TEXAS RIVER ON FIRE AS FLOODING SNAPS PIPELINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roiling floodwaters apparently ruptured a 40-inch pipeline Thursday, sending 
pools of burning gasoline down the rain-swollen San Jacinto River and setting 
fire to homes and boats on the banks. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 59 people were treated for minor burns and smoke inhalation. Much of 
the area had already been evacuated because of days of flooding that have 
claimed at least 15 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like hell opened up on the water and the whole river was gasoline," 
said Mike Norman, who was on the bank trying to retrieve his sailboat when the 
explosion occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 About 11,500 people had been forced from their homes by heavy rain that began 
Sunday. Skies were clearing, the murky water had begun to recede in most areas 
and some people were returning to their damaged homes when the pipeline broke 
east of Houston, sending smoke and flame hundreds of feet into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Several houses, mobile homes and boats on the banks were set ablaze. Schools 
and businesses in the path of the smoke were ordered evacuated. The number of 
people affected was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we believe the force of the floodwaters caused the pipeline to 
break," said Ed Schaefer, spokesman for the state Department of Public Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion occurred near "The Spaghetti Bowl," the mouth of the nation's 
interstate pipeline network. The broken line, owned by Colonial Pipeline, 
carries gasoline from nearby Pasadena to New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard was investigating a possible rupture of a second line nearby. 
The substance believed leaking from that pipe was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency crews had trouble putting out the fire because their boats could not 
handle the swirling river currents and fire trucks were blocked by flooded 
roads, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Eric Nicholas. 
</P>
<P>
 Valves on either side of the 2-mile section of pipeline were shut off, but 
gasoline is likely to continue spilling into the river, said George Tenley, 
associate administrator of pipeline safety for the U.S. Transportation 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400,000 gallons of gasoline spilled before the shut-off, Tenley 
said, and the 2-mile section can hold hundreds of thousands of gallons.

 Anna Hauptmann, the widow of the man executed for the kidnaping and murder of 
aviator Charles Lindbergh's infant son, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 Her death Oct. 10 in New Holland, Pa., was reported this week by the Lancaster 
New Era newspaper, a nearby neighborhood publication. 
</P>
<P>
 She insisted for more than 60 years that Bruno Richard Hauptmann was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 She had spent much of her life trying in vain to clear her husband of what was 
called the Crime of the Century: the 1932 killing of the 20-month-old namesake 
of Lindbergh. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauptmann, a German immigrant carpenter, was accused of kidnaping the 
Lindbergh boy from his nursery in Hopewell, N.J. He denied it, and his wife 
insisted that he was with her the night the child was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauptmann was convicted in 1935 and executed in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
 "God knows that my husband was innocent," she said in 1986 in one of her final 
interviews.

VIRGINIA DALE; ASTAIRE PARTNER IN 'HOLIDAY INN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Virginia Dale, probably best remembered as Fred Astaire's dancing partner in 
the classic Hollywood musical "Holiday Inn," has died of the complications of 
emphysema. 
</P>
<P>
 She was 77 and died Oct. 3 in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Virginia Paxton, the actress and dancer was discovered while performing 
as one of the dancing Paxton Sisters on the New York stage by Darryl F. Zanuck. 
</P>
<P>
 Zanuck signed her to a 20th Century Fox contract and she began making films in 
1938. She moved to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and appeared in a small role in "Idiot's 
Delight" (1939) starring Clark Gable. 
</P>
<P>
 She also was seen in "Start Cheering," "Buck Benny Rides Again," "Kiss the 
Boys Goodbye" and "All Women Have Secrets." 
</P>
<P>
 But her role opposite Astaire and Bing Crosby, the two entertainers who 
performed at the nightclub-hotel "Holiday Inn" (1942), proved her most 
prominent movie part. 
</P>
<P>
 She also worked in television in the 1950s on such series as "Playhouse 90," 
"Mystery Theater," "Wyatt Earp" and others.

MTA SHAKE-UP PROPOSAL IS OF LIMITED SCOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN and RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed reorganization of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's 
management of Los Angeles subway construction calls for a handful of limited 
changes, but avoids more sweeping measures that had been under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepared by MTA Chief Executive Officer Franklin E. White and aides, the 
proposal drew immediate criticism from two state legislators with jurisdiction 
over transportation spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan drafted by the local transit officials proposes a series of 
management and engineering changes designed to prevent a repeat of the kinds of 
problems that have plagued the project. 
</P>
<P>
 White's proposal calls for shifting, over a seven-month period, a handful of 
inspection-management consultants under the direct employment of the MTA. It 
was sent confidentially this week to the Federal Transit Administration, which 
on Oct. 5 cut off $1.6 billion of future subway funding because of 
dissatisfaction with the MTA's management of construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FTA did the right thing in cutting off the funding," said Assembly 
Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz. "They ought to be demanding a 
whole lot more (than what White's plan proposes). The FTA came out with a big 
2-by-4. It would be a shame for it to turn into a toothpick." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz noted that the proposal makes no mention of whether White still intends 
to dissolve the Rail Construction Corp., an MTA subsidiary that has overseen 
subway safety, construction quality and costs since mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, the MTA board has twice 
postponed votes on White's earlier request to disband the subsidiary, which has 
drawn criticism from some officials for being too lenient with contractors. The 
matter could surface at Wednesday's MTA meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal also indicates that White will not seek to terminate the contract 
of either Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, the builder of the troubled subway tunnels in 
Hollywood, or MTA-hired consulting firms that supervised the work. 
</P>
<P>
 White, in addition to seeking a lifting of the freeze on future federal 
funding, asked Federal Transit Administrator Gordon J. Linton for approval to 
resume tunneling along Hollywood Boulevard. White did not specify a date, but 
has said that he would like to resume digging by month's end. Excavation in 
Hollywood has been halted since Aug. 18, when surface sinkages of nine inches 
were confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We remain optimistic that all outstanding issues can be resolved by the end 
of the month," White said in a memo received Thursday by MTA board members 
regarding the proposal, which he called a working draft. "Our goal is to resume 
tunneling as soon as possible, but only when we have concurrence from the 
(Federal Transit Administration)." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Federal Transit Administration would not speculate 
Thursday as to when the agency would permit tunneling to resume in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman, Pete Halpin, said federal officials have raised "some questions 
that aren't addressed by the report." He said he could not comment more 
specifically. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the view of our technical folks, they're looking for some more 
information," Halpin said from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, local transit officials met Thursday with staff of the Federal 
Transit Administration to review the plan for resuming tunneling. And, included 
in the package sent by White to Washington, were new construction procedures 
recommended by the inspection-management firm, Parsons-Dillingham. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the engineers recommended that metal struts be used for tunnel 
bracing -- not wooden wedges. Substitution of the wedges was approved in 1992 
by Parsons-Dillingham and by the project's chief design engineer, employed by 
the firm of Parsons Brinckerhoff. The wedges were crushed under Hollywood 
Boulevard and project engineers have concluded that the failure contributed to 
the surface sinkages. 
</P>
<P>
 Three types of soil-stabilizing grouting procedures also were recommended. The 
grouting procedures were not performed in the worst-affected area of tunneling. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of the reorganization proposal and related analyses provided by 
consultants of the MTA and the Federal Transit Administration were obtained by 
The Times. Among the developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * The federal government's consultant for subway work in Los Angeles said in 
an Oct. 13 report that the MTA "relented to the contractor's demands" by 
reinstating Shea-Kiewit-Kenny's tunneling superintendent, who had been expelled 
for safety-related reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The reinstatement of the superintendent, by the MTA's then-president of rail 
construction, Edward McSpedon, was reported on Oct. 8 by The Times. White 
ousted McSpedon three days later, while praising his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government's consultant, Hill International Inc., questioned the 
reinstatement of the superintendent, Norm Hutchins, and criticized the MTA's 
commitment to enforcing safety standards. "The (MTA) needs to be more forceful 
with regard to making (Shea-Kiewit-Kenny) reinforce its commitment to safety," 
said Hill International. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although Hutchins' status is not addressed in White's reorganization 
proposal, the document does say that Shea-Kiewit-Kenny has agreed to appoint a 
new project manager for the work. Representatives of the company could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * According to the reorganization proposal, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny "has agreed to 
submit a plan for resolving all" of its deficient installation of wooden wedges 
used for bracing 12 miles of twin tunnels along both Hollywood Boulevard and 
Vermont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz, asked to comment on the reorganization proposal, said he was 
disappointed by what he termed its small scope. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ignores a number of the significant issues out there," said Katz, whose 
legislation created the MTA in 1993 by merging the former Southern California 
Rapid Transit District with the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission. 
"There's not much change, really, in how this thing is structured." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz, who is seeking to block further state funding of the subway project 
until the MTA makes more sweeping changes, said that White has agreed to appear 
next Monday at a Transportation Committee hearing that will explore the 
construction management problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Another legislator who has expressed concern about the MTA's operations, Sen. 
Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), termed White's reorganization proposal 
"inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
 "The restructuring appears to be a reshuffling," said Hayden, who is 
organizing a Senate Transportation Committee hearing on Nov. 2 regarding the 
funding and construction of the subway and other MTA policy issues.

 Well, we're happy to report that crime hasn't become that bad. An LAPD

 * It was a pleasure to read the interview with Julius Shulman in the Opinion 
section of Oct. 9. The interview and the recognition of Shulman's great 
contribution in architectural photography are long overdue.He is one of 
California's living treasures. 
</P>
<P>
 I had the privilege of meeting Shulman and visiting his studio when he donated 
a photograph of the historic Bradbury Building in Los Angeles last year for the 
American Institute of Architects/Los Angeles Chapter's silent auction, which 
benefited the organization's scholarship program. 
</P>
<P>
 His style in photography creates nostalgia, even with modern buildings that he 
photographed. His works are among the connective tissues between the architects 
and the public. I am very glad to read that he "un-retired" himself and 
realized that his mission is not yet finished. 
</P>
<P>
 I look forward to more Shulman photographs. And, thank you, Steve Proffitt.

SMOKING MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am compelled to compliment The Times and Dan Morain on his Oct. 10 article, 
"Tobacco Giant Quietly Pushes Prop. 188." 
</P>
<P>
 Morain highlighted the truth behind this devastating and confusing initiative. 
Philip Morris USA and other tobacco companies are spending more than $7 million 
to support Proposition 188, under the guise of "Californians for Statewide 
Smoking Restrictions." 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is that 188 would preempt or replace local smoking ordinances, 
replacing them with a more lenient statewide ban that would allow regulated 
smoking in most places. Proposition 188 is not "a reasonable compromise between 
smokers and nonsmokers" nor is it "a fair, balanced, reasonable solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's be realistic: Would the tobacco industry really spend upwards of $8 
million to "protect" our health? In California alone, 14 people die every day 
from secondhand smoke, while hundreds of others suffer its effects in the form 
of lung cancer, heart disease and respiratory infections. 
</P>
<P>
 If voters take the time to read between the lines, it is clear that 
Proposition 188 would be the greatest setback to California's progressive 
anti-smoking effort. Your story is a good first step to clearing the air. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRI JONISCH 
</P>

 If the people of California are stupid enough to pass the tobacco 
company-sponsored Proposition 188, then they deserve the consequences of their 
stupidity.

 When the voters approved a 25-cent tax on cigarettes in 1988 to be used for 
anti-smoking education, I doubt if anyone imagined that the Department of 
Health Services would use this money for high-priced TV commercials. In your 
Oct. 14 article, S. Kimberly Belshe, director of the department, states that 
these ads do not defame Reynolds Tobacco Chairman James W. Johnston. She must 
not watch these commercials -- a revolting waste of taxpayer money. 
</P>
<P>
 If she can't find better use for the funds, turn them back to the general 
fund.

PRESIDENT CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As a naturalized citizen of this great country, I am baffled by the citizens 
here who take so much for granted and seem to pay little or no attention to the 
details of any news story unless it involves scandal or celebrities. The shabby 
treatment of President Clinton by the media and his "low job-approval" rating 
by the masses are very sad and symptomatic of a seemingly childish and 
shallow-minded population. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a very good man trying to bring several issues to the table concerning 
crime, health care and economic recovery, and because there is a struggle in 
his efforts to make changes that are good for the people, those same people 
seem to look at the surface, feel that the whole thing is messy, and dismiss 
this President as someone who is not doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 In previous years, people were cranky because the economy was sour and there 
was a general sense that President Bush did not care about domestic issues. Now 
it seems clear why he stayed away from domestic issues. This country doesn't 
deserve a good man like Clinton. It will be very interesting to see who or what 
pleases them in the future.

WILSON, BROWN DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Wilson, Brown Meet at Last in Bitter Debate" and "A Look Behind the 
Debate," Oct. 15: 
</P>
<P>
 As a reader, I very much appreciated your coverage of the Wilson-Brown 
gubernatorial debate. As a voter, however, I very much regretted your not 
having printed the full text of their exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's easy dismissal of Kathleen Brown's economic proposals 
struck me as extremely self-serving. First, Wilson had a chance to show that he 
could prudently manage the state's economy, a chance that he has effectively 
squandered over the length of his four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, after promising not to raise taxes and then doing so, his charge that 
Brown is trying to slip us a hidden tax plan is just plain hypocritical. Third, 
some of Brown's ideas really are worth considering, especially her proposals to 
streamline, consolidate and review state regulations, programs and agencies.

 * Brown's performance during the debate highlights her biggest problem -- she 
has no command of the issues. She has been a candidate stuck on slogans and 
generalities, while Wilson has proven that he understands the voters, the 
issues and how to achieve his goals. 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed to be specific, Brown failed time and time again to convince me 
that she is capable of handling the complexities and pressures inherent in 
being governor. Her only demonstrable skill was being able to blame all of 
California's problems on Wilson, a strategy that has failed her miserably.

 * Brown shot herself in the foot when she revealed during the debate that her 
daughter had been date-raped. No charges were filed. Is this tough on crime? 
She allowed a man to go free after an assault on her own daughter! What if this 
were your child? 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if the decision not to press charges was for reasons of 
personal privacy, Brown is guilty of denying her daughter the right to her 
privacy. Either way, Brown is soft on crime and willing to betray her own 
daughter.

 * It is interesting to note that in this state's gubernatorial race, the only 
issues Wilson is stressing are immigration and the death penalty, issues over 
which he as governor has no legal control or responsibility. And the only 
issues he is not stressing are the state's lousy economy and its exodus of 
businesses to other states. These are issues over which he does have 
responsibility and control. It would appear that he has his priorities 
backward! 
</P>
<P>
 However, if he does not get reelected, all is not lost. He can always run for 
county sheriff or for lord high executioner.

 * It was a relief to read your Column One, "Perils of Parole Reform" (Sept. 
17), which was, for a change, on balance, and gave Wilson a break, just as he 
has, on occasion, seen fit to give convicts a break. 
</P>
<P>
 But your Column One on Oct. 8 ("Moving Voters, Not Mountains") was back in the 
old rut, which appears to be a prejudice and bias against the guy. Especially 
when you say that trying to perform well at the job of being governor is 
playing politics. 
</P>
<P>
 It is true that Wilson does present an unattractive appearance -- small in 
stature, rarely a smile. A choice photo of him would certainly bear out the 
image you wish to portray -- a mealy-mouthed, two-faced political hack. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Clinton Democrat, I have a real feeling for the little guy, the underdog, 
and appreciate sticking to facts and giving a guy a fair shake. 
</P>
<P>
 And as for the accomplishments of his office, which you reluctantly finally 
conceded in your article, I would like to mention that you omit first, foremost 
and most notable of same. I refer to his repeatedly taking an unpopular stance 
and vetoing bills submitted by the Legislature. Invariably, these bills 
reflected bad government, unprudent judgment, a departure from common sense and 
were unnecessary.

<P>
 * It seems that every time I'm watching television a tasteless ad appears 
exclaiming that Brown is against the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 As tasteless as it is, it could be improved upon by adding that even though 
her personal opinion is that it is barbaric and unfairly administered, she vows 
to uphold the law. Brown's personal opinion concerning the death penalty does 
not detract in any way from her ability to handle the job of governor.  
</P>
<P>
 More and more candidates for every elected position are using the death 
penalty in their campaign to garner votes. My judgment is that they should be 
required to give better evidence of their qualifications for the position. 
Neither I, nor many of my friends, will ever vote for a candidate who 
degenerates to this divisive ploy.

A HEROIC STRUGGLE TO DEFUSE TENSIONS; THE UNSUNG WORK OF AREA SCHOOLS IS SO 
NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Education Goals Panel, established five years ago to assess the 
quality of education in America, now reports that incidents of violence at or 
near schools are on the decline. However, what we usually hear about -- often 
in great detail -- are every disruption of peace at schools and every situation 
in which strife might occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples: We've been told that 400 Orange County students have been expelled 
over the last three years for taking weapons to school. In Los Angeles County 
there have been 11 instances since early 1993 in which students have been 
wounded or killed or in which shots have been fired near or inside schools. On 
Wednesday a boy was shot to death near Dorsey High School in Los Angeles' 
Crenshaw area. On Tuesday in Van Nuys two Grant High School students were 
stabbed and a third teen-ager was shot near the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 AURA OF FEAR: Problems perhaps could have been predicted at Grant High, where 
racial tensions between Armenian and Latino students have been escalating for 
some time. Indeed, the sole L.A. Unified School District police officer at the 
school requested assistance on Tuesday because he had heard that a fight might 
erupt. His fears soon were realized in the form of after-school skirmishes 
involving several dozen students. Later, a student told television news 
reporters that problems there surely would continue because there were "too 
many differences between the races." 
</P>
<P>
 More police officers and counselors have been dispatched to Grant High. But 
what else can be done, now and in the future, to avoid such problems? Some are 
seeking remedies through legislation. Orange County Assemblywoman Doris Allen 
(R-Cypress), for example, brought a number of bills to Sacramento including one 
directing schools to punish students who commit racist hate crimes and another 
establishing "gun-free zones" around campuses. But some of the best solutions 
appear to be those that involve students by enlisting their support and 
establishing a dialogue among them. 
</P>
<P>
 EUROPEAN WARNING: Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) and North Hollywood 
High School officials have worked together to bring a group of Serbians, 
Croatians and Muslims from war-torn Bosnia to the campus to discuss what 
happens when racial and religious differences reach their illogical and 
genocidal extremes. "It's just normal to be dead in Sarajevo," one of the 
visitors told the students. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda High School's WARN program (which stands for Weapons Are Removed Now) 
has succeeded in breaking the code of silence among students and enlisting them 
in reporting peers who take guns onto the campus. And at Inglewood and 
Morningside high schools in Inglewood, students are using a U.S. Department of 
Justice conflict resolution program to try to find solutions to conflicts and 
racial tensions before they grow into violence. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these are valuable efforts. They are every bit as worthy of our 
attention as accounts of the shedding of blood.

POLICE WATCH; GOING TOO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When police officers impersonate criminals, large questions arise. Are the 
police wrongly entrapping someone, luring an otherwise law-abiding person into 
committing a crime? Are they strictly accounting for all the money or drugs 
they use as bait? Are supervisors monitoring the operations to ensure they will 
stand up in court and result in convictions? 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Police Department unfortunately has introduced an additional 
issue into the so-called "reverse stings," in which officers pose as criminals. 
The department has been taking powder cocaine seized in arrests to the Orange 
County Crime Laboratory, run by the Sheriff's Department. There it is cooked 
into "rocks" before being given back to the police. Undercover officers then 
sell $10 or $20 worth to drug users and arrest them. 
</P>
<P>
 Other police departments in the area, including San Diego and Los Angeles, 
rightly avoid manufacturing drugs, an action that ultimately puts an illegal 
substance into the hands of someone who otherwise might not have it. There are 
dangers of a drug overdose abetted by law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida Supreme Court correctly said it was "incredible" to think that 
police manufacture of a dangerous substance like cocaine could benefit public 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Orange County police agencies reported good results in snaring drug 
buyers with phony cocaine -- ranging from macadamia nuts to crushed drywall. 
Rather than offering the real thing on the streets, Santa Ana police would be 
better off adopting a similar tactic in the worthwhile fight against drugs.

BRAVE VOICES AT A CRUCIAL POINT; REPUBLICANS KEMP AND BENNETT STAND AGAINST THE 
NATIVIST PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Too often when the public hopes for light in the campaign season it gets only 
hot air. William Bennett and Jack Kemp, two leading Republicans and former 
Cabinet secretaries, provided a refreshing alternative when they stood up 
against Proposition 187, the state ballot initiative aimed at cutting off 
public services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 In a joint statement, these co-directors of the Washington-based think tank 
Empower America essentially called the ballot measure what it is -- an 
unconstitutional and nativist reaction to a complex problem, a misconceived 
measure that carries the potential to spread poison elsewhere and undermine the 
very spirit of democracy in this country.  
</P>
<P>
 Both did their party a great service, by the way, in warning against 
alienating hard-working and entrepreneurial immigrants, a message that ought to 
be taken to heart by one very prominent California Republican, Gov. Pete 
Wilson, a strong supporter of Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp, a former housing and urban development secretary who is widely regarded 
as a top-tier contender for the 1996 GOP presidential nomination, might have 
ducked the matter this week when he visited the Nixon Library & Birthplace in 
conservative Orange County. He did not; instead he engaged the issue directly, 
answering critics by appealing to an increasingly rare commodity in politics, 
conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, a former education secretary and author of the best-selling "The Book 
of Virtues," had thought the issue through enough to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 In politics, there is a time to be silent, and a time to speak out. These two 
leading conservatives picked their spot well, and gave California voters lured 
by the quick fix something of great value to think about.

DON'T LET HAMAS WIN; ARAFAT INVITES HIS OWN POLITICAL DESTRUCTION IF HE DOESN'T 
STOP EQUIVOCATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Middle East peace process will survive the terrorist atrocity carried out 
in Tel Aviv by Palestinian Muslim fundamentalists. It will survive because the 
leaders of Israel and Yasser Arafat, who heads the Palestinian Authority in the 
Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho, know that to let the process fail 
is to concede victory to the Hamas extremists, who dream only of Israel's 
replacement with a rigidly theocratic Palestine on the Iranian model. So 
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators will continue to talk. But the extremist 
horrors will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's Cabinet has approved various measures, some unannounced, in response 
to Wednesday's bus bombing that killed more than 20 in downtown Tel Aviv. 
Palestinians who commute to Israel for work will, once again, be denied entry 
and so their livelihood. The police will be bolstered. Beyond that it's a 
near-certainty that Israeli security forces have been ordered to move more 
aggressively to capture or kill members of Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 How effective will all this be? Two years ago Israel exiled to Lebanon 400 men 
it identified as top Hamas members. That action, however, neither weakened nor 
demoralized the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Tougher measures against Hamas may help ease Israeli pain over the Tel Aviv 
outrage. But will Hamas really be harmed? For the most part Hamas is now simply 
beyond Israel's reach. What Israel couldn't do when it still had military 
control over Hamas' breeding ground in Gaza it can hardly hope to achieve now. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Arafat and his regime are capable of neutralizing Hamas and shielding the 
peace process from its most committed enemies. Arafat's timidity so far has 
only emboldened the zealots, allowing them both to expand their terrorism and 
increase their appeal to young hotheads. The plain fact now is that Arafat 
invites his own political destruction if he doesn't stop equivocating. 
</P>
<P>
 He has run out of options: Hamas must be disarmed and broken up by the 
Palestinian Authority. Hamas can't bring Israel down. But in time it assuredly 
can destroy the hopes of Palestinians for self-rule, dooming a people that has 
never known real independence to a continued political limbo.

 * As you know, we were finally able to enact the California Desert Protection 
Act in the final hours of 103rd Congress (Oct. 9).

 Our success after a long and difficult road was due in no small part to the 
consistent editorial support voiced by The Times. We made sure your editorials 
were given wide circulation here on Capitol Hill and they helped convince a 
majority of members to approve this far-reaching legislation. Your editorial of 
Oct. 7 was particularly helpful.

PERSPECTIVES ON THE PRESS AND THE COURTS; SEQUESTER US ALL, NOT JUST THE JURY; 
FINDING THE TRUTH HAS BECOME SECONDARY TO FINDING THE PHOTOGENIC. AND THE REAL 
ISSUES AREN'T EVEN ON THE TABLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT C. FELLMETH, Robert C. Fellmeth, a former prosecutor, is a professor 
at the University of San Diego School of Law and director of the statewide 
Children's Advocacy Institute. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's how it's supposed to work: 
</P>
<P>
 The police arrest a suspect on probable cause; the case goes to a prosecutor 
if there is sufficient evidence. The defense gets discovery of the 
prosecution's case. Prosecutors do not simply seek a conviction, but -- as 
public officials -- are primarily concerned with establishing the truth. 
Defense attorneys represent their clients' interests, but within limits; they 
also are officers of the court. There is a trial. Potential jurors are 
questioned to select an unbiased group. Its primary purpose is to look at the 
demeanor of the witnesses, apply common wisdom and determine what actually 
happened. The jury does this by listening to testimony under oath, including 
cross-examination. A judge furthers the process by screening out inherently 
unreliable and prejudicial evidence and tells jurors how to apply the law to 
what they believe happened and how strongly they must believe it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a perfect model, perhaps. But as Churchill said about democracy, it may be 
damned well better than any of the alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it's working in the Simpson case: 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant is arrested with plenty of probable cause and the case properly 
goes to prosecutors. But officials start leaking prosecution evidence 
selectively to the media. The defense then responds with more of the same, and 
soon all of the counsel are posturing shamelessly. Meanwhile, the case is 
everywhere. It is news day and night.  
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson case appeals in one stroke to all four of the media's howling 
biases: It deals with a celebrity, it involves drama and violence, it caters to 
our cultural morality-play of good versus evil in caricature and it involves an 
unexpected twist -- someone whom we all love may have done something 
unspeakably evil.  
</P>
<P>
 The jury selection begins. Counsel are carefully plotting: How does it play to 
mock juries? What hairdo should I have? Am I coming across as too unfeminine? 
Is the defense team in disarray? Who is plotting the strategy? Should my 
prowess in boxing be featured to contrast with my boyish gentility? What a 
devastating package I am! 
</P>
<P>
 The questioning of prospective jurors has begun. They are not open-ended 
questions to elicit bias but, as is now the custom, they are meant to create 
bias. Both sides vie for maximum bias -- not the same thing as eliminating it.  
</P>
<P>
 Those who argue against sequestration of the jury really have only one 
argument: The well has already been poisoned by a combination of 
hot-button-pushing and media frenzy. And in its defense, the media invoke the 
heavy artillery, the First Amendment: Even a delay in the sacrosanct right of 
continuous speculation and rumor-mongering transgresses it. The media have 
corrupted a reasonable process for getting at the truth by wrapping themselves 
in the flag. The price being paid is that "what happened" is not being 
determined by 12 persons searching for the truth from a crucible of reliable 
evidence under oath; it is being determined based on third-hand hearsay, people 
negotiating book contracts with film careers dancing in their heads, informal 
polls of the recipients of this garbage and, it appears, Nielsen ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the well has been poisoned. And it's worse than that. Digressing a bit 
from this media circus, there are real issues out here that aren't being 
covered. Children's programs have been sliced from the state's budget. 
One-third of our high school students are not finishing in four years or are 
dropping out entirely. The state Forestry Board conceded that it has unlawfully 
allowed virtually all of the state's original forests to be destroyed. We had 
19,000 prisoners incarcerated in 1977; now we have 126,000, costing about 
$31,000 a year. One-quarter of California's children are living below the 
poverty line and more than 2 million have no medical coverage. Our political 
campaigns are a disgrace to truth-telling and civilized discourse. Oh, a few of 
these matters get scant passing attention; but they pale in importance to what 
O.J. had for breakfast or the hourly big news break. (On a recent night, it was 
"O.J. masks for Halloween: In bad taste or not? News at 11.") 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the jury should be sequestered for the trial, because as bad as the 
well is poisoned, it can be poisoned even more, and we need someone in a 
position to look at evidence under oath and to make a decision from it. The 
rest of us hooked into our cable systems are certainly not going to be doing 
it. It would be nice to separate entertainment from truth-seeking.  
</P>
<P>
 But I have a better idea than sequestering the jury. How about sequestering 
all of us? How about giving us a hiatus until after the trial? Come on guys, 
it's moved past embarrassing -- you're well into self-satire.

COLUMN LEFT/ ANTONIO H. RODRIGUEZ / CARLOS A. CHAVEZ: LATINOS UNITE IN 
SELF-DEFENSE ON PROP. 187; THE THOUSANDS WHO MASSED AT CITY HALL SEE DANGER FOR 
CITIZENS, TOO, IF THE INITIATIVE PASSES. 
</P>

<BYLINE>

administrator at a Los Angeles liberal-arts college. Antonio H. Rodriguez is a 
civil-rights lawyer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last Sunday, the people whom Gov. Pete Wilson has been vilifying to get 
reelected showed how personal they take his relentless attack. By the tens of 
thousands (CNN estimated 150,000; the police, 70,000) Latinos and supporters 
from other ethnic groups marched along Avenida Cesar E. Chavez to a mass rally 
at Nuestra Senora la Reina de Los Angeles' City Hall. It was the largest 
social-justice march in L.A. history, but were we heard? 
</P>
<P>
 In their typically myopic view, Wilson and the pro-187 cabal dismissed the 
massive demonstration as having no impact on the November elections. We were, 
they said, a vocal minority, "nationalists" and "separatists," as shown by the 
marchers' Latin American flags. 
</P>
<P>
 Can't these politicians understand the affirmations of cultural pride that 
their racist attacks have produced? Their denying the significance and the 
implications of the movement that spawned the march is a gross underestimation 
of how personal the political issue of Proposition 187 has become in the Latino 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's blind pursuit of reelection based on the fantasy of fighting for 
Californians by attacking Latino Californians is irreparably damaging the 
future of race relations in this country. Latinos on both sides of the border 
view the immigrant-bashing of 187 and the Wilson campaign as state-endorsed 
racism.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Latino community, there is widespread understanding that, while the 
immigrant-bashing nominally targets the undocumented, it is in fact, given the 
reality of this segregated city, a direct attack on everyone of Latino 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 The anger against Wilson runs deep. It cuts across all sectors. If Wilson has 
accomplished anything, it is in giving racism a face -- his own.  
</P>
<P>
 The response in the Latino community has been increasing solidarity. Sunday's 
march was a manifestation of that. While it was but a single event, it 
demonstrated the surging unity for self-defense and survival that Wilson and 
Proposition 187 have unwittingly promoted. Indeed, there is growing mystique in 
the barrios that we are all Latinos, we are all Mexicans, we are all 
undocumented and we have to stick together to resist the onslaught. It is a 
community version of the labor movement axiom, "An injury to one is an injury 
to all." Significantly, this sentiment is cutting across social and economic 
lines. Sunday's marchers were not only undocumented immigrants; they also were 
citizens and permanent residents. There were not only minimum-wage workers, but 
also skilled workers, trade-unionists, professionals, entrepreneurs, employees 
and employers, men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 This unity and solidarity cuts across generational lines as well. Young people 
were the overwhelming majority at the march. Young Latinos have been very 
active in voicing their opposition to Wilson and Proposition 187. In recent 
weeks, Latino students have demonstrated with walkouts and conducted teach-ins 
at several Southland high schools. And they have organized precinct walks to 
register voters. This has important implications for the electoral future of 
California. These young Californians are the voters of the next 40 years or so, 
and they will certainly remember witnessing the use of racism as a force in 
California's electoral politics. Sadly, their vote in the future may reflect 
this lesson being taught so well by Wilson and his ilk. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge of the pro-187 forces that Sunday's march was an expression of 
Mexican nationalism is a classic example of ignorance. For Latinos, persecuted 
and rejected, many unable to express themselves through the ballot box, what 
could be better than to seize the protection of the U.S. Constitution in order 
to speak out against passage of this punishing initiative? 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps most important to history, the marchers on Sunday became in that 
one single event the active conscience of California voters. While white voters 
may be unable to put a human face on the potential victims of Proposition 187, 
our community can. The demonstration may at least alter the trend reported by 
the latest polls that show heavy support for 187 among Latino voters. The 
marchers reminded us all that this racist campaign is personal: It is an attack 
against our relatives, our children, our neighbors, classmates and co-workers 
who are the potential victims of 187's inhumane denial of medical services and 
education. And when the official witch hunts start, none of us will be spared 
the hate crimes that this racism will spawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, we must rely on those who will cast the ballots on Nov. 8: Will 
the electorate respond with a human face?

COLUMN RIGHT/ ARTHUR LAFFER / JOEL FOX: CALIFORNIA IS RIPE FOR REVOLT AGAIN; 
RAISING TAXES HAS NOT BROUGHT IN MORE REVENUES, AND THE GUBERNATORIAL 
CANDIDATES WOULD BE WISE TO LEARN THAT LESSON.

 As the California governor's race heads to the finish line, Kathleen Brown's 
campaign staff is dazed by her drop in the polls. They have taken hope in the 
story of New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman who just a year ago snatched 
victory from the incumbent, Jim Florio. Whitman had been trailing in the polls 
only a week before the election. The reason Brown's staff believes that the 
Whitman/Florio example is appropriate is because Florio can be compared with 
Gov. Pete Wilson, both of them unpopular because they dramatically raised 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown may like the way the Whitman story ended, but she hasn't followed the 
Republican's model. Whitman's issue that turned the electorate around and led 
to her victory was a proposed across-the-board income tax cut. Brown has not, 
as of this date, called for a tax cut to invigorate California's depressed 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Florio, Wilson has admitted the tax increases were an error. In fact, 
he has quite accurately called those tax increases the biggest mistake of his 
first term. He still has plenty of time to punctuate that mea culpa by 
following Whitman's example and declaring for a tax cut early in his second 
term. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate who first calls for a serious across-the-board tax cut would 
very likely repeat Whitman's electoral success. And the real beneficiaries 
would be all of us in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, California is ready for another tax revolt. From 1980 to 1989, 
following California's fabled Proposition 13 tax revolt, state and local 
revenues increased 55% in real terms, well above the national average of 40%. 
State and local budgets were solvent. California's unemployment rate fell below 
the national rate for most of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, California began the second stage of the great tax experiment, only 
this time California was increasing taxes. Starting with the gasoline tax 
increase of 1990, and then followed by income, sales and other tax increases of 
1991, the Golden State's taxes were increased with no less gusto than they had 
been cut 12 years earlier. This was the largest one-year state tax increase in 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 As a consequence, California has lost its competitiveness with other states 
and the state's economy is in disrepair; personal income has fallen relative to 
the rest of the nation and employment is still below its June, 1990, peak. 
Based on the trend of job gains in the 1980s, California is currently 2 million 
jobs below expectations. But even more surprising for some, the state budget 
has been in a perpetual state of crisis since all the tax increases took place. 
</P>
<P>
 The next governor of California should take an eye-opening look at what 
happened to tax revenue after the tax cuts of 1978 and the corresponding tax 
increases of 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
 California's general-fund revenues were about $15 billion in 1978. Within a 
decade, they had soared to about $37 billion. However, following the tax 
increases of 1990 and 1991, California's general-fund revenues dropped for the 
first time in 50 years. Despite a record tax increase projected at more than $7 
billion, the general fund ended with less money than it had the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax increases were not the only reason for California's misfortune, but 
they played a major role. What is surprising is that the increases were 
misunderstood by the lawmakers and bureaucrats who supported them. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the logic expressed by California's budget writers in the May, 1992, 
budget revision: "Showing the worst growth in decades, personal income tax 
revenues for the 1991 tax year appear to be nearly 2% below the year earlier, 
despite the tax increases enacted last year. If not for these law changes, 
revenues would have declined nearly 7%." The budget personnel got the wrong 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget forecasters ignored the feedback effect that income-tax rates have 
on income and then on revenue collections. They believed that the tax increases 
prevented an even greater revenue drop; they never considered that the tax 
increases could be a cause of the fall in revenues. According to their logic, 
at 100% tax rates the state would collect a lot more revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 For Califorinia, it is time to reverse the trend of this sloppy thinking and 
snap the locks that keep our economy tied down. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown or Pete Wilson could lead the state back to economic health by 
proposing and following through with serious across-the-board tax cuts.

CLIPPER REPORT; TEAM SIGNS TOP DRAFT PICK LAMOND MURRAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California forward Lamond Murray, the Clippers' top draft pick, ended a 
two-week holdout Thursday night, signing a multiyear deal with the club, a 
source close to Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray had been seeking a contract that paid him $2.4 million in his first 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers are expected to announce the deal today. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's agent, Fred Slaughter, was not available for comment and efforts to 
reach Clipper officials were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't known whether Murray will join the club in time to play in tonight's 
exhibition game against the Sacramento Kings at UC Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 A 6-foot-7 small forward, Murray was the seventh player selected in the draft. 
He is expected to replace All-Star forward Dominique Wilkins, who signed with 
the Boston Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who averaged 24.3 points per game last season to lead the Pacific 10 
in scoring, needed only three seasons to break Kevin Johnson's school scoring 
record with 1,688 points, a 19.1 average. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, the Clippers' sixth lottery pick in the last 10 years, might make an 
immediate impact on the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the fact that he can do several things," Clipper General Manager Elgin 
Baylor said after the Clippers selected Murray. "He can really shoot the 
basketball, and that's something we have lacked -- a terrific perimeter shooter 
from the (small forward) position. He can run the floor very well and finish 
the play on the fast break and he's a good post-up player." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper assistant Barry Hecker, who scouted Murray, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started scouting I asked, 'What makes a player?' and they said, 
'The guy who pops out at you,"' Hecker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lamond Murray was the guy who popped out at me. He's got all kinds of talent. 
He could be an All-Star if he works at it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers have reached a settlement with Coach Bob Weiss, who was fired 
last May with two years left on a three-year contract. Weiss, who was due to 
receive $1.2 million, stopped receiving paychecks last July. Terms were not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers made their first cuts, waiving guards Keith Smart and Alphonso 
Ford, center Robert Werdann and forward Isaiah Morris. That left them with 17 
players. . . . Center Stanley Roberts, who reported to camp overweight and out 
of shape, went through a complete practice for the first time and said he felt 
good.

HOCH TAKES CHARGE WITH 14-UNDER 129

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Hoch rode six consecutive birdies into a two-shot lead over three 
golfers Thursday after two rounds of the 90-hole Las Vegas Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch took the lead of the $1.5-million tournament with an eight-under-par 63 
at the Las Vegas Hilton course. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoch, who won this five-day, three-course tournament in 1989, completed 36 
holes in 129 and will take a 14-under total into his last three rounds at the 
TPC at Summerlin. 
</P>
<P>
 The format calls for the 144 pros to play one round on each of three courses 
before the field is cut for the final two rounds at the TPC at Summerlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudley Hart shot a 66 and was tied for second at 131 with Dan Forsman and Jim 
Furyk. Forsman and Furyk each shot 64. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Norman, who is playing in this event in order to have enough rounds to 
qualify for the Vardon Trophy, shot 69 for 136 and continues to lead the season 
race for the low scoring average.

 The Oakland Athletics will not exercise their $4-million option on reliever 
Dennis Eckersley, 40, making him eligible for free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The A's apparently would like him back at a lower salary. 
</P>

 "We would love to have Dennis back in 1995, and we will sit down soon with 
Dennis and his agent to discuss that possibility," General Manager Sandy 
Alderson said.

 Ten prominent player agents met for more than five hours with officials of the 
baseball players' union in New York and rejected the idea of refusing to let 
players sign contracts if the owners unilaterally implement a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no prohibition on players signing if they like the deal," an 
agent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Management, however, has reserved the right to implement a 45-day freeze on 
signings, which the union would challenge via grievance.

 Special mediator William J. Usery talked with union and management

 The scores appeared sensational: Sam Torrance and Gordon Brand Jr. shot 54s; 
Jamie Spence and Malcolm MacKenzie had opening-round 57s. 
</P>
<P>
 But competitors at the $750,000 Czech Open weren't playing that well.They were 
playing only 15 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy frost made three holes unplayable at the 6,753-yard, par-71 Marianske 
Lazne Golf Club course Thursday, so organizers decided to cut the course from 
18 to 15 holes and make it a par 59 -- at least for the first day. 
</P>
<P>
 The start of the first European PGA tournament to be played in the Czech 
Republic was delayed by more than three hours before tournament organizers 
decided players would skip the 11th, 13th and 14th holes. Still, only 51 of the 
102 starters were able to finish the first round before darkness halted play. 
</P>
<P>
 Brand, who had five birdies in a bogey-free round, said he wore three layers 
of clothing in the near-freezing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bit dodgy here and there, but it was better than sitting in the 
clubhouse," the Scotsman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance, another Scot, found he was over-dressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wore a vest, a T-shirt, two cashmere sweaters and a waterproof jacket," he 
said. "But I had to take the jacket off in the afternoon because I had so much 
on and it was difficult to swing."

 Center Matt Fish was a longshot to make the Clippers when training camp opened 
two weeks ago, but if he continues to play as he has in the Clippers' last two 
exhibition games, he may make the team.

<P>
 "You've got to think positive at all times because they never really give you 
any clue of what's going on," Fish said.

Basketball Assn.

 At 6 feet 11 and 265 pounds, he helped the Quad City Thunder win the CBA title 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fish is great," Clipper rookie swingman Eric Piatkowski said. "He gets out 
there and he works his tail off." 
</P>
<P>
 Fish has also impressed Coach Bill Fitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as he keeps playing the way he has, it's going to make it interesting 
on the roster," Fitch said. " . . . If he improves as much in the next two 
weeks as he has in the last two weeks, I'd say he has a pretty good chance of 
playing here and helping us. 
</P>
<P>
 "(But) he's not in good shape. He gets so excited and he's always on the trail 
end (of the fast break). He reminds me of a horse I bet on that's still out 
there running." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Clippers have reached a settlement with Coach Bob Weiss, who was fired 
last May with two years left on a three-year contract. Weiss, who was due to 
receive $1.2 million, stopped receiving paychecks last July. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got the check today and it'll be settled when it clears," Weiss quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss would not discuss terms of the settlement. Neither would Clipper 
spokesman Joe Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, now a broadcaster with the Dallas Mavericks, had no criticism of the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Momma told me that if you can't say anything nice, don't say anything at 
all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers made their first cuts, waiving guards Keith Smart and Alphonso 
Ford, center Robert Werdann and forward Isaiah Morris. That left them with 17 
players. . . . Center Stanley Roberts, who reported to camp overweight and out 
of shape, went through a complete practice for the first time and said he felt 
good. . . . Fitch said that Gary Grant, who had arthroscopic knee surgery 
before training camp, will probably open the season on the injured list.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: REALITY ADDS SPICE TO RAIDER TELECAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The spat between Raider quarterback Jeff Hostetler and his coach, Art Shell, 
last Sunday in Miami was unfortunate and disappointing. It was also bizarre in 
that the combatants had to be aware of NBC's presence. 
</P>
<P>
 But they carried on as if it didn't matter, providing millions of viewers with 
a stunning mini-drama. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like it," NBC commentator Bob Trumpy said from his 
home in Cincinnati, echoing the sentiments of many who witnessed it. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been player-coach tiffs caught on camera before. You may remember 
the one between Reggie Jackson and Billy Martin, or last season's battle 
between Scottie Pippen and Phil Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 And, earlier this season, Fox's cameras caught Steve Young voicing his 
displeasure with Coach George Seifert when he was yanked in the third quarter 
of the San Francisco 49ers' 40-8 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 But never before has a player-coach spat gone on as long as Hostetler-Shell. 
And NBC was there to cover this soap opera as it unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers couldn't hear what was being said, but some of the words weren't fit 
for national television, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got one close-up of Shell but we couldn't use it," said game producer John 
Faratzis. "It was too obvious what he was saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Faratzis said his crew had been aware of a possible volatile situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had read in the clippings the team sent us that Tim Brown had displayed his 
displeasure during the San Diego game when a running play was called on fourth 
and three from the six just before halftime," Faratzis said. "Making matters 
worse, the Raiders ran from a passing formation, with three wideouts." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Williams was stopped after a two-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Faratzis said that during a production meeting with Shell the day before the 
game, the coach had complained that Hostetler was holding the ball too long and 
also relying on Brown too much. 
</P>
<P>
 On game day, things came to a head late in the second quarter. In the huddle, 
Hostetler changed two running plays to passes. And after a series of mistakes 
and two dropped passes by James Jett, Hostetler, who was drilled by Dolphin 
linebacker Bryan Cox, was fuming when he came to the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a camera on him," Faratzis said. "What (director) John Gonzalez and I 
saw in the (production) truck was Shell say something to Hostetler when he got 
to the sideline. Hoss may have said something back and then went to get a drink 
of water. But he came back to have more words with Shell. That's when things 
got heated. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one point we saw Hostetler saying, 'I don't need this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 NBC dispatched sideline reporter Hannah Storm to get what she could. She 
reported after halftime that Hostetler had said he and Shell had not spoken in 
the locker room and that he didn't know if he was starting the second half or 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler started and played superbly despite the circumstances, but the 
Raiders lost their halftime lead and the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is just the tip of the iceberg," Faratzis said. "I think Shell's 
outburst stems from the heat he's feeling from Al Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an offense that has no imagination. They make it easy for a defense 
to shut it down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's one flaw was Trumpy's jumping to the wrong conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpy said the dispute between Hostetler and Shell stemmed from an earlier 
argument, caught on camera but not put out over the air, between Hostetler and 
offensive lineman Bruce Wilkerson. 
</P>
<P>
 Trumpy assumed incorrectly that that argument had led to the later one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think the two may have been connected," Trumpy said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's been no indication that they were, even though Wilkerson was 
demoted on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as bizarre as Hostetler vs. Shell is Tom Watson vs. Gary McCord. It was 
learned recently that Watson sent a letter to McCord's CBS boss, golf producer 
Frank Chirkinian, after last April's Masters, with a copy going to Masters 
chairman Jackson Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson didn't like some of McCord's comments, and in the letter to Chirkinian 
said, "Get rid of him, now." 
</P>
<P>
 McCord later was taken off future Masters at the request of Masters officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to reach Watson through his Kansas City management company were not 
successful, but McCord was contacted at his new home in the Phoenix area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew about the letter two days after the Masters," McCord said. "We had 
gone from the Masters to Hilton Head (S.C., the site of the HCI Heritage), and 
on Tuesday I was emceeing a 10-player shootout (a charity event). I saw Tom 
working on his chipping at a practice green, and we had a pleasant 
conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few minutes later, I see Frank and he calls me into the (production) truck 
and closes the door and shows me the letter. I couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK if someone doesn't like my work and OK if he voices an opinion, but 
what got me was Tom tried to get me fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Tom, out on the practice green, didn't even have the decency to say, 
'Hey, I didn't like some of your comments on the Masters telecast and I even 
sent a letter to your boss.' I could have dealt with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson appears to be in the minority. A poll in Golf Weekly had 84.7% 
disagreeing with McCord's removal from the Masters, and mail to The Times has 
been all pro-McCord. 
</P>
<P>
 He's the type of commentator golf needs, despite what Watson or the Masters 
people think. 
</P>
<P>
 TV-Radio Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles gets a look at the undefeated San Diego Chargers on Sunday, with 
Channel 4 showing their home game against the Denver Broncos at 1 p.m. Charlie 
Jones and Randy Cross are the announcers. The Fox game Sunday is the Rams at 
New Orleans at 10 a.m., with Joe Buck and Tim Green calling the action. . . . 
The ABC college game Saturday at 12:30 p.m., UCLA at Arizona, isn't much unless 
you're a die-hard Bruin fan. But there are some attractive pay-per-view games, 
including Utah-Colorado State and Michigan-Illinois. The UCLA-Arizona 
announcers will be Roger Twibell and Todd Blackledge, with Harry Carson working 
the sidelines. . . . California at USC is the Prime Network Pacific 10 
Conference game of the week, with Phil Stone and Rodney Gilmore calling the 
action and Paul Sunderland working the sidelines. . . . Stanford-UCLA at 3:30 
p.m. Oct. 29 is not scheduled to be televised live. The Prime Network game that 
day is Washington State at California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers have hired Channel 2 sportscaster Rory Markus as Rich Marotta's 
replacement on the radio broadcasts. Markus, who had been the Clippers' PA 
announcer and is also the Milwaukee Brewers' television play-by-play announcer, 
will be Ralph Lawler's commentator on most games but will do the play-by-play 
when Lawler switches over to do one of the Clippers' 35 Channel 13 telecasts. 
Despite the Clippers' efforts to keep Marotta, he chose to leave because of a 
growing number of boxing commitments. . . . Dan Goossen, Top Rank vice 
president who coincidentally is also Marotta's agent, Thursday was added to the 
broadcast team for Saturday night's pay-per-view card from Hong Kong. The 
four-bout card, featuring Rafael Ruelas defending his IBF lightweight title, 
begins at 7 p.m. Goossen is a fill-in for commentator Colin Cowherd, who was 
battling a 105-degree temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Add boxing: Saturday night's Forum-promoted card at Caesars Palace in Las 
Vegas will be simulcast in English and Spanish by Channel 9. Tom Kelly, Marotta 
and Fernando Paramo will be the English announcers, with Jaime Jarrin and 
Ricardo Jimenez doing the Spanish. The main event on the 8 p.m. card has 
unbeaten super bantamweight Marco Antonio Barrera facing Jesus Sarabia. . . . 
Jarrin, since the baseball strike, has been doing a sports-talk show for radio 
station KWKW, and it has become a big hit among Latino listeners. 
</P>
<P>
 The final match of the 1995 Newsweek Champions Cup in Indian Wells will be 
played on Monday, March 13, and televised by ESPN. It is the first time since 
the inception of the ATP Tour in 1990 that a tournament final has been 
scheduled for a Monday. . . . Because of the success of "Sportstalk" as fill-in 
programming at KABC radio during the baseball strike, the station has made it a 
permanent 5-8 p.m. fixture on weekdays, beginning Monday. The co-hosts are 
Steve Edwards and Eric Tracy. Gloria Allred's show has been moved to 3-5 p.m. . 
. . Brian Golden and Doug Krikorian, beginning this weekend, will do a regular 
Sunday show on KMPC, 2:30-5 p.m., whenever the Rams play an early road game. 
Joe McDonnell will continue doing his Saturday night show. . . . Willie Mays 
and Johnny Unitas will be the guests on a special "Up Close" show on ESPN today 
at 4:30 p.m. . . . Former UCLA gymnast Maura Driscoll joins John Nabor on the 
taped World Gymnastics team trials on ESPN Sunday at 5 p.m.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; SKREPENAK FINALLY GETS BIG CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Greg Skrepenak was crushed. 
</P>
<P>
 After starting 48 consecutive games at Michigan, the offensive lineman had 
waited 2 1/2 seasons as a pro to make the starting lineup.He had endured a 
major leg injury that cost him a season. He had endured the indignity of 
watching one big name after another join the team and move ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it appeared he had his chance. On Sunday against the Miami Dolphins, 
offensive left tackle Gerald Perry fractured a bone above his right ankle, an 
injury that will sideline him from four to six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Skrepenak had been working out at left tackle. So the job was his, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Robert Jenkins mentioned to Skrepenak that he, Jenkins, had been told 
the job was his . 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little disappointed," said the 24-year-old Skrepenak, now in his 
third year as a Raider after being drafted in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 But the disappointment didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Art Shell quickly elated Skrepenak by informing him that starting right 
tackle Bruce Wilkerson was being benched, to be replaced by Skrepenak. 
</P>
<P>
 Skrepenak's joy, however, was tempered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy," he said, "but Bruce and I are friends. One man's misfortune 
is another man's good fortune. I feel bad, but I've just got to take advantage 
of the opportunity.  
</P>
<P>
 "Bruce is in a slump. We all go through it.'

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; NEWMAN STANDS OUT DESPITE INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Safety Anthony Newman, the hero in the Rams' 17-10 victory over the New York 
Giants on Sunday with a game-ending interception, said in six years of 
practicing against Jim Everett he never once intercepted an Everett pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd go No. 1 defense versus No. 1 offense in training camp and then I'd play 
on the scout team and I never picked Jim," Newman said. "A lot of times you're 
out there and it just happens. Chris Miller throws a ball and you intercept it. 
I'm definitely due." 
</P>
<P>
 Newman seriously injured the little finger on his right hand before last 
week's game and still made the key interception with his right hand bandaged to 
look like a club. This week he will attempt to play with only his last two 
fingers protected by a cast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The throbbing has stopped, but I'm very conscious of it," Newman said. "I 
don't shake hands or open doors, and I need help putting on my shoulder pads 
and snapping my chin strap." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the inconveniences, Newman played against the Giants and has continued 
to practice effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he slit his finger and that bone was sticking out, there was still no 
doubt in his mind that he was going to play," said Joe Vitt, Ram assistant head 
coach. "It wasn't up to the doctors, it was up to Anthony and it shows what 
kind of attitude he has. If you didn't know he was hurt, you couldn't have 
spotted it because there was no drop in his aggressiveness or in his play and 
that's the mark of a true professional." 
</P>

<P>
 Defensive tackle Jimmie Jones sat out practice because of a sore hip, but 
Coach Chuck Knox said he will play against the Saints. . . . Tom Newberry has 
been promoted to offensive team captain while Jackie Slater recovers from a 
torn triceps muscle. Knox said Slater is expected to be ready to play again 
after the bye next week. . . . Knox said rookie wide receiver Isaac Bruce 
continues to improve, but Jessie Hester remains the starter opposite Flipper 
Anderson. . . . Rookie Wayne Gandy will start again at right tackle although 
Knox said Darryl Ashmore "just needs to get bumped around and gain some 
confidence." Ashmore, who was projected to start at right tackle this season, 
injured a knee earlier. Center Bern Brostek remains on crutches with his broken 
leg in a cast. He may return in three to five weeks. T.J. SIMERS

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; USC; ROBINSON LOOKING FOR DEFENSIVE HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A couple of weeks ago, John Robinson said he could form a media all-star team 
and, with two days' practice, could score on his varsity defense on the first 
drive of a game.  
</P>
<P>
 The regularity with which opponents are scoring on their first or second 
possessions has Robinson's entire staff stumped.Here's how it has gone: 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, second drive: Two plays, 86 yards for touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State, first drive: Five plays, 80 yards for touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor, first drive: Six plays, 80 yards for touchdown.  
</P>
<P>
 Oregon, first drive: Eight plays, 43 yards, field goal.  
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State, first drive: Four plays, 79 yards, touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, first drive: Thirteen plays, 65 yards, field goal.  
</P>
<P>
 Penn State scored on its first three drives, Baylor, Oregon, Oregon State and 
Stanford on their first two. Yet USC is 4-2 and has outscored opponents, 54-39, 
in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Robinson: "I will accept any suggestions -- written, fax, oral -- 
anything for how we can stop teams on the first drive. I have no pride left, no 
ego, and I'll take any suggestions." 
</P>

 For decades, California was dominated by USC and UCLA. From 1950-1989, it was 
a combined 12-67-1 against the Trojans and Bruins. But since 1990, Cal has 
posted a 6-2-1 mark against USC and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory over USC Saturday at the Coliseum would give the Bears a season 
sweep of USC and UCLA for only the second time in 36 years. EARL GUSTKEY

LINEBACKER SMALL CAME UP BIG AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME FOR USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the space of half a minute last Saturday in Palo Alto, USC executed what 
could arguably be called its three best plays of the season.  
</P>
<P>
 With about 4 minutes 30 seconds left and USC leading Stanford, 20-13, the 
following transpired: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom completed a short pass to Anthony 
Bookman, and USC cornerback John Herpin knocked him into yesterday with a 
jarring tackle.  
</P>
<P>
 -- Two plays later, Stenstrom tried the same pass but USC linebacker Errol 
Small made a leaping, one-handed interception from a range of about 12 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One play later, USC tailback Shawn Walters swept around Stanford's left 
side on a 61-yard touchdown run, the longest run from scrimmage by a Trojan 
back in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But for pure athleticism, Small's interception at point-blank range has to be 
the leader for USC's play of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 Is this guy in the right sport? Shouldn't he be playing third base for 
someone? 
</P>
<P>
 Fact is, Small is grateful to be playing any sport. 
</P>
<P>
 He and two 1993 Trojan teammates narrowly escaped death in an auto accident 
last Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Small's remarkable interception Saturday was yet another big play by a 
big-play player, defensive coordinator Don Lindsey said.  
</P>
<P>
 A 6-foot-2, 240-pound senior outside linebacker, Small is making up for lost 
time. He's had two knee operations and one on his shoulder since USC recruited 
him at Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High and never did crack the starting lineup 
last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, he's starting ahead of heralded junior college transfer Izzy Ifeanyi and 
playing the kind of football Lindsey says can get him into the next NFL draft.  
</P>
<P>
 "Errol's big assets are that he plays hard, he's very aggressive and he's 
fast," Lindsey said. "Guys like that tend to make big plays and that's exactly 
what he's doing. If he plays the rest of the season like he's played the last 
couple of games, he'll attract some NFL attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, as Lindsey points out, good coaching has something to do with all 
this, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "When our outside linebackers are being blocked on a pass play, and when they 
see a (right-handed) quarterback's left hand come off that ball, we want them 
to get their hands up in the air. If they can't block it, we at least want them 
to force the quarterback to put more hang time on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, best of all, catch it.  
</P>
<P>
 "The ball came point-first right into my palm, and I just hung on to it," said 
Small, describing his Brooks Robinson play.  
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Robinson, after reviewing the play on video Sunday morning, noted 
that everyone on the field -- including Small -- was stunned by the play.  
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as he caught it, I'm yelling: 'Run! Run!' " Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But he went stationary, like everyone else. Errol turned a 30-yard return 
into a plus-four." 
</P>
<P>
 Errol Small came to USC as a running back. At Notre Dame High, he ran for 275 
yards in the season opener of his senior season. He was also a 200-pound free 
safety.  
</P>
<P>
 He gained 1,567 yards his senior year, averaging 7.7 yards a carry and scored 
21 touchdowns. Yet always, he knew he'd be a college defensive player. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nearly everyone who recruited Errol pegged him as a safety or linebacker in 
college," said his prep coach, Kevin Rooney.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was a big, tough physical runner but didn't have that burner speed to be a 
running back on the major-college level." 
</P>
<P>
 Small was recruited principally by USC, UCLA, Notre Dame, Washington and 
Colorado.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 12, I played Pop Warner football for the East Valley Trojans," 
Small said. "I always wanted to be a Trojan." 
</P>
<P>
 Small is the son of a retired video editor and electronic engineer, Errol 
Small Sr. His grandmother, Small said, named his father after actor Errol 
Flynn, and it was handed down to him, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Small's mother, Saundra, is a credit analyst for a department store. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Errol Small's parents got the most unsettling kind of phone call parents can 
have early in the morning of last Feb. 14.  
</P>
<P>
 He was calling from West Hills Regional Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom, I've been in a wreck . . . they're hurt, please come," Small said." 
</P>
<P>
 Small and two teammates from the 1993 USC team, Jason Oliver and Michael 
Jones, had just survived a frightening Ventura Freeway accident, near 
Calabasas.  
</P>
<P>
 It happened at 3:30 a.m. Small, the driver, saw a car coming onto the freeway 
from an on-ramp, moving erratically. Later, it would be learned, the car had 
just broken its axle.

 The car spun out of control and Small turned hard right to avoid it. His car 
skidded, then flipped 7 1/2 times. It slid, wheels up, for 300 feet, then 
tumbled into a drainage ditch. "I blacked out, but I wasn't out long," said 
Small, who was the least injured of the three.  
</P>
<P>
 There was blood everywhere, from deep cuts on Oliver's hand and arm. Oliver 
screamed from the pain. Jones was quiet.  
</P>
<P>
 "I got out of my seat belt upside down, and got out and got the back door open 
to get Michael," Small recalled.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who had been sleeping in the back seat, was unconscious. An asthmatic, 
he also was in respiratory arrest.  
</P>
<P>
 Small, who had never had instruction in CPR, brought his teammate back to 
life, in a concrete-lined ditch.  
</P>
<P>
 "I pulled him out of the car and was blowing into his mouth, and he started 
breathing again," Small said, adding that at that moment an ambulance arrived.  
</P>
<P>
 Small, Oliver and Jones are close friends. They had come in together to USC's 
football program in the summer of 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 Oliver was hospitalized for three weeks. His cut hand became infected and 
doctors briefly considered amputating fingers. Jones has more than two dozen 
pins in his right arm, which was broken in seven places. He faces further 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Small had minor cuts and bruises.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Oliver today are junior varsity coaches at Montclair Prep in Van 
Nuys.  
</P>
<P>
 And Errol Small is a football player with a new attitude.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have a totally different outlook on life, since the accident," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, who knows how long I'll play this game? I enjoy one day at a time. I 
go out to practice every day and do the very best I can, and try to appreciate 
everything I used to take for granted."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; UCLA; DONAHUE THINKS STOKES WON'T PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Could J.J. Stokes play Saturday at Arizona? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably, said Gerald Finerman, UCLA's team physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Stokes play? Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
 Finerman, who has been treating Stokes for a bruised thigh muscle since the 
first game of the season, said that he could be available for limited duty, 
similar to the situation four weeks ago against Washington State.. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back, it was probably a mistake to play him against Washington 
State," Coach Terry Donahue said. "He played, and then we didn't have him for 
four weeks. I'd rather give him another week and have three games at 100% than 
have him limp through the last four games of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes played at what he termed 80% effectiveness against Washington State and 
caught one pass for 13 yards. His leg stiffened at halftime and he has not 
played since. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, both Donahue and Stokes said he would not play again until he 
was 100% healed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has gone through twice-daily rehabilitation with the Bruin 
medical staff. Last week he began jogging, and on Tuesday of this week he ran 
patterns with the offense for the first time since September. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked harder Wednesday, including jogging through wind sprints with the 
team and felt no adverse effects on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said that Stokes' condition would be reviewed today for a decision on 
whether to take him to Tucson and, if so, whether he will play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't think he's going to play," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said that Wayne Cook will start at quarterback. "But I won't hesitate 
to make a move if things are not going well or Wayne isn't playing well," 
Donahue said. A move would involve bringing in sophomore Ryan Fien. 
</P>
<P>
 The kicking situation is not yet resolved. Bjorn Merten, who missed last week 
from 32 yards after kicking two shorter field goals, is four for his last 11 
attempts. Greg Andrasak is his competition, and Donahue said that a decision 
would not be made until the two warm up in Tucson. JIM HODGES

 THE COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 The season has passed the halfway point -- too late for Notre Dame's Lou Holtz 
or any other coach to redshirt his entire team. It's also that melancholy time 
of the year when winless records begin to disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest team to suffer such a blemish was Houston (1-5), a 39-33 winner (it 
hurts us to say that word) over the Smus (1-6). Bottom Ten selectors met in an 
emergency session afterward and activated Akron (0-6) for the No. 1 spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zips, who were shut out by some school named Central Michigan, 0-47, are 
coached by Gerry Faust. You may recall that Faust formerly coached Notre Dame, 
where he won zero national championships (one fewer than the legendary Holtz). 
</P>
<P>

 Mandatory suspended list: Houston (1-5) (for winning a game). 
</P>
<P>
 Rout of the Week: Arizona (5-1) over school whose identity will be withheld 
pending notification of next of athletic director. THE PROS 
</P>
<P>
 This is a Bottom Ten bye week for Cincinnati (0-6). We won't kick around the 
Bungles at all. Ah, but the Broncos . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It's too bad that John Elway has to be stuck with a crummy team like Denver 
(1-5). It's his own fault, though. Remember the team that originally wanted to 
draft him out of college? It's a club that has won three times as many games as 
the Broncos -- the powerful Indy Dolts (3-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows? With Elway at the helm, the Dolts might even be 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, paced by the agile thinking of Buddy Ryan, Arizona won an exciting, 
if exhausting, two-out-of-three match with Washington over the weekend. Arizona 
edged the Redskins, 19-16, one day after Arizona had defeated Washington State, 
10-7. Arizona State, meanwhile, was edged by Washington on Saturday, 14-35. 
</P>
<P>
 And how about the Giants' explosive runner Rodney Hampton? He had a run longer 
than 20 yards Sunday for the first time in 471 attempts. Have you caught your 
breath yet, Rodney?

"A year ago . . . I was standing up there before them at 5-2. This year, I was

team."

THOROUGHBRED RACING; PARADISE CREEK IS BEST ON GRASS, BUT HOLY BULL HAS OVERALL 
EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the Irish-bred Theatrical held off Bruce McNall's Arc de Triomphe 
winner, Trempolino, to win the Breeders' Cup Turf at Hollywood Park in 1987, 
friends called to congratulate Bill Mott for having trained a cinch grass 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Grass champion hell, Mott thought. In his opinion, Theatrical had done enough 
to merit more than that. The 5-year-old had raced all year, starting in the 
winter at Hialeah and ending with the fall in California, while winning seven 
of nine starts, six of the victories coming in Grade I races. 
</P>
<P>
 Mott figured that these were bona fide horse-of-the-year credentials. But this 
marked his introduction to the harsh vagaries of Eclipse Awards voting. 
Theatrical edged out Manila for the male grass championship, and horse- 
of-the-year honors went to Ferdinand, a dirt horse who had been beaten in more 
than half of his races. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, Mott shakes his head about what went on at the ballot box in 1987. 
"Theatrical was as consistent as a horse could be," he said. "I feel that he 
was slighted. He was good from January to the end of the year, yet he was 
overlooked because he was a grass horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferdinand was a horse with charisma, which didn't hurt. He had won an 
extra-dramatic Kentucky Derby with Bill Shoemaker aboard in 1986, which should 
have had no bearing on 1987.  
</P>
<P>
 As a 4-year-old, Ferdinand had the look of another Derby horse who would be a 
bust the rest of his career. His post-Derby record was no wins in nine races 
before trainer Charlie Whittingham got him rolling again. From late June 
through the Breeders' Cup Classic -- when many of the Eclipse voters are paying 
the most attention -- Ferdinand was undefeated in four starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years after Theatrical, Mott is knocking on the horse-of-the-year door 
with another consistent grass horse: Paradise Creek, who will be the heavy 
favorite in the $2-million Breeders' Cup Turf at Churchill Downs two weeks from 
Saturday, has won eight times and finished second once in nine starts. But this 
time there's a weightier presence out there than Ferdinand. Holy Bull, 
ineligible for the Breeders' Cup, has finished his season, and what a year it 
was: 10 starts, all on dirt, with eight wins and two easy victories over older 
horses at Belmont Park. In Thoroughbred Racing Communications' weekly poll, 
which includes only a fragment of the Eclipse voters, there were 31 votes for 
Holy Bull and one for Paradise Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always been a turf bias," Mott said. "But there has been a change the 
last few years. I think the voters have become more open-minded in the last 
five or six years." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Eclipse Awards began in 1971, only four grass runners -- John Henry 
twice, All Along and Kotashaan -- have won the horse-of-the-year title. In 
1981, John Henry's first championship year, he was tough on both surfaces, 
adding wins in the Santa Anita Handicap and the Jockey Club Gold Cup to his 
grass accomplishments. Last year, Kotashaan wouldn't have won the title if 
Bertrando hadn't run second to the 133-1 Arcangues in the Breeders' Cup 
Classic. That outcome left the electorate with nothing but grass horses -- 
Kotashaan, Lure and Star of Cozzene -- to vote for, so perhaps what Mott 
perceives as an age of enlightenment for Eclipse voters is a deception. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a relief that Mott and Jimmy Croll, the owner-trainer of Holy Bull, have 
styles that are more pianissimo than press agent. "Paradise Creek is a 
once-in-a-lifetime horse," the soft-spoken Mott said, "and I don't see any 
chinks in his armor. But I don't want to say anything that will get pie in my 
face. If he gets the job done in the Breeders' Cup, maybe I'll mouth off then. 
But until then, I'll let the horse do the talking." 
</P>
<P>
 Bert and Diana Firestone bred and raced both Theatrical and Paradise Creek, 
but they sold Paradise Creek to Masayuki Nishiyama, a Japanese businessman, 
early this year. This Nippon connection insures that Paradise Creek, headed for 
a career at stud in 1995, will run one more time after the Breeders' Cup, in 
the $3.5-million Japan Cup in Tokyo on Nov. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Since there are no guidelines, Eclipse voters have been confused about what to 
do with the Japan Cup. Kotashaan's hard-luck defeat in Tokyo moved Lure closer 
to him in the final horse-of-the-year vote, and had Star of Cozzene won the 
Japan Cup, he might have moved past both of his grass rivals in the final 
tally. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not look to diplomatic Bill Mott for help on this tangled issue. "If a 
horse wins in Japan, there's more of a reason to consider him," he said. "And 
if he gets beat, you can always say that it's been a long, tough campaign and 
not hold it against him." 
</P>
<P>
 If Mott really wants to lure -- poor word choice -- more voters at Churchill 
Downs on Nov. 5, he ought to run Paradise Creek in the Breeders' Cup Mile 
instead of in the 1 1/2 mile Turf. Lure, winner of the last two runnings of the 
Mile, is trying to become the first horse to win three Breeders' Cup races, and 
any rival that ruins that mission would be special indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Carried wide in that catastrophic run to the first turn of the Mile at Santa 
Anita last year, Paradise Creek finished eighth, eight lengths behind Lure. 
This year, however, Paradise Creek has beaten Lure in two of three meetings at 
1 1/8 miles, one of the victories coming at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettors trying to beat Paradise Creek in the Turf will be saying that the 
horse has never run the 1 1/2-mile distance. His last three wins have come at 1 
1/4 miles. Pat Day, who rides Paradise Creek, said a week ago that he didn't 
know whether the horse's Breeders' Cup race would be the Mile or the Turf, but 
in reaching his decision, Mott said: "I'd much rather go up a quarter of a mile 
than drop a quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 What he might actually be saying is that at a flat mile, Lure will take more 
beating than anything Paradise Creek has to face in the longer race. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Cardmania, last year's Breeders' Cup Sprint winner, leaves for Kentucky today, 
with trainer Derek Meredith hopeful that his horse will be invited to join a 
field that will be oversubscribed for the 14-horse limit. In his comeback race 
following a cannon-bone injury, Cardmania was fourth in last Saturday's Ancient 
Title Handicap at Santa Anita. Eddie Delahoussaye, who rode Cardmania in last 
year's Sprint, is scheduled to ride again . . . Phone Chatter, winner of last 
year's Juvenile Fillies, won't run in this year's Breeders' Cup Distaff. She 
finished last in the Spinster at Keeneland last Sunday . . . With Pat Day 
opting to ride Heavenly Prize in the Distaff, the mount on Dispute, trainer 
Shug McGaughey's other starter, goes to Chris McCarron. . . . McCarron's other 
mounts are Cezanne in the Classic, Fraise in the Turf, Soviet Problem in the 
Sprint, Mr Purple in the Juvenile and Honky Tonk Tune in the Juvenile Fillies . 
. . Inner City, with 118 pounds, is the high weight for Saturday's $75,000 
Russell Handicap at Santa Anita. Others running in the 1 1/4-mile grass race 
are Seahawk Gold, Stark South, Marfamatic, Estonia, Newton's Law, Lomitas and 
Navire . . . Joe Burnham, an award-winning racing cinematographer, has suffered 
a stroke and is in intensive care at Arcadia Methodist Hospital.

 MOZART'S BOYS: Vienna, Austria, is not only the city of culture, but was once 
home to many great composers: Schubert, Strauss, Mozart. The music of those 
geniuses is heralded by the Vienna Choir Boys, just shy of 500 years old and 
still in such demand that it now has four touring choruses around the world. .

 MATCHMAKER? Alice Sommer of Huntington Beach wants a reward posted to help 
find whoever killed her son, Kenny, and his friend, Chen Blanchard, shot to 
death in March. Frank Di Bella, president of Planet Hollywood in Santa Ana, has 
offered to put up his own money -- if the city of Huntington Beach will match 
it. . . . So far, city leaders there are reluctant, for fear this could set a 
costly precedent in such cases. Says a disappointed Sommer: "They seem more 
worried about cleaning the gum on the sidewalks than getting rid of the scum on 
the streets."

 CLASSIC GUY: Before Gene Autry was owner of the California Angels and a

Classics sure does. . . . The cable network, shown most places here, recaps 
Autry's cowboy career with a 60-minute tribute Sunday (10:30 a.m. and 7:30 
p.m.), "Gene Autry: Melody of the West," narrated by Johnny Cash. People 
magazine says of it: "Footage from Autry's first serial, 'Phantom Empire,' 
still looks pretty cool 60 years later."

 NEW TEXAS STORY: Texas has spawned countless blues and soul bands, but it's 
safe to say none quite like Storyville, which plays the Coach House in San Juan 
Capistrano on Saturday (F29). . . . The group's lead singer and songwriter is 
Malford Milligan, an albino African-American Buddhist. His religion, he says, 
"opens me up onstage. When I chant, it helps. . . . I bare my emotions in a 
song. It takes a lot of chutzpah . . . Buddhism gives me that courage."

 SCHOOL DUEL: It wasn't just for cake and coffee that hundreds of parents 
turned out for Back to School night at Grant High School in Van Nuys. Worried 
parents, some of them immigrants, questioned administrators about ethnic 
violence that left two Armenian boys stabbed and a Latino boy shot following a 
melee in a school parking lot. . . . Principal Eve Sherman emphasized that the 
violence happened off campus (B1).

 LOSING TIMES: Gloom gripped the Cal State Northridge athletic department as 
coaches and players mourned defeat in a campus election over whether to 
increase student fees to provide more money for sports (C10). . . . Said Dan

 TRADE ZONE: To help West Valley manufacturers recover from the quake, Rep. 
Howard (Buck) McKeon proposes forming a trade zone to exempt them from customs

Glendale Symphony. After 29 years away, the symphony returns to town Saturday

POLITICAL BRIEFING: IMPRISONED LEGISLATOR SAYS OTHERS BENEFIT FROM WAR ON CRIME

 THE INSIDE VIEW: Word is that Pat Nolan, formerly the state assemblyman from 
Glendale-Burbank and now known around the Dublin federal prison as Inmate No. 
06833-097, is doing as well as can be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only has he been promoted in his prison duties -- again -- but he has 
picked up the pen and become a scribe. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall issue of a conservative journal called the California Political 
Review, Nolan writes in a guest editorial that he is still disillusioned about 
the state of justice in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Or injustice, perhaps, in Nolan's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too many people profit from the War on Crime," he writes, arguing that no one 
wants to actually win the war because that would end the gravy train. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the profiteers in Nolan's view are lawyers, prosecutors, prison guards, 
prison builders, bond sellers and social workers. All stand to gain from the 
overblown, bloated and self-serving War on Crime. 
</P>
<P>
 And the victims? People like himself who are overzealously prosecuted for 
marginal white-collar infractions. Nolan is serving a 33-month sentence for 
political corruption after taking $10,000 in campaign contributions from an 
undercover FBI agent who was seeking legislative favors. 
</P>
<P>
 "A substantial portion of the men with me here at the Federal Prison Camp in 
Dublin are here for bureaucratic 'crimes' arising from disputes with government 
employees over billing procedures, loan documentation, late filing of documents 
or other violations of statutes that are technical in nature," Nolan writes. 
"It came as quite a shock to me -- though it shouldn't have -- to learn that 
our judicial and penal systems are just like every other bureaucracy. In my 15 
years in the Legislature, I was blind to this fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he has had his eyes opened, Nolan should find plenty of reading 
material to keep his ruminations sharp. For his new prison job, he's been 
elevated to the status of librarian. 
</P>
<P>
 This follows an episode in which, in his former capacity as street-sweeper 
operator, Nolan had a little run-in of sorts with the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems he had got the sweeper's water squirter operating again after a long 
hiatus just as he was driving the machinery toward a trio of prison bosses who 
stood chatting on the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 You can guess how that one ended. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 SIGN WARS: You can expect a race for high school student body president to 
have its juvenile moments. But congressional politics is supposed to be 
high-brow, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 Witness, for example, the behavior this week at the Cal Lutheran University 
debate between U.S. Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) and his GOP 
challenger, Richard Sybert, in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert enthusiasts fired the first shots in this opera buffa by taping signs 
advertising their champion in a neat row across the rear wall of the debate 
site, a CLU auditorium at which numerous other candidates for local races set 
up booths of their own to greet voters. 
</P>
<P>
 When the late-arriving Beilenson folks saw the Sybert signs, they began 
slapping up their own signs on the same wall, in the only expanse not claimed 
by Sybert placards.  
</P>
<P>
 But, in the heat of battle, the Beilenson folks failed to see a public 
relations gaffe in the making. The debate sponsors had put up their own sign, 
on this same contested wall, designating the entire rear area of the auditorium 
for "special interest groups" to set up informational booths to advertise their 
political causes and wares. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the Beilenson-ites plastered the congressman's posters just above 
the "special interest groups" sign, creating the impression of some alliance 
between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony: Beilenson fiercely prides himself in not taking special interest 
money. "If I take a photo of this, will you run a picture?" one Sybert backer 
asked a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing their mistake, the sheepish Beilenson team relocated their signs -- 
to beneath the existing row of head-high Sybert signs. "We're on top," one 
youthful Sybert partisan was heard to exult. More glares and flushed faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a debate organizer, with schoolmarmish precision, sternly adjudged 
the increasingly tense rear wall area off-limits to all candidate signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, the partisans had dutifully pulled down their respective signs 
and scattered to the winds, like so many chastised children. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 REVELATIONS: U.S. Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Panorama City) surprised a few 
observers with the conciliatory remarks he made at a candidate forum sponsored 
last week by the conservative Christian Coalition, TV evangelist Pat 
Robertson's group. 
</P>
<P>
 And Berman, who has virtually impeccable liberal credentials, had some success 
with this unfamiliar crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 In prepared remarks, Berman -- now seeking his seventh term in the House -- 
said that it was his belief that "evangelical Christians should be praised, and 
not reviled" for their involvement in the political process. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite differences, he and the coalition share many fundamental views, Berman 
added. Notable among these: a growing skepticism about the ability of 
government to cure societal ills and a belief that the existing welfare system 
has actually perpetuated poverty and undermined the work ethic and family 
values. With such shared views as a starting point, Berman said he hoped that 
he and the conservative Christian community could enter into a new dialogue 
over issues facing the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But one of the highlights of the congressman's remarks was his support for the 
concept of schools' setting aside a "moment of silence" to give pupils a 
chance, if they wish, to pray or otherwise "attend to the spiritual nature of 
the human soul." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Christian Coalition is absolutely in favor of school prayer, 
said Sara Hardman, the coalition's California chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Berman and the fundamentalist movement are not exactly in sync on 
school prayer. Berman, being a good politician, did not emphasize the 
differences in his remarks at Friday's forum. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, fundamentalist Christians wanted Congress this year to pass 
measures that would punish local school districts, by denying them federal aid, 
if they prohibited school prayer. Berman voted against these measures.  
</P>
<P>
 The federal government should "keep its clammy claws off this issue and leave 
it to the local jurisdictions to decide what's best as long as it's consistent 
with the Constitution," Berman said in an interview with The Times. That's too 
passive for many Christian activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Berman's efforts to reach out to the coalition was appreciated by some 
at Friday's event. "He may have picked up a few votes," Hardman said. "I talked 
to him afterwards, and he was very conciliatory. He wants us to dialogue, and I 
agree." 
</P>
<P>

 MAKING TRACKS: With the showdown vote less than a week away, Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich is working hard to persuade his colleagues on the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority board that the best place to put a rail line across 
the San Fernando Valley is along the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich has also waged a campaign to capture the hearts and minds of 
residents. Last month, Antonovich sent a mailing to 230,000 Valley households 
praising the concept of an elevated line along the freeway and painting the 
rival subway option as an environmentally unsound, unsafe alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 The mailing claimed nearly $41,000 of Antonovich's district operating budget, 
and the bulk of the recipients don't even live in his district. 
</P>
<P>
 But the longtime supervisor calls it a justified expense to warn Valley 
taxpayers that a modified subway with some open-air stations would run the risk 
of "flooding of the channel, illegal entry and contact with the high-voltage 
rail and accidents with oncoming trains by those daring to venture onto the 
tracks," Antonovich wrote in a letter to the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., 
which opposes the Ventura Freeway route. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of it is our district," Antonovich deputy Habib Balian said of some of 
the northern Valley area where residents received the flyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just people who live by the freeway or a (possible) Valley subway" 
who would be affected by the rail project, Balian said. Antonovich "felt he had 
the responsibility -- and legally he was able to -- to use the operating budget 
to send a mailer."

 Denny's Accused of Union Busting: The National Labor Relations Board charged 
that two restaurants in New Jersey fired overnight employees because they tried 
to unionize workers.Debbie Atkinson, a spokeswoman for Flagstar Cos., Denny's 
parent, said the employees weren't fired but were laid off when the two 
restaurants stopped serving food at night. But New Jersey's Local 54 of the 
Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International union filed complaints 
with the NLRB on July 21, saying Denny's graveyard-shift employees in Mt. 
Laurel and Marlton were fired. The NLRB has not set a date for a hearing.

UPBEAT ECONOMIC NEWS SENDS STOCK AND BOND PRICES DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bonds and stocks suffered deep selloffs Thursday as upbeat economic reports 
revived inflation fears and sent long-term interest rates soaring to within a 
baby's hair of 8.0%. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the gloom were a broad decline in the dollar and a healthy rise in 
commodity prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's 30-year bond yield surpassed 8.0% briefly, but by late in the 
day it had dipped below that psychological barrier, closing at 7.996%, down 
from Wednesday's 7.89%. The last daily close of the long bond above 8.0% was in 
May, 1992. The long bond's price, which moves in the opposite direction, sank 1 
6/32 points, or about $11.88, for each $1,000 invested. 
</P>
<P>
 Government reports Thursday all showed an economy continuing to rise rapidly, 
a scenario that prompts fears of inflation eroding the value of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said housing starts jumped 4.4% in September. They had 
been expected to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 A Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank report showed unexpectedly strong regional 
manufacturing growth and rising prices in October. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Labor Department said first-time unemployment claims fell. They were 
expected to rise. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar, meanwhile, fell to a two-year low against the German mark and the 
British pound after Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the United States has 
no plans to intervene to prop up the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar finished at 1.492 marks, down from 1.502 marks 
Wednesday and the lowest level since Oct. 19, 1992. At the same time, the 
British pound rallied against the dollar for an eighth consecutive trading 
session. Sterling ended at $1.632, up from $1.623. 
</P>
<P>
 The closely watched Commodity Research Bureau's index rose 2.74 points to 
233.91, further fanning inflation fears. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, earnings reports from a few prominent companies also helped 
push stock indexes lower and took the luster off an earnings season that so far 
has been favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average lost as much as 41 points before paring those 
losses to close at 3,911.15, down 24.89 points. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 11 to 5 
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 331.46 million shares, up 
from 319.34 million Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dow component General Motors tumbled 3 3/4 to 43 1/8, after the auto maker's 
third-quarter profit fell below analysts expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other stocks falling after disappointing quarterly earnings were 
Kimberly-Clark, off 5 to 52 3/4 and Pet, down 1 5/8 to 17 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * IBM, another Dow component, fell 3/8 to 75, although its earnings were good. 
</P>
<P>
 * Microsoft surged 2 to 59 5/8 after posting earnings Wednesday that beat 
forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reliance Electric soared 5 1/8 to 29 5/8. The company, which recently agreed 
to be acquired by General Signal Corp. for $25 a share in stock, attracted a 
rival all-cash bid of $30 per share from Rockwell. Rockwell fell 3/8 to 36, 
while General Signal rose 1 1/4 to 35 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas markets closed mixed. Stocks closed firmer in Tokyo, with the 
225-share Nikkei average rising 123.03 points to 19,991.90. Frankfurt's DAX 
30-share average closed at 2.069.95, up 18.79 points, while in London, the 
Financial Times 100-share average edged up 2.4 points to 3,063.2. Mexico's 
Bolsa index ended 6.77 points lower at 2,743.36.

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'LOVE AFFAIR,' THIRD TIME AROUND; WARREN BEATTY AND ANNETTE 
BENING STAR IN LATEST REMAKE OF THIS STURDY TALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his latest film, Warren Beatty has loved wisely but not all that well. His 
infatuation with the 1939 "Love Affair," one of the great romantic weepies of 
its time, is well-placed, and his decision to faithfully remake such an openly 
sentimental and old-fashioned film is almost a brave one. 
</P>
<P>
 But though it is effective in fits and starts, this third version of that 
sturdy tale (the fourth, if you count "Sleepless in Seattle," which it in part 
inspired) never manages to be more than a reasonable facsimile of its 
progenitor. 
</P>
<P>
 For like all things light and airy, romantic fantasies turn out to be more 
difficult to construct than they seem. The memorable ones are as delicate and 
ephemeral as champagne bubbles, defying logic and gravity as they infiltrate 
our sensibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The first "Love Affair," directed by Leo McCarey and starring Irene Dunne and 
Charles Boyer, managed this feat, and Beatty (who also produced and co-wrote 
with Robert Towne while Glenn Gordon Caron did the directing) has attempted to 
recapture the magic by closely following the original script. 
</P>
<P>
 But not even the kick husband and wife Beatty and Annette Bening must have 
gotten from re-enacting one of the screen's memorable liaisons has been enough 
to bring this "Love Affair" totally to life.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the intriguing aspects of this "Love Affair" is watching Beatty and 
Bening in what can be read as a version of their own relationship, acting out a 
kind of valentine to their own personal success as a married couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Beatty plays Mike Gambril, a former NFL star and now a sportscaster best 
known, if the TV tabloid shows are to be believed, as either an "aging playboy" 
or "an aging sports stud." 
</P>
<P>
 At the film's opening, Mike's engagement to powerful and glamorous talk-show 
host Lynn Weaver (Kate Capshaw) has just been announced, and the man himself is 
off to Australia for what is supposed to be a quick few days of work. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plane over, however, he encounters Terry McKay (Bening) when he drops 
his little black book and she archly comments, "I thought those things were 
extinct." 
</P>
<P>
 Herself engaged to lord of Wall Street Ken Allen (Pierce Brosnan), a financier 
whose yacht she is flying off to decorate, Terry is both attractive and 
seemingly immune to Mike's heavily practiced line of chat, a combination he 
finds intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
 Since most of the original "Love Affair" took place on an ocean liner, some 
fancy plot footwork is employed to get Mike and Terry onto a goofy Russian 
cruise ship, but the feat is managed and in the few days they have together, a 
kind of bond is forged. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping in the bonding is a quick visit to Mike's Aunt Ginny (Katharine 
Hepburn in her first feature appearance in nine years) who conveniently lives 
on a nearby island. A font of ancient wisdom, as was the delightful and elfin 
Maria Ouspenskaya in the 1939 version, Ginny opines that her nephew may not be 
the philanderer he appears to be. He may just have not met the right woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry and Mike can see the conflict between their increasing attachment to 
each other and their commitments to other people, but what neither they nor the 
audience can imagine are the other kinds of roadblocks the film's shameless 
plot will put in their path. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love Affair" wisely does not try to update things too much. A simple kiss is 
as explicit as things get romantically, and venerable devices like pages flying 
off a wall calendar to indicate the passage of time are lovingly employed. 
</P>
<P>
 But all this care is not enough to bring "Love Affair" to life. Beatty and 
Bening, though they do have their moments, mostly seem to be acting as opposed 
to inhabiting their parts, and Hepburn, gamely battling against the 
encroachments of age and disease, has a particularly tough time of it. Magic 
cannot be willed into existence, and despite everyone's best intentions, this 
film remains earthbound. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG-13, for "one use of strong language." Times guidelines: The 
word is used by Hepburn, of all people, but otherwise this is the most chaste 
of romances. 'Love Affair'

MOVIE REVIEWS; THERE'S AN ART TO ALLEN'S SHOTS AT 'BROADWAY' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The life of the theater has lots of life in Woody Allen's "Bullets Over 
Broadway." Set in the Prohibition '20s, it's a theatrical satire crossed with a 
gangster satire, and the joke is in how close the two realms really are. The 
onstage prima donnas and posturers and leches are as conniving and 
strong-arming as gangsters -- they just use barbs instead of bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 This collision of worlds comes about when the only backer for the Broadway 
production of a work by promising young playwright David Shayne (John Cusack) 
is mobster Nick Valenti (Joe Viterelli). The condition for the backing is that 
Nick's flouncy, aggressively untalented showgirl mistress, Olive (Jennifer 
Tilly), must be given a starring role. She ends up getting -- and mangling -- 
the role of the psychiatrist. (Allen is perhaps the world's best-known 
analysand. Is he dissing the profession here?) 
</P>
<P>
 David has perfected the somewhat emaciated Greenwich Village look of the 
"true" artist. (He also, as played by Cusack, acts and sounds suspiciously 
close to Woody Allen.) David quarrels with his producer (Jack Warden) about the 
indignity of casting Olive in order to rescue his show (which he also ends up 
directing). 
</P>
<P>
 When the dread decision is made, he wakes up screaming in the middle of the 
night and screams out the window, "I'm a whore." David is inflamed by 
compromise; he turns his selling out into high flamboyant drama. It's his worst 
-- and finest -- hour. David is a schnook with standards -- a blood-brother to 
the Coen brothers' Barton Fink, who also primped his principles (while also 
selling out). 
</P>
<P>
 David's girlfriend Ellen (Mary-Louise Parker) is bemused by his tortuousness. 
When the aging, Norma Desmond-like star Helen Sinclair (Dianne Wiest) is cast 
as the lead in his play, David's flailing about becomes ever more foolish. 
Helen plays on his vanity; he falls in love with her. She knows his play is a 
stinker, but she figures he can at least expand her role if she name-drops his 
heroes -- "Max Anderson, Gene O'Neill" -- often enough. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a wild card here. Olive's bodyguard, Cheech (very well played by 
Chazz Palminteri), sent by Nick to keep an eye on her during rehearsals, turns 
out to have better ideas on how to fix the play than the playwright. Without 
making a big fancy deal about it, "Bullets Over Broadway," co-written by 
Douglas McGrath, turns into a riff on the nature of artistry. David, with his 
haunted look and high-flown common-man sentiments, is the popular image of the 
Greenwich Village-style artist. But he's the artist as poseur. Cheech, the hit 
man who really comes from the streets, is the artist we don't recognize -- 
don't want to recognize. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen knows how shopworn satire of the theater can be, but he has come up with 
a dandy crew of scene-stealers. There's Tracey Ullman, as a superannuated 
ingenue hugging her Chihuahua, Jim Broadbent as the voluminous ex-matinee idol 
whose waistline expands in direct proportion to his anxieties, Tilly as the 
swacked showgirl -- she may be a bimbo, but, with her woozy wiles, and her 
nasally voice as loud as an air-raid siren, she's a bimbo of genius. All of 
these performers are "too much," but that's not a criticism. The only way they 
can play their roles is to overplay them -- that's the nature of high 
theatrical satire. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wiest is so gloriously over the top that she turns Helen into a sacred 
monster. She's the soul of theater -- she's Mistress Thespian. Whether she's 
cocooned in furs or glazed in makeup, Helen is a powerhouse of intimidation. 
David doesn't stand a chance with her; he's a speck on the windshield of her 
ego. Wiest doesn't try for pathos -- she's having too much fun for that. Every 
time you think she has gone too far in "Bullets Over Broadway," she redeems the 
foolery with her sozzled, spirited timing. She understands the royal pettiness, 
and the smarts, behind Helen's Great Lady act. Helen may be a big blur of 
narcissism, but she's great at sizing up weakness, including her own. That's 
why she goes after David so strenuously. Despite her self-proclaimed 
"legendary" status, she knows she needs a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 David, of course, is the most self-deluded character in the movie. By its end, 
he has his eyes opened. One of his cronies -- an obnoxious, unproduced 
playwright played by Rob Reiner -- tells him at one point that "an artist 
creates his own moral universe." The movie ends up being a kind of riposte to 
that gangsterish sentiment. (It's possible -- though not very productive -- to 
interpret the movie as Allen's apologia for his above-it-all public stance 
during the early stages of his famous troubles.) 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Allen surely regards himself as an artist. He wants us to know that 
artistry isn't all it's cracked up to be -- that it's better to be a decent 
human being and know your limitations and live a good life. But he also wants 
us to know he's enough of an artist to be able to humble himself in that way 
and still make a movie as good as "Bullets Over Broadway." So he has it both 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a neat hat trick.

MUSIC REVIEW; PACIFIC SYMPHONY SHOWS STRENGTH, VITALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrons of symphony concerts sometimes resent the inclusion on their programs 
of choral/ symphonic works, one reason being the secondary role the orchestra 
would seem to play in such works. 
</P>
<P>
 That putative reading is seldom true, of course. At the opening of the Pacific 
Symphony's 16th season Wednesday night at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center in Costa Mesa, two large-scale choral pieces, preceded by an 
instrumental overture, made up the program. But the orchestra, seated, 
naturally, center-stage, definitely dominated the aural horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening nights should always be this gratifying. Under music director Carl 
St.Clair, the agenda of Frank Ticheli's brand-new "Pacific Fanfare," James 
Hopkins' year-old "Songs of Eternity" and Mozart's Requiem, K. 626, emerged 
technically splendid and musically uplifting. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra played with a wondrous transparency throughout, and the Pacific 
Chorale, 116 strong on this occasion, sang with inspiration, with mellow tone 
and words forward and clarified. 
</P>
<P>
 St.Clair's detailed pacing of the Requiem defined its continuity expertly, 
giving the familiar work an unaccustomed glow and its Latin texts a fresh 
perspective. Always competent, conscientious and musically sensitive, the East 
Coast-trained conductor from Texas this time around added a spiritual dimension 
one has not always noticed in his work. There was authority and mastery in 
every aspect of this performance of the Requiem. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of Brian Matthews' bright, clear and resonant bass, the 
solo vocal quartet -- also including soprano Joyce Guyer, mezzo Phyllis 
Pancella and tenor David Hamilton -- proved serviceable but undistinctive. 
Prepared by John Alexander, the Pacific Chorale met its own high standards for 
blended tone and articulate singing. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioned originally by the Orange County Philharmonic Society, and first 
heard in April, 1993, on the Chorale's Costa Mesa series, Hopkins' "Songs" is a 
most touching, handsomely wrought setting of three Tagore poems. The composer 
wrote this delicate and autumnal music -- which recalls both Mahler and Brahms 
in its emotional directness -- in memory of David Lee Shanbrom, who died in a 
truck-trailer accident in 1986. This performance seemed to realize all the 
beauties, as well as the musical thrust, of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of the evening, St.Clair's conducting of the world premiere 
of Ticheli's "Pacific Fanfare," for woodwinds, antiphonal brass and percussion, 
started the season off in as upbeat a mode as one can imagine. Ticheli's 
imagination seems fervid, his compositional techniques firmly in place. In six 
compact minutes, the composer produces wake-up music that sounds at once novel 
and familiar, exciting and serious, optimistic and thoughtful.

MOVIE REVIEW; PSYCHIATRIST CAUGHT UP IN MURDER MYSTERY 'PASSION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe the third time Scott Bakula plays an L.A. psychiatrist will be the 
charm. He got knocked off early on in "Color of Money," and now in "A Passion 
to Kill," a relentlessly routine psychological murder mystery, he's done in by 
a lackluster script. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakula's Dr. David Lawson receives a double whammy when he meets the 
beautiful, regal Diana (Chelsea Field), the bride of his best friend Jerry 
Chamberlain (John Getz). On the one hand, Diana rapidly displays scary mood 
swings that leave her consumed with brief, perplexing outbursts of rage, and on 
the other, she attracts David profoundly. Despite the repeated warnings of a 
friendly colleague (France Nuyen), David allows himself to become swiftly 
ensnared in an affair with the woman he's suppsed to be unofficially counseling 
at the urgent request of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the corpses start piling up, and the question becomes simple: Is Diana a 
crazy woman going around knocking off every man who makes an unwelcome pass at 
her or is she being set up? Director Rick King keeps us guessing, but he can't 
keep us caring; David and Diana are too underwritten, too uninteresting, to 
involve us despite Bakula and Field's best efforts. There's no doubt that David 
is caught up in a grand passion, but that's no excuse for him and Diana to be 
such glum characters. The result is that Sheila Kelley, as David's 
ex-girlfriend, becomes the film's most sparkling presence. This is a sleek, 
painstaking production with great-looking stars and settings, but its Sunset 5 
engagement seems but a stopover on the way to the video store. 
</P>

MOVIE REVIEW; 'MASTERS' STRINGS UP SCI-FI FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You might be wondering what we need with another body snatchers movie when 
there's already been one official "Body Snatchers" remake released this year. 
But "Robert A. Heinlein's the Puppet Masters" -- based on a 1951 story by 
guess-who that predates even Jack Finney's literary mother of all pods -- is a 
kinder, gentler and more action-oriented sort of "B.S." It's perky paranoia. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a rumored alien infestation in a small Iowa town, a father-son team 
from a typical top-secret government organ -- Donald Sutherland and Eric Thal 
-- meet up with NASA exobiologist Julie Warner to go take a look-see. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a good joke early on, when Warner quickly determines the locals are no 
longer quite human by noticing that the menfolk don't try to look down her 
blouse. A shootout with the critter-controlled Iowans ensues -- "It's the kid 
from the spaceship! Get him off the car!" -- and these three high-tail it back 
to a state where the guys are more interested in drilling babes than drilling 
brains. 
</P>
<P>
 The army is sent in and, of course, legions of troops quickly fall to the 
shifty parasites, which attach themselves to human backs, send tentacles into 
the nervous system and instantly suck up the memory of their hosts. The alien 
advantage -- and, in the inevitable twist, their downfall -- is that they're 
60% brain tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 This movie doesn't suffer the same problem of excess gray matter. In its 
favor, "Puppet Masters" has a strong sense of its own silliness and doesn't 
play around with superfluities like subtext. The movie isn't dumbing down 
science-fiction so much as being spiritually faithful to pre-Communism, 
old-school sci-fi -- in which an invasion might not be such cause for political 
or spiritual Angst as for a team of brilliant scientists to exchange jocular 
banter or even smooches as they narrowly save the world via firearms and the 
best available medical research. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, after an agreeably hokey and halfway-fun first half, you keep waiting 
for the picture to take off into the goofy delirium it promises. That's about 
the mid-point where the unnecessarily long proceedings bog down in ill-edited 
shootouts and fisticuffs that take place largely in an underground "hive" set 
even Ed Wood might not have thought was great. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time, it's apparent that the best audience for "Puppet Masters" is an 
appreciative kid crowd (despite the R rating, which seems altogether too harsh 
for the relatively mild mayhem here), though boomers with inordinate fondness 
for Saturday matinees could find themselves fleetingly willing puppets of the 
nostalgia engendered in better moments. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: R, for violence, sci-fi gore and brief language. Times 
guidelines: It includes much gunplay, some gruesome creature effects, and one 
pointed use of profanity -- but still on the tame side of R. 'Robert A. 
Heinlein's the Puppet Masters'

MOVIE REVIEW; TWO AMUSING LOOKS AT LOVE AT NUART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 German filmmaker Katja von Garnier's effervescent, 55-minute "Makin' Up" and 
Louis Venosta's distinctive 35-minute "The Coriolis Effect" add up to an 
amusing commentary on the state of relations between men and women today. We 
most certainly are going to hear more from both Von Garnier and Venosta. 
</P>
<P>
 Von Garnier's vignette, which won a student film Oscar, is a witty farce about 
what even the most attractive and vibrant young women have to put up with in 
the search for suitable men. Maischa (Nina Kronjager), a blond cartoonist, has 
pretty much retreated from the fray, drawing inspiration for her comic strip 
from the romantic exploits of her vivacious best friend, a tall brunette nurse 
nicknamed Frenzy (Katja Riemann, who recalls Geena Davis in her looks and 
infectious giddiness). 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment Frenzy has set her sites on the handsome Rene (Gideon Burkhard), 
who on their first date asks her to bring along a friend for his best pal Mark 
(Max Tidof). Pressed into going, Maischa realizes immediately that she and Max 
have literally crossed paths before -- and not fortuitously. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing that develops can be said to be unpredictable, but Von Garnier manages 
to make every turn seem fresh and wryly funny. She's a sharp, stylish observer 
of the challenge modern women face in squaring away their freedom and 
independence with their attraction to the opposite sex and their longing for 
love. She has a sure way with both the camera and her cast, which sparkles 
under her direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of "The Coriolis Effect," which was named the best short film at 
Venice this year, are not as sophisticated as those of "Makin' Up," but Venosta 
is every bit as assured a director as Von Garnier.  
</P>
<P>
 Ray (Dana Ashbrook) and Stanley (James Wilder) are best friends, U.S. Weather 
Service scientists working in the Texas Panhandle and specializing in chasing 
tornadoes. Just as Ray's girlfriend (Corinne Bohrer) has admitted, in a burst 
of unwelcome honesty, that she's slept with Stanley, a tornado starts brewing.  
</P>
<P>
 In his film debut, Venosta manages to make turbulent emotions and weather echo 
each other without lots of heavy-handed symbolism or rigid symmetry. As Ray and 
Stanley begin working out the crisis in their friendship, they encounter the 
alluring and mysterious Ruby (Jennifer Rubin, always a radiant presence) who's 
a force of nature herself. 
</P>
<P>

nudity, but both focus on adult themes and situations.

ART REVIEW; MOCA PUTS 'FOCUS' ON ARTISTS' INSTALLATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM WILSON, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two artists virtually unknown hereabouts debut at the Museum of Contemporary 
Art. They manage to bring real feeling to the arcane mystifications of the 
genre. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of MOCA's ongoing "Focus" series of special installations, one marks 
British sculptor Richard Wilson's American debut, the other the first museum 
solo for San Diego-based artist Margaret Honda. The exhibitions were put 
together by curators Paul Schimmel and Elizabeth A.T. Smith, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's projects are part of the current citywide UK/LA '94 festival 
celebrating British arts. By happy coincidence, they seem to have some very 
oblique and funny things to say that relate directly to this town. His most 
impressive piece is "20:50," a re-creation of a work that has become Wilson's 
signature piece. Fusing with the architecture of Arata Isozaki's gallery, the 
work consists of a waist-high steel container filled to the brink with sump 
oil. A short, narrowing corridor leads into the room where visitors are 
surrounded on three sides with hundreds of gallons of gooey, odoriferous black 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all rather deliciously eerie. The place feels mysterious, as if Moses had 
parted a small black sea for your inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 The surface of the oil is dead calm. The gallery ceiling has been removed, 
exposing one of the museum's trademark glass pyramid skylights about 30 feet 
above. The oil mirrors everything in perfect detail. The illusion is so 
convincing, you no longer feel you are standing on the floor. Now you are on a 
cantilevered balcony looking down into an atrium. There's a queasy thrill about 
the experience, like riding one of those glass elevators in high-tech hotels 
where you feel dared to look down. But here when you do what you see is -- well 
-- up. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil was once the lodestone of this city's wealth. Wilson's piece is dramatized 
by a rigorously deadpan science-and-engineering style that will remind L.A. art 
buffs of their indigenous Light and Space art. His second piece, "Deep End," 
incorporates an even more familiar local icon, a swimming pool recalling David 
Hockey's Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The fiberglass turquoise pool shell is suspended upside-down at an angle from 
the ceiling, resting on its ladder. The shell is punctured by numerous 
porthole-sized apertures, making it appear like a piece of aquatic Swiss 
cheese. The holes are about large enough for a person's body to pass through. 
One of them sprouts a metal flue that goes all the way up through the skylight 
to daylight. It is placed in the pool about where a bathtub drain would be. 
There is a strong suggestion that the water that used to be in the pool drained 
upward. By extension if someone "fell into" this pool, the laws of gravity 
would have been suspended and the person could fly. Conceptually it's entirely 
consistent with the oil piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's brilliant exercises in perceptual dislocation make the topsy-turvy 
world of Lewis Carroll's Wonderland palpable. It places that world firmly here 
in Lotusland, a place famous for illusion, lack of gravity and never quite 
knowing which end is up. You don't, thank goodness, need a Ph.D to get the 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda's work initially looks like it might require the degree. It comes with a 
little booklet containing much verbiage about perception, autobiography and the 
juncture between language and form. The installation, titled "Recto Verso," is 
visually muddled. This is rarely a good sign. You see a ladder leaning against 
the wall. A long hinged aluminum bar zig-zags across the floor. Two identical, 
beautifully finished wooden boxes rest beyond, a gray metallic fabric issuing 
from their bottom edges. Vague suggestions of old carpenter's rulers and 
aluminum-foil dispensers are not enough to hang an idea on. 
</P>
<P>
 Most visitors will not even notice a text lettered so it wraps around the edge 
of the ceiling. It turns out to be a clinical account of an early medical 
procedure intended to cure a visual defect called strabismus, a condition in 
which a misalignment of the eyes causes the brain to receive two different 
visual messages. The artist suffered from strabismus as a child and the present 
work is supposed to, in part, have reference to its effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing this may give the viewer a sense of sympathy, but it does nothing to 
sort out the works' aesthetic or perceptual effects. This art seems concerned 
with extreme refinement and understatement. Nothing comes of that until you 
notice that the ladder rolls on a track as in a library. At each of its 
terminal ends there is a hole in the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiosity aroused, one climbs the ladder and finds the holes contain stashes 
of kids marbles. It's as magical as the moment in "To Kill a Mockingbird" when 
the children find treasure in a hollow tree. Wistful and reclusive, it goes 
some distance to redeem the work.

MOVIE REVIEW; THE REAL MYSTERY IN 'RADIOLAND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Radioland Murders" never lets up and never shuts up. It's wearying -- kind of 
like staring at a gasping hamster on an exercise wheel for two hours. The 
freneticism of this comedy-mystery is the work of highly talented people but 
there is a basic mistake at its core: The filmmakers think that a fast-paced 
movie must constantly be fast. They don't understand that a movie appears to 
move like a streak only when the pace is slowed from time to time. In 
"Radioland Murders," the illusion of nonstop speed is confused with its 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality in this movie is everywhere else in short supply. Set in 1939 in 
Chicago during the opening night of a new radio network, WBN, the film takes 
place almost entirely inside the studio as employees are lopped off one by one 
by a mysterious deep-voiced intruder who announces his murders over the air. 
The lead suspect is the show's head writer, Roger (Brian Benben), who is trying 
to win back his estranged wife, Penny (Mary Stuart Masterson), the station 
owner's secretary, while attempting to solve the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger is far more interested in whodunit than we are. Since the clues are as 
scattershot as everything else in this film, the entire murder mystery plot 
resembles a "Hellzapoppin" for the short-attention-span generation. The only 
consolation is that, as the fun-less, knockabout subplots pile up, they just as 
quickly disappear. If you don't like the way the movie is going, don't worry -- 
it will soon be going somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 In a larger sense, though, "Radioland Murders" is unvarying -- not since 
"1941" has there been a movie that so throttled you with its hyperactivity. 
(And "1941" at least had a few visual splendors.) The film begins like a 
faster-than-a-speeding-bullet trailer and after about a half hour, your worst 
fears begin to take hold -- the whole movie is going to be this way. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast is so talented that you keep waiting for the talent to kick in. But 
the script by Willard Huyck, Gloria Katz, Jeff Reno and Ron Osborn doesn't 
allow for what the actors can do; the effect is like listening to a beautifully 
sung song played at chattering chipmunk speed. Besides Masterson and Benben, 
whose first (and hopefully not last) starring movie role this is, Ned Beatty, 
Anita Morris, Michael Lerner and Stephen Tobolowsky turn up. A few of them make 
tiny, tart impressions. George Burns has a cameo as a stand-up comic -- he's 
still a gas -- and Christopher Lloyd, as the sound effects man, is in his best 
wild-man mode. Michael McKean, as the orchestra conductor, has a 
transported-by-his-own-ego grin that's a real goof. 
</P>
<P>
 The period re-creation is in the shiny-ersatz style, and the director Mel 
Smith (who made the great, underrated "Tall Guy" with Jeff Goldblum) reaches 
for a hefty nostalgia. But he doesn't have much of a feel for American pop 
Golden Age stuff. "Radioland Murders" isn't cynical -- maybe it would be better 
if it was. Instead, it's just a squawking yesteryear contraption. It feels a 
lot longer than its 112 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: PG, for mild language, some farcical violence and brief nudity. 
Times guidelines: It includes killing by laughing gas and a man clinging to a 
skyscraper's ledge.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; CHILI PEPPERS, BUDDY GUY IN SOLID OUTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rolling Stones' "Voodoo Lounge" spectacular rolled into the Rose Bowl on 
Wednesday with a generous, age-defying celebration of the band's music. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd was there for the main event, but the bill also featured Chicago 
bluesman Buddy Guy and L.A. funk-rockers the Red Hot Chili Peppers, both of 
whom added propulsive energy and solid music to the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Guy seemed to enjoy the opportunity to crank his slashing guitar lines through 
the Bowl's sizable sound system. Backed by guitar, bass and drums, he worked 
his way through blues that often began sweet and turned explosive when he cut 
loose. He played intensely -- though mostly for a crowd that was still finding 
its seats -- and ended his short set with a ripping version of "Knock on Wood." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chili Peppers took the stage in a fetching mix of skirts, underwear and 
ponchos, and quickly kicked into the forceful groove of "Give It Away." "Suck 
My Kiss" and some new material were also strong, and a couple of funk jams were 
as compelling as the songs proper. Bassist Flea spoke up to urge a no vote on 
Proposition 187. When the band pulled together on a frenzied version of Stevie 
Wonder's "Higher Ground," the excitement was infectious.  
</P>
<P>
 The Stones, whose San Diego concert was reviewed here Wednesday, didn't simply 
play their songs -- they prodded, poked, teased and toyed with their songs. 
Mick Jagger croaked out his seductions, Keith Richards tossed in a signature 
lick here and there, Charlie Watts held down the beat behind the tiniest of 
drum sets, and it was consummate rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Rolling Stones, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Buddy Guy play tonight at 7 at 
the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, $55. (818) 577-3100. CHUCK CRISAFULLI

JAZZ REVIEW; BERNHARDT AT THE BAKERY: THE JAZZMAN AS INTELLECTUAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Warren Bernhardt ran smack into a perennial problem at the Jazz Bakery 
Wednesday night: getting a Los Angeles audience to turn out for a relatively 
unheralded East Coast musician. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the New York-based pianist has a ton of jazz and pop credits, 
including a recent tour with Steely Dan, his local jazz visibility has been 
minimal, a fact reflected in the small turnout for his opening performance. And 
that's a shame, because Bernhardt, although a far cry from the more typically 
hard-swinging New York jazzer, is always a fascinating player to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking a bit like a refugee from a seminary, dressed completely in black, 
with flowing white hair and silver-rimmed eyeglasses, Bernhardt was -- both 
visually and musically -- the epitome of the jazzman as intellectual. Deeply 
influenced by Bill Evans, his soloing emphasized rich harmonic densities 
juxtaposed against brisk, right hand runs. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the Evans trio style, bassist Jay Anderson played the role of equal 
melodic partner, stretching out in extended solos and moving freely through 
Bernhardt's chording, while drummer Jeff Hirshfield added understated 
percussion accents. Standards such as "How Deep Is the Ocean," Evans' own "Time 
Remembered" and George Young's lovely "October" were explored via complex 
timbral meanderings and a constant interplay among all three instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 There was one problem, however. Unlike Evans, the Bernhardt group never quite 
managed to generate much forward propulsion. Engaging though it may have been 
as a kind of abstract exercise in improvisational symbiosis, the trio's music 
would have been considerably more appealing had its cerebral qualities been 
balanced with a stronger dose of sheer rhythmic swing. Even so, this is a group 
that deserves a hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Warren Bernhardt Trio at the Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave., Culver City. 
(310) 271-9039. $20 entrance charge. The Bernhardt trio plays two sets each 
night, 8:30 and 10:30, through Saturday. DON HECKMAN

RESTAURANT REVIEW; PATINETTE: REALITY BEGINS TO TAKE HOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Joachim Splichal's Patinette first opened at MOCA two months ago, a 
marvelous gloss of high quality seemed to sparkle over everything; there were 
cloth napkins, ceramic demitasses, a highly civilized, European ambience. 
Rarely has fast food looked so appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Already in its short life, Patinette's menu has been revamped, the prices 
raised a bit, some portions cut. Appetizers, which once appeared at the top of 
the menu, have been eliminated or absorbed into the list of deli salads, 
perhaps to streamline ordering. Marinated goat cheese, a huge beautiful disc 
fished from a great jar of golden green olive oil, once sated four people; it 
was the sort of thing that hung shimmering in your mind, pulled you from your 
desk job and led you like a zombie through the city to its source. Today, far 
smaller discs cut straight from the roll of cheese, are set out on a plate, 
lightly drizzled with oil, served with a roasted tomato, a sprig of rosemary, 
one teeny, pitted olive. It's still good, but not irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 Asparagus spears, blanched a deep green, are paired with the muted purple of 
grilled red onions. Marinated roasted oyster and cap mushrooms are as 
full-bodied as meat. A "Feta-terranean" salad is a Greek salad aerated with 
crisp spears of romaine. Still, Splichal's deli case food does not escape the 
pitfalls of deli case food in general: Some days, the salads can seem limp and 
redolent of stray flavors. Especially susceptible are pasta salads made with 
thick, undercooked, gummy imported pastas, like the pennini with shrimp or a 
hand-rolled tube with vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Soups are excellent -- I'm especially fond of the gazpacho, a cool, pureed 
soup with deep tomato power and a dollop of Patina's fruity house olive oil. 
Best of all are sandwiches. Grilled scallions infuse moist roast chicken on 
firm-crumbed country white bread. Lamb, medium rare and tender, is paired with 
dense, sweet oven-roasted tomatoes on sturdy rosemary focaccia and served with 
a terrific, deep green salad of haricot verts and arugula. 
</P>
<P>
 The cafe's initial gloss, however, has dulled; the first burst of ambition and 
enthusiasm tempered, perhaps, by reality: Despite a cultured clientele, 
Patinette is, after all, only a small, moderately priced art museum cafeteria. 
Still, if you're downtown and hungry, it's a lovely spot to eat and 
people-watch. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordering process needs still more streamlining. If you want more than a 
salad and a drink, it can be downright stressful. Some foods are dished up on 
the spot, some require heating or assembly, others are made in the kitchen and 
brought to the table. If it's at all busy, servers won't keep a running tab, 
which means you either have to order all at once or keep returning to the line. 
If you're ordering for more than one person, the confusion mounts. Each visit, 
by the time we have our food and scored a table, my friends and I have 
collapsed into our chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few tables indoors, but with the sun beating in through the plate 
glass wall and the long lines, it's not exactly a place to relax. Of course, 
outside at noon, the small, sunken plaza, with its red rock walls, is a hot 
box, too. Plastic chairs cluster under canvas umbrellas and shade is at a 
premium.  
</P>
<P>
 The best bet is a later lunch, after the sun has passed its zenith. It's 
quieter and there is less hassle to order. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, Patinette will deliver with an hour's notice and a minimum order of $20. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Patinette has some very nice touches -- and some odd economies. 
Silverware is heavy, out-sized silver plate, a luxury. But coffee comes in 
cardboard cups, which is fine for some brews, but by the time a cardboard 
demitasse of espresso reaches the table outside, it's tepid as tap water.  
</P>
<P>
 One thing has improved since Patinette's first week: The lemon tart, once 
impossible to cut, now has a crumbly, buttery crust. Also recommended: the 
chocolate crunch cake, whose crunch is cunningly located in the thinnest web of 
crispy cake beneath a killer chocolate mousse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Patinette at MOCA, 250 S. Grand Ave . , Los Angeles . (213) 626-1178. Open 
Tuesday through Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Thursday until 8 p.m. Beer

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: A HIDEAWAY FOR FRANCOPHILES WHO WOULD BE TRES SVELTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. IRENE VIRBILA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Score one for the French! Not that they're going to catch up with the Italians 
anytime soon. Jean Francois Meteigner, last seen cooking at the casual 
celebrity-packed Cicada in West Hollywood, has just entered the game with La 
Cachette (the Hideaway) specializing in what a flyer describes as "Jean 
Francois' Famous Light and Delicious French Food." 
</P>
<P>
 The former l'Orangerie chef wants to dispel the idea that French restaurants 
are expensive and fattening. Mais non, only one entree here hits the $20 mark. 
And butter and cream? Pas de tout. Liza Utter, Meteigner's svelte partner, who 
presumably has been eating lots of his cooking, is advertisement enough. Making 
the rounds of the tables, she points out that Meteigner's latest appetizer, 
Provencal tart with tapenade, basil, organic tomatoes and garlic -- and 
parsley-infused olive oil, is very light. That the warm Maine lobster salad 
with haricots verts and asparagus has only a whisper of white truffle oil 
dressing. And that Meteigner uses mainly jus instead of rich sauces. 
</P>
<P>
 For die-hard French foodies who are not watching every calorie, Meteigner 
proposes duck cassoulet or bona-fide mashed potatoes. But when it comes to 
dessert, the menu treads carefully: Chocolate mousse and the caramelized apple 
tart are both served with "whipped cream on the side." 
</P>
<P>
 * La Cachette, 10506 Little Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles. (310) 470-4992. 
Open for dinner daily; lunch Tuesday through Friday. Valet parking. All major 
credit cards accepted. Appetizers $4.50-$8; entrees $12-$20. S. IRENE VIRBILA

THEATER BEAT: 'SONNYVILLE': A PASSIONATE ADAPTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the moment we enter the Lex Theatre, redolent of incense and twinkling 
with fairy lights strung in the trees of Garman Noah's wonderfully ramshackle 
set, we are seduced into a desultory daydream that is alternately turbulent and 
torpid, gently humorous and rantingly melodramatic. We are in "Sonnyville," the 
Actors Conservatory Ensemble's loose adaptation of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya," 
updated and set in a failing Mendocino winery. 
</P>
<P>
 The writer and director of the piece, Mark Haining, who recently directed both 
"Uncle Vanya" and "The Three Sisters" at ACE, knows his way around Chekhov, 
circuitously speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Chekhov's, Haining's characters drift in a purposeless void, yet their 
every action is informed by an undercurrent of throbbing sensuality that 
vitalizes them. A melange of eccentrics, the characters range from 
unreconstructed hippies to visionary New Agers to modern-day philistines. 
Eventually, the sexual crosscurrents among them reach flood stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Haining's rambling, self-indulgent adaptation is risky, but his actors, 
himself included, are so committed to the work that they mostly pull it off. 
Keenly nostalgic, the play is reminiscent of students huddled about a dorm room 
ranting about life and the universe until the wee hours. Although we may lose 
our way in the discourse, we admire the passion behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Sonnyville," Lex Theatre, 6760 Lexington Ave., Hollywood. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. Ends Oct. 30. $15. (213) 463-6244.

THEATER BEAT: 'HULA HOOP' MOVES IN RIGHT DIRECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So what's not to like about "Hula Hoop Sha-Boop," the toe-tapping musical at 
the Tamarind in which a high-energy cast sings and dances to pop music of the 
mid-'50s to early '60s? The narrative that hinges the show together may be 
slight, but the music is boppin' and the mood strictly escapist. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Larry Deckel, who co-wrote the musical with John Leicht and John 
Tanner, this revisionist romp down memory lane concentrates on the most common 
denominators of the period's youth culture -- fast cars, dating, vintage dance 
crazes, and, of course, the Hula-Hoop, symbol of a generation just getting into 
the pelvic-grinding rhythms of rock 'n' roll.A born pelvis-grinder, the 
rebellious, black-leather-clad Johnny (Robert Gant) wants to score with fast 
and flashy Suzie (Jill Salmon). Johnny's nerdy pal Paul (Richard Israel), on 
the other hand, discreetly and sweetly covets the virginal Paula (Jean Gunn). 
These antithetical couples may approach romance from different angles, but 
their paths converge at the altar. 
</P>
<P>
 The tone becomes barbed during "Duck and Cover," an actual jingle of the time 
advising children what to do in the event of an atomic explosion. However, for 
the most part, McCarthyism, the Cold War and the threat of nuclear annihilation 
are distant murmurings, only dimly heard above the din of the malt shop 
Wurlitzer. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's coda, which alludes to the Kennedy assassination and the Vietnam 
War, seems tacked on, an obligatory paean to the end of an era. Whatever its 
structural shortcomings, "Hula Hoop Sha-Boop" is an engaging entertainment, 
with juggernaut choreography by Nathan Prevost and Lynn Brilhante and an 
infectiously perky cast. 
</P>

THEATER BEAT: 'PANTS ON FIRE': A SMOTHERED ATTEMPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If Madame Bovary were living today in a big American city, she might resemble 
the heroine of "Pants on Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Writer-performer Jane Brucker's seriocomic one-woman play concerns a 
30-something New York artist (Brucker) who has an affair with one of her male 
models after years of stultifying marriage.The show runs in the Met Theatre's 
downstairs space, formerly the sometime home of the old Los Angeles Actors' 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruefully noting that she had always wanted to be buried next to her husband, 
Brucker's protagonist catches herself: "What am I talking about? I've been 
buried next to him for the last couple of years." 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the wistful-bitter tone of "Pants on Fire," which is sporadically 
funny and touching but seems to deliver far less than it promises. 
</P>
<P>
 A superb mimic, Brucker here imagines a series of amusing encounters between 
her heroine and a gallery of daft characters: a snooty English woman, a 
fortuneteller and a pornographic model. Director Anne Beatts, a one-time writer 
for TV's "Saturday Night Live," may have helped mine the comic potential from 
these bits, even if their connection to the rest of the plot seems a little 
stretched. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Brucker doesn't expose enough of her character's psyche to win our 
sympathy or offer the crucial insights that would elevate the show beyond the 
level of a somewhat superficial monologue. Particularly disconcerting is this 
self-absorbed protagonist's lack of concern for how risking her marriage might 
affect her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end, the viewer is convinced that Brucker's heroine needs either a good 
therapist or a good divorce lawyer. The play, meanwhile, could stand a good 
rewrite. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Pants on Fire," Met Theatre, 1089 Oxford Ave., Hollywood.

THEATER BEAT: 'MR. SLOANE' COULD BE MORE ENTERTAINING

 "Entertaining Mr. Sloane" is Joe Orton's outrageously lewd parody of a stuffy 
British drawing-room comedy. But the current revival at the World Theatre in 
Hollywood has some elements of mystery, too.The viewer wonders why something 
that reads so funny on paper isn't funnier onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some clues: Under Milton Justice's halting direction, the show moves 
at a fitful pace, never really kicking into high gear until late in the second 
act. A promising cast, meanwhile, ultimately disappoints by giving the most 
obvious readings of these deceptively textured parts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the title role, David Hamilton somewhat overplays the young man's wide-eyed 
innocence, while Bonnie McNeil's horny middle-aged matron Kat relies too 
heavily on quick gestures, such as licking her lips to indicate lasciviousness. 
Tim McNeil, however, is scarily (and hilariously) cadaverous as Kat's decrepit 
father, and David Meyer as brother Ed lends the right air of hypocritical 
dignity to the proceedings.

THEATER BEAT: 'SISTER MARY IGNATIUS' IS SATISFYINGLY SILLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A some-odd-decade ago, Christopher Durang's "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It 
All for You" was banned in St. Louis, that great Catholic bastion of the 
Midwest, resulting in a media outcry and earnest editorials about censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Today it's hard to understand what all the fuss was about.The character of 
Sister Mary (Diana Bellamy) is still hilariously horrifying, but in light of 
recent scandals concerning pedophilic priests, Durang's nun seems more quaint 
than genuinely shocking. 
</P>
<P>
 Geo Hartley, who has directed the current production at his own Theatre Geo, 
displays the fine sense of the ridiculous requisite in the staging of Durang 
but fails to hone the play to a cutting edge. Played strictly for laughs, the 
production may not succeed as the anti-dogmatist tract Durang intended, but it 
is satisfyingly silly. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious ramifications aside, this is essentially a showcase for Bellamy, who 
plays the lovable, hateable, mind-bogglingly intolerant nun of Durang's piece. 
When Bellamy is good, she is very, very good -- when she's not going up on her 
lines, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening's opener "The Actor's Nightmare," a hapless accountant (Philip 
Abrams) gets trapped onstage in an ever-mutating production that shifts 
dizzyingly from one theatrical style to another. This companion piece to 
"Sister Mary" is also played strictly for laughs -- but then, unlike "Sister 
Mary," it's supposed to be. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You" and "The Actor's Nightmare," 
Theatre Geo, 1229 N. Highland Ave., Los Angeles. Sundays only at 7 p.m. Ends

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; WOOD'S FILMS FINDING NEW LIFE ON VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the recent release of Tim Burton's film "Ed Wood," a celebration of the 
director of '50s B-horror flicks, video store owners have been showcasing his 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Called by some critics one of the year's best movies, "Ed Wood" is spurring 
some fans to sample Wood's films for the first time. And with Halloween just 
around the corner, these movies will get even more attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't make the mistake for renting any of Wood's movies looking for a good 
scare. What you'll get instead is a good laugh. The scripts and acting are 
amusingly bad and the tacky special effects are a laugh riot. These cheapie 
flicks have been interpreted as parodies of the genre by a director with a 
perverse vision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plan 9 From Outer Space" (1959, Rhino). The aliens' plan to take over Earth 
includes grave-robbing -- from a cemetery in the San Fernando Valley, no less. 
The movie is famous for the flying saucers that are merely plates propelled by 
string. The famed horror star Bela Lugosi died while the film was being made 
and was replaced by an actor -- face hidden by a cape -- who only marginally 
resembles him. You really have to see this to believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bride of the Monster" (1955, Video Home Library). Lugosi plays a mad 
scientist who tries to create a super race with a ray machine. In some ways 
it's funnier than "Plan 9" -- particularly the special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Revenge of the Dead" (1960, LIVE). In this sequel to "Bride," a bogus mystic 
(Kenne Duncan) accidentally revives the dead, leading to a rampage by ghouls. 
The narration by Criswell, a well-known psychic back in the '50s, is hilarious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jail Bait" (1954, Rhino). The story of this thriller has nothing to do with 
the title. It's really about a crook who gets a face lift. There aren't many 
thrills, but there are a lot of laughs. It's worth seeing just to catch Steve 
Reeves, famed for portraying Hercules, playing -- very badly -- a cop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Glen or Glenda" (1953, Video Yesteryear). Wood actually stars, under the name 
Daniel Davis, in this homage to transvestism. He plays Glen, a secret 
cross-dresser who yearns to come out of the closet. The strangest part of one 
of the strangest movies ever made is Lugosi's narration. For reasons known only 
to Wood, he does it from a haunted house. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want a closer look at this bizarre director, Rhino has just put out a 
documentary, at $20, called "Ed Wood . . . Look Back in Angora." It includes 
fascinating footage of Wood and Lugosi and a revealing commentary by Wood's 
widow, Kathy. 
</P>
<P>
 Halloween Videos 
</P>
<P>
 Low-budget horror movies such as Wood's are staples of the Halloween season. 
Here are three that are new to video: 
</P>
<P>
 "Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead" (MCA/Universal). Fifteen years after 
directing the original, Don Cosarelli returns with a film that's just as 
gruesome, nightmarish and barely coherent as the first two, featuring a 
colorful villain -- the Tall Man (Angus Scrimm) -- and those skull-piercing 
chrome balls. Mainly for fans of the first two. 
</P>
<P>
 "Puppet Master 5" (Paramount). The killer dolls in this B-horror series are 
heroes this time, tackling a villain from another dimension. Quirky, 
off-the-wall touches make it a delight for series fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cronos" (Vidmark). In this Spanish movie, an antique dealer nicked by a gold 
scarab turns into a vampire. It takes some weird twists but features some 
genuinely scary scenes. Available dubbed and subtitled. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Interest 
</P>
<P>
 There aren't many good instructional card-playing videos around, but the 
half-hour "Winning at Casino Blackjack" is certainly one of the better ones. 
The information is presented in an easy-to-understand manner, constantly making 
the point that a knowledge of rules and strategies enhances chances of winning. 
Good for beginners or occasional players. From Strategic Play Productions at 
$20; (513) 984-0433. 
</P>
<P>
 An excellent way to learn to tap dance, say some veteran tap enthusiasts, is 
watching "Tap With Ginger" -- Reilly, not Rogers. The first volume, for 
beginners, effectively lays out the basics and makes learning rudimentary 
routines relatively simple. Intermediate and advanced programs available. From 
Step by Step, at $20; (800) 531-1320. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents convinced that their children are ideal for commercials should find a 
lot of useful tips in the 45-minute "Kids in the TV Commercial Biz." It 
features Vernee Waston Johnson, who's appeared in more than 200 commercials. 
From Wizards Production Group, at $20; (800) 500-2567. 
</P>
<P>
 What's New on Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Clean Slate" (MGM/UA). Flimsy farce -- funny in spots but hardly a laugh 
fest. Dana Carvey stars as a detective who loses his memory whenever he falls 
asleep. When Carvey is not doing impressions, he's very bland.  
</P>
<P>
 "Crooklyn" (MCA/Universal). Although directed and co-written by Spike Lee, 
this is nothing like his usual controversial movies. Set in '70s Brooklyn, it's 
a fairly engaging, rather low-key comedy/drama, about the trials of a big, 
poor, constantly bickering black family. Mostly told from the point of view of 
a 10-year-old girl, well played by Zelda Harris, it's like a good TV sitcom.  
</P>
<P>
 "No Escape" (HBO). A convict (Ray Liotta) is dedicated to escaping from an 
escape-proof prison on a jungle island in 2022, but he gets caught in the 
middle of a bloody battle between the island's two factions. Simplistic script, 
slow pace but some great action sequences.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Inkwell" (Touchstone). The coming of age of a nerdish black teen-ager 
(Larenz Tate) during a summer visit to Martha's Vineyard, Mass., in the 
mid-'70s. Could have been a lively, acerbic examination of that era's black 
culture but 22-year-old director Matty Rich, so promising on "Straight Outta 
Brooklyn," opts for cliches and corny theatrics.

THEATER REVIEW; A PRETTY 'ITALIAN STRAW HAT' IS REAL EYEFUL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "An Italian Straw Hat," the zany 19th-Century French farce by Eugene M. 
Labiche, over the years has been remade into an operetta, a movie, even several 
stage adaptations. Yet the language of this warhorse probably has never looked 
as good as in the winning new tour by the National Theatre of the Deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 The story -- a silly bit of business about a bridegroom who struggles to make 
amends after his horse eats a lady's hat -- has enough twists and turns to tax 
any company. Yet director-adapter Kenneth Albers has found bold ways to mix 
spoken and signed words, reaping humor and visual invention from what might 
have been a mannered, burdensome device. 
</P>
<P>
 The breakneck pacing demanded by farce sometimes overwhelms even this 
incredibly well-rehearsed cast. But for the most part, Albers' "Straw Hat" is 
still a treat for the eyes and, yes, ears. 
</P>
<P>
 A reviewer can only imagine how a person without hearing perceives the show 
(which played over the weekend at Occidental College and stops tonight and 
Friday in Rolling Hills Estates, Saturday in San Diego and Sunday at Orange 
Coast College in Costa Mesa). Many audience members at Occidental's Keck 
Theater signed their applause by raising their arms in the air and waving their 
fingers like so many rows of wheat. 
</P>
<P>
 The production has special charm for a viewer who can hear. Victor Becker's 
fairy-tale set is dominated by a miniature replica of the Eiffel Tower, which 
serves as the perch for Maestro (Ira Mitchell), a one-man synthesizer-and-drum 
band of director Albers' ingenious devise. Mitchell sails through the 
near-impossible job of providing music, sound effects and certain character 
voices during virtually every scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Maestro, along with the valet Felix (Brian K. Jennings), serves as the show's 
link to the aural world. Albers wittily drives home the point when Felix 
declines to step in and help a character with a broken leg, explaining, "Sorry, 
Frank, I'm just your voice." (Amazingly, this same character seems to have been 
given a French accent -- in sign language.) 
</P>
<P>
 The sonic accompaniment just adds another rich layer to the show, which in its 
expressive movement and demonstrative acting reminds one of the silent films of 
Chaplin or Keaton. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the rich hero Fadinard, Robert DeMayo betrays his training as a mime with a 
beautifully acrobatic performance. His eyes alone say more than most actors' 
entire bodies. Meanwhile, Anthony Natale steals his scenes as Achille, a fey 
poser in a blond wig. 
</P>
<P>
 General audiences may be tempted to shun a work like this one because of the 
company's name. But notice that it's a troupe of the deaf, not exclusively for 
the deaf. Anyone with an abiding interest in theater should see what the group 
has to say. 
</P>
<P>
 * "An Italian Straw Hat," Friday at Norris Theatre, Rolling Hills Estates, 
(310) 544-0403; Saturday at UC San Diego, (619) 534-6467, and Sunday at Orange 
Coast College in Costa Mesa, (714) 432-5880. Running time: 2 hours, 5 minutes.

MUSIC REVIEW; UNRUFFLED MASTERY FROM GUARNERI QUARTET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The comparison is inevitable and irresistible: On Wednesday, as the Rolling 
Stones were packing in the mega-thousands at the Rose Bowl, just down the road 
in Pasadena, Ambassador Auditorium was packing 'em in for a rather different 
attraction, a concert by the Guarneri String Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, the numbers may not have been quite the same, but either way it was a 
sellout for groups who have been doing their remarkable thing for three decades 
with undiminished skill. 
</P>
<P>
 In as imaginative a program as any mainstream chamber ensemble has presented 
here in years, the Guarneri, whose personnel -- violinists Arnold Steinhardt 
and John Dalley, violist Michael Tree, cellist David Soyer -- has been constant 
since its inception, rewarded their hearers with the lushness of tone, 
immaculate balances and unruffled mastery that have marked the group's best 
work throughout its existence. For slashing attacks, urban tensions and the 
latest musicological research, look elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The program began with a rarity, the sunny, but with passing clouds, E-flat 
Quartet of the precocious Juan Arriaga, born in 1806 and destined not to 
survive his teens. The Guarneri played it with beguiling charm and airborne 
grace. 
</P>
<P>
 The dark, throbbing heart of the program was the other and less frequently 
encountered of Leos Janacek's two stunning quartets, the one written in 1923 
and subtitled "The Kreutzer Sonata," after Tolstoy's short story. 
</P>
<P>
 The work's 18 unremittingly inspired minutes, with their incisive pauses, 
craggy rhythms and brief, achingly lyrical phrases, were delivered on this 
occasion with tremendous vitality and with the sort of sonic bloom rarely 
accorded this music by performers more intent on illuminating its "modernity." 
</P>
<P>
 Mendelssohn trying to be Beethoven is a losing battle, but when played with as 
much conviction -- some ensemble miscues and intonational lapses in the opening 
movement aside -- as by the Guarneri, even Mendelssohn's E-flat Quartet, Opus 
44, No. 3, takes on considerable allure.  
</P>
<P>
 But for the ultimate in refinement -- vintage Guarneri magic, if you will -- 
one had to wait for the encore: as glowing, glamorous and lush a performance of 
the moonstruck slow movement from Debussy's Quartet as this listener can 
recall, even from the Guarneri String Quartet. HERBERT GLASS

MUSIC REVIEW; PACIFIC SYMPHONY SHOWS STRENGTH, VITALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrons of symphony concerts sometimes resent the inclusion on their programs 
of choral/ symphonic works, one reason being the secondary role the orchestra 
would seem to play in such works. 
</P>
<P>
 That putative reading is seldom true, of course. At the opening of the Pacific 
Symphony's 16th season Wednesday night at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center in Costa Mesa, two large-scale choral pieces, preceded by an 
instrumental overture, made up the program. But the orchestra, seated, 
naturally, center-stage, definitely dominated the aural horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening nights should always be this gratifying. Under music director Carl 
St.Clair, the agenda of Frank Ticheli's brand-new "Pacific Fanfare," James 
Hopkins' year-old "Songs of Eternity" and Mozart's Requiem, K. 626, emerged 
technically splendid and musically uplifting. 
</P>
<P>
 The orchestra played with a wondrous transparency throughout, and the Pacific 
Chorale, 116 strong on this occasion, sang with inspiration, with mellow tone 
and words forward and clarified. 
</P>
<P>
 St.Clair's detailed pacing of the Requiem defined its continuity expertly, 
giving the familiar work an unaccustomed glow and its Latin texts a fresh 
perspective. Always competent, conscientious and musically sensitive, the East 
Coast-trained conductor from Texas this time around added a spiritual dimension 
one has not always noticed in his work. There was authority and mastery in 
every aspect of this performance of the Requiem. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of Brian Matthews' bright, clear and resonant bass, the 
solo vocal quartet -- also including soprano Joyce Guyer, mezzo Phyllis 
Pancella and tenor David Hamilton -- proved serviceable but undistinctive. 
Prepared by John Alexander, the Pacific Chorale met its own high standards for 
blended tone and articulate singing. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioned originally by the Orange County Philharmonic Society, and first 
heard in April, 1993, on the Chorale's Costa Mesa series, Hopkins' "Songs" is a 
most touching, handsomely wrought setting of three Tagore poems. The composer 
wrote this delicate and autumnal music -- which recalls both Mahler and Brahms 
in its emotional directness -- in memory of David Lee Shanbrom, who died in a 
truck-trailer accident in 1986. This performance seemed to realize all the 
beauties, as well as the musical thrust, of the work. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning of the evening, St.Clair's conducting of the world premiere 
of Ticheli's "Pacific Fanfare," for woodwinds, antiphonal brass and percussion, 
started the season off in as upbeat a mode as one can imagine. Ticheli's 
imagination seems fervid, his compositional techniques firmly in place. In six 
compact minutes, the composer produces wake-up music that sounds at once novel 
and familiar, exciting and serious, optimistic and thoughtful.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SMILE: HEAVY ON ATTITUDE, BUT FUZZY ON INTENTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

 *** Smile "Maquee" Cargo/Headhunter  
</P>
<P>
 Ratings range from * (poor) to **** (excellent). Three stars denote a solid 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with the puzzling album title, there's something slippery about this 
trio from Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Smile appropriates such commercially proven '90s techniques as grunge 
heaviness, Sonic Youth-style guitar clangor and dissonance, and the 
juxtaposition of pop melody against an abrasive, punk-inspired sonic backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, its lyrics view youth-cultural trends with a jaundiced eye, 
notably in the sourpussed "Rock Anthem for the Retarded Teenage Hipster 
Population." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than take hope in the prospect of playing music to public acclaim, 
Smile singer-guitarist Mike Rosas looks at a downside in which success will 
only leave him subject to betrayal and backbiting. 
</P>
<P>
 In a more innocent era, Bruce Springsteen could stand at the brink of stardom 
and exult, in mid-song, "the record company, Rosie, just gave me a big 
advance!" Smile embarks on its career in a more jaded time, musing gloomily in 
"Papaya Clearance Sale" about the costs of an acclaim it isn't sure will be 
worth having: 
</P>
<P>
 So just remember, you'll be hated in this town  
</P>
<P>
 When everybody everywhere thinks you're the greatest thing around.  
</P>
<P>
 Smile begins the album by announcing, in "Rock Anthem," "Before we start I'd 
like to say that we're all done" -- an opening gambit that echoes (as Rosas' 
chesty voice occasionally does) the tone of Agent Orange singer Mike Palm on 
the excellent "Living in Darkness," a similarly defeatist album from 1981. 
Against a woozy groove akin to the Breeders' hit "Cannonball," Smile decides, 
in "Until(?)", to move ahead warily with its rock career: 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Spotlight, shine your light down, down on my town.  
</P>
<P>
 As long as your light won't make me uptight, I guess it's all right.  
</P>
<P>
 With attitudes like those, it's hard to know when to trust Smile's intentions. 
The slow, heavily tromping "Staring at the Sun" lumbers down the middle of the 
stardom-bound path that the band elsewhere professes to shun. With 
made-to-order trippy, oblique lyrics, it sounds like something Stone Temple 
Pilots stole from Led Zeppelin. Is it a parody? If so, it's done 
straightforwardly, with no overt giveaway. Maybe Smile really wants a hit, 
after all. Or maybe it just wants to show how easy it is to succumb to hit 
formulas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lemonade" is a grunge-pop confection that might be an earnest bid for a hit 
about troubled romance -- after all, Rosas sings it with the full-on, anguished 
ardor of a Bob Mould. But what to make of (deliberately?) smarmy, comically 
absurd lyrics like: 
</P>
<P>
 Although it seemed we'd be together long as sun and moon and earth were in the 
sky,  
</P>
<P>
 Goodnight, my star, you'll always be as lemonade inside my heart.  
</P>
<P>
 Again, one is left wondering whether it's a sincere effort, or a '90s heir to 
"Elenore," the nugget that the Turtles recorded in 1968 as a parody of cliched 
pop love songs, only to wind up with a big hit from a public that heard only 
the enticing harmonies and hooks and never got the joking send-up. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes "Maquee" a frequently bracing album is Smile's sincere interest in 
revving up a bracing and adventurous sound. Drummer Scott Reeder's beats are 
propulsive but slightly off-balance, slipping in accents where you wouldn't 
expect them to fall.  
</P>
<P>
 With the help of producer/engineers Eric Garten and Geoff Harrington (both of 
Orange County), the guitar and bass have commanding presence and slicing 
intensity -- witness the nasty, Lennonesque guitar break at the end of "She." 
The band takes a surprising dip into the art-rock pond with "Pictures Made 
Past," a spacey ballad that applies the fractured guitar sonics of a Robert 
Fripp or Fred Frith to a song that wafts along dreamily like the Beatles' "Sun 
King."

 It adds up to an album that is familiar enough to capture KROQ-tuned ears, but 
holds enough quirks and unexpected turns to make you wonder just what these 
guys are up to, anyway.

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; DOT FAVORS SUBWAY OVER 
ELEVATED LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Department of Transportation recommended Monday that the City 
Council and mayor support the construction of a subway line through San 
Fernando Valley instead of a plan for an elevated train down the median of the 
Ventura Freeway.  
</P>
<P>
 Valley residents and government officials have debated the merits of both 
plans for years. Supporters of the subway say the proposed route running along 
Burbank and Chandler boulevards is close to heavy population centers and would 
remain functional if the freeway corridor is damaged in a quake or other 
natural disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The elevated train, or monorail, proponents declare that a freeway-based 
system would be less costly and would lure more frustrated commuters away from 
the freeway. They cite the sinking of Hollywood Boulevard as an example of what 
can go wrong with subway tunneling.  
</P>
<P>
 Next week, the Metropolitan Transit Authority is scheduled to make its final 
decision over which mass transit route and technology will be used to connect 
the Valley to Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Which system would be more conducive to the Valley's transportation needs? 
</P>
<P>
 Don Shultz, president of the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn.: 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to get people out of their cars to use a public 
transportation system, you need them to see a system that's working, while they 
are stuck in traffic."  
</P>
<P>
 Paul Jacobs, President of the Universal City-North Hollywood Chamber of 
Commerce: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Burbank-Chandler Route is the most logical and cost-effective route to 
use. It goes through the center of the Valley; it would alleviate traffic 
congestion in other areas and would serve as a boost to the business 
communities with Metro Rail stations located near them. The freeway route would 
add to traffic congestion already in the area."  
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Mike Antonovich:  
</P>
<P>
 "The freeway-based system is regional, in that it can serve Ventura County in 
addition to commuters in Los Angeles County. It would cost almost $200 million 
less than the subway line to build, with five more stations, (nearly) 2,000 
more parking spaces provided and over two miles worth of extra track. It can be 
built within (four to five years) and would be operational in this century. The 
subway line would not. Its construction would not disrupt traffic along the 
freeways, where the subway line would disrupt a whole residential neighborhood. 
Along the subway route, there are both a high ground water table and lots of 
soil that would need to be removed and treated for toxicity before it could be 
dumped."  
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Ed Edelman: 
</P>
<P>
 "The MTA already owns the rights of way to the Burbank-Chandler route, which 
was paid for by taxpayer dollars. If we don't use it, we would have to return 
the money to Caltrans, which would be counter-productive. To accommodate a 
freeway-based system, we would have to widen the freeways again and raise the 
sound walls even higher. It would be a visual blight on the some 1,400 homes 
located in the area. The Burbank-Chandler route would go through key population 
centers, serving the Van Nuys Civic Center, local colleges and the Warner 
Center."  
</P>
<P>
 James Moore, associate professor of urban planning and civil engineering at 
USC: 
</P>
<P>
 "Either option is very expensive. There are certain global indicators that 
determine whether the use of trains is a good idea in a given society. Among 
these are population density and the price of gasoline. In L.A., the population 
density tends to be pretty low, and the cost of gas is close to the lowest in 
the world. The demand for either form of train will not be intense."

<P>
 For the first time in more than 20 years, the public is being invited onto the 
4,000-acre Starr Ranch Sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1973, only wildlife researchers and Audubon Society members have been 
able to set foot onto the 4,000-acre refuge.But the environmental group wants 
to give the outside community a glimpse of how the sanctuary works. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to welcome the public to our back yard, and give people a chance to 
see what Orange County was like before all the neighborhoods were built," said 
Audubon spokesman Ken Fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally undisturbed by mankind, the ranch is rich in wildlife, with 75 bird 
species, 360 types of plant life and 35 animal species. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got gnatcatchers and coastal wren," Fortune said. "When I was there 
last year, it only took a few minutes to spot a lazuli bunting and a western 
tanager, two beautiful birds." 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth largest privately owned land holding in Orange County, Starr Ranch 
Sanctuary was donated to the Audubon Society in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Tours will begin on Oct. 29. Phone reservations are required and must be made 
before Tuesday. The number of people allowed onto the ranch will be limited, so 
organizers recommend calling as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Guided tours of the wilderness preserve will take place every half hour from 9 
a.m. to 3 p.m. For information and reservations, call (714) 858-1013. FRANK

PARENTING; WHEN KIDS WANT TO QUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA GRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You have looked for the right after-school activity, enrolled your child, paid 
the fee -- and then the kid comes home one afternoon and tells you the class is 
terrible. What next? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of steps before quitting," said Barbara Polland, professor of 
child development at CSUN. Parents should first ask children why they want to 
stop going -- and listen carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, Polland said, the problem is simple, and it's something either the 
child or the parent -- depending on the age and maturity of the child -- can 
communicate to the teacher. Perhaps the youngster had hoped to work with clay, 
and, up to now, the class has only painted with watercolor. Maybe the student 
ended up in too young a group of children.  
</P>
<P>
 Polland said that in most cases it's important to help young ones learn that a 
commitment to take a class should be fulfilled. Sylvia Rieman, a cooking 
instructor and teacher at Granada Hills High School, agrees. "Quitting 
establishes a pattern of not following through," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet if a child gets into a situation that is adverse to emotional health, by 
all means, let him or her quit, Polland advised. There are cases where teachers 
or coaches can be punitive or extremely negative, and in such situations, the 
child should not continue.  
</P>
<P>
 Rieman also encourages parents to review a youngster's complete seven-day 
schedule and evaluate whether the child is overdosed on extracurricular 
activities. The combination of school with sports, religious education and a 
class or two can be exhausting, and a child's request to quit may be nothing 
more than a plea for some quiet, personal time, she said. BARBARA GRAY

PARENTING; BEYOND THE BASICS; AS SCHOOLS TRIM PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND ART 
PROGRAMS, PARENTS LOOK TO OUTSIDE CLASSES TO ALLOW CHILDREN TO EXPLORE NEW 
INTERESTS, TALENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BRONSON GRAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Barbara Bronson Gray writes 
regularly for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In theory, choosing after-school activities for children should be fun and 
easy, but parents say it's hard to know how structured a child's time off 
should be, and just what sorts of programs are most worth while.  
</P>
<P>
 One thing is clear: Since tight-budgeted schools have greatly reduced the 
number of physical education and arts classes they offer, moms and dads are 
increasingly using after-school hours to provide youngsters with opportunities 
to explore new interests or develop special talents. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Barbara Polland, professor of child development at Cal State 
Northridge, most extracurricular activities contribute positively to a child's 
attitude about learning and life, and stimulate parts of the brain that 
straight academic programs cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 Succeeding in an art class or a poetry club can raise children's self-esteem, 
allowing them to build on strengths and feel the pleasure of doing something 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 Such successes can later spill over into academic course work, Polland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there are a host of factors that determine which activities a youngster 
undertakes, Polland believes that the child's interests should be a major 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wherever the child shows more enthusiasm -- that's the most important clue 
about what to pursue," she said. "If a child has a true propensity, you 
generally can't keep them away from it." 
</P>
<P>
 More commonly, kids are swayed by what their friends are doing. "If you insist 
on giving your child tennis lessons because that is what you always wish you 
did, but all your child's friends are in T-ball, your kid will resent you," 
Polland cautioned.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes parents enroll their children in an activity because they are 
convinced the child shows natural -- or supernatural -- talent. "Most people 
tell me their children are very artistic and talented when they enroll," said 
Donna Meyers, a teacher at Mission Renaissance Art Classes in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she added, most of the children are not unusually talented, but they 
like art, so they do well. 
</P>
<P>
 Polland warns parents against pushing a child to pursue an activity because 
they see signs of impressive talent.  
</P>
<P>
 "Only a tiny fraction of society is really gifted in any area. And even if the 
child is especially talented, when you push kids, they burn out, whether it's 
gymnastics, or swimming, ballet, karate, computers or anything else," she said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever a child's interests or abilities, some teachers suggest that parents 
try to arrange an introductory class before signing up for a full-length 
course, an option many schools offer routinely. 
</P>
<P>
 At Mission Renaissance Art Classes, for example, children are given a free 1 
1/2-hour preview to see if they and their parents like the approach and the 
teacher, said Meyers.  
</P>
<P>
 Meyers suggests that parents initially look for classes that teach basics. In 
art, for example, she recommends courses that help children learn to look at 
objects carefully -- to study the shapes inherent in everything -- and convey 
the fundamentals of drawing and painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers also encourage parents to find instructors who communicate to 
children the idea that they can do anything if they want to, if they practice 
the skill enough. "Look for a program that really cares, where the teacher is 
willing to get involved with the children," said Meyers.  
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate goal in after-school activities is to give children a chance to 
explore, to have fun, and to succeed, these experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a little boy in one class who calls his art 'miracle pictures,' " said 
Meyers. "It gives him great confidence to know there's really something he can 
do well."

PARENTING; SCHOOL WINNING THE BATTLE

By JAMES E. FOWLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in the mid-1980s, Gary Guttenberg was a troubled 16-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been a drug user who was arrested three times and expelled from the Los 
Angeles Unified School District twice. He had gone to six high schools, and he 
was two years behind in his studies. He never thought of himself as a truant 
because he never went to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a lot of problems," Guttenberg says. "I was an angry kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Guttenberg, now 24, graduated from UC Berkeley with a bachelor's 
degree in legal studies. He plans to attend law school. Although he cannot 
pinpoint a single cause of his turnaround, he knows it started about the time 
he enrolled at Miguel Leonis High School in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonis High School is one of 43 continuation schools in the LAUSD. Although 
associated with El Camino Real High School, it has its own distinct campus and 
a student body of approximately 120 students, most between the ages of 14 and 
20. All were unsuccessful in regular high school. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10% of Leonis students have been identified as gifted and about 35% are 
in special education classes. The school graduates about 35 to 40 young people 
each year -- students like Guttenberg, who were previously considered at high 
risk of dropping out. Approximately 15 of these graduates eventually go on to a 
four-year college. All of them receive the same California high school diploma 
awarded to students in regular high school. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Odus Caldwell, the school's principal since 1986, 90% of the 
student body arrives at Leonis with a history of truancy problems, yet the 
school has a 95% attendance average. 
</P>
<P>
 "Truancy is a reaction to something else; (the students) don't choose to be 
truant," Caldwell says. "At 14, 15, 16, they don't have the experience to deal 
with the real issue. Leonis is an alternative program, not a penalty."  
</P>
<P>
 Its success in combatting truancy, however, may lie in the non-traditional 
approaches it offers students who have been unable to cope with the rigors and 
rules of other high schools.  
</P>
<P>
 "We take the pressure off the kid," Caldwell says. "We're student-driven. They 
make the decisions."  
</P>
<P>
 Leonis students work at their own pace and are given control of their work 
schedule. They are allowed to sit where they want and decide what subjects they 
are going to tackle and when. Truancy is tolerated at the school but not for 
long. Those with more than three unexcused absences in any of each semester's 
six three-week sessions are expelled from the program.  
</P>
<P>
 Most, however, succeed. And, says Caldwell, "as they start to feel some 
success, they feel better about themselves. They regain their self-confidence 
and self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 Guttenberg, a Leonis success story, appreciated his teachers' recognition of 
his potential, rather than his "self-proclaimed and society-placed 
limitations." While he acknowledges that there's no perfect solution to the 
truancy problem, in his view, "Leonis is a viable option."

PARENTING; SICK OF GOING TO SCHOOL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If children are frequently claiming illness to avoid school, experts suggest 
parents take the following steps: 
</P>
<P>
 * Track your child's complaints. Does the child always feel sick on Sunday 
nights -- never on Friday afternoons? Does it happen the same time each day? 
Such patterns often point to the source of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't simply dismiss a youngster's complaints. Take the child's temperature, 
rub her tummy, offer her a glass of juice. "You never want a child to feel you 
are not listening," said Encino pediatrician Dr. Kristine Irani. "Don't 
pooh-pooh what they are saying." 
</P>
<P>
 * If you decide your child's symptoms warrant a day off from school, be clear 
that it is a day to rest and recuperate -- not to play video games, go 
skateboarding or watch television. 
</P>
<P>
 * Enlist the support of the school. The child's teacher, for example, may 
warmly greet the child on the schoolyard and spend a few extra minutes chatting 
with him during the day. The school nurse can offer TLC and allow the child to 
lie down for a few minutes before going back to class. Such extra attention 
makes school seem less threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the problem persists, seek advice from the school psychologist or mental 
health office. MARYANN HAMMERS

PARENTING; CURING MONDAY MORNING FLU; IT TAKES A LITTLE DETECTIVE WORK TO 
DETERMINE IF A CHILD IS TRULY ILL -- OR WORRIED SICK ABOUT SCHOOL.

 "My head hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 "My tummy aches."  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel good!" 
</P>
<P>
 It happens every Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The whining starts as soon as the alarm goes off. 
</P>
<P>
 You know the drill. You pull out the thermometer. You check for symptoms. No 
fever. No vomiting. No diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
 When children repeatedly claim -- or feign -- illness, parents are presented 
with a quandary. No one wants to force a sick kid to go to school. But keeping 
a healthy youngster home is no good either. How can a parent determine if a 
child is truly ill or simply trying to get out of going to school?  
</P>
<P>
 "Parents must be concerned detectives," said Robin Schleifer, school nurse at 
Portola Middle School in Tarzana. "Pay attention to what the child looks like, 
if they have a fever, what their eyes look like, how their attitude is, if they 
are eating and if they have regular bowel habits." 
</P>
<P>
 Pediatrician Robert Barnhard, who has offices in Agoura and Tarzana, also 
recommends an initial visit to a physician. "Headaches and tummy aches are the 
most difficult complaints for parents to evaluate," he said. "If they are 
occurring over and over, parents should seek medical attention to rule out 
possible illnesses, such as sinus infections, vision problems, irritable bowel 
syndrome, constipation or appendicitis." 
</P>
<P>
 If the youngster gets a clean bill of health, the parent must do some 
investigating to figure out why the child goes to such lengths to avoid class. 
A schoolyard bully, impending exam or the prospect of getting called on in 
class may have a child terrified. New kindergartners and first-graders, as well 
as students beginning middle or junior high school, often feel anxious about 
being separated from their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Children who complain about aching heads and bellies are probably really 
hurting. Fear and anxiety can cause a youngster to be worried sick, according 
to Glendale pediatrician Vincent Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the physician cannot find an organic problem in a physical exam 
or lab work, an uptight child can experience real discomfort," he said. "Sit 
down and talk with the child. Ask what they don't like, what makes them afraid, 
what makes them uncomfortable. See if you can pull out what the child is 
fearful about."  
</P>
<P>
 But while parents should be sympathetic and understanding, experts agree that 
a well child should not be permitted to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is really important to nip school refusal in the bud," said Dr. Mary 
Moebius, a Tarzana child psychiatrist. "If a parent lets the child stay home 
with the TV going, the kid just loves it, and that night the kid gets 'sick' 
again because he wants to stay home the next day." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, you can lead a kid to school, but getting him to stay in class is 
another story. Take San Fernando parent Alicia Gonzalez. Last year, her son, 
Isaac, 11, began complaining that he didn't feel well. After a doctor confirmed 
that the boy was fine, Gonzalez sent him to school and headed to work. But just 
as she settled at her desk, the phone rang. It was the school nurse's office, 
where Isaac sought refuge at least three days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I picked him up immediately -- at first," Gonzalez said. "But when 
it continued, and Isaac realized I was on to him, he would tell the nurse, 
'Don't bother my mom. Call my grandma.' I would come home from work to find out 
that my mother-in-law had picked him up from school that morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Isaac finally fessed up to the source of his concern: A bigger, older boy was 
picking on him. Armed with that knowledge, Gonzalez asked the school principal 
to intervene. The bullying stopped, and Isaac's headaches and stomachaches 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Isaac, kids who are intent on staying out of school often end up in the 
nurse's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come in right before the 8 a.m. bell rings," Schleifer said. "Sometimes 
they make it through homeroom. Then they tell the homeroom teacher they have to 
go to the nurse. One girl would make it through the first two hours. Then she 
would come in right after nutrition. She just didn't want to be in school. 
Other kids who are afraid of a certain teacher or certain classes, such as math 
or P.E., will always come in during the same time and day of week. They say 
something like, 'I just need to lie down for one hour.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In such cases, Schleifer will call the parent to work out an agreement. "The 
parent and I may set ground rules that if the child has no obvious signs of 
illness, I will send him back to class without calling home," she said. 
"Sometimes if the kid knows that Mom and I agree, that is all it takes to stop 
the pattern."

PARENTING; LESSONS IN GIVING; COMMUNITY-SERVICE REQUIREMENTS HELP VALLEY 
SCHOOLS FOSTER STUDENTS' SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Though it's easy to dismiss some kids today as self-absorbed and 
self-indulgent, the labels don't always apply. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Studio City grade-school students who knit caps for homeless people, 
or Reseda students who use their acting abilities to keep guns out of schools. 
In Van Nuys, youngsters raise money and donate toys to those less fortunate 
than themselves. In Chatsworth, students plant trees to beautify their local 
Metrolink station. 
</P>
<P>
 In a cynical world where many adults feel powerless to alleviate chronic 
social problems, San Fernando Valley schools are working to foster a sense of 
responsibility in their students. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators hope that the next generation will be willing and able to make a 
difference by learning to give of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Lowe, assistant superintendent of the Las Virgenes Unified School 
District, stresses how important it is for youngsters to develop the habit of 
contributing to society. "Many children are so cloistered from the real world," 
he says. "For them to see its varied conditions, look beyond their own 
circumstances and weigh them against the problems of others, it helps them 
recognize their good fortune."  
</P>
<P>
 Lowe supervised a committee formed last year to study the possibility of 
making volunteerism a graduation requirement in the Las Virgenes district. 
Though the effort foundered over concerns about its legality, and fears that 
mandatory volunteerism might defeat the spirit of giving, Lowe and many other 
educators and charity figures strongly support such programs in elementary as 
well as secondary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, under the jurisdiction of the L. A. Unified School District, 
Chatsworth High School made volunteerism mandatory, instituting a requirement 
in 1993 for all seniors to complete 10 hours of community service and 
increasing the requirement to 20 hours for this year. The measure was approved 
by a school-based management council made up of students, teachers, parents and 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Burke, the school's government teacher and sponsor of the volunteer 
program, reports that, so far, students have planted trees, worked on political 
campaigns, visited hospital shut-ins and helped out in libraries. Not only are 
young people getting more involved, he says, but their parents are 
participating too, joining their kids for tree-planting and politicking. 
</P>
<P>
 At Grant High School in Van Nuys, where service programs are still voluntary, 
students are equally exuberant, says Michael Denman, a history teacher who 
oversees student government programs. Denman supervises the school's biggest 
volunteer effort, Operation Happiness, which supplies youngsters with holiday 
gifts through the Children's Bureau of Los Angeles. "Even (students) who don't 
have a lot of money contribute to it," says Denman, adding that while most of 
the school's home rooms "adopt" one to five children, some are so gung-ho they 
end up helping out as many as 20 kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Entire communities, as well as individuals, reap the rewards of such programs. 
Burke says that Chatsworth's Metrolink station, enhanced by trees planted by 
students, is a better place today, thanks to their labors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community benefits in so many ways," says Burke. "It is beautified, 
improved. Students are made better citizens now, and we hope that sense of 
responsibility continues in the future." 
</P>

 For Shahrzad Firouz, a senior at Reseda High School, the wish to end violence 
prompted her to volunteer her time. After a student shooting on the school 
campus a couple of years ago, an organization called W.A.R.N. (Weapons Are 
Removed Now) was formed on campus. Members of the organization produce plays 
that focus on nonviolence and take them on tour to local elementary schools. 
According to Firouz, who has participated in the program for a year, "It's been 
very useful, and I really believe in it. Our voices are being heard."

MTA SHAKE-UP PLAN'S LIMITED SCOPE CRITICIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WILLMAN and RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed reorganization of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's 
management of Los Angeles subway construction calls for a handful of structural 
changes -- but two key state legislators said Thursday that the plan falls 
short of what is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepared by MTA Chief Executive Officer Franklin E. White and aides, the plan 
calls for management and engineering changes aimed at preventing a repeat of 
problems that have plagued the multibillion-dollar project. 
</P>
<P>
 White's plan does not seek to terminate the contract of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, the 
builder of the troubled subway tunnels in Hollywood, or MTA-hired consulting 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important concern is to get this job done properly and quickly and 
not act out of anger," White said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacing the contractors, he said, would add "substantially" to the cost of 
completing the work, because it could further delay work on subway stations 
along the route. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was sent confidentially this week to the Federal Transit 
Administration, which on Oct. 5 cut off $1.6 billion of future subway funding 
because of dissatisfaction with the MTA's management of construction. The 
federal agency also has ordered that tunneling remain shut down along Hollywood 
Boulevard, pending its approval of the construction procedures to be used. 
</P>
<P>
 "We remain optimistic that all outstanding issues can be resolved before the 
end of the month," White said in a memo received Thursday by MTA board members. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, the MTA announced late Thursday that Joel J. 
Sandberg, the agency's project manager for all subway construction in the 
Wilshire district and in Hollywood, is being reassigned to the position of 
deputy project manager for systems and construction service. 
</P>
<P>
 Two state legislators, both of whom have jurisdiction over transportation 
spending, said White's reorganization proposal lacks the sweep needed to better 
manage construction and to protect the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FTA did the right thing in cutting off the funding," said Assembly 
Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz, whose legislation created the 
MTA in 1993. "They ought to be demanding a whole lot more (than what White's 
plan proposes). There's not much change there, really." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Katz has urged the state Transportation Commission to withhold its funding for 
the Los Angeles subway until the MTA demonstrates it can competently manage the 
project. The state has provided about $250 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz noted on Thursday that White's proposal makes no mention of whether he 
still intends to dissolve the Rail Construction Corp., an MTA subsidiary that 
has overseen subway construction since mid-1990. Katz will hold a hearing on 
the subway problems Monday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Another legislator who has expressed concern about the MTA's operations, Sen. 
Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), said White's reorganization plan lacked the 
substance that he believes is needed to gain control over what is the most 
expensive subway construction, per mile, in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The restructuring appears to be a reshuffling," said Hayden, who is 
organizing a Senate Transportation Committee hearing on Nov. 2 regarding the 
funding and construction of the subway and other MTA policy issues. "It's 
inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, the MTA board has twice 
postponed votes on White's earlier request to disband the subsidiary, which has 
drawn criticism from some officials for being too lenient with contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 White, in addition to seeking restoration of federal funding, asked Federal 
Transit Administrator Gordon J. Linton for approval to resume tunneling along 
Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 White has said that he thinks tunneling may resume as early as Nov. 7. 
Excavation in Hollywood has been halted since Aug. 18, when surface sinkages of 
nine inches were confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Federal Transit Administration would not speculate 
Thursday as to when the agency would permit tunneling to resume. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman, Pete Halpin, said federal officials have raised "some questions 
that aren't addressed by the report" submitted by White. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the view of our technical folks, they're looking for some more 
information," Halpin said from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, MTA officials met Thursday with staff of the federal agency to 
review proposed procedures for resumed tunneling. The procedures were prepared 
by the MTA's inspection-management firm, Parsons-Dillingham. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineers recommended that metal struts -- not wooden wedges -- be used 
for tunnel bracing. 
</P>
<P>
 Substitution of the wedges was approved in 1992 by Parsons-Dillingham and by 
the project's chief design engineer, employed by the firm of Parsons 
Brinckerhoff. The wedges were crushed under Hollywood Boulevard and engineers 
have concluded that the failure contributed to the surface sinkages. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA plan also called for three types of soil-stabilizing grouting 
procedures. The grouting was not performed in the worst-affected area of 
tunneling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Transit Administration and MTA documents obtained by The Times shed 
further light on the management and construction problems: 
</P>
<P>
 * The federal government's consultant for subway work in Los Angeles said in 
an Oct. 13 report that the MTA "relented to the contractor's demands" by 
reinstating Shea-Kiewit-Kenny's tunneling superintendent, who had been expelled 
for safety-related reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal consultant, Hill International Inc., questioned the reinstatement 
of Norm Hutchins and criticized the MTA. "The (MTA) needs to be more forceful 
with regard to making (Shea-Kiewit-Kenny) reinforce its commitment to safety," 
said Hill International. 
</P>
<P>
 White said in an interview that Hutchins' role would be reassessed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shea-Kiewit-Kenny has agreed to appoint E. O. Mixon as new project manager 
for the work. He declined to comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 * According to the reorganization proposal, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny "has agreed to 
submit a plan for resolving all" problems with installation of wooden wedges 
used in 12 miles of twin tunnels along Hollywood Boulevard and Vermont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said the federal government should not agree to allow a resumption of 
tunneling or to unfreeze funding until the MTA approves Shea-Kiewit-Kenny's 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The incremental improvements should be implemented, and then the money should 
be turned on," Hayden said.

PROBE EXPECTED TO JUSTIFY SLAYING BY OFFICERS ; INVESTIGATION: INGLEWOOD POLICE 
FIRED 66 SHOTS, KILLING A KIDNAPING SUSPECT AFTER A CHASE. THE VICTIM'S FAMILY 
PLANS TO FILE A CLAIM AGAINST CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Inglewood police said an investigation is expected to find that eight officers 
were justified when they fired 66 shots in two or three seconds at a kidnaping 
suspect after a car chase, hitting him nine times and killing him. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was one of the most intense instances of police firepower 
directed toward a single suspect in recent memory, according to several veteran 
Los Angeles police officers and "officer-involved shooting" investigators 
contacted by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man's relatives say police overreacted and used excessive force 
against Gary C. Zeigler, 33, in what turned out to be more a domestic dispute 
between the man and his wife than a kidnaping. Zeigler was not armed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like it's a good shooting" (one that is within department 
guidelines), said Inglewood Police Capt. John R. Frazier, who is supervising 
the primary investigation of the Aug. 21 incident. However, "We have concerns 
with the number of rounds fired," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeigler's wife, Margo, 32, said she doesn't understand why police fired at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing that can bring him back, but why, why did they shoot him like 
that?" she said. "No one deserved to die the way he died." 
</P>
<P>
 Results of the Inglewood police investigation, expected to be completed in a 
week or two, will be turned over to the county district attorney's special 
investigations division for review. Inglewood police internal affairs officers 
are conducting a separate investigation of the incident, but would not release 
any details. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police and witnesses, the incident began shortly before midnight 
when Zeigler and his wife, both Hawthorne residents, were arguing in front of 
her mother's home on Venice Way in Inglewood.  
</P>
<P>
 Zeigler, who was a custodian at the Los Angeles County Arboretum in Arcadia, 
reportedly dragged Margo Zeigler into his 1980 GMC sport utility vehicle; 
another woman, Tracy Butler, Margo Zeigler's cousin, also jumped into the 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's toxicology report indicated that Zeigler's blood-alcohol level was 
0.24%, three times the intoxication limit for driving. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving several 911 calls and a report about a kidnaping in progress, 
several Inglewood police cars pursued Zeigler's vehicle at 45 m.p.h. to 50 
m.p.h., police said. After a two-mile chase, Zeigler tried to turn left off La 
Cienega Boulevard into an entrance ramp for the San Diego Freeway, missed the 
turn and crashed into a chain-link fence. Margo Zeigler and Butler jumped out 
and ran. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Frazier said, at least four patrol cars and eight officers -- 
whose names police have refused to disclose -- were at the scene. Zeigler 
backed his vehicle into a police car, police said, went forward and began 
backing up again toward two officers who were outside their patrol car. 
</P>
<P>
 Believing themselves or their fellow officers to be in danger, Frazier said, 
the eight officers opened fire, seven with 9-millimeter semiautomatics and one 
with a .45-caliber semiautomatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing took about two seconds," said Frazier, who was not at the 
scene but based his estimate on the officers' reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounded like a war breaking out," said Kevin Johnson, a security guard who 
had alerted police to the incident and followed the pursuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Margo Zeigler said she was shocked when she heard the police shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I turned and hollered 'No! No!,' " she said. "Then the police put me down on 
the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeigler said she did not believe that her husband had ever intended to harm 
her. She characterized the argument as "a small thing," but did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the coroner's autopsy report, Zeigler received two fatal gunshot 
wounds in the back and head -- one of which passed through both frontal lobes 
of his brain -- and seven nonfatal wounds in the head, back, thigh and arm. 
Despite those wounds, police say, Zeigler attempted to drive away, with the GMC 
going 30 or 40 feet before hitting a curb and turning over on its side. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives believe that Zeigler was not backing up toward the officers, and 
that they were never in danger and should not have fired. The relatives take 
issue with the police version, questioning how a man shot through the brain 
could have shifted out of reverse and then gone forward. 
</P>
<P>
 No weapon was found on Zeigler or in the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeigler was pronounced dead about 25 minutes later at Daniel Freeman Memorial 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Equipped with hindsight, (the officers) might have done some things 
differently," Frazier said. He added, "We thought it was a righteous (actual) 
kidnaping." 
</P>
<P>
 Will Harris, Margo Zeigler's attorney, said the family plans to file a claim 
against Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The circumstances of this case raise grave doubts as to whether the shooting 
was justified," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Zeigler had been in trouble with the law several times since 1979, 
including a two-year prison sentence in 1990 for assault with a deadly weapon, 
friends and family members said he had since "gone straight." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was always cooperative, personable and conscientious," said Tim Lindsay, 
Zeigler's supervisor at the arboretum for the last two years. "I want to know 
why my son is dead," said Zeigler's mother, Roberta Zeigler of Anaheim. "What 
(police) did was 100% wrong."

COUNTY-USC QUAKE TOLL IS $1 BILLION; RECOVERY: LOCAL OFFICIALS HOPE TO PERSUADE 
FEDERAL, STATE AUTHORITIES TO PAY FOR NEW CENTER INSTEAD OF MAKING REPAIRS.

 Tallying the bill from what is believed to be the worst natural disaster 
absorbed by a hospital in U.S. history, local officials on Thursday placed 
earthquake-related costs to Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center at $1 billion 
and asked federal and state authorities to fund a $1.3 billion state-of-the-art 
medical center rather than make repairs.  
</P>
<P>
 The damage estimate concludes nine months of evaluations and surveys by 
architects and engineers and greatly exceeds original estimates of $400 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, 19 of 128 buildings in the 72-acre Boyle Heights complex are 
scheduled to be demolished, including the psychiatric and pediatric hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials hope to persuade the Federal Emergency Management Agency and 
the state Office of Emergency Services to forgo repairs and instead fund 
construction of a new center, which had already been planned before last 
January's earthquake. Approval of the relief funds would be a huge boost for 
the project, originally scheduled for completion by 2002, and could even speed 
up it up by two to three years.  
</P>
<P>
 Medical center officials expressed confidence in their position that it is 
more cost-effective to replace the facility than to pump millions into repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the architectural plans have been developed very carefully; we have 
followed all of the steps and feel the outcome will be favorable," medical 
center Executive Director Edward L. Martinez said in presenting recovery cost 
assessments to FEMA and Office of Emergency Services officials at a morning 
news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The elaborate ceremony, held in front of the damaged pediatric pavilion, was 
attended by dozens of elected officials, local health administrators and 
representatives of state and federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl Wait, regional public assistance officer for FEMA, said his agency will 
work jointly with state and local officials to review the assessment and will 
respond within three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been on the site from Day 1 and I think we have a good grasp of the 
damage," he said. "We haven't come up with any figure or dollar amount, but in 
terms of eligibility for the money, we will be looking at how precise these 
(assessments) are." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert C. Gates, director of the county Department of Health Services, 
stressed that there was a compelling need even before the earthquake either to 
replace the hospital or begin costly repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the facilities, including General Hospital and Women's and Children's 
Hospital, do not meet seismic safety codes. The buildings lack fire detection 
systems or sprinklers and have no air conditioning and other safety and 
environmental systems that are standard in modern hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Local health officials have been under a federal mandate for years to correct 
the deficiencies or lose licensing and accreditation.  
</P>
<P>
 The county proposes to replace the old complex with a 946-bed hospital.

A TENUOUS PEACE MOVES INTO SOME GANG AREAS; CRIME: LONG BEACH IS LATEST 
COMMUNITY TO SEE DROP IN VIOLENT RIVALRIES. SOME SAY GANGBANGERS WANT TO END 
CARNAGE; OTHERS SAY THE CALM IS DESIGNED TO PROTECT DRUG OPERATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 Latino and Asian gangs in Long Beach, enemies for a decade, have struck a 
tentative cease-fire over the last two months in a war that has claimed at 
least 38 lives, maimed countless others and kept terrified residents off their 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The break in hostilities represents the latest peaceful effort between gangs 
in communities across Los Angeles County. Over the last year, gangs in Venice 
and parts of the San Fernando Valley have laid down their weapons in hopes of 
bringing calm to their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The roots of the cease-fires remain murky, with a variety of differing 
interpretations. Gang members say they are tired of seeing their brothers die 
and hope that police -- and the news media -- will stop paying them so much 
attention. However, authorities believe some gangs are cooling out to avoid 
publicity that interferes with their drug sales. Other experts see the recent 
overtures as part of an up-and-down cycle of violence in which gangs have 
entered a period of calm. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reasons, a message of peace appears to be spreading from 
neighborhood to neighborhood in places where gunfire once sent residents 
scurrying for cover and left parents searching for ways to keep their children 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe safer and saner heads are prevailing over the hot heads," said Long 
Beach Sgt. Buz Williams, a gang expert and member of the California Gang 
Investigators Assn. "We've had gangbangers telling us they can walk down the 
street now without getting shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of gang violence in the three communities appear to support the 
optimistic outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Oakwood section of Venice, where a gang war claimed 17 lives over the 
last year, no gang homicides have occurred since mid-June, when a truce was 
hammered out by African American and Latino gangs.  
</P>
<P>
 Gang-related homicides also appear to be down in the San Fernando Valley since 
an estimated 75 Latino gangs agreed last fall to set aside their weapons. As of 
August, the Los Angeles Police Department had recorded nine gang-related 
killings in the Valley, compared to 35 for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Long Beach, no Asian-Latino homicides have occurred since July. Just 
months before, the violence had reached an almost feverish pitch. Among the 
victims were six innocent Latinos from Los Angeles who were shot -- three of 
them fatally -- in front of stunned witnesses moments after leaving a birthday 
party where they had gone to promote their dance club. The shooting was an 
apparent reprisal for the murder a few days earlier of two Cambodian 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can hold onto the peace for a while . . . I think we'll be in pretty 
good shape," said Bill Martinez, executive director of Community Youth Gang 
Services, an organization that works with gangs across Los Angeles County. "I 
think the guys are understanding that violence isn't productive." 
</P>
<P>
 But some gang members in Long Beach express skepticism about any lasting peace 
on their streets. So tenuous is the situation that most refuse to use the word 
truce, insisting that the newfound calm is merely a cease-fire. Some say they 
still are being stopped -- and occasionally beaten -- by rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It still feels dangerous," said a 14-year-old Asian gang member. "When I walk 
home, I have to look back. A car pulls up and sweats (harasses) me or beats my 
ass." 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who support the peace worry that others less inclined may ignore 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt if the crazy ones will listen," said a 17-year-old Asian gang member. 
"Some don't care about a peace treaty. I still got that reflex looking back 
over my shoulder even though this peace is going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Latino gang members contacted declined to be interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang investigators in Long Beach say other factors may account for the calm in 
their city. The Police Department's gang unit has more than tripled in size 
this year, from 11 full-time officers to 39. Police say their beefed-up 
presence on city streets has likely helped quiet things down. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also believe initial efforts behind the truce may have come from 
the Mexican Mafia, which is run from prison. Authorities speculate that the 
group, which is allegedly involved in drug sales on the street in an effort to 
expand its criminal enterprise behind bars, felt the ongoing violence in Long 
Beach was attracting too much attention to its operations. The peace treaties 
in Venice and the San Fernando Valley also are thought to have been prompted by 
orders from the powerful clan. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Armando Gonzalez, a consultant to the city's gang prevention 
program and a trusted elder among the gangs, says the leaders are serious about 
stopping the bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez is one of three community leaders who brokered the recent cease-fire. 
Along with Pastor Joe Esposito of the Cambodian Baptist Church and a third man 
who asked not to be named, Gonzalez helped persuade gang leaders to attend 
meetings together at the church and at local parks. Although none of the adults 
would comment on the meetings, sources said the two sides reached an 
understanding to talk about future trouble such as shootings rather than seek 
revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know it was getting out of hand," Gonzalez said of the gang leaders. "A 
lot of innocent people were being killed. That's one thing that has to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities and gang members alike concede that a truce is a tall order for 
rivals who have spent years eyeing one another with suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino gangs, who are primarily Mexican American and have roots in Long Beach 
dating to the late 1960s, say they fight to protect their barrios against 
Asians intruding on their streets. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the Asian gang members -- who are mostly Cambodian but also 
include Laotians, Vietnamese, Chinese and other groups -- say they formed gangs 
as protection against attacks by their more numerous Latino rivals. The Asian 
gangs began appearing in Long Beach 10 to 15 years ago, and their emergence 
coincided with the influx of southeast Asian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their differences, growing numbers on both sides appear willing to put 
the conflict aside and abide by edicts that could save their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a senior. We're growing up," said a 17-year-old gang member. "I'm tired 
of all that stuff. I want to graduate."

CLOSER TO HOME; UNICEF TURNS ITS FOCUS ON HELPING U.S. CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 People remember the little orange boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1950s, American children have carried them door to door on Halloween 
night, collecting donations for UNICEF instead of candy. The box was a bridge, 
linking children of the world's most wealthy nation with needy children in 
foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, the line that separates them from us has blurred, forcing 
UNICEF's American supporters -- particularly those in Los Angeles -- to sharpen 
their approach to fund raising and advocacy, aiming their efforts toward those 
at home as well as abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't just talk about children 'over there' because those children live 
here now," said Marilyn F. Solomon, executive director of the Los Angeles 
chapter of the U.S. Committee for UNICEF in Los Angeles. "We have the same 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Since becoming executive director in January, Solomon has dedicated much of 
her time to refining the city's understanding of the 47-year-old organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In communities throughout the city, Solomon is spreading the message: UNICEF 
is alive and well and concerned with issues facing children on the Eastside as 
well as those in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Of late, the Los Angeles chapter has been busy forming partnerships with 
community-based organizations, Solomon said, part of an effort to increase 
public awareness of UNICEF and to forge the gap between local and international 
efforts for youth. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, the Los Angeles committee is co-sponsoring the third annual 
Pan-African Film Festival, a two-week event that will raise funds for UNICEF's 
Africa project and two local, predominantly African American private schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's such a relationship between the status of children in our own back 
yard and children in other places," said Solomon, a longtime community 
organizer who began her work in the northeast San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's very different. With these partnerships we feel we can make a 
difference globally and locally." 
</P>
<P>
 The local organization's new slant coincides with a national movement aimed at 
broadening the focus of the organization to include children in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with the now famous orange boxes, American children over the years have 
collected more than $100 million for UNICEF on Oct. 31, National UNICEF Day. 
The money collected on Halloweens past has been used to buy medicine, supply 
fresh water and provide primary education to children around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, for the first time in its history, the organization has 
declared all of October National UNICEF Month. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only will American children collect money for others, now they will have 
an opportunity to learn about the people who benefit from their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization's goal is to have trained volunteers and staff members visit 
schools nationwide during October, sharing their knowledge of other cultures 
and places with American schoolchildren in hopes of fostering a respect for 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need help understanding global diversity, which is not across the ocean 
anymore," said Gwendolyn Calvert Baker, president and chief executive officer 
of the U.S. Committee for UNICEF, based in New York. "So much of it is in the 
classrooms sitting right next to them and on the playground." 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon recently visited churches in the African American community and 
throughout the city, encouraging ministers to invite their congregations to the 
two-week-long Pan-African film festival, and dropping off free passes. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be other events this month to introduce the community to UNICEF and 
to raise funds: a concert featuring singer Maxine Weldon at Lunaria Restaurant 
and Jazz Club, and a reception at the Alitash Kebede Art Gallery featuring the 
work of artist Herbert Gentry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people to know we're here and the kinds of projects we're involved 
in," Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Ayuko Babu sees a parallel between the goals of the Pan-African Film Festival 
and those of UNICEF. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is to bring an awareness and consciousness about black people 
around the world," said Babu, executive director of the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 All too often Americans possess only vague sketches of people in other places, 
Babu said. Sketchier still is Americans' understanding of the relationship 
between their lives and the lives of people abroad, how the hot cocoa Americans 
drink to feel cozy on cold winter days comes from Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the people who pick (it) are poor and don't have enough money," to enjoy 
it themselves, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The film festival "fits right in with" UNICEF's and Solomon's goal of "letting 
folks have a better sense of what's happening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Extraordinary Place in the Crenshaw district, one of the schools that 
will receive funds from the festival, educators say UNICEF's involvement in 
local issues will "contribute to the effort to keep children (in America) on 
the forefront of people's minds" -- a contribution as valuable as the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just makes me feel very hopeful because so much of the attention tends to 
be on the children abroad who are without," said Ernestine Washington, who is 
program coordinator of the nonprofit educational cooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very impressed by UNICEF's outreach to the community. My prayer would 
be that it continues."

GRANT HIGH PARENTS, STAFF DISCUSS MELEE; VIOLENCE: BACK-TO-SCHOOL NIGHT CROWD 
CONFRONTS OFFICIALS ABOUT TUESDAY'S INCIDENT. PRINCIPAL SAYS CAMPUS IS SAFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It was an emotionally loaded back-to-school night Thursday at Grant High 
School. Beyond conferences with teachers over grades, parents came to hear 
about ethnic violence earlier in the week that resulted in two Armenian boys 
being stabbed and a Latino boy shot. 
</P>
<P>
 After cake and coffee, Principal Eve Sherman described the series of incidents 
Tuesday, emphasizing that the violence happened off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Police from the Los Angeles Unified School District and the Los Angeles Police 
Department have said the two Armenian boys were stabbed in the back a block 
from school after a melee involving 50 to 100 students in the school parking 
lot. In a separate incident several minutes after the stabbings, a gunshot from 
a passing car struck the Latino boy in the leg about three blocks from the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 All three boys are recovering at their homes, Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have made no arrests in the incidents and would not make public the 
names of the injured students. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman, acknowledging that there had been tension on the campus and earlier 
fights between the two groups, assured parents Thursday that Grant is a safe 
place for their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever was going on moved off campus," she told an auditorium crowd of 
about 375 parents and students. "They knew they better not mess with what's 
going on here." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the meeting, parents -- some worried, some angry and some curious -- 
milled about with their children, quietly checking report cards and saying 
hello to other parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have two daughters and they're not involved in these things, but I'm scared 
they might get caught in it," said Angela Khalulyan, an Armenian immigrant who 
spent half the evening with 15-year-old daughter Roxanne and half with 
17-year-old daughter Kristina. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came for a better, safer life, and now I worry about my kids in school," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Students were eager to point out that parents ought not to worry, saying the 
violence is limited to a small group and that Grant is, overall, a good, safe 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 That point was underscored by Sherman, who challenged the news media to report 
good things about Grant -- that 76% of last year's graduating class went on to 
college, and that last spring the school administered 496 advanced placement 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents still had questions, however. Sherman reassured one mother that there 
are daily sweeps with metal detectors by school police and random locker checks 
when warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman who said she was the mother of one of the boys who had been stabbed 
approached Sherman after the meeting, asking why the school did not do more to 
protect her son. 
</P>
<P>
 And she had another question. "Why didn't the principal come to the hospital?" 
she asked reporters. "My son, maybe he could die." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, the mother, who declined to give her name, wanted reporters to 
know that her son's friends said they had warned school administrators before 
the violence that there was going to be trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions between the two ethnic groups have been running high at Grant for 
some time, students and faculty said. A brawl last spring prompted school 
officials to send students to a one-day seminar aimed at improving relations. 
</P>
<P>
 After a fight last week and another incident Monday at lunch, students said, 
they were waiting for a more serious clash to erupt. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials have said they did what they could to prevent violence. They 
have tried to address problems with the students as they occurred, officials 
said, and plans were in place for a daylong diversity training seminar for 
faculty members next week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 School district police have said that the lone officer assigned to Grant had 
requested help Tuesday because of rumors of a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 An extra officer was dispatched on Tuesday, school police said, but not until 
after classes had ended. By the time the additional officer got to the school, 
the situation was too much for two officers to handle and a general assistance 
call was put out for help from any officers from any agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Granados brought his 10-year-old son, Francisco Jr., to the meeting. 
His daughter, Elisa, a freshman at Grant, was studying at home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is better for Armenians and Latinos to be here than in our own countries," 
said Granados, who came to the United States 17 years ago from El Salvador. "We 
can learn to be friends."

THE LAST PRAYERS IN CHURCH; EARTHQUAKE: WORSHIPERS SLIP INTO THE SANCTUARY FOR 
A DUSTY GOODBY. OTHER CONGREGATIONS ARE WAITING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Demolition work has begun on the First Presbyterian Church of North Hollywood, 
the first house of worship in the San Fernando Valley to be torn down because 
of damage from January's earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other local congregations, facing varying amounts of damage, are still 
trying to decide between repairing or rebuilding their churches. 
</P>
<P>
 Dust and debris filled the red-tagged Presbyterian church building as about 80 
members of the congregation, led by the Rev. John Moody, slipped in Sunday 
morning for about 10 minutes of final prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stood in a circle, and it was emotional," Moody said. 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation has been holding services since the Jan. 17 Northridge 
temblor in its chapel or in the larger fellowship hall. 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed that the only other church structure razed to date because of 
quake damage was the First Christian (Disciples of Christ) Church in downtown 
Santa Monica. The congregation still meets in a chapel in an adjoining 
building, which has been enlarged to handle the usual Sunday attendance of 
about 50 people, said Pastor Charles Elswick. 
</P>
<P>
 The 70-year-old Santa Monica church building, which served as a weekday refuge 
for the homeless, "was in danger of collapsing so we began demolition in 
February," said Elswick, who lives in Reseda. "The basement and subbasement 
haven't been removed because we ran out of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Catholic parishes in the Valley and to the south suffered extensive 
damage, but none had to be demolished, said Father Gregory Coiro, spokesman for 
the Los Angeles archdiocese. Mary Immaculate Church in Pacoima, for instance, 
still celebrates Mass in a tent outside, but Jeff Castillo, parish 
administrator, said that repairs and refurbishment of its church building 
should be complete by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of La Trinidad Church in San Fernando, an Assemblies of God 
congregation, did the demolition work themselves on the badly damaged church 
structure, but the building was not razed. "The roof, the ground slab and some 
support beams were worth saving," foreman David Laning said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some small congregations, such as Emerson Unitarian Church in Canoga Park, are 
leaning toward rebuilding but are still investigating all the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did vote to try to put up a new building," said Virginia Margerum, a 
former Emerson president. "This one, rebuilt after a fire gutted it in 1921, 
would take a lot of work to meet the new earthquake codes and handicap access 
(requirements). It would cost more to fix it up than to build something new." 
</P>
<P>
 Another congregation, St. James Presbyterian Church in Tarzana, has raised 
more than $64,000 toward what church leaders thought was a goal of about a half 
million dollars for repairs. But new engineering assessments of the building -- 
similar in construction to North Hollywood First Presbyterian -- have increased 
the project's cost to at least $700,000, according to the Rev. Carl Horton, 
associate pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of the increase, the congregation is considering tearing the 
building down and replacing it with a new one, Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation led by Pastor Moody at First Presbyterian of North Hollywood 
had little choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The precast concrete church at the corner of Colfax Avenue and Addison Street, 
built in the early 1960s, was declared a public nuisance by building inspectors 
because of broken sections where the roof meets supporting columns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building has been a joy and a pain," said Moody, who has been pastor 
since 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years after the building was constructed, a liberal-conservative split 
over theology erupted within the congregation and most conservative members 
went to the new Valley Presbyterian Church in North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "A small group was left behind to finish paying for the building, but they did 
burn the mortgage in 1990," Moody said. 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation now faces the option of calling it quits or continuing in the 
small buildings on its property, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way we're going to be able to rebuild is to sell the parking lot 
across the street and pull together our reserves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The denomination has been silent. All they can do is offer loans -- at a 
higher rate than the Small Business Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 After those gloomy remarks as demolition workers arrived early in the week, 
Moody added later that the congregation still has a lot of spirit. "They feel 
that the church is continuing even though the building is going down," the 
pastor said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Carrie Jones, director of the church's preschool, had to tell 
parents of 45 children that the school was temporarily closed. Workers sealed 
doorways and windows and a large filtration machine was placed at a side 
doorway to suck out floating asbestos fibers and other potentially harmful 
airborne substances in the building. The preparation for actual demolition may 
take up to two weeks, said Tony Ruvalcaba, a superintendent on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the dust and dirt, a senior citizens' center on the grounds was 
relocated for two months, Moody said. 
</P>
<P>
 And because the flowers outside the building were likely to be crushed during 
demolition, two members of Van Nuys Presbyterian Church dug up a half dozen 
plants and took them away for transplanting.

ELECTIONS / FILLMORE COUNCIL; CANDIDATES AGREE QUAKE MAY HAVE SILVER LINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even before the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake crumbled $250-million worth of 
downtown, Fillmore had more than its share of economic woes. 
</P>
<P>
 A sprawling industrial park outside town sits largely unleased, sinking retail 
sales have thinned the general fund and efforts to lure new business to town 
have not yet panned out. 
</P>
<P>
 But the early morning 6.7-magnitude shaker may ultimately help the city of 
12,000 position itself for the next century, candidates and current members of 
the Fillmore City Council say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a face-lift," said Councilman Roger Campbell, who is not up for 
reelection this year. "It's kind of like the rebirth of town, and the people 
who get in on the ground floor are going to do the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Only one candidate is challenging incumbents Linda Brewster and Don Gunderson 
for the two open council seats, a sign many community leaders say shows support 
for the job the Fillmore City Council has done in the aftermath of the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Evaristo Barajas, 39, who runs a tax consulting and realty business in 
Fillmore, said he can bring a pro-business perspective to the five-member 
council that has just one self-employed member. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main concern has been that we need a little different perspective on what 
goes on in Fillmore," the first-time candidate said. "I have a base of about 
1,000 clients a year, so I'm in touch with the private sector." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the issue of attracting jobs and industry to Fillmore, the council 
election so far has been pretty much a sleeper, voters and merchants said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewster, Gunderson and Barajas all filed forms stating they would spend less 
than $1,000 on their campaigns. Each is campaigning strictly by word-of-mouth, 
coffee klatches and door-knocking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now there are no controversial issues being discussed or talked about," 
said Hank Carrillo, executive director of the Fillmore Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest concern for everyone, including all three candidates, is the 
recovery of Fillmore from the earthquake and bringing in new business," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Former council candidate John Pressey, a 20-year Fillmore resident, said the 
apparent lack of interest in the 1994 local election translates to a good 
approval rating for the incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of a ho-hum kind of attitude is the way I'm reading it," the 
retired airline mechanic said. "I think (voters) are satisfied and they think 
the city's in capable hands." 
</P>
<P>
 All three candidates list jobs and industry as the biggest issue facing the 
small town. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Brewster and Gunderson cite gains that have been made in economic 
development over the four years they have served and, they say, their swift and 
effective response to the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even before the earthquake the economy everywhere in California was poor," 
said Brewster, a 45-year-old homemaker. "The North Fillmore Industrial Park is 
practically empty. Everything's there but the businesses, so when the economy 
picks up, we'll be ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
 A retired Navy lieutenant who now works as an engineer, Gunderson also cites 
local business as his top priority. Sales tax revenues in the last quarter of 
1993 were down nearly 10% from the same quarter in 1992, a trend Gunderson said 
the city cannot afford to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the city needs to continue its work with merchants to help them 
recover from the earthquake, including making grant funds and low-cost loans 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson, 59, said he plans to work just half time at his engineering firm to 
increase the time he has for city business. "Business and the general economy 
really are the No. 1 concerns among everybody here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 John (Chappy) Morris Sr., a longtime resident who owns a local car dealership 
and has extensive farming interests in Fillmore, said the city is facing severe 
challenges in bouncing back from the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said each of the three candidates appears up to the task. 
</P>
<P>
 "All three of them are good," he said. "But they have to aggressively go after 
a better sales tax base, and encourage business." 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, Morris said the city needs to focus on two areas: creating a 
tourist destination of shops and restaurants out of a 13-acre railroad site the 
city has purchased, and balancing the city's housing stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fillmore's main income in the past has been based on oil and citrus," Morris 
said. "But with the depleting oil activity, the Medfly . . . things don't look 
so rosy." 
</P>
<P>
 John McKinnon, who chairs the Fillmore Film Commission and is active in other 
city projects, agreed with Pressey. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no one, big issue to chew on," said McKinnon, who said the 
candidates' similar positions make it difficult to distinguish between them.  
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, we're lucky that there's three good, qualified people that are 
running," he said. "The problems we've had are being addressed."

HUENEME MAKES COMPROMISE ON RV PARK TOP PRIORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Port Hueneme City Council has directed staff members to try to work out a 
compromise with the California Coastal Commission in a last-ditch effort to 
build a recreational-vehicle park on a city beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The move came nearly five weeks after the Coastal Commission rejected the 
city's original plan, deciding that the site proposed for the 144-space RV 
resort was an environmentally sensitive habitat.  
</P>
<P>
 But Coastal Commission staff said the beachfront project could be built if it 
was moved 290 feet north toward the municipal pier and away from fragile sand 
dunes and wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 It also required that the city add overnight tent camping, which would replace 
half the RV stalls the city wanted to build, said Tom Figg, director of 
community development. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 4-1 vote shortly after midnight Wednesday, the council directed city 
employees to work with the commission staff to find a compromise that will 
comply with commission recommendations and be acceptable to the city.  
</P>
<P>
 Figg said the city is asking the commission to withdraw the requirements for 
the overnight tent spots and to move the resort northwest instead of north. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project as recommended by the Coastal Commission is too close to the 
pier, and that would destroy the character of the beach," Figg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Figg said the Coastal Commission had invited the city to resubmit the project 
and that city staff members have been meeting with Coastal Commission staff 
since the commissioners reviewed the proposal at the panel's September meeting 
in Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 Toni Young, the only council member to vote against the project, said she 
still doubts the resort would generate the $400,000 a year that city officials 
predict. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are unable to increase retail sales in Port Hueneme," Young said. "How are 
we going to attract RVs when we don't even have freeway access to the city? I 
don't think this project is appropriate in any circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
 But other council members disagreed, saying that the park would be a good 
source of revenue for the financially strapped city, and that the proposal 
should be expedited. 
</P>
<P>
 By sending the plan back to the commission as soon as possible, Councilman 
Dorill Wright said, the city is making it easier for the incoming council to 
continue with the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't act now, we are denying the new council the opportunity to carry 
on this project without having to spend more money," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents at the Wednesday meeting felt that since the city has agreed 
to move the resort, the city should seek new public input. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that the council "completely ignored the needs of the residents and 
voted to send what is basically a new proposal," said Larry Bailey, a homeowner 
near the proposed site. "We need to have a public hearing so we can understand 
what this new proposal is about." 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials said they had a public hearing in May and there is no need 
for another one. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Brigham, a spokesman for the homeowners association of the Surfside III 
Condominiums near the proposed site, said earlier this week that the 309 
members of the association authorized the board to do "whatever it takes to 
defeat the RV park project." 
</P>
<P>
 "If the project is approved, we will tie it up in courts for years," Brigham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the Coastal Commission is expected to look at the RV 
proposal again during its Nov. 15-18 meeting in San Diego.

VENTURA TO START CITY MANAGER INTERVIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council today will begin interviewing six men and one woman, 
all of them Californians, who are vying for the city's top job. 
</P>
<P>
 The position has been open since July 1, when former City Manager John Baker 
resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the candidates -- Terry Adelman, Ventura's director of management 
resources, and Everett Millais, the director of community resources -- already 
work for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will not release the names of the other candidates because in 
some cases their colleagues do not know they are applying for the job.  
</P>
<P>
 A source close to the process said that of the five outside candidates, three 
are city managers in Northern California. One is a county administrator in a 
Northern California county of about 150,000 people, and one is an assistant 
city manager in a central California city of fewer than 50,000 people.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the three city managers, two manage cities of fewer than 40,000 people. The 
third manages a major California city. 
</P>
<P>
 Millais has spent most of his working life in Ventura after accepting a job as 
an assistant city planner just out of graduate school in 1973. He was promoted 
to his current post, one of the top ones at City Hall, in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Adelman spent the bulk of his career in the San Francisco Bay area, working in 
various financial posts for East Bay cities and counties. He also spent five 
years in the private sector as a political consultant. Adelman came to Ventura 
seven years ago. Ventura lost Baker, its city manager of 12 years, when he quit 
July 1 to start a consulting firm with an old friend, a former city manager of 
Cincinnati. Baker was paid $108,000 a year plus benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Thomas, who retired in 1993 as top administrator in Santa Barbara, has 
been serving as interim city manager.  
</P>
<P>
 Baker said when he stepped down that he was tired of dealing with warring 
special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "What bugs me most about governing is, when there's not enough money to just 
throw it at a problem, the pressure groups start their lobbying," Baker said in 
late June. "There's more and more pressure on government with less and less 
ability to (get results)." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, immediately after Baker announced his resignation in April, the 
council members began bickering among themselves over what type of person 
should be hired as his successor. Even today, six months later, many have 
conflicting visions. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jim Monahan, who served on the council that hired Baker, says that 
if he had his way he would just promote Millais. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gregory L. Carson wants someone with experience in tourism-oriented 
cities, someone who "has been proven creative in the cities he came from 
before." Carson is the council's primary tourism proponent, expending great 
effort on the drive to spiff up downtown and make it more attractive to 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rosa Lee Measures, one of the council's most enthusiastic business 
boosters, said she is looking for a candidate with a strong financial 
background. Measures herself is a former banker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hearing (from residents) that this community wants someone with 
experience in economic development," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members plan to sequester themselves in a local hotel room for the 
interviews, which will begin at 8 a.m. today and continue Saturday morning if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman Roberts, the professional headhunter the city has hired to conduct the 
search, said he believes council members will winnow their list down to one or 
two candidates by Monday. Then, he said, various council members will call the 
finalists' colleagues and supervisors before making an offer to the most 
attractive candidate.

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION POST REDUCED TO PART-TIME JOB; BUDGET: ADVOCATES FOR WOMEN 
AND MINORITIES ARE ANGERED BY THE DECISION TO SLASH FUNDING FOR THE COUNTY 
WATCHDOG ON RACE AND SEX DISCRIMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Budget cuts have eliminated Ventura County's official watchdog on race and sex 
discrimination, reducing the position to a part-time job and angering advocates 
for women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Forced to trim 15% from his budget, Personnel Director Ronald Komers cut 
funding for the county's full-time affirmative action officer, who monitors 
minority recruiting and hiring and investigates complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The move comes at a time when minorities make up nearly a third of the county 
government's work force, but hold only 7% of the executive jobs and remain 
underrepresented in middle-management and law enforcement, according to a study 
released in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Bland, chairman of the Affirmative Action Advisory Committee, said he 
fears that the loss of the full-time position will erode the county's progress 
in recruiting and hiring minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 "At best, the result can only be an uneven application of the principles and 
practices of Affirmative Action and at worst total neglect," Bland warned in a 
letter to the Board of Supervisors this week asking the position be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the letter, Bland said he plans to address the issue during the 
supervisors' meeting on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Komers could not be reached for comment, but other officials described the 
position as a luxury the county could no longer afford. Faced with a deficit 
reaching $16 million, the supervisors slashed deep into departments in July. 
The cuts come on top of four years of budget shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "The priorities have not changed," said Robert Hirtensteiner, assistant chief 
administrative officer. "We are certainly concerned and that is still a top 
priority. I think Mr. Komers felt it could be added with some functions." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Diaz, who has served as the county's affirmative action officer since 
the position as created in 1982, will now have primary responsibility for 
assisting four county departments with recruitment and hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 She will share the work for the county's affirmative action program with half 
a dozen other co-workers, who also have full workloads helping various county 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bland said he worries that diluting the affirmative action duties sends a 
message to department heads that the program is no longer a priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "It says that when times are good and the budget is there, it's one of those 
nice things to do. But when times get tough, this is dispensable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the reorganization, Diaz will no longer be responsible for investigating 
complaints by county employees about unfair promotions or alleged 
discrimination. Until now, she has handled about 20 complaints every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, such grievances will be directed to an affirmative action coordinator 
within each department. Bland said that system could discourage employees from 
filing complaints and place coordinators in the awkward position of 
investigating their superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would never really know how far you could go without jeopardizing your 
own career," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If employees do not feel comfortable with the county's new internal 
investigation system, they could take their grievances to the employees' union 
or the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hirtensteiner said he does not think the reorganization will limit employees' 
abilities to report abuses or perceived wrongs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have enough checks and balances that we would hopefully head off 
any potential problems we would create," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk said the board will continue to monitor the 
county's progress on affirmative action. But she said the county cannot afford 
to restore the full-time position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although I sympathize with what Bob (Bland) is saying, I hear this every day 
from various . . . departments and constituencies," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have got to start to understand that you can't do all the wonderful 
things we've done in the past when we don't have the money."

OZONE RANKING AMONG WORST; ENVIRONMENT: POOR COUNTY SHOWING OCCURS DESPITE 
SIGNIFICANT SMOG REDUCTIONS IN PAST TWO DECADES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only 12 areas in the nation registered worse ozone pollution than Ventura 
County last year, according to new Environmental Protection Agency statistics 
released this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The county also ranked sixth worst in the nation for the number of days that 
air quality failed to meet federal health standards for ozone pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The poor showing for 1993 comes despite some of the most stringent regulations 
in the world and significant reductions in smog over the last 20 years, area 
pollution control officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's air quality failed to meet federal health standards on 122 days 
in 1974, compared to 13 days in 1993 and 15 days so far this year, said Bill 
Mount, deputy director of the Ventura County Air Pollution Control District. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA shows that the county's air did not meet standards on 18 days in 1993. 
But EPA figures include a state-operated station that is not included in county 
figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Peak concentrations of ozone, a primary component of smog, also dropped 
substantially from 0.260 parts per million in 1974 to 0.150 parts per million 
or less this year and last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't necessarily pollute more per capita than other areas, but we have 
the perfect conditions for smog," Mount said. "We have the right topography and 
meteorology with the onshore winds that blow everything into the inland 
valleys, and we have a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA report still classifies the county as having a "severe" air quality 
problem, a category exceeded only by the Los Angeles area's "extreme" rating. 
Those designations have not changed since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest annual statistics, released Wednesday, come less than three weeks 
before the Ventura County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider the 
county's new plan to guide clean air programs over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The county, along with other areas of the nation, is required by amendments to 
the federal Clean Air Act to write a plan showing that the county's air will no 
longer fail the health standards by 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county's new plan, which is to be considered Nov. 8, does not contain 
enough measures to meet the standards. The standards require that the ozone 
concentration in the air must not exceed 0.120 parts per million on more than 
three days during a three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The county has already tightly regulated most of the pollution sources within 
its control, including emissions from businesses and industries such as 
manufacturing operations, power plants, dry cleaners, roofers, auto body shops 
and others, Mount said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the state and federal governments have jurisdiction over major polluters 
such as cars, ships, trains and interstate trucks, which account for more than 
50% of the pollutants that cause smog. Agricultural sources such as pesticides 
also cannot be regulated by the local air pollution district. 
</P>
<P>
 However, with state and federal measures that will become available after a 
federal clean air plan is adopted in February, the county will be able to show 
it can meet clean air goals by 2005, said Scott Johnson, manager of planning 
for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The state and federal governments both are working on regulations to control 
emissions from pesticides, he said. The state has a new mobile source plan to 
require use and manufacture of cleaner cars for use in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And a federal plan, which is due to be adopted on Feb. 14, will include 
provisions to curb pollution from ships, trains and interstate trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 That document, called the Federal Implementation Plan, was drafted by the EPA 
on court order after districts in Ventura, Sacramento and the Los Angeles area 
failed to show in their 1982 air quality plans that air quality would meet 
federal standards by 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal plan, which contained some provisions in its draft form that many 
business and government leaders feared would devastate the local economy, will 
be imposed on the three areas after it is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county can then take appropriate measures from that plan and from a 
similar state plan and incorporate them into a revised 1994 Air Quality 
Management Plan, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're recommending that we do a 1995 revision to our plan almost before the 
ink is dry," he said. "But the important thing is that we're showing we won't 
need the (federal) measures that are generating the most controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson referred to one provision in the draft EPA plan that called for 
industry to reduce emissions 25% every year, regardless of whether they had 
already cut emissions by installing state-of-the-art equipment. The only way to 
achieve those goals would have been to cut production, business and air 
pollution officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A second provision in the draft plan would have allowed large trucks coming 
from out of state to make only one stop in the county. That provision would 
have caused trouble for the agriculture industry, which depends on the same 
vehicle picking up loads from several packinghouses and fields. The EPA 
determines the severity of air quality problems based on the number of days 
that federal health standards are not met. Here are the areas considered worse 
than Ventura County for 1993. 02,25,20 Days Area of nation standards exceeded

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: USE OF RUBBER ON RAIL TRACKS STUDIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to complaints that bumpy railroad crossings are damaging cars and 
injuring cyclists in the San Fernando Valley, City Councilman Hal Bernson on 
Wednesday asked city officials to study the purchase of rubber material to make 
all crossings safer in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In a motion before the City Council, Bernson asked the city's Department of 
Transportation to identify the number of railroad crossings that would be 
eligible for repairs and determine the cost-effectiveness of purchasing the 
rubber material to be installed within the railroad right-of-way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had more than a dozen recent complains from people, including people on 
their bicycles who get their tires caught in the tracks and have broken legs 
and arms," said Francine Oschin, legislative deputy for Bernson. "And people 
with cars say the tracks are smashing up their cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Don Rosenberg, who sits on the city's Bicycle Advisory Committee, said the 
problem occurs for bicyclists when tires get stuck in decaying wooden planks 
between the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the the Valley, Rosenberg said two of the most dangerous crossings are 
those at Tampa and White Oak avenues, where rotting tracks lie in disuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a car, it's just a bump, but on a bike it can kill you," said Rosenberg, 
57, who lives in Porter Ranch. "Metrolink is fixing some of them, but they are 
not going fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to consider the motion next week. Oschin said several 
Ventura County cities use the material at rail crossings, including Oxnard and 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever is good enough for Ventura County is good enough for the San 
Fernando Valley," Ochin said. "There are a lot of tracks in the San Fernando 
Valley. If you live in the north San Fernando Valley, there is no way to avoid 
them." JEFF SCHNAUFER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; AUDIT 
FINDS RIORDAN, WOO DONATIONS EXCEEDED LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Releasing final audits of the 1993 mayoral campaign, the costliest in Los 
Angeles history, the city Ethics Commission Thursday found Mayor Richard 
Riordan and his opponent, former Councilman Michael Woo, received several 
thousand of dollars in contributions in excess of legal limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, the reviews concluded that both candidates substantially 
complied with tougher election laws enacted after the ethics controversies in 
the latter years of former Mayor Tom Bradley's Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's campaign, which spent $9.6 million, received $7,000 in impermissible 
donations, the report said. Woo, who spent nearly $6 million, received about 
$16,000 in unallowable contributions, including $3,655 in public matching funds 
for contributor checks that later bounced. Woo also received $583 worth of 
computer material not reimbursed from one of the former councilman's 
non-campaign committees.  
</P>
<P>
 Woo's attorney said funds would be returned to contributors or to the city 
treasury where warranted. A Riordan campaign spokesman was not immediately 
available for comment.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: U.S. SURVEY FINDS DAY 
CARE A KEY ISSUE FOR WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHING-CHING NI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Frausto says she can't afford day care near her job for a federal agency 
in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if she could, she says, the waiting list is long and it would be 
inconvenient to bring her children each day on the hourlong bus rides to and 
from work.  
</P>
<P>
 The federal government wants to make work and family easier to juggle for 
women like Frausto. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich came to Los Angeles City Hall Thursday to 
release results of a survey in which 250,000 working women around the country 
voiced their needs and frustrations.  
</P>
<P>
 "This survey should be a wake-up call to the private and public sector," Reich 
said. "All across the country public and private sector employers have a very 
long way to go. They are not providing nearly the quantity and the quality of 
day care women need on the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Nussbaum, director of the Labor Department's Women's Bureau, which 
conducted the study, said it revealed that working women say the stress of 
balancing work and personal lives is the most crucial issue facing them. Along 
with job training, discrimination, lack of health insurance and other benefits, 
the majority of the women cited child care as one of the most important issues. 
</P>
<P>
 About 56% of the women surveyed said they have serious problems finding 
quality child care. A third said it is their most serious problem connected 
with work. More than half said better access to information on where to find 
care is a high priority for improving their workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. has the highest percentage of working women of any city in the country," 
Mayor Richard Riordan said. Seventy percent of women work in either the public 
or private sector, he said, adding that action needs to be take based on the 
findings.  
</P>
<P>
 Reich said the Clinton Administration will use the findings to guide future 
policies. Among the issues being looked at are how to "upgrade enforcement of 
anti-discrimination laws," how to "push for more equal pay" and how to 
"re-examine labor laws based on women's needs."  
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum said she and Reich will soon begin work on a mandate from Clinton to 
submit by next March "serious initiatives" the federal government could 
undertake to address the issues raised in the survey.  
</P>
<P>
 But many women questioned after the announcement were skeptical about seeing 
real changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not hopeful," said Myrna Morales, another federal worker. "It's been said 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 The women said they need changes now.  
</P>
<P>
 As a single mother of three young children, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Donna 
Roller said she cannot send her children to a day care center run by the city 
because it is open Monday through Friday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. She often works 
long hours, on weekends and holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I absolutely love my job," she said. "But child care is an extremely 
important issue to women police officers, especially during emergencies. You 
work 15-16 hours (a day) for weeks on end. You hardly get home in time to get 
back to work. I can't tell you enough how important this is."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; 16TH VALLEY AIR DERBY IS SET FOR TAKEOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Come Saturday, they will check their navigational equipment one last time, 
review flight plans, collect good-luck kisses from their husbands and 
boyfriends, and give their light planes full throttle as they head north into 
hoped-for blue skies. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the women pilots who will be competing in a daylong air race from Van 
Nuys Airport to Mesquite, Nev., about 90 miles northeast of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't call it a "powder-puff" race -- a name associated with another 
famous race for women pilots, in any case -- they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitors call it a unique opportunity for experienced and novice pilots to 
sharpen their flying and navigational skills. Besides, say race officials, even 
though it is organized by a women's group, about half of the estimated 25 
racers will be men. 
</P>
<P>
 Past participants say they compete in the Valley Air Derby, now in its 16th 
year, as much for the fun and camaraderie as they do for the experience.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun, it's challenging, and it helps you to increase your long-distance 
piloting skills," said Paula Sandling, a Woodland Hills resident who has 
finished in the top 10 in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 The race is sponsored by the San Fernando Valley chapter of the Ninety Nines, 
an international women pilots association whose first president was Amelia 
Earhart, America's most famous woman pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Planes of many types will begin taking off at 9 a.m. and fly northeast on a 
timed, 400-mile zigzag course that will take them over the Grapevine, through 
the Antelope Valley and Mojave Desert and across the southern tip of Nevada.  
</P>
<P>
 Pilots are required to perform seven flybys -- whipping just 200 feet above a 
timing line at speeds up to 200 m.p.h. -- at airports along the way to allow 
race officials to make sure no one has taken any unauthorized shortcuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to winning the Derby, say those in the know, is staying strictly on 
course and finding the altitudes with the best tail winds. Because each plane 
is assigned a handicap based on its performance level, even a first-time racer 
can win, said Mary Rawlings, chairwoman of the Air Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Rawlings, only once in the Derby's history has there been a 
near-accident -- several years ago, when an aircraft lost power and its pilot 
was forced to make an emergency landing in the desert. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only danger is the weather," said Gloria May, who with partner Dene 
Chabot-Fence won the Derby in 1992. "If people go out and fly into a 
thunderstorm, or if they get careless with their fuel consumption and they run 
out of fuel, well, it gives aviation a bad name." 
</P>
<P>
 The diciest moments of May's 35 years as a pilot came in September, 1993, when 
she and Chabot-Fence flew the Mile High Derby, a 500-mile race originating in 
Denver. After stopping at an airport along the route for fuel, they started 
climbing again, but not as fast as they should have. They struggled to clear a 
mountain range that loomed menacingly before them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hedge-hopping over those mountains," recalled May, a resident of 
Kerman, near Fresno. "That was a little hairy." 
</P>
<P>
 Racers say they enjoy the race because of the challenge of figuring out the 
course, which changes every year, and because of the people.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's designed to be an interesting race," said Madeline Kurrasch of Palos 
Verdes. "It's neat because we will be out over the desert." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the camaraderie and the competition," May said.  
</P>
<P>
 After a tiring day of flying, the racers will gather at Mesquite's Virgin 
River Hotel for the time-honored tradition of trying to tease people's scores 
out of them. The point of the game is to figure out how one stacked up against 
everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is telling lies," chuckled Sandling. "They're trying to get 
information out of you to see if maybe they won a trophy." 
</P>
<P>
 The top three finishers get token cash awards and the top five get trophies, 
Rawlings said. This year, she hopes the race will net $1,800 for the Ninety 
Nines' scholarship program for student pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ninety Nines was founded in 1929 in Long Island, N.Y., to further aviation 
education and safety and promote women in aviation. Valley women pilots founded 
the local chapter, based at Van Nuys Airport, in 1952. Among its 90 members are 
three former WASPs, or Women Air Force Service Pilots, who during World War II 
ferried aircraft across the country and performed other flying duties for the 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Glassman, the chapter's president, said that despite women's gains in 
aviation, there is still a need for an organization like the Ninety Nines. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Women pilots) still need that companionship, that mentorship, that 
encouragement to continue to go on," she said. "They still have doors that they 
need to get through. We still have a long way to go." KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: COLLEGE DISTRICT OPPOSES PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trustees of the Los Angeles Community College District, where minorities 
compose nearly three-quarters of the 104,000 students, have joined the growing 
roster of local public officials and groups to oppose Proposition 187, the 
controversial immigration initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 6-0 vote Wednesday night, the district's Board of Trustees went on record 
opposing the Nov. 8 ballot measure that, among other restrictions, would deny 
illegal immigrants access to the state's public colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a nutshell, folks, Proposition 187 is a demagogue's dream," said Trustee 
David Lopez-Lee, a USC professor who sponsored the board's resolution. 
Lopez-Lee also blasted Gov. Pete Wilson for supporting the measure, which 
Lopez-Lee said "appeals to the basest of emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez-Lee complained that the measure would discriminate against legal Asian 
and Latino residents because they would be the most likely ones to have their 
citizenship status challenged. And he charged that federal officials have never 
fully enforced existing federal provisions against hiring illegals. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, the state's community colleges generally accept illegal immigrants 
as students, although they pay the same higher fees as non-California 
residents. The Los Angeles district asks students if they are U. S. citizens, 
but only for the purpose of determining fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the measure, the community colleges, Cal State and University of 
California systems would be required to verify the citizenship status of new 
and existing students beginning in the spring, and would have to report 
suspected illegal immigrants to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the so-called "Save Our State" measure argue that illegal 
immigrants should not have access to publicly subsidized college educations. 
The measure would also bar illegal immigrants from a range of other state- and 
county-funded benefits, including non-emergency health care. JOHN CHANDLER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY LAWYERS MAY LOSE THEIR RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the market for a home loan, Ron Bamieh should not have been surprised when 
the bank officer asked the magic question: How much money do you make? 
</P>
<P>
 But Bamieh, a Ventura County deputy district attorney, said Thursday that he 
put his home loan application on hold because he did not have the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bamieh is one of 25 county attorneys who were given pay hikes in July, only to 
be told this week that raises were improper and are being taken back. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, lawyers released the list showing exactly how much the county says 
it inadvertently paid them. Overall, the 28 lawyers received $45,000 from the 
county and may now have to reimburse the money, said Thomas A. Mahon, county 
auditor-controller. 
</P>
<P>
 Bamieh, 28, might have to refund $1,125. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will say that I don't legally believe they can take it back," he said. He 
was making $40,000 a year with the raise and will be making $33,000 if county 
officials revoke it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 County personnel officials said they plan to revoke the raises, starting with 
deductions in the lawyers' first November paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 Personnel Director Ronald Komers has said his staff mistakenly approved the 
raise. Because county employees were under a wage freeze from July, 1993, to 
July, 1994, the lawyers should not have received raises for their service to 
the county during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the lawyers are fighting the county the best way they know 
how: They hired a lawyer Thursday to investigate their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin G. DeNoce, vice president of the district attorney's association, 
criticized the personnel office for the flap. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is government bureaucracy. Inefficiency. Not knowing what they are 
doing," DeNoce said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a way to treat employees and to run a government business."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; CITY COUNCIL VOTES TO OPPOSE PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Swayed by a packed room of residents opposed to Proposition 187, the Moorpark 
City Council has voted to oppose the statewide initiative that would deny 
education and health care benefits to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly I'm really relieved by this vote," said Councilman Bernardo Perez, 
who introduced the resolution."I've been urging groups all across the county to 
oppose this proposition, and at the least I wanted my own town to come out 
against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Scott Montgomery, who has touted his support of the initiative in 
his campaign for a seat on the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, voted 
against the resolution, and Mayor Paul Lawrason abstained from the 3-1 vote at 
the council meeting Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen residents who spoke on the resolution opposed the initiative. 
Several charged that flyers sent by the Montgomery campaign in support of 
Proposition 187 were racist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me sick," lifelong Moorpark resident Nellie Meza said. "I felt like I 
was being stabbed in the back, and yet he was asking for my vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery also received some harsh criticism from Perez for the flyer, which 
listed his five-point plan to "Stop the Illegal Alien Rip-Off" in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't a racist bone in my body," Montgomery said in response. "I've 
heard a lot of accusations thrown at me . . . for having the courage to state 
that I was going to vote for 187. I think reasonable people can disagree on 
this one issue and still work together. " SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MARR RANCH PROJECT TENTATIVELY OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A developer has received tentative approval for a plan to build 550 homes on 
the rolling hills of Marr Ranch in northwest Simi Valley as part of an 
elaborate agreement that will bring the city $3.5 million and 1,800 acres of 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement between the city and developer Long Beach Equities was approved 
by the Simi Valley Planning Commission on Wednesday and must still be reviewed 
by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The only opposition to the development of estate-sized homes on 900 acres 
north of Presidio Drive came from a group of landowners whose parents and 
grandparents purchased lots in the area during the early part of this century. 
</P>
<P>
 About 160 tiny lots are checkered within the boundaries of the land planned 
for open space preservation, but were never purchased by Long Beach Equities. 
</P>
<P>
 Title holders to those lots, bought on the promise of future development in 
the area, said they should have been included in any agreement to develop Marr 
Ranch. The plan before the commission Wednesday, they said, would render their 
properties undevelopable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, after paying taxes on this land for 60 years, we've been left 
dangling in the wind," said 71-year-old Russell Page, a Santa Ana engineer 
whose mother bought 4,000 square feet of land in 1931." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Friedman, who spoke for Long Beach Equities, said the agreement only 
involves land owned by his company. He said his company did not purchase the 
160 lots because "it appeared to us that those lots have no value." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners said they were sympathetic to the landowners, but found nothing 
that would prevent them from approving the project. MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; PORN ACTRESS GETS 2-YEAR PRISON TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A porn actress from Newbury Park, who lost her chance at probation because she 
made a graphic statement about her sexual encounter with a minor, was sentenced 
Thursday to two years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Arden, 45, decided not to withdraw her guilty plea to four felony 
charges after the judge said he would give her the minimum prison sentence.She 
will serve about half the sentence before she is released. 
</P>
<P>
 Arden pleaded guilty in September after Superior Court Judge Charles W. 
Campbell Jr. promised her probation. After reading the probation report, 
however, Campbell changed his mind because of the way Arden described two 
sexual encounters she had with a 14-year-old boy in April and May. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she seduced the boy because she felt sorry for him. 
</P>
<P>
 She pleaded guilty to two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, 
one count of sexual penetration with a foreign object and one count of showing 
explicit photos to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Arden met the boy through a youth employment program when she hired him to 
help her move. Campbell said he chose the minimum possible prison sentence 
because mitigating factors far outweighed the aggravating circumstances of the 
offense. Deputy Dist. Atty. Tom Connors said he agreed that the sentence was 
fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sends a message, plus it recognizes the fact that she doesn't have a 
criminal record," the prosecutor said. BARBARA MURPHY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY TO HIRE EXPERTS TO PLAN FOR 
BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heeding the requests of local business leaders, the Thousand Oaks City Council 
has agreed to hire outside consultants to plan the long-debated renovation of 
the city's deteriorated major thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 Tuesday to spend $15,000 for architects and planners 
to map out the future development of Thousand Oaks Boulevard.Councilwoman Elois 
Zeanah opposed the plan, saying she did not believe it was supported by a 
majority of business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two dozen representatives from shops along the boulevard gathered 
last month and agreed to back the plan. Residents and businesses have 
complained about crime, deteriorating buildings and a lack of adequate parking 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is proposed, the group of experts will spend four to five days meeting 
with business owners, residents and city officials to determine how the 
majority of citizens would like the boulevard to look. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, they will outline plans to overhaul the area. The city can later use the 
blueprint to coordinate improvements and begin approving specific projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar, who failed to gain the council's support in previous 
attempts to hire outside experts, said she would ensure that the business 
community was involved in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has to be the businesses' plan," she said. "Otherwise it will never 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners at the Tuesday night meeting said they approved of the plan as 
long is it meant action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not talk about this any more," said businessman Larry Carignan. "Let's 
get something done." 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar said the consultants would probably begin work early next year. MATTHEW

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUNLAND-TUJUNGA; MOUNTED POLICE PATROLLING SANCTUARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From trash dumpers to naked men, the Tujunga Ponds Wildlife Sanctuary has 
attracted an array of troublemakers, frustrating police who have found it 
nearly impossible to catch anyone in the hostile terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 Time to bring in the cavalry. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, police and city officials announced that mounted patrols will 
spend weekends working the 13-acre site, which is closed to the public to 
protect animals such as ducks and crawdads. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of rocks in the area so we can't get in on bicycles or even 
off-road motorcycles," said Los Angeles Police Department Officer Jay Phillips. 
"With the horses, we can get into hard-to-reach areas." 
</P>
<P>
 The wilderness, located on unincorporated county property at 9500 Foothill 
Blvd., is a maze of shrubbery and rocks accessible by foot. The key features 
are two ponds, each about a half-mile in circumference and up to 50 feet deep, 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two police officers from the LAPD's mounted patrol unit began roaming the 
wetlands on weekends about three weeks ago, Phillips said. But the patrols were 
not officially announced until Thursday, when Los Angeles City Councilman Joel 
Wachs held a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 New no-parking signs will also be placed along the boundaries of the 
wilderness area to discourage people from entering. 
</P>
<P>
 Since late spring, neighbors have complained about the weekend goings-on in 
the sanctuary, which is under the jurisdiction of the LAPD Foothill Division, 
where Phillips is stationed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a City Council panel on public safety heard complaints from the 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of complaints about people with guns, public drunkenness, and 
people taking their clothes off and getting naked," said Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the horse-powered detail will initially operate during daylight 
hours. In addition to the crime problems, the stepped-up patrol will also be on 
the lookout for wildfires sparked by illegal campfires. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pond area is located in a mountain fire district," Phillips said. "We've 
had two fires in the district all year and now it's the beginning of fire 
season." JEFF SCHNAUFER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MONTEREY PARK; COUNCIL 
REPLACES OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF RACIAL REMARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Monterey Park City Council decided Wednesday night not to reappoint 
library board member Kathleen Brzozowski, who made what critics say were 
racially tinged remarks about a fellow board member and threw a cup of water at 
a Chinese American activist. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the council's five members voted to replace Brzozowski with Joyce 
Mangrum, a former library worker and city employee.Brzozowski, 73, did not 
attend the selection meeting for the city's boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the majority of the council decided there needed to be a change. 
There needed to be someone who could focus on the important issues of the 
library," Mayor Judy Chu said.  
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Monterey Park library board last month called on Brzozowski to 
apologize or resign after she threw the water toward a Chinese American 
political activist. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Brzozowski said fellow board member Marina Tse "had a problem 
understanding English," was not suited to be a board member and should take a 
"low position until she learned the language."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
MCKEON TO SEEK FOREIGN TRADE ZONE IN WEST VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) announced Thursday that he 
will petition the Commerce Department for a foreign trade zone to help 
manufacturers in the west San Fernando Valley bounce back from the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The formation of a trade zone, which exempts manufacturers from paying customs 
and excise taxes on exports, would stimulate economic development by attracting 
businesses and encouraging the expansion of existing ones, McKeon said in an 
appearance at Duke's Inc., a Chatsworth firm that makes airplane parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Such trade zones have been established at the ports of Los Angeles and Long 
Beach and in a portion of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, now in a reelection campaign against Democratic challenger James 
Gilmartin, will file the formal application after the Nov. 8 election, an aide 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmartin called the proposal a great idea but questioned whether McKeon has 
the political skill to bring it about. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a boundary for the zone has not been determined, it would include 
portions of Canoga Park and Chatsworth.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; JUDGE 
SENTENCES MAN WHO LEFT BABY LOCKED IN CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A high school English teacher who left his 20-month-old son in a locked car in 
100-degree heat was sentenced Thursday to time already served in jail, 100 
hours of community service in a children's hospital and three years' probation 
in a plea agreement with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Karl Fischer, 34, of Paramount, avoided a preliminary hearing on a 
felony child endangerment charge by pleading guilty to the reduced charge of 
misdemeanor child endangerment.A felony conviction would have carried a maximum 
six-year prison term. 
</P>
<P>
 After imposing sentence on Fischer, Van Nuys Municipal Court Judge Jessica 
Perrin Silvers told him that "something could have happened," as a result of 
the incident. "How lucky you are that it didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, who teaches 10th- and 12th-grade English and is the department 
chairman at Fremont High School in South-Central Los Angeles, also was ordered 
to pay $100 to the state restitution fund and to complete a 13-session 
parenting class.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SEASON 
TICKET HOLDER SUES DODGERS FOR REFUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Dodgers fan sued the baseball club Thursday, contending that he 
and other season ticket holders deserve all their money back because the 
players' strike made the 1994 season "meaningless."  
</P>
<P>
 In his Los Angeles Superior Court lawsuit, William Schellbach says the games 
he attended before the strike "turned out to be nothing more than meaningless 
exhibitions."The Dodgers have refunded money for the canceled portion of the 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither Schellbach's lawyers nor a spokesman for the Dodgers could be reached 
for comment. Schellbach wants the court to accept his complaint as a 
class-action lawsuit on behalf of himself and up to 20,000 other season ticket 
holders.  
</P>
<P>
 Schellbach, who alleges that the Los Angeles Dodgers Inc. violated its 
contract to carry out "an entire baseball season," wants either compensatory 
damages or a direct refund for his season tickets and parking passes.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; ETHICS 
PANEL VOWS TO PRESS FOR QUARTERLY FUND REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city Ethics Commission on Thursday vowed to continue pressing 
for a requirement that officials file twice as many reports on how they use 
special "officeholder" funds, despite opposition from an influential city 
councilman. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal to require elected officials to file quarterly reports instead of 
the semiannual reports now required is part of a larger reform package the 
commission has proposed to crack down on abuses in the officeholder accounts 
controlled by each elected official. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Richard Alatorre, head of the council's Rules and Elections 
Committee, opposed quarterly reporting when the panel considered elements of 
the package last week, saying it would create too much paperwork. His 
committee, however, supported a proposal to triple the amount elected officials 
can spend and collect in the account. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Thursday, the Ethics Commission reaffirmed its support for the 
quarterly reporting, calling it a trade-off for allowing elected officials to 
collect and spend more. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are always pushing the envelope (on spending) and the pushing of the 
envelope requires us to have quarterly reporting," said Ethics Commission 
President Dennis Curtis, who vowed to press for quarterly reporting when the 
matter comes before the City Council early next month.

 What can you do to protect yourself from crime? 
</P>
<P>
 The Glendale Police Department plans to answer this and related questions at a 
free Crime Prevention Expo, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at City Hall.In addition 
to police, representatives from about 15 local stores that sell home security 
and other anti-crime merchandise will attend, and there will be demonstrations 
on self-protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of this is to let the public know we're available to help them in 
such ways as coming to the community to talk about forming Neighborhood Watch 
groups, or inspecting residences for security," said Kathy Allen, a community 
service officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Held in connection with California Crime Prevention Month and the first of its 
kind in the city, the expo will also provide answers to some of the most 
frequently asked security questions, Allen said. Those questions include how to 
secure sliding and double-hung windows against intruders. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses scheduled to be on hand for the event include private security 
companies, home security and car alarm dealers and a cellular phone company.  
</P>
<P>
 Students from the International Karate Assn. of Glendale will demonstrate 
self-defense techniques, organizers said. STEVE RYFLE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; PROTESTS OVER SALES AT LIQUOR STORE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chanting "Stop breaking the law!" about 30 students, community activists and 
Ventura County officials protested an Oxnard liquor store that has been cited 
repeatedly for selling alcohol to minors for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alcohol is destroying our youth," said Felipe Santana, director of community 
services for the county Alcohol and Drug Programs."We cannot tolerate that in 
Ventura County." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is trying to revoke the 
license of the Stop N' Save Market, 1037 S. Ventura Road, after an 
investigation uncovered numerous violations, said Ed Macias, supervisor of the 
local departmental office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a hearing Monday to revoke the license," Macias said outside the 
store. "Apparently they didn't think they needed to make an appearance." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynrose Dimalanta, the store's owner, has been cited some dozen or more times 
since February for selling liquor to minors, authorities said. Before that, her 
father, T. Roman Paras, was cited nine times for the same offense, Macias said. 
</P>
<P>
 Store workers shut the door and would not comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC officials were trying to revoke Paras' license when he canceled it. His 
daughter then obtained a permit to sell alcohol at the same store. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogelio Boteoo, a 17-year old student at Ventura College, said the store was 
well known to teen-agers as a place where they could buy booze. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows about it, that they can walk in and buy it here," he said. 
"Even my friends in Ventura knew about this place." MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; BATTLE OVER STREET REACHES CITY CLERK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The battle between Ventura residents fighting to reopen Poli Street at Ventura 
High School and those who want to keep it closed spilled over into the city 
clerk's office this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The group working to defeat Measure E, which would reopen the street, noticed 
that opponents had given neither their organization's name nor its address in 
campaign literature, which is a violation of the state elections code. 
</P>
<P>
 In a mailing to 1,000 absentee voters, Concerned Citizens of Ventura put only 
the initials "CCV" above the return addresses on its envelopes. 
</P>
<P>
 And the enclosed pamphlets fail to list even the initials of the group's name 
or its address. The mailing also included a cover letter that fully identified 
the group. 
</P>
<P>
 After anti-Measure E forces gave copies of the literature to City Clerk 
Barbara Kam, she informed Concerned Citizens of Ventura President David 
Gladstone that all campaign literature should identify the sender's name on the 
outside envelopes. Groups must also give their names and addresses on any 
pamphlets they distribute by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Gladstone said the omissions were a mistake. "It was an oversight," he said, 
adding that the organization is reprinting flyers to include the missing 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura High parent Valerie Chrisman, who heads the anti-Measure E group 
known as Poli: Safety Over Convenience, said Concerned Citizens' failure to 
identify itself was deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure E opponents are upset, Chrisman said, because Gladstone's group is 
using the Ventura High School colors gold and black in its literature, which 
she said wrongly implies school support for the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Gladstone, however, said his organization picked the high school's colors 
because the issue is about Ventura High. MAIA DAVIS

 School district officials said Thursday the overruns are not unusual and the 
project is not in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-story classroom building was approved in 1992 and is scheduled to be 
completed by fall, 1995. The building, which will include science laboratories 
and regular classrooms, is needed to ease current overcrowding and accommodate 
a further increase in students as the campus converts to a four-year high 
school, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board approved the extra $64,000 to be paid to contractor C. W. 
Driver for the installation of video cable and modifications to the electrical 
system that were "inadvertently omitted" from the construction plans, said 
Stephen Hodgson, assistant superintendent of business services. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sixth cost overrun since the contract was approved, and a seventh 
-- a $25,000 bill for removing asbestos -- is expected to go before the board 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Vic Pallos, a district spokesman, said unforeseen changes are common and 
construction projects of such magnitude typically exceed the original contract 
amount by about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "By comparison, this project is two-thirds of the way through, and the cost 
overruns are at just over 5%," Pallos said. "And nearly half of that is the 
result of changes the state made in earthquake safety standards, which were 
imposed after the project got started and which we were required to adhere to." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest single addition to the contract was approved in March, when 
construction crews discovered an old oil storage tank buried on the site. The 
school district paid the contractor $99,000 to remove the tank.  
</P>
<P>
 Three earthquake-related changes were made totaling $178,000, and there were 
additional charges of $35,000 for changes to the fire alarm system and $74,000 
for computer cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgson said the $64,000 charge approved this week also includes overtime pay. 
During summer school, the contractor's access to the campus was limited and 
some work was done after hours, he said. STEVE RYFLE

STUDY SEEKS TO DEBUNK STEREOTYPES OF LATINOS; PROP. 187: STUDY SAYS VAST 
MAJORITY OF IMMIGRANTS ARE HARD-WORKING, FAMILY-ORIENTED AND LESS INCLINED TO 
ACCEPT PUBLIC ASSISTANCE THAN OTHER LOW-INCOME GROUPS. CRITICS CALL IT A 
DELIBERATELY NARROW ASSESSMENT.

 The vast majority of Latino immigrants in Los Angeles County are legal 
residents who work hard, earn relatively little, tend to live in traditional 
family settings and are less likely than other low-income people to receive 
public assistance, according to a study scheduled for release today. 
</P>
<P>
 The report is the first detailed examination of 1990 census "microdata" 
samples focusing on the nearly 1.8 million Latino immigrants in the county, 
home to the nation's densest concentration of Latin American immigrants, mostly 
Mexican-born but including Central Americans and others. Previous studies have 
tended to view Latinos as a whole, lumping together U.S. native and 
foreign-born populations. 
</P>
<P>
 The results are being released now, said David E. Hayes-Bautista, principal 
author and a UCLA-based sociologist, in an effort to counter what he called 
widespread misperceptions before the Nov. 8 election. On that day, Californians 
will vote on Proposition 187, the ballot initiative that seeks to bar illegal 
immigrants from receiving public education and other tax-supported benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Numbers are better than shouts," said Hayes-Bautista, author of several 
pioneering studies on California's Latino population, who acknowledged his 
personal opposition to Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Apprised of the new study's results, supporters of the proposition questioned 
its findings, voicing suspicions about what they termed a deliberately narrow 
assessment of the illegal immigrant community. Los Angeles County is widely 
believed to have the nation's largest concentration of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to make it seem as though illegal aliens are not a big deal," 
said Harold W. Ezell, former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service 
Western states commissioner, who is an initiative co-author. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was sponsored by the Alta California Policy Research Center, a Los 
Angeles-based think tank specializing in Latino issues that is headed by 
Hayes-Bautista. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors call for a return to an earlier civic largess that, they argue, 
benefited a poor population that migrated from other states and helped create 
the prosperity of post-World War II California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investing in a youthful, hard-working, forward-looking population was a wise 
decision in the 1940s and 1950s, and is still the wisest approach to a more 
prosperous future for all," the report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ezell rejected any comparisons between today's illegal immigrants and the 
migration of U.S. citizens to California after the war. "What is this about?" 
Ezell asked. "A full employment plan for illegal aliens?" 
</P>
<P>
 In line with other national studies of urban immigrants, the study depicts the 
Latino immigrant population as a kind of sociological paradox. Latino 
immigrants display some characteristics typical of the urban underclass -- 
notably high poverty rates and low education levels -- but also boast tightly 
knit families, a strong work ethic and low use of public services, all 
qualities not usually associated with the inner-city poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Census data for 1990 shows that 3.3 million Latinos lived in Los Angeles 
County, nearly 40% of the 8.8-million total population. Latinos, their ranks 
bolstered by immigration and high birth rates, are projected to represent a 
plurality by 2000, surpassing non-Latino whites. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The report, extrapolating from census and INS data, estimates that fewer than 
300,000 illegal immigrants from Latin America were residing in Los Angeles 
County in 1990 -- a ratio of less than 1 in 5 of all Latino immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some perception that if you're a Latino, you must be an immigrant," 
said Hayes-Bautista, who noted that only slightly more than half of Los Angeles 
County Latinos are foreign-born. "And there's a suspicion that if you're a 
Latino immigrant, you must be illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan C. Nelson, a former INS commissioner and co-author of Proposition 187, 
disputed the findings. Closer to 50% of Latino immigrants probably lack papers, 
Nelson said, which would mean that there were some 900,000 undocumented Latinos 
countywide -- more than three times the new study's projection. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates based on studies by the INS and Los Angeles County put the county's 
undocumented Latino population at one-fifth and one-quarter of all Latino 
immigrants, higher than the new study. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors of the study also assailed what they termed "a widely disseminated 
image" that Latino immigrants are "welfare abusers." Only 16.9% of poor Latino 
adult immigrants received public assistance in 1990, the study noted, compared 
to 64.6% of poor blacks, 50.4% of poor U.S.-born Latinos, 48.8% of poor Asians 
and 41.7% of the comparable non-Latino white population. 
</P>
<P>
 That is so, the study found, despite the fact that Latino immigrants are more 
likely to be poorer than anyone else. The average Latino immigrant household 
income of $29,989 was much lower than those reported for other groups: $52,375 
for non-Latino whites, $49,042 for Asians, $43,777 for U.S.-born Latinos, and 
$32,813 for black households. 
</P>
<P>
 One contributing factor to Latino immigrants' poverty might be a lack of 
formal education -- something the authors trace not to a lack of interest but 
instead to a paucity of advanced schooling in rural Latin America, most 
immigrants' homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that 70.5% of immigrant Latino adults 25 and older had not 
completed high school, by far the largest percentage of any group in Los 
Angeles County. By contrast, only 14.4% of non-Latino white adults lacked high 
school degrees, 20.7% of Asians, 25.4% of blacks and 35.3% of U.S.-born 
Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the authors concluded, Latino immigrants' poverty is more a function 
of low wages than unemployment. Latino immigrants are actually among the 
county's hardest workers, the data shows. Almost 9 of 10 (86%) of immigrant 
Latino men 16 and older participate in the workplace, the researchers found, 
far more than any other group. 
</P>
<P>
 Among women, the study found that slightly under half (49.2%) of all Latina 
immigrants 16 and older were in the work force, compared to more than 50% of 
all other women. But the authors called the Latina employment ratio 
"extraordinary," considering that they "are many more times likely to be 
married with children" than other women. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, immigrant Latino households are more typically composed of the 
classic nuclear family -- a couple with children -- than any other group, the 
researchers found. Almost half (49.6%) of immigrant Latino households 
constitute such families, compared to 16.4% of blacks, 18.4 % of non-Latino 
whites, 30.7% of U.S.-born Latinos and 38.4% of Asians. Immigrant Study A new 
study of recently released 1990 census data for Los Angeles County has found 
that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Fewer than 1 in 5 of Los Angeles County's Latino immigrants were here 
illegally, compared to other estimates of 50% or more. 
</P>
<P>
 * Almost 9 in 10 Latino immigrant men participated in the work force. 
</P>
<P>
 * Latino immigrant households were more likely than other county residents to 
be living in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 * Poor Latino immigrants were less likely than low-income U.S. natives and 
other poor immigrants to receive public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 * More than 70% of immigrant Latinos 25 and older had not completed high 
school, by far the largest percentage in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * Immigrant Latino households were more typically composed of the classic 
nuclear family -- a couple with children -- than any other population group in 
the county.

HUNDREDS OF STUDENTS STAGE WALKOUTS TO PROTEST PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Hundreds of middle school students walked out of classes in Pacoima on 
Thursday in protest of Proposition 187, the ballot measure seeking to bar 
illegal immigrants from public schools and social services. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning walkouts at Maclay and Pacoima middle schools were peaceful, 
police and school officials said. Carrying an anti-Proposition 187 banner and a 
Mexican flag, about 300 Maclay students left their classrooms shortly after 
first period, about 9:10 a.m., school police said. Most returned shortly, but 
40 of the students did not come back to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia Costas, principal at Maclay, said she was aware Thursday's walkout was 
going to take place because of calls earlier in the day from parents. She said 
she believes the students and their parents mistakenly believe that pupils will 
be expelled from school Nov. 8 -- Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the kids are terribly misinformed," Costas said. "We have to do a lot 
more work in the community . . . to inform people." 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Thursday, students attempted to leave the Bravo Medical Magnet near 
Downtown but school administrators and police locked the gates and kept the 
students on campus, said Assistant Chief Richard Page of the school district 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, about 200 students marched the perimeter of the El Camino Real 
High School campus in Woodland Hills and last week, hundreds of students walked 
out of classes at Huntington Park, Bell, South Gate, Los Angeles and Fremont 
high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect this to continue until Election Day," Page said. "I think (the 
students) want to draw attention to the issue . . . but we're going to make 
efforts to keep them on campus." 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators and police are planning to meet next week to discuss how 
to deal with potential problems if the ballot measure passes. Several high 
schools are holding meetings for students before the election to dispel rumors 
that the school system would be checking citizenship.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the school board has hired outside counsel to deal with legal 
questions that would arise if the proposition passes. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure calls for schools to verify students' legal status and 
ultimately to report illegal students and their parents to authorities. The Los 
Angeles Board of Education has voted to oppose the measure and expects to join 
in legal challenges if it passes. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say that although they believe an outside group is 
responsible for organizing the student walkouts, they are unsure which group. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Macdonald, a spokesman for Taxpayers Against 187, said his group does 
not support the protests and that the students are sending the wrong message to 
voters. "We do not believe this educates the voters about the problems of 187 
-- we believe it distracts them," Macdonald said. "We encourage kids to stay in 
school -- that's one of the things this is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 Pasadena High School students also cut classes Thursday morning and 
walked to City Hall to protest Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The students left the school about 8:15 a.m. and headed downtown, where they 
were intercepted by school administrators, Principal Kathy Lesley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesley said the students conducted themselves in an orderly manner and that 
the school did not plan to punish them.

LAPD CHIEF, SHERIFF BACK STATE BAN ON SMALL PISTOLS; WEAPONS: BLOCK AND 
WILLIAMS ADDRESS A LEGISLATIVE HEARING IN LOS ANGELES. A STUDY HAS FOUND THAT 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE NATION'S SMALL-CALIBER HANDGUNS ARE MADE IN SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Possibly drawing battle lines for a legislative campaign next year, two of Los 
Angeles County's top law enforcement officials on Thursday endorsed banning the 
manufacture and sale of small-caliber handguns in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheap guns, which studies show are popular with gang members, have been 
banned in Maryland, South Carolina and parts of Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a legislative hearing Thursday in Downtown Los Angeles, Police 
Chief Willie L. Williams said a nationwide ban on the popular so-called 
Saturday Night Specials would be more effective, "but if there's a will within 
the state and city governments that this is an issue . . . perhaps we'll be a 
leader as we were with the waiting period and assault weapons ban." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block said he would support a ban on the 
guns, most of which are made in the Southland, but was unsure whether it would 
have a major impact on crime prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Assembly Select 
Committee on Gun Violence, said he may introduce legislation next year to ban 
small-caliber weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was the first of four that Caldera's committee will hold statewide 
before drafting legislation aimed at some type of gun regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 A California ban on small-caliber weapons would have national impact. A study 
by a UC Davis researcher released last month found that seven Southland gun 
companies made about 80% of all small-caliber handguns in the United States in 
1992. Another study, conducted by the Los Angeles branch of Women Against Gun 
Violence and released at the hearing, showed that .25-caliber guns made by one 
Southland company, Phoenix Arms, were the weapons most frequently recovered at 
crime scenes by the LAPD from 1990 to 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix Arms, based in Ontario, said no spokesman was available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said that tackling small-caliber guns is "a very ticklish (position) 
to be in, politically pretty risky, but until we're in the position where we're 
not having 70 people a month killed (by guns in the city), we don't have any 
other alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all law enforcement officials at the hearing backed the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's sort of a mistake," said George Rodriguez, special agent in 
charge of the Los Angeles office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms, to think "that restricting the sale or possession of a type of weapon 
is going to have an impact on the crime problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Gun control advocates suggested other restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have to pick at this in small pieces," said Ann Reiss Lane, 
coordinator of Women Against Gun Violence. Citing the fact that the small size 
of the gun makes it popular and easily concealable, Lane suggested a minimum 
size requirement for handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She also called for liability laws on gun makers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you manufacture lawn darts," she said, "you can be held liable if some kid 
throws it at some other kid. There seems to be an analogy." 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers also expressed concern about the surging popularity of 9-millimeter 
handguns and the state's lack of a computerized gun registration system. 
Caldera said the committee would weigh legislation to tighten registration 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Sposato, whose wife was killed by a mentally disturbed gunman in a San 
Francisco law office in 1993, said he had to get a permit to retrieve his 
wife's ashes from a crematory but needed no such paperwork to get a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Block advocated a system in which gun owners would need a valid license to buy 
and keep firearms. Many law enforcement officials asked Caldera to resurrect a 
bill narrowly defeated in the Legislature this past year that would make 
carrying a concealed gun a felony. It is now a misdemeanor to carry a concealed 
gun, though it is a felony to carry a concealed knife or club.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; BACK-TO-SCHOOL NIGHT FOCUSES ON THE FATHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mike Shaughnessy fell in love with the 1912 Western tune "Ragtime Cowboy Joe" 
when he heard it as a kid on the flip side of Alvin and the Chipmunks' single, 
"Christmas, Don't Be Late." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Shaughnessy and his fellow members of the Fathers Brothers 
barbershop quartet belted out the song in full four-part harmony at Verdugo 
Woodlands School's back-to-school night, giving parents, teachers and a few 
students a preview of their next show at the school in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a longstanding tradition at our school," said Shaughnessy, chairman of 
the annual "Fathers' Follies" production, an all-dads event that features, in 
addition to the barbershop quartet, a live band, dance routines and skits, all 
interwoven in an original story line. "We do a completely new show every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Moms pitch in with behind-the-scenes work such as set and costume design, but 
onstage, it's fathers only. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is not exactly an all-macho show. Every year the dads perform in drag. 
</P>
<P>
 "It dates back to 1947," Shaughnessy said. "That year, the dads at our school 
decided to play a little joke on their wives in the PTA. They did a skit in 
drag, and it's evolved from that and today it's a very elaborate production." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ragtime Cowboy Joe" was chosen for Wednesday's brief performance to highlight 
the theme of next year's "Fathers' Follies," which will be set in Texas. As in 
past years, the story will be written and directed by Jill Benone, a faculty 
member of the Glendale Community College theater department, whose children 
attended Verdugo Woodlands. The event is staged in the college's auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Janice Hanada said Verdugo Woodlands is unique among Glendale 
schools in that the dads, not the moms, are the primary PTA fund-raisers. 
Proceeds from the musical have paid for new copy machines, the repair of 
ceiling fans and other needs not covered by the school's budget, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're extremely lucky to have them, they put so much effort into the 
production," said Hanada. "They spend hours planning and practicing, working 
with a choreographer and drama teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing is that it gets the dads involved in a way they typically 
wouldn't be," Shaughnessy added. "We get to know each other, and it's a 
racket." STEVE RYFLE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: POINT MUGU; NAVY BASE JANITORS STRIKE OVER BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 40 civilian janitors at the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station went on 
strike Thursday, protesting that they have no employee benefits and low 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Laborers International Union of North America, Local 585 
picketed near the Navy base's Wood Road entrance for most of the day Thursday, 
claiming that the Scottsdale,Ariz.-based janitorial firm, Teltara Inc., has 
refused to bargain in good faith onbenefits, salaries and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very upset that the company does not want to come back to the table 
and discuss these issues," said David Valenzuela, a spokesman for the 
picketers. "If we have to get our point across by striking, then so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 The janitors vowed that they would remain on the Wood Road picket until both 
sides meet again at the bargaining table. The two sides met with a federal 
mediator earlier this month but could not reach an agreement. The union voted 
to strike Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Campbell, Teltara's chief executive officer, said his company has 
bargained appropriately and pays its employees on average $3 more per hour than 
other commercial janitorial companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are doing all that we can given the restrictions of our contract with the 
Navy," Campbell said. "It is true that we do not provide medical, dental and 
other benefits but we do pay our employees more than other firms." 
</P>
<P>
 Navy officials said that because of federal contracting rules, Teltara must 
still honor its cleaning contract with the Navy. Company officials said they 
will rely on non-striking employees, temporary employees and management 
officials to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Point Mugu officials said the labor action cause no disruptions at the base 
Thursday. J. E. MITCHELL

 In an effort to save the city's Police Department from shutting down, the Port

$500,000 needed to maintain the force.

<P>
 If approved with a final vote in two weeks, the 4% utility tax will be tacked 
onto water, gas, electricity, cable television and telephone bills.

 The council's gave unanimous support for the measure Wednesday after a public 
hearing during which residents urged council members to preserve the city's 
independent Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are in a unique position," said Dolores Ward, a Port Hueneme resident. 
"You have the residents of this fine city saying: 'tax us, tax us, tax us.' We 
have done everything humanly possible to let you know how we feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who qualify as low-income under standards set by the U. S. 
Department of Housing and Urban Development will be exempted from the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's decision came after a property tax measure on the June 7 ballot 
fell just shy of the two-thirds majority needed for approval. The tax was 
designed to raise enough revenue to keep the Police Department running. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the measure failed, hundreds of residents have continued campaigning 
throughout the city to keep the department from closing. 
</P>
<P>
 The $500,000 will allow the city to maintain its own police force, bring the 
department to full staffing and hire a new police chief, City Manager Richard 
Velthoen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief John R. Hopkins, age 50, who has been with the department for 28 years, 
told the council Wednesday night that he will retire when his contract expires 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired," Hopkins said Wednesday night. "I have been working for 32 years 
and I feel like doing something else. I want to do something without having to 
answer to anyone." CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: POINT MUGU; PANEL CALLS JOINT USE OF AIRFIELD 
FEASIBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A proposal to develop joint military and civilian use of the airfield at the 
Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station is technically feasible, a committee 
declared Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting in Camarillo, the Point Mugu Airfield Joint Use Investigative 
Committee voted 4 to 3 to adopt the findings of a report issued by the Southern 
California Assn. of Governments, which found that the Navy facility could be 
developed as a regional airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time has come that we, as a body, make a recommendation that this 
proposal is indeed feasible," said Ventura County Supervisor John K. Flynn, a 
committee member. "The Navy and the Department of Defense must be looking for 
some sort of signal on this proposal. I believe that it is time to give them 
one." 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisors Maria VanderKolk and Maggie Kildee joined Camarillo City 
Councilwoman Charlotte Craven in opposing the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents have argued that a regional airport would increase noise and air 
pollution -- especially over Camarillo -- and say it is too soon to deem the 
project feasible. "I felt that it is too premature to have taken this action," 
Craven said. "There is still so much that we don't know about this project." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal now rests with the County Board of Supervisors. It is expected to 
decide whether to vote on joining a joint powers authority, a governmental 
entity that would run the proposed airport. Its vote to join the authority 
would activate the body. A date for the decision has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
 SCAG officials said a second and last phase of the feasibility study, which 
will encompass airline interest, land use and environmental impact, will be 
prepared by late December or early January. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee will meet again at 10 a.m. Nov. 23 at Camarillo City Hall, 601 
Carmen Drive. J. E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; CITY GIVES $10,000 TO EFFORT TO SPARE 
BASES 
</P>

<P>
 A committee working to spare Ventura County's military bases from closure has 
received $10,000 from Port Hueneme, despite the city's initial reluctance to 
contribute to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4 to 1 vote Wednesday came six weeks after the City Council turned down a 
request to give $16,630 to the Ventura County BRAC '95 Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are disappointed" at the lower amount, said Cal Carrera, co-chairman of 
the task force. "We would like to convince the city that, among all the cities 
in the county, Port Hueneme will be one of the cities to suffer the most if the 
local bases are closed." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrera said Ojai was the only other city that gave less than the task force 
had asked -- $3,000 instead of $4,600. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force asked for contributions based on the population of each city 
and the economic impact if Port Hueneme Naval Construction Battalion Center or 
Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station turn up on the list next March. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Tony Young, voting against the $10,000 contribution, said the 
city should give the full amount requested. Council members told the task force 
they would contribute the full amount, if they find a way to raise the money in 
the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials initially objected to the request saying the contribution was 
too high for their population of less than 22,000 and that the city enjoys 
little direct economic revenue from the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the initial request, Sept. 7, city officials also said they 
needed more information on how the task force would spend its money. City 
Manager Richard Velthoen told the council Wednesday that the task force has 
since defined its work program better. CHRISTINA LIMA

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; CHAMBER TO MAKE A GAME OF BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce has caught the Monopoly craze and plans 
to create its own version of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing this to generate an awareness of the various businesses that are 
within the community and to give each business an opportunity to have their 
name on a game that is a fun activity that can be enjoyed," said Daniel L. 
Romey, the chamber's first vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills is one of several Southern California communities to 
manufacture its own home-spun version of the famous game. Chatsworth, Sherman 
Oaks and Westlake Village have already their own versions, as do Beverly Hills, 
Moorpark, Malibu, Santa Barbara and other communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Woodlandopoly . . . will be Woodland Hills' very own board game," reads a 
letter from chamber President Michael J. Miller in a pitch to area businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your business name will be called 20 to 30 times, every time the game is 
played, for years and years to come, by thousands of players all over our local 
area," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a fee, businesses can buy a space in the game, which will be manufactured 
after all of the spaces have been bought, Romey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are only 50 spaces, so it is limited," he said. "It's on a 
first-come, first-served basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the games are produced, they will be available in major department 
stores, said Romey, an attorney who is in charge of special events for the 
chamber. The group hopes to get the game on the market before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules are similar to Monopoly, but enough changes have been made that 
Monopoly's maker, Parker Brothers, cannot claim trademark infringement, said 
Dan Siegel of Hometown Games, which is marketing the game for Woodland Hills.

INJURY TOLL GROWS TO 28 IN MOBIL REFINERY BLAST; EXPLOSION: OFFICIALS ARE STILL 
SEEKING CAUSE, BUT SAY COSTLY SAFETY FEATURES KEPT INCIDENT FROM BEING WORSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the injury toll from an explosion and fire at the Mobil refinery in 
Torrance grew to 28 workers Thursday, government and company officials were 
still trying to figure out what caused the incident.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the officials noted that the incident could have been much worse if 
the refinery had not installed millions of dollars in safety features in recent 
years, largely at the insistence of neighbors and government public safety 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a huge facility that makes a lot of gasoline, that's an 
inherently dangerous business," Torrance Fire Chief R. Scott Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is (the) Mobil (refinery) much safer than it used to be? The answer is yes. . 
. ," Adams said. "To give Mobil a black eye because of this is probably 
unfair." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't live in an accident-free environment," said Jim Carbonetti, a Mobil 
spokesman. "We take all the steps we can to ensure that we're operating 
safely." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some neighbors said they believe the refinery is safer than it used to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do feel they're doing better," said Fred Casstevens, a board member on the 
Northwest Torrance Homeowners Assn. "This refinery is a lot safer than some 
other refineries." 
</P>
<P>
 But he added, "It only takes one major incident to change that." 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion at 3:15 p.m. Wednesday sent flames about 40 feet into the air 
and shook the ground. Twelve people who were injured in the incident remained 
hospitalized at three South Bay hospitals Thursday, most suffering from burns 
or inhalation injuries. One patient had a broken arm, another had a fractured 
spine, hospital spokeswomen said. 
</P>
<P>
 All were reported to be in stable or fair condition. Sixteen other people were 
treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the injured had been working at the refinery except one. Although not 
included in the Mobil or Torrance Fire Department injury figures, one patient 
at Little Company of Mary Hospital was driving by the refinery when the 
accident occurred and later complained of respiratory problems. The 36-year-old 
Torrance resident was being treated for respiratory complaints, a hospital 
spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the injured workers were employed by a Carson general contracting 
firm, I.S.T. Mechanical Corp., which had about 200 employees on the site, 
including some at the accident point. But company officials declined to comment 
on what might have caused the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Coast Air Quality Management District is also investigating the 
incident to determine whether toxic substances might have been released by the 
explosion. If Mobil is found to have violated air-quality standards, even 
because of an accident, it could be fined as much as $50,000 for each 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations between the refinery, which opened in the 1920s, and local 
governments and citizens' groups have often been strained. After a 1987 
accident caused $17 million in property damage, Torrance sued Mobil for alleged 
safety violations. A subsequent agreement called for the refinery to hire a 
safety adviser, make various improvements and modify or phase out the use of 
hydrofluoric acid, which can cause a deadly toxic cloud when released. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said that since the agreement, Mobil has added millions of dollars in 
improvements, including safety features designed to prevent hydrofluoric acid 
leaks. Adams said that although Wednesday's explosion occurred near a unit 
containing hydrofluoric acid, no acid seemed to have been released. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance City Councilman Dan Walker, a Mobil critic after the 1987 explosion, 
also noted that the company has made safety strides since its settlement with 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this (latest accident) says is you can never make a refinery 100% safe," 
he said. "Unfortunately, there will always be accidents." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Ted Johnson and Deborah Schoch and correspondent Mary 
Guthrie contributed to this story.

MAN, 26, FATALLY SHOT IN ALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 26-year-old man was shot to death in an alley Thursday morning, Los Angeles 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Freeman Jr. of Panorama City was pronounced dead at the scene, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred about 7 a.m. near the 14300 block of Roscoe Boulevard, 
Detective Stephen Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said witnesses told them that as Freeman was walking in the 
alley, a medium-sized red four-door car drove up behind him. A man emerged, 
shot Freeman at least once, got back in the car and drove away, Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have no suspects and know of no motive. Detectives do not believe that 
Freeman was in a gang.

MCKEON TO PETITION FOR FOREIGN TRADE ZONE TO AID MANUFACTURERS; RECOVERY: 
EXEMPTION FROM CUSTOMS AND EXCISE TAXES WOULD STIMULATE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, 
HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon announced Thursday that he will petition the U.S. 
Department of Commerce for a foreign trade zone to help West Valley 
manufacturers bounce back from the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The formation of a trade zone, which exempts manufacturers from paying customs 
and excise taxes on exports, would stimulate economic development by attracting 
new businesses and encouraging the expansion of existing ones, the Santa 
Clarita Republican said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message here is clearly jobs," said McKeon aide Armando Azarloza. "This 
is going to mean jobs in the area. It's going to mean a revitalization of our 
economic base in the West Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, who is now in a reelection campaign against Democratic challenger 
James Gilmartin, will file the formal application after the Nov. 8 election, 
Azarloza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmartin called the proposal a great idea but questioned whether McKeon has 
the political skill to fulfill it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that he's even thinking about a foreign trade zone is miraculous," 
Gilmartin said. "Mr. McKeon has not had one original thought in his two years 
in Congress." Although an exact boundary for the proposed zone has not been 
determined, it would include portions of Canoga Park and Chatsworth, roughly 
bounded by Winnetka Avenue, Devonshire Street, Topanga Canyon Boulevard and 
Prairie Street, Azarloza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Azarloza said that locating in a trade zone can save a business up to 10% on 
the production cost of its exports. Duties on imported raw materials would be 
deferred until the sale of a finished product. 
</P>
<P>
 Such trade zones have been established at the ports of Los Angeles and Long 
Beach and a portion of Palmdale. The Port of Long Beach unsuccessfully opposed 
the application of its rival in Los Angeles, contending that its own benefits 
as a foreign trade zone would be diluted. 
</P>
<P>
 Azarloza said McKeon's staff has briefly discussed the congressman's proposal 
with Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, and that he did not anticipate any 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon made the announcement at Duke's Inc., a Chatsworth firm that 
manufactures general aviation equipment. He said the trade zone would help the 
$10-million company to better compete in foreign markets and, consequently, 
hire more employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke's vice president Chet Huffman said the proposal was one of several 
factors weighing against a plan to relocate the company, which exports 20% of 
its production overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 "As competitive as things are getting with the areas we export to, anything is 
going to help," Huffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorized by the Foreign Trade Zones Act of 1934, trade zones are intended to 
stimulate an area's economy and to increase U.S. exports. The use of trade 
zones blossomed in the 1980s. There are now 194 of them, according to the 
National Assn. of Foreign-Trade Zones. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon's application will be decided by the Foreign-Trade Zone Board, 
consisting of the Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of the Treasury and 
Secretary of the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 The review of the application could take up to a year, McKeon's staff said.

'PARTY HOUSE' MAY BE IN NEW HANDS; LEGAL: STATUS OF AGREEMENT TO CONTROL 
LATE-NIGHT FESTIVITIES IS IN QUESTION. ATTORNEY WILL AMEND DOCUMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The legal status of an agreement to put a lid on the "party house" has been 
left in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2-million Studio City mansion, where neighbors say hundreds of people at 
a time pay to attend late night commercial parties, was the subject of an 
agreement last month between the owner and city officials, who brought suit 
charging the house was a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears now that title to the house changed just a week before the 
agreement was signed -- but whether that means the house actually has new 
owners who are not bound by the agreement is unclear, Deputy City Atty. Deborah 
Sanchez said Thursday. It may have been simply a change in how the owner wanted 
the deed to read, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, Sanchez said, she will amend the city's lawsuit aimed at quelling 
the late night merry-making at the mansion to include the new deed holder in 
case there are new owners. However, if the same people are involved in the new 
ownership, the present agreement would still be valid, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez said she only recently discovered that the deed to the 
7,500-square-foot hilltop mansion in the 3200 block of Wrightwood Drive had 
been transferred a week before the previous owner, Paul Campbell, reached 
agreement with the city to tone down the late night activities. 
</P>
<P>
 According to property records, the house was sold to Equity 2000 Corp. on Aug. 
5, and the deed transfer was recorded on Sept. 21. Sanchez said the company is 
incorporated in Delaware, but lists a mailing address in Tallahassee, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez said she has been unable to reach anyone with Equity 2000, and has not 
spoken with Campbell in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement signed Sept. 29, Campbell agreed to ban alcohol sales and 
advertised events, limit parties to no more than 25 people and end the events 
by 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge was scheduled to formalize the agreement as a permanent injunction 
Monday, but that action was canceled after Sanchez discovered the change in 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 The house's tenant, Jerry Bolduc, who staged many of the parties that 
neighbors complained about, has scoffed at the restrictions and said that as 
the lessee of the mansion, he never agreed to the terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolduc, known as "Jerry Bo," filed a $1-million lawsuit against the city last 
week, claiming he had been harassed by vice detectives and defamed by the 
city's description of his parties. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Sanchez maintained that even without Bolduc's agreement to the conditions, 
he could be evicted if the settlement is violated because the building's owner 
is legally responsible for seeing to it that the terms of the settlement are 
adhered to. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolduc moved in only last March, but city officials say the house has been 
Party Central since 1990, the site of widely advertised bashes, to which guests 
paid an entry fee, with themes like Lingerie Night. One party there was 
broadcast by MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors have complained that party-goers block their driveways, run parking 
shuttles up and down their narrow road, have sex in public, urinate on their 
lawns and play loud music at all hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolduc contends that the claims are exaggerated.

MAN ON TRACKS KILLED BY TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man apparently bent on committing suicide knelt between railroad tracks 
Thursday, beat his chest and gestured challenges until an oncoming freight 
train killed him, Los Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Day laborers nearby saw a man in his 30s kneel on the tracks near the overpass 
on Sherman Way and Hines Street and dive under the engine just before it hit 
him, Los Angeles Police Sgt. Paul Modrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Modrell said the man had not been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 42nd death this year involving pedestrians trespassing on Southern 
Pacific tracks and being hit by trains, railroad spokesman Jack Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the sort of thing that you have no defense against," he said. "It was 
an unfortunate death."

1ST-YEAR BUDGET FOR RUNNING THE CENTER AMOUNTS TO A GUESSING GAME; FUNDING: 
OFFICIALS ARE OPTIMISTIC, BUT EXACT ACCOUNTING MUST WAIT. ENDOWMENT WILL 
PROVIDE KEY FINANCING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thousand Oaks' new performing arts center will run this year on $730,000 -- 
maybe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza's first budget details, to the dollar, how much the 
theater department will spend on postage stamps, usher uniforms and travel 
allowances. 
</P>
<P>
 But every one of those line items is just a guess. And the theater staff can 
only hope its financial predictions prove solid. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening a performance center is an act of faith. Exact accounting will have to 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows how much it will cost to light the Forum Theatre. No one can 
predict the tab for heating the Civic Auditorium. No one even knows whether the 
ballyhooed theaters will make money this season. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, the future's looking good. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the 400-seat Forum Theatre and the 1,800-seat auditorium are booked solid 
through the summer. Several shows have sold out, and the box office opens to a 
line nearly every day. The first performances have turned profits. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Civic Arts Plaza endowment fund has reeled in nearly $9.4 million in 
pledges, although slightly over $1 million has been collected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had high hopes when I signed on here," theater Director Tom Mitze said. 
"And they have all pretty much come true." 
</P>
<P>
 As the grand auditorium opens tonight, Thousand Oaks council members express 
optimism that the Civic Arts Plaza will achieve three key goals: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Forum Theatre will offer community groups a chance to perform in a 
professional setting, at a reasonable cost. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Civic Auditorium will bring in quality acts without putting the city at 
any financial risk. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Alliance for the Arts endowment fund will generate enough revenue, 
through interest earnings, to cover the theaters' day-to-day costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although tonight's glitzy opening swings the spotlight to the large, elegant 
auditorium, Thousand Oaks leaders have always emphasized their affection for 
the oak-and-russet-colored Forum Theatre, which can be configured to seat 280 
or 400 viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mitze recommended setting the small hall's rental rate at $400 a day, 
some outsiders balked. That seemed too high for nonprofit groups, they said, 
especially since performers must also pay for professional stage crews and 
ushers. 
</P>
<P>
 But local artists have willingly footed the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rates seem quite fair," said Lane Davies, who stars in "Man of La 
Mancha," which plays through next weekend. "This space is a magnet for 
audiences, no matter what show you're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Proving that point, two teen-agers recently staged a recital in the Forum 
Theatre and packed the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went pretty well," 14-year-old violinist Elise Goodman said. "We sold 
standing-room only seats." And then, shyly, she added: "We made a profit also, 
I think." 
</P>
<P>
 The children's theater troupe at Cal Lutheran University hopes to achieve 
similar success with this weekend's performances of "Jungalbook" on the forum 
stage. Director Michael Arndt had to double ticket prices, to $6 apiece, to pay 
an overhead that he expects to reach $10,000 for the four-show run. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're extending our budgets well beyond normal," Arndt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with such hefty fees, the Forum Theatre is expected to lose money -- 
about $120,700 in the upcoming year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will pay a portion of the forum's utility bill, since both the City 
Council and Planning Commission use the hall as a meeting chamber. But the 
council has promised not to subsidize theatrical uses of the arts center. 
</P>
<P>
 To bring the books into balance, Mitze is counting on a $250,000 donation from 
the endowment fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the art center's two theaters have already earned a $10,000 profit, 
nearly all of it from speedy sellouts of David Copperfield's magic show and Hal 
Holbrook's "Mark Twain Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 As a further boost, the large auditorium's rental income should soar beyond 
all expectations, Mitze said. Demand for the stage has been so high that he has 
scheduled a packed season. Each new show brings in $1,800 in rent, plus revenue 
from the concession stand and parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The phone doesn't stop ringing with people wanting to rent the halls," Mitze 
said. "We don't have enough room for all the people who want to do things 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 But arts patrons caution that snags are inevitable once the maiden-season glow 
wears off. 
</P>
<P>
 In this first year, they can count on spectators to snap up tickets just to 
get a glimpse of the theaters. And they can rely on performers to book gigs to 
test the state-of-the-art halls. When the hoopla fades at the end of the 
season, the really gritty work will begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first year so it's a freebie -- everything's a lot easier." said 
Larry Janss, a member of the theaters' Board of Governors. "The second year 
will be hairier. But if we can get people hooked, maybe we can keep them 
coming."

MERCHANT LOAN PROGRAM APPROVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Merchants along some major thoroughfares in North Hollywood can qualify for 
business improvement loans of up to $25,000 under a program approved Thursday 
by the Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, the borrower may never have to repay the funds because 10% 
of the zero-interest loans will be forgiven each year for 10 years if the 
borrower maintains the building. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify, long-term tenants or building owners must use the money to 
renovate the facades of retail or commercial buildings along Magnolia and 
Lankershim boulevards and Vineland Avenue in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 For applicants seeking less than $10,000, the CRA will offer grants on a 
dollar-for-dollar matching basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new program will help to keep existing businesses in North Hollywood, 
revitalize local shopping districts and generate new sales for local 
merchants," CRA Chairman Stanley Hirsh said.

3 FRAIL FEMALE WITNESSES TO RECEIVE SPECIAL CARE; TRIAL: MEASURES ARE TO ENSURE 
THEIR TESTIMONY AGAINST A MALE NURSE'S AIDE ACCUSED OF SEXUALLY MOLESTING THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prosecutors are making extraordinary arrangements, including hiring ambulances 
and medical attendants, so that three women in frail health can testify against 
a male nurse's aide that they say sexually molested them while they were 
patients at Simi Valley Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Although doctors have said the traumatic court experience could kill one of 
the women, Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrice D. Koenig said it is important to 
prosecute Victor Sumner because he violated a position of trust. Sumner is 
accused of fondling the women in July on his first day as a temporary hospital 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very distressed about having to put (the women) through this, but there's 
no other alternative because this is a very aggravated situation," Koenig said 
Thursday. "I think we have an obligation to go forward with this. I've tried to 
impress it on the victims, but when you're sick it's kind of hard to take 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner, 47, is charged with sexually battering two elderly women while they 
were institutionalized, and a third felony count of sexually penetrating a 
mentally retarded person with his finger. He is in custody with bail set at 
$25,000 and a trial date tentatively scheduled for Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the victims, a 32-year-old mentally retarded woman, has such severe 
medical problems she was not expected to live past 15, Koenig said. Testifying 
against Sumner could prove fatal to the woman because the emotional distress 
might trigger a seizure, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 A second victim, 73, remains in the hospital in "extremely bad condition," 
while the third, 72, is 5 feet, 10 inches tall but weighs only 90 pounds and is 
in "an extremely precarious state," Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said one or more of the women must be transported to court by 
ambulance. Medical attendants will be hired by the district attorney's office 
for all three women during their testimony, Koenig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Koenig asked the court to move Sumner's trial to Simi Valley on the 
days the women will testify because "I don't think that they can withstand the 
45-minute trip" to the Ventura courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. said he probably will grant the 
request and even conduct part of the trial in the hospital if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Koenig also is researching whether a defense attorney can be appointed to 
cross-examine the women so the defendant, who is serving as his own lawyer, 
will not question the women directly in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, however, was unable to stop the defendant from contacting the 
women before trial. Sumner was given the victims' home addresses as part of the 
defense file in the case, and Koenig renewed a request to have that information 
taken from the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to sit in a sterile courtroom and say there's nothing to worry 
about (because) he's in custody," the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge said he cannot withhold the addresses from Sumner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since he's representing himself he's the attorney in charge of the case," 
Campbell said. "I believe that he has a right to that information."

SUSPECT FLEES INTO SURF, DROWNS; CRIME: OFFICER SWIMS TO RESCUE HIM. BUT, 
IGNORING ENTREATIES TO RETURN, THE MAN SLIPS BENEATH THE WAVES. A CAP LINKS HIM 
TO AN APARTMENT BURGLARY.

 A prowler fleeing from police ran into the surf off the Ventura Promenade, 
vanished beneath the waves before dawn Thursday and drowned before a swimming 
officer could reach him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4 p.m. Thursday, a team of six divers found what they believed to be the 
man's body, its clothing snagged on a piling of the Ventura Pier about 10 feet 
down in the 61-degree water, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified man was about 30, and had curly blond hair, Detective John 
Leach said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was believed to have burglarized a 12-unit apartment complex in Ventura 
about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday Leach said. At 3:12 a.m. Thursday, a prowler was 
reported in the parking structure at the Country Inn on South Chestnut Street, 
across the street from the apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Ray Vance, who responded to the prowler call, demanded the man halt 
and gave chase when the suspect ran across the California Street overpass, 
beyond the Holiday Inn, across the Promenade and onto the sand, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 There, the man threw his cap onto the beach, rushed into the surf and swam 
into the darkness, ignoring the entreaties of gathering officers to return to 
shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Chris Davis swam after him but could not reach him before he slid 
under the water about 50 yards from shore and about 30 to 40 yards west of the 
pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after dawn broke, authorities called off a fruitless search involving 
a Coast Guard helicopter and two law-enforcement vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach said the body recovered Thursday afternoon closely resembles the 
description given by officers and the burglary victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of a Mighty Ducks cap on the beach was one clue. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecelia Geertsen, 55, night manager at the apartment complex, said a tenant 
saw a man fitting the suspect's description huddled in the passageway outside 
her back door Wednesday night. She later found that some electronic equipment 
and the tenant's Mighty Ducks cap had been stolen, Geertsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Sgt. Earl Matthews, whose search-and-rescue dive team recovered the 
body, said the man's clothing might have weighted him down. The body, its 
clothing caught on some mussels on the pier supports, was clad in an 
olive-green sweat shirt and tan pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, noting the man ran about a quarter mile before entering the sea, 
speculated that fatigue might have made him vulnerable to hypothermia in the 
cold water. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy was scheduled for today, authorities said.

DRIVER DIES WHEN TRUCK HITS POLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 72-year-old man was killed after his pickup truck struck a power pole -- 
knocking out electricity to several hundred homes in east Palmdale, authorities 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Aguilar of Rosamond was driving his truck east on Avenue S near 42nd 
Street East at 10:30 p.m. Wednesday when his truck hit the pole, Sheriff's Lt. 
Terry Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar, who was not wearing a seat belt, was thrown from the truck and killed 
instantly, Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident cut power to about 2,400 homes on Palmdale's east side for about 
an hour, a Southern California Edison spokeswoman said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COLLEGE BUILDINGS GET GO-AHEAD; EDUCATION: 
CAMPUS OFFICIALS, STATE REACH ACCORD ON FUNDING LIBRARY AND FINE ARTS CENTER 
AFTER BIDS CAME IN HIGHER THAN EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Construction of a long-awaited library and a fine arts center at College of 
the Canyons is scheduled to begin by the end of the year after campus officials 
worked out a compromise with the state over funding, it was announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The two projects were originally expected to cost $10.3 million, but the 
lowest construction bid submitted was $11.9 million, college President Dianne 
Van Hook said. The estimate was higher than expected because seismic 
reinforcements were added to the plans after the Northridge earthquake, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, construction costs around Southern California increased after the 
earthquake -- when the project went to bid -- as contractors once starved for 
work found themselves able to name their price. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials initially denied the school's request for extra funds. But Van 
Hook argued that the projects would have to be scaled back considerably without 
the funding. She told state officials that spending a year drafting new plans 
would be nearly as costly as approving extra funding now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I explained to them, not so politely, that this was not an acceptable 
answer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Community College Chancellor's Office agreed Monday to provide about 
two-thirds of the extra funding, Van Hook said. In return, College of the 
Canyons will pay $300,000 for the seismic work out of its reserves and will be 
reimbursed by the state later. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Hook said the structures will be built as planned, but without some 
decorative elements such as a fountain, library shelving and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 The 35,689-square-foot library will be about three times as large as the 
college's existing library, located on the third floor of a classroom building, 
school spokeswoman Sue Bozman said. Book capacity will increase from 41,000 
volumes to 73,000, and the new facility will have extensive computer access, 
including hookups in seating areas for students with laptop computers. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine arts center -- roughly the same size as the new library -- will house 
courses in art, journalism and related fields, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's original budget established by the state chancellor's office was 
based on estimates done before construction costs rose after the earthquake, 
said Joe Keating, facilities administrator for the state community college 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating said failure of a state bond measure in June and the Legislature's 
refusal to put another bond issue on the November ballot made requests for 
extra construction money all but impossible to approve. 
</P>
<P>
 About $10 million remained in the community college system's coffers from bond 
acts approved in 1990 and 1992, but that money had been allocated to purchasing 
equipment for projects already under construction, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We established that as a higher priority than new construction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Keating said, community college officials were able to juggle money from 
other accounts to avoid the extra cost of delaying the project. Van Hook said 
it will take four or five weeks for the college to receive the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Groundbreaking on the buildings is scheduled before the end of the semester.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 3 YOUTHS ARRESTED IN BURGLARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 8-year-old boy and two teen-agers were arrested Wednesday night on 
suspicion of stealing $4,500 worth of construction materials and causing 
$20,000 in vandalism at a new Lancaster housing tract, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8-year-old and a 15-year-old were released to their parents after they 
were booked for investigation of burglary and vandalism.The third boy, 14, was 
being held at the San Fernando Juvenile Hall on unrelated charges, said Los 
Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Richard Wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said all three boys allegedly knocked out windows, smashed roof 
tiles and broke water pipes at a housing tract being built by Encino-based 
Larwin Construction in the 1800 block of W. Avenue H-8 in Lancaster more than 
two weeks ago, Wood said. Graffiti also had been sprayed on some of the houses 
in the tract, he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PROBE OF LATEST RACIAL FIGHT CONTINUES AT 
PITCHESS JAIL

<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies on Thursday continued to investigate a 
brawl between African American and Latino inmates at the Peter Pitchess jail in 
Castaic that left 21 prisoners injured, including two who were hospitalized 
with serious stab wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The two inmates who were stabbed in the chest during Wednesday night's fight 
were in serious condition, although the wounds did not appear to be life 
threatening, said sheriff's Deputy Diane Hecht. 
</P>
<P>
 Other prisoners suffered less serious cuts and abrasions, some requiring 
stitches, Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 The melee broke out about 9 p.m. Wednesday in the East Facility of the Peter 
J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, when 140 inmates in one dormitory divided along 
ethnic lines and began fighting with prison-made knives and ceramic shards of 
broken toilets, Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen deputies used "sting ball" grenades and rubber bullets to quell the 
fight, which lasted about 15 minutes, Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 No deputies were injured in the brawl. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not identified any of the instigators," said Lt. Drew Basey, watch 
commander of the East Facility. "(The inmates) don't speak very freely after 
these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Basey said some family members of the inmates called after news reports of the 
disturbance reached them, but only relatives of injured prisoners were given 
any information on the fight.

GRIFFINS SURVIVE BIG SCARE; FOOTBALL: NO. 1-RANKED LOS ALAMITOS RUNS UNBEATEN 
STREAK TO 42 WHEN LATE TOUCHDOWN PASS BEATS EDISON, 15-12. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes was working on his postgame post-mortem almost 
up to the moment Tony Hartley grabbed a 15-yard touchdown pass from Kevin 
Feterik. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to think of ways of saying what a great run it's been," Barnes 
said. "I wanted to say how nice this experience has been." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the end was at hand, then it wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartley's touchdown with 12 seconds left gave the Griffins a 15-12 Sunset 
League victory Thursday at Orange Coast College, one that had seemed improbable 
seconds before. Their unbeaten streak, now 42 games, was intact. 
</P>
<P>
 There might come a day when Barnes' speech is necessary, but not today. The 
Griffins gave the game away, then took it back, all in a bat of an eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley Lisotto's three-yard touchdown run gave Edison a 12-7 lead with 38 
seconds left. The Chargers had scored two touchdowns in less than two minutes 
and it seemed the Griffins' days as king of the hill were over. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos, which has won three consecutive Southern Section titles, had not 
lost since Oct. 25, 1991. But so sure did the upset appear, that Edison fans 
began lining the sidelines, ready to burst onto the field. Moments later, they 
were back in the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Wanigasekera returned a short Edison kickoff 22 yards to the Charger 48 
with 30 seconds left. Feterik then hit Russ Benefield down the left sideline 
for a 33-yard gain with 19 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play, Hartley lined up to the right, then moved further out. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was single coverage on me, so I took it out as far as I could," Hartley 
said. "We improvised." 
</P>
<P>
 He then slanted to the middle, in front of defensive back Alex Alonso. The 
pass was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was ecstastical ," Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecstastical?  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the word is, but I know what it means," Hartley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seconds later, Feterik hit Hartley for the two-point conversion. The normally 
stoic Feterik ran to Hartley, grabbed and lifted him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't matter what the score was or how much time was left, I knew we were 
going to win," Feterik said. "I have that much confidence in this offense." 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed misplaced much of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison (5-2, 0-2), ranked fourth in Orange County, had dominated the No. 
1-ranked Griffins (7-0, 2-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik threw for 259 yards and two touchdowns, but took a beating. He was 
sacked three times and had Charger players in his face throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 His counterpart, meanwhile, was having a field day. The type of day, in fact, 
that Griffin quarterbacks usually enjoy. Patrick Markovsky completed 26 of 39 
passes for 305 yards, 203 of which came in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 But through 3 1/2 quarters, the Griffins' defense made Feterik's 72-yard 
touchdown pass to Stan Guyness stand up. Edison had chances but wasted them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers' Kevin Bever missed a 26-yard field goal attempt in the first 
quarter. The Chargers got to the Griffin one early in the fourth quarter, but 
Brodie Riederich fumbled on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
 "They outplayed us," Barnes said. "They should have scored a couple times. It 
should have been a runaway." 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins had a chance to clinch it, but Mike Phillips missed a 20-yard 
field goal attempt with 5:38 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Markovsky went to work. He completed seven passes, including an eight-yard 
touchdown pass to Mike Ogas with 2:27 left to play. But Markovsky's pass was 
batted away on the two-point conversion attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos recovered the onside kick. But two plays later, Ryan Gragnano 
fumbled and Edison's Kevin Voeller recovered. Markovsky took the Chargers 48 
yards in seven hurry-up plays, with Lisotto scoring with 38 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 It was their moment. Then it was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Edison Coach Dave White: "I told the kids today that sometimes life isn't 
fair."

MIKE PENNER: FIDDLING WHILE THE FANS BURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So good of the NHL to send out its new and abridged calendar for 1994-95, 
featuring all the major dates worth circling: 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 31 -- Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 Nov. 24 -- Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 25 -- Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 1 -- College Bowl Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 21 (or thereabouts) -- 1994-95 NHL Season Opens*. 
</P>
<P>
 (* New $155-million Fox TV hockey contract kicks in on Jan. 21, 1995. 
"Miraculous breakthrough" in negotiations expected sometime around Jan. 14, 
1995.) 
</P>
<P>
 So, as hockey fans sit and wait and bide their time watching Prime Ticket 
re-runs of the 1993 Stanley Cup playoffs, luxuriating in the sweet sound of 
Marty McSorley illegally scraping, torching and reshaping his stick, it is 
worth noting that the owners and the players actually agreed on something the 
other day. 
</P>
<P>
 It happened at a press briefing at the Forum, during the Southern California 
leg of Brian Burke's league-wide "I'm Here To Speak On Behalf Of The Owners 
Because I'm A Lot Nicer And Warmer To The Camera Than Gary Bettman" tour. 
</P>
<P>
 From behind the microphone at the front of room, Burke refuted the charge that 
the NHL had blown its window of opportunity by locking out its players at the 
same time baseball was locking out the World Series, saying: 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that this league, even with the current problems we've got to solve, 
is poised to do some great things. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think the (exciting) hockey that was played last spring is going to 
be wasted. We don't feel it's a fluke that we were able to put the greatest 
sport in the world on national television here in the U.S. for the first time 
in many years . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We think we can continue to increase revenue streams because of two things. 
One, this is clearly the world's greatest game. No question about it. Whatever 
you like in a sport, we have it. And we have it better, faster and more 
entertaining, in my opinion, than any other sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two, we have the greatest athletes in the world. People talk about athletic 
ability in other sports. Our guys do everything an athlete has to do in any 
other sport, and they do it on skates -- which is a difficult task in itself -- 
and they do it with a fear of getting knocked on their butt at any given time 
in the game. We not only allow contact in hockey, we encourage it . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the four major sports, we're (still) fourth place in virtually every area. 
We think we're poised to make a move and catch one of those sports." 
</P>
<P>
 In the back of the room, the Kings' McSorley, a member of the players 
association negotiating committee, listened and nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows that the game of hockey is immensely popular right now," 
McSorley said. "Everybody knows that it's growing dramatically. . . . The 
owners realize revenues are going to increase dramatically, as do we." 
</P>
<P>
 There it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Accord. 
</P>
<P>
 It lasted until McSorley was able to take another breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sitting there at the table with an open mind, saying, 'Is there any room to 
have an agreement?' -- I don't think the commitment is there on their side for 
a compromise," McSorley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an all-out drive for victory for their side, to capture the 
future revenues of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Professional hockey in late 1994 is at the kind of crossroads major league 
baseball faced in 1949, and professional football faced in 1959, and the NBA 
faced in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Boom period, just up a ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Full speed ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Now name the first major North American sport to approach this fork in the 
road and slam on the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball has been running on stupid for quite some time now, but in the late 
'40s, with the racial barrier collapsing, great young players emerging and the 
bonanza of West Coast expansion looming, the lords of the game had enough 
foresight to at least keep the players playing. Nobody took the ball out of 
Ralph Branca's hand before he could pitch it to Bobby Thomson. No one canceled 
the World Series before Vic Wertz and Willie Mays got to play long-distance 
pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the NFL a decade later knew television was about to catapult pro 
football from second-rate status to Super Bowl Sunday and Monday night madness, 
seeing the same type of indicators hockey does today. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Rozelle always made sure his season started on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 All the great moments in sports history have one thing in common. None of them 
ever occurred during a work stoppage. Burke might be right when he says his 
game has the best athletes in the world, but what's the point when all 700 are 
sitting at home, eating cheese balls and watching videotape of games played 16 
months earlier? 
</P>
<P>
 The owners' position -- that the league is impoverished and requires financial 
assistance -- is retrograde, and the players know it. Hockey used to be the 
pauper on the sports page, but not anymore. And if certain franchises continue 
to struggle today, it is from years of promotional neglect, not the present-day 
salary structure -- which, as it is, remains a good decade behind the going 
rate for right fielders and power forwards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't agree that the owners are struggling as much as they say," McSorley 
said. "You've got as many as eight cities lined up right now for expansion. If 
we signed a bargaining agreement today, within four years there would be four 
more teams in the NHL, and each one of them would be paying $75-100 million in 
expansion fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now tell me that's a suffering business." 
</P>
<P>
 Better days are ahead for hockey, as everybody involved readily acknowledges. 
This is why the Bettman Lockout is the most lame-brained work stoppage in the 
annals of organized sports. 
</P>
<P>
 So bright a future, and yet the owners persist in dwelling in the past, miring 
their great game in the obscurity of the 1980s. Then, you couldn't watch a 
hockey game on national TV, either.

LAS VEGAS SHUFFLE: GRGURICH GETS OFFER; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: SOURCES SAY FORMER 
ASSISTANT WILL ACCEPT THREE-YEAR $900,000 DEAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No, Nevada Las Vegas doesn't have a patent on big-time college-basketball 
controversy -- it only seems that way. 
</P>
<P>
 The chaotic events of the last two weeks were seemingly capped Thursday night 
when UNLV reversed itself and offered former assistant Tim Grgurich a 
three-year contract to fill the school's vacant coaching position. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials declined to release terms of the contract, but sources said 
UNLV will pay Grgurich, a Seattle SuperSonic assistant, $300,000 per year over 
three years, including a shoe deal, to succeed the recently ousted Rollie 
Massimino. Grgurich, who believed he had a deal with UNLV officials Wednesday 
only to have it taken off the table, will accept the job, sources close to the 
negotiations said. 
</P>
<P>
 Confirmation of the offer came less than 24 hours after Athletic Director Jim 
Weaver resigned and UNLV interim President Kenny Guinn said negotiations with 
Grgurich had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 The new coach inherits a team that was 15-13 last season, one that doesn't 
have the talent that used to put UNLV among the nation's elite. 
</P>
<P>
 Grgurich, 50, was in Memphis, Tenn., Thursday with the SuperSonics but is 
expected to return to coach the Runnin' Rebels in practice this afternoon. 
Neither Grgurich nor his Las Vegas-based attorney, Roy Smith, returned phone 
calls Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Grgurich describe him as a skilled recruiter, an area in which 
Massimino did not excel during his rocky two-year tenure at UNLV. Grgurich 
favors up-tempo basketball, which he learned while serving as one of former 
coach Jerry Tarkanian's top aides for 12 seasons from 1981-92.  
</P>
<P>
 Guinn said as late as Wednesday night that talks with Grgurich had stalled and 
that he would consider hiring a coach on an interim basis. But on Thursday, 
dialogue resumed between Guinn and Smith after Guinn's office was deluged with 
pleas from basketball players and coaches in other sports at UNLV to offer the 
permanent position to Grgurich. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made some very valid points about interim coaches versus permanent 
coaches," Guinn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver resigned late Wednesday because he did not want to recommend Grgurich, 
and because of pressure he has felt from the community over his involvement in 
procuring a secret and lucrative supplemental contract for Massimino, sources 
said. Weaver was said to be worried that Grgurich's link with the former regime 
would send UNLV back into the problems it encountered with the NCAA under 
Tarkanian. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver said Wednesday he would leave UNLV by Dec. 31. But Guinn on Thursday 
persuaded him to stay until June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I resigned, that pulled me out of deciding who would be the coach," 
Weaver said. "But I want to make it clear I'm not anti-Tim Grgurich. I'm 
willing to work with whomever President Guinn wants to be coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Grgurich told Weaver on Wednesday he wanted to embrace the success of the past 
and bring back former star players such as Larry Johnson and Stacey Augmon to 
help promote the program, and to do so he would need Tarkanian's support, a 
friend of Grgurich's said. This was unacceptable to Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver is currently the subject of a probe by the Nevada Commission on Ethics 
into his handling of Massimino's contract. He gave testimony Wednesday for 
almost six hours to the commission in Las Vegas about the supplemental contract 
that paid Massimino $375,000 a year above his annual base salary of $511,000 -- 
the only one approved by the regents. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission plans to hold a hearing in early November in Las Vegas. Weaver 
could be fined if found to be in violation of the ethics code that pertains to 
state employees, said Nevada Deputy Atty. Gen. Frances Doherty, counsel for the 
commission.

MONDESI KEEPS DODGER TRADITION ALIVE BY WINNING ROOKIE AWARD; BASEBALL: RIGHT 
FIELDER FROM DOMINICAN REPUBLIC IS TEAM'S THIRD CONSECUTIVE WINNER, FOLLOWING 
KARROS AND PIAZZA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Right fielder Raul Mondesi was selected unanimous winner of the National 
League's rookie-of-the-year award in voting announced Thursday and said it was 
a fantastic feeling to sustain what he called a Dodger tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 How much of a tradition? 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi, who received all of the 28 first-place votes from a committee of the 
Baseball Writers Assn. of America, is the 14th Dodger to win the award. Jackie 
Robinson won the first in 1947. No other organization has won more than six. 
Mondesi also makes it three in a row for the Dodgers, following Eric Karros and 
Mike Piazza, the unanimous pick last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Dodgers have a chance to make it four in a row and match the streak 
that began in 1979 with Rick Sutcliffe, who was followed by Steve Howe, 
Fernando Valenzuela and Steve Sax. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, the Dodgers' vice president, said the latest streak merely 
spotlights the regeneration of a farm system that had gone fallow during the 
mid- and late '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one more indication of the direction in which we want to head," he said. 
"I don't believe we've ever had as many quality young players on the verge of 
being ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of good things happening, and we definitely have a chance to 
win a fourth in a row, although as you project the team and the people who 
could be candidates, the guy who figures most prominently has eight (major 
league) at-bats too many to qualify as a rookie, and that's unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Claire alluded to left fielder Billy Ashley, who batted .345, hit 37 home runs 
and drove in 105 runs in 388 at-bats with triple-A Albuquerque. Ashley, 24, hit 
11 more home runs in 94 fewer at-bats than in 1993 and also walked 18 more 
times, sustaining his power while cutting down on his swing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has Piazza-type power and his time has come," Claire said. "He'll get 
every opportunity to be a regular player." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Ashley will not have a shot at the rookie award, the Dodgers have 
others who might. Claire mentioned outfielders Roger Cedeno and Todd 
Hollandsworth, along with third baseman Ron Coomer, who hit 22 homers, drove in 
123 runs and batted .338 at Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceivably, the Dodgers could start a home-grown lineup in 1995 -- if the 
labor situation is resolved -- with the exception of second baseman Delino 
DeShields. Claire said Mondesi's award was another tribute to the scouting and 
development staffs, the hard work Mondesi put in and the finishing touches 
applied by Manager Tom Lasorda and his coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We threw Raul enough breaking balls this spring that he'll remember it the 
rest of his life," Lasorda said. "He saw curveballs in his dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 The result: Mondesi hit .306 in 434 at-bats. He had 16 homers, 27 doubles, 
eight triples and 56 RBIs. He also led major league outfielders with 16 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda said that with more selectivity and patience, Mondesi can realize his 
full potential as a "five-point player who can run, field, throw and hit for 
both power and average." 
</P>
<P>
 In a conference call from the Dominican Republic, Mondesi said he was proud to 
become the first Dominican to win the National League award and that he owed 
thanks to the Dodgers and Lasorda for giving him the opportunity to play every 
day and to his teammates for challenging him from the start to play hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me I have the ability to win the rookie of the year," Mondesi said, 
adding that the strike-shortened season didn't diminish the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the best numbers. That's all that matters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston Astro relief pitcher John Hudek was second in the voting, and Atlanta 
Brave outfielder Ryan Klesko was third. Mondesi said he will be playing in the 
Dominican Winter League because he wants to come to spring training ready "to 
play even harder and with more confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Chris Gwynn rejected an outright assignment to the minors and 
chose free agency. Gwynn had previously filed for free agency, but his claim 
was rejected by the owners' Player Relations Committee on the basis that he was 
a day shy of the required six years of major league service and that striking 
players didn't accrue service time. 
</P>
<P>
 The players' union is expected to file a grievance today on behalf of the nine 
players thwarted by the PRC from becoming free agents over the service-time 
issue. Claire said the Dodgers could still re-sign Gwynn, but that they have 
freed a roster spot in the meantime and provided him a way to become a free 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Kevin Gross filed for free agency after the Dodgers failed to offer 
arbitration as part of the repeater-rights procedure. Dodger Rookies of the

ANALYSIS; NEW DRAMA SURROUNDS RAIDER PLAY CALLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When quarterback Jeff Hostetler went jaw to jaw with his coach, Art Shell, 
last Sunday, eyebrows went up around the league. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler raised quite a few eyebrows last year simply by coming to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 How in the world, people wondered, would a quarterback schooled in the art of 
a ball-control offense at the elbow of the master, Bill Parcells, function at 
the elbow of Al Davis, master of the bombs-away vertical game? 
</P>
<P>
 Among those wondering were the Raider hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 As late as last year's regular-season opener, the Raiders were inquiring about 
the availability of Jeff George, then a disgruntled quarterback with the 
Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler appeared to answer all the questions with a brilliant performance 
opening day as the Raiders beat the Minnesota Vikings, 24-7. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did it his way, completing a club-record 15 consecutive passes at one 
point, going with the short routes when the Viking secondary took away the 
vertical game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler's forte is keeping the chains moving, looking for the open man and 
picking up an acceptable three or four yards when the alternative is an 
unacceptable bomb into double coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The knock on Hostetler's predecessor, Jay Schroeder, was that he wouldn't vary 
from the game plan even when prudence dictated it. His interceptions ran neck 
and neck with his touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in 1993, Hostetler showed no aversion to the vertical game when it was 
there for the taking. He passed for 424 yards against the San Diego Chargers, a 
single-game Raider record, and hooked up with James Jett on enough long passes 
to enable Jett to lead the NFL in yards per catch last season with 23.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler's leading receiver last year was wide receiver Tim Brown, who caught 
a career-high 80 passes. But the second-leading receiver was tight end Ethan 
Horton, who caught 43. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an admirable balancing act by Hostetler, who effectively mixed his 
preference for ball control with the Raiders' love of the long game. 
</P>
<P>
 But 1994 has been different from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first two games, Hostetler had trouble completing anything, long or 
short. The wounded ducks he was putting up made it appear as if he had a sore 
arm, although he vehemently denied that. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the problem, it was gone by the third game. But there were plenty of 
other problems to take its place: The Raiders dropped an alarming number of 
passes. The offensive line, despite the off-season addition of Kevin Gogan, was 
ineffective. And the running game was practically nonexistent, putting even 
more pressure on Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, there was the play-calling. 
</P>
<P>
 That's an inexact science on any team. But on the Raiders, it can sometimes be 
weird science. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis is unlike any other owner in the NFL, or any sport for that matter. He 
is out at practice every day. He talks to the players. He offers his opinions. 
And he meets afterward with Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davis, despite rumors to the contrary over the years, does not phone down 
plays from his seat in the press box during games. 
</P>
<P>
 Next door to Davis in the coaching box sits Tom Walsh, the offensive 
coordinator, who does phone down the plays. 
</P>
<P>
 That job used to belong to Terry Robiskie, a close friend of Shell's. But when 
the team struggled two years ago, Robiskie was replaced by Walsh, whose stock 
in the Raider organization has risen steadily. 
</P>
<P>
 The other member of the troika, Shell, has the deciding vote on the field. As 
the head coach, he has to maintain his authority, not always an easy task on 
this team. 
</P>
<P>
 And to make that task even more difficult, he has Hostetler and Brown on the 
field, two confident, opinionated players who don't hesitate to complain about 
or tinker with the play calling when they think it necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism of the play calling has been heavy this season. There has been 
grumbling along the chain of command that Hostetler still doesn't look 
downfield for the bomb often enough and that he depends on Brown too much. 
</P>
<P>
 There was even more grumbling when the Raiders gambled and failed on a crucial 
fourth down in a loss to the Chargers, going unsuccessfully with a run. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about the play calling went public two weeks ago in New England when 
Brown threw up his hands in disgust after a play. 
</P>
<P>
 And then last week in Miami, Hostetler changed two running plays to passes, 
causing the furor on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 So what now? 
</P>
<P>
 What happens the first time Hostetler doesn't like something he sees in the 
Atlanta Falcon defense Sunday at the Coliseum? Or what happens when Brown comes 
back to the huddle and tells Hostetler a cornerback seems to have a tender 
hamstring and can be beat? 
</P>
<P>
 Shell says Hostetler will have leeway to adjust. 
</P>
<P>
 But when there are three official voices -- Davis, Walsh and Shell -- in the 
mix, and two unofficial voices -- Hostetler and Brown -- the question is, who 
gets the last word? 
</P>
<P>
 When the Raiders win, it doesn't matter. 
</P>
<P>
 But when they don't, watch out.

REMORSEFUL BENNETT SUSPENDED BY UCLA; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: DEFENSIVE BACK WHO 
PLEADED NO CONTEST TO FELONY CHARGES HOPES TO PLAY AGAIN IN 1995. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Step 2 of Tommy Bennett's three-step program to get on with his life was 
completed Thursday when he was suspended from UCLA for the fall quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Step 3, playing football again, will have to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, a defensive back who has not played this season, pleaded no contest 
in West Los Angeles Superior Court last month to felony charges of making a 
false financial statement and grand theft and was sentenced to 300 hours of 
community service and three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been arrested on March 3 in his Saxon Suites dormitory room on campus, 
booked and released on his own recognizance. Pete Dalis, UCLA's athletic 
director, immediately suspended him from the athletic department, pending 
resolution of his legal difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, six months of legal maneuvering have left him on the outside, 
looking in at school and UCLA's football season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to get things resolved, one way or the other," he said a week 
ago, just after visiting Coach Terry Donahue to seek help in being readmitted 
to school. "Not knowing is the toughest part. I want to finish school, and I 
want to play football again, but it's not up to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision Thursday was handed down by Cary Porter, senior associate dean of 
students at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said that his problems began because of financial difficulties in his 
San Diego home, where his mother supports a daughter and several other people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was having problems with financial aid and I was broke," he said. "But 
that's not a reason for what I did. It's an excuse. I shouldn't have done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators said that in April of 1993, Bennett applied to the 
Department of Motor Vehicles for an identification card, using his picture and 
the name of another UCLA student. He then applied to a company in Las Vegas to 
supply a birth certificate, again in the name of the other student. 
</P>
<P>
 He used the identification card and birth certificate to open accounts in 
"four or five local banks" and get a credit card, said Det. Terry Brown of the 
UCLA police. It was then a matter of writing checks and using the credit card, 
beginning in May of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 When overdrafts started appearing and charge account bills went unpaid, the 
student whose name had been used was pursued by banks and went to the UCLA 
police on Nov. 12, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation took several months and culminated in the March 3 arrest, at 
which time a search warrant turned up evidence of forgery and other crimes, 
generating seven charges, five of which were dismissed by the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The student was able to identify Bennett from the picture on the ID card. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount involved totaled $2,821.55, and Brown said restitution has been 
made as part of Bennett's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett had been a starting safety as a sophomore in UCLA's Rose Bowl season 
and was part of a defense that generated 40 turnovers. He intercepted three 
passes and recovered three fumbles, returning one 18 yards for a touchdown 
against Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 His size, six feet and 200 pounds, would have been an asset this season for a 
Bruin secondary that has little. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the Tennessee game and watched, and I left," he said. "I couldn't 
take it. I've played since I was 7 years old, and it feels empty not to be 
playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Having used his redshirt season, Bennett will have one more year to play if he 
is allowed to return. He considered transferring to try to play this season but 
could not because of the timing involved in his sentencing and appeal to UCLA 
for reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Since leaving school, where he was on a schedule to graduate next winter, he 
has worked at odd jobs, part of the time as a security guard, and lived with 
UCLA and San Diego Morse High teammate Teddy Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett had worked with children, both in San Diego and at UCLA, and had been 
held up as a role model -- someone who had escaped the temptations of gang life 
in the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the hardest thing I've had to do is to tell kids what I did was wrong, 
and that I am sorry for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His future remains clouded, though there is precedent for his being allowed to 
return to the football team. A year ago, linebacker Jamir Miller was suspended 
for one game and played the rest of the season after pleading no contest to 
charges of receiving stolen goods. It was also anticipated that nose guard 
Bruce Walker would return after a year's suspension in the same incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Walker chose the NFL draft and was selected by the Philadelphia 
Eagles in the second round, then later cut. 
</P>
<P>
 After making All-American last season, Miller took the same route, giving up 
his senior season and becoming a first-round draft choice of the Arizona 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether or not Tommy returns to the football team is not an issue at this 
time," Donahue said of Bennett. "What is important is that Tommy does what is 
necessary to be readmitted to school and earn his degree."

SONNY'S DELIGHT; IN HIS SECOND SEASON, LUBICK HAS GUIDED SURPRISING COLORADO 
STATE TO A 7-0 START AND NO. 12 RANKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 To find Bill & Ted's Place in Coral Gables, Fla., you basically need, well, 
Bill or Ted. 
</P>
<P>
 Located about a mile from the University of Miami football offices, the bar is 
nothing more than a gray, one-story, concrete block building. There are no 
signs, no flashing neon, no nothing. If you didn't know any better, you'd think 
it's where some guy named Louie fixes foreign transmissions on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't get much fancier once you walk in the door. There's a pool table, a 
bar and a grill, where the best thing they serve is a hamburger with a 
half-inch-thick slice of onion. And, in a concession to the 20th Century, 
management just bought a color TV to replace the old black-and-white relic. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonny Lubick loved the place. He remembers the wall of fame, where framed 
photographs of Howard Schnellenberger, Jimmy Johnson and Dennis Erickson pass 
for interior decorating. Three Miami coaches, four national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got to be a Miami guy to get on there," said Lubick, a former Miami 
defensive coordinator. "You got to win a national championship. I mean, that's 
an exclusive wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill & Ted's might want to make an exception, especially if Lubick and his 
12th-ranked Colorado State Rams finish the season undefeated and, who knows, 
maybe make an improbable run at the national title themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 At last check the Rams were 7-0 and counting, with a game Saturday at Ft. 
Collins, Colo., against No. 18 and unbeaten Utah. Not bad, said Lubick, "for a 
kid in the park from Montana." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurricane coaches have been going to Bill & Ted's for years. Lubick was one of 
them. He'd have a few beers with the fellas, unwind, talk a little shop and, on 
occasion, allow himself a dream or two -- something in the head coaching 
variety. 
</P>
<P>
 As on most staffs, the graduate assistants knew about every coaching opening 
in the country. They had a network of contacts and used one of those 
grease-pencil blackboards to keep tabs on possible job opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Lubick would stick his head in their office and marvel at that board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to laugh, but damn if they weren't pretty accurate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about every Wednesday night after practice, Lubick and the rest of the 
staff would stop by Bill & Ted's for a drink, Erickson's treat. Almost always 
the conversation would turn to job openings: what buddy got what job where. 
</P>
<P>
 Lubick listened and considered his own future. He was 55. He was happy. He 
owned two national championship rings. But was he fulfilled? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there was a little part of me that wondered," Lubick said. "But I was 
so happy there. We're winning. We're 44-4 in the four years I was there. We've 
got great defensive football players. Two national championships and we played 
for one every year. So you couldn't have asked for a better situation." 
</P>
<P>
 There also was Erickson, whose reputation as a coach's coach made him Lubick's 
favorite. There was the warm Miami weather. There was family. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I guess there's always a yearning that maybe you look around and say, 
'OK, do I stay and do this for the next four or five years or should I try to 
take another shot at something?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Back in 1968, Lubick was the coach at Butte High in Butte, Mont. Ten years 
later, he was the coach at Montana State in Bozeman. And then four seasons 
after that . . . he wasn't at Montana State anymore. Fired. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, he became an offensive coordinator at Colorado State, then an 
assistant at Stanford, then a defensive coordinator at Washington State, then a 
defensive coordinator at Miami. He was successful. He made friends. He 
developed contacts. He burned no bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe that's why Montana State was the first to call again. It happened in 
1991, about the same time Miami traveled to Tallahassee and left town with a 
thrilling 17-16 victory over Florida State. Afterward, Lubick saw his wife, 
Carol Jo, who looked at him and said, "You want to leave this?"  
</P>
<P>
 The next season, it was Colorado State that called. The program itself was a 
public relations disaster, thanks to a handful of allegations involving Earle 
Bruce and his coaching staff. Bruce was accused of hitting players, of 
exceeding the NCAA limit of allowable practice hours, of becoming Woody Hayes 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 So Colorado State dumped Bruce and asked Lubick to return to Ft. Collins. 
Lubick made some calls. He talked to his former high school coach, Jim Sweeney, 
now at Fresno State. Sweeney gave him thumbs up on the Colorado State job. 
</P>
<P>
 Lubick talked it over with Carol Jo and asked Erickson for advice. Erickson 
didn't hesitate. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was trying to make a decision, particularly at this point in his career, 
if he wanted to become a head coach again," Erickson said. "Believe me, I tried 
to convince him to take that job because I think it was a great opportunity for 
him and a great opportunity for Colorado State. As it's turned out, he's done a 
great job." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams finished 5-6 last season, but it was the way they finished that 
mattered. After a 2-6 start, Colorado State won its last three games and hasn't 
stopped since. One more victory and the Rams tie the school record of 11 in a 
row set in 1924, which should tell you all you need to know about Colorado 
State's dismal football past. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great," said junior defensive end Sean Moran. "And it's about time." 
</P>
<P>
 So Ram-crazed is Ft. Collins over Saturday's game that a temporary bleacher 
section has been added. Hughes Stadium usually holds 30,000, but Colorado State 
officials expect it to bulge with 35,000 on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Lubick is setting a single-week record for interviews. He also has 
a TV show to do and a radio call-in program at one of the local restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the hell's happening," he said. "Life was so simple a month 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that was before Colorado State upset Brigham Young at Provo and 
three weeks later upset Arizona at Tucson. Now Lubick is a celebrity and his 
team is actually mentioned in the same sentence as Colorado, located a few 
hours away in Boulder. Imagine that. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what? We're a pretty good football team and improving all the time," 
Lubick said. "This team, they're thinking they're pretty good right now." 
</P>
<P>
 And they're right. The Rams, led by quarterback Anthoney Hill, are averaging 
nearly 33 points. The defense is a telling plus-seven in turnover margin and 
has sacked opposing quarterbacks 31 times. It still isn't Miami, but it's 
getting there. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lubick, there wasn't an offensive or defensive lineman, a 
linebacker or running back from last season's Rams -- his first team at 
Colorado State -- who could have started for the Hurricanes. There might have 
been a wide receiver or defensive back who could have challenged for a starting 
job at Miami, but that's about it. Only Hill would have had a real chance to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 This year is different. Lubick said as many as eight Rams could have played 
for the Hurricanes. Keep it up and Erickson might be calling Lubick for advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Easy as it might sound, the Colorado State transformation is the result of an 
attitude adjustment. The Rams had their winning moments with Bruce, but not 
enough to last. Then came the losses, followed by the allegations of 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty much a drag to come over every day," said Hill, who came to 
Colorado State from San Diego. "It's hard to have a hell of a lot of confidence 
when you're not winning any games." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Rams are whispering about the Western Athletic Conference championship 
and a Holiday Bowl appearance. This is heady stuff for a program with a 
100-year history, but a 10-page scrapbook of highlights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sonny Lubick -- it's simple," Hill said. "Everybody latched on to what he was 
saying." 
</P>
<P>
 And what he was saying was this: Be positive. . . . Expect to win. . . . Play 
as a family, as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it wasn't Descartes, but it worked. The Rams started to believe in 
themselves and also began winning games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always used to fight on the practice field," said Moran, who was there 
during the 3-8 season. "Actual fights with players on the team. There hasn't 
been one this year that I can remember. We're all one big family out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Free safety Greg Myers didn't have a clue who Lubick was when Colorado State 
announced the hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "But a lot of people do now," Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Lubick, there was a pep rally last week that drew more than 1,000 
fans. And how does that compare to the past? 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, we haven't really had a pep rally before," said junior defensive end 
Brady Smith. "We would have them, but only a few boosters and alumni would 
come. And the band too -- but they had to." 
</P>
<P>
 Now everyone in Ft. Collins wants to be part of Ram mania. Watching with a 
satisfied smile is Lubick. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is just going so good," he said. "I just know deep inside me that 
this cannot last forever. But our players are playing with so much feeling for 
each other. They're playing for something beyond. They're certainly not playing 
for themselves."

MIKE DOWNEY: A GENUINE BOX-OFFICE ATTRACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before he came to produce such blockbuster movies as "The Terminator," 
"Platoon" and "The Last Emperor," the great passion of John Daly was 
prizefighting. He boxed as a lad in England, as his father and uncle had, and 
later, purely by chance, it was Daly's last-minute intervention that helped to 
stage what many considered the fight of the century, George Foreman vs. 
Muhammad Ali. 
</P>
<P>
 That one, "The Rumble in the Jungle," brought big-time heavyweight boxing to a 
new neutral corner of the world. And this weekend John Daly -- not the golfer, 
mind you -- is doing it again, acting as one of the promoters for a 
worth-pay-per-viewing card Saturday in the exotic setting of Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 There, on the southeastern coast of China, where British rule is drawing to an 
end after more than 150 years, Daly is pleased because "maybe Britain can at 
least go out with a bit of a bang." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no monumental bouts along the lines of Foreman-Ali are scheduled, 
this promotion from Hemdale Special Events, called "High Noon in Hong Kong," 
should at least be entertaining and will be rushed out on video cassettes 
within a week. Tommy Morrison resurfaces to meet an awkward but undefeated Brit 
with the adorable name of Herbie Hide. The card also features Ray Mercer and 
Frank Bruno, two heavyweights in search of a Requiem, plus, far more appealing, 
one of Southern California's battling Ruelas brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Difficult to tell which heavyweights are and aren't legitimate these days. 
England had a heroic figure for a while in Lennox Lewis, until one Oliver 
McCall recently turned Lennox's legs to pudding. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were right to stop it," Daly said this week on the phone from London. 
"Lewis' legs definitely gave way." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years earlier, before Daly had become executive producer of many 
distinguished films ("Salvador," "The Falcon and the Snowman," "Hoosiers") 
including a couple of Oscar-winning Best Pictures, he was witness to another 
heavyweight fight in which one of the principals was made to wobble and 
stagger. It was a night he will never forget -- or a morning actually, since 
Ali and Foreman stepped through the ropes in Zaire, Africa to begin their 
jungle warfare at 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before that fight was set, Daly was sitting and shivering one afternoon 
inside a Hemdale Film Corporation office in London, where a coal strike had 
caused businesses and residences to go without proper heat. On this dreary day, 
in a room illuminated by kerosene lamps, Daly had a surprise visitor, a 
passerby who'd seen his sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing of the Daly family's long association with boxing, the stranger 
explained that he was directly involved in an attempt to bring together the two 
most famous names in boxing, Foreman, the unbeaten heavyweight champion, and 
Ali, the once and future king, in a spectacular promotion, probably bound for 
Madison Square Garden in New York. But the financing necessary to secure this 
promotion was crumbling, and a deadline was to expire within hours. The man was 
desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to resist, Daly seized the moment. He began making calls to associates 
from Chicago to New York to Oakland, trying to arrange funding by that day's 
close of business. There were headaches galore, not the least of which was 
Daly's endeavoring to read the fine print of documents in a room dim as a cave. 
</P>
<P>
 "But boxing was always the No. 1 sport of my life, so I was positively 
thrilled," he remembers. 
</P>
<P>
 That was 1973. The following year, Foreman-Ali was set, not for New York but 
for Kinshasa, Zaire, where the fighters were lured by sums of money 
unprecedented in boxing. Daly went along for the wild ride, sitting ringside 
and viewing one of the most unforgettable spectacles in sport. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, a lightweight with about 300 bouts under his belt, went to Zaire 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a very clever boxer myself, won lots of cups," Daly says. "As I got 
older, boxing faded out of my life, but I always wanted to keep that bond with 
my father, who went on to manage many fine English boxers. Then this 
opportunity to be involved in one of the great sporting events of our lifetime 
came to me out of the blue. Perhaps it was fate." 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, Daly can remember Foreman dropping by his office unexpectedly and 
everyone there in a panic, trying to steer George from the reception area 
before he spotted a prominently placed photograph of a triumphant Ali, standing 
over his victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The rumble in the jungle was quite a night. Around Round 2, when Ali began to 
sag on the ropes and not return Foreman's punches, many at ringside feared the 
worst. A flop. Maybe even a fix. 
</P>
<P>
 "Foreman, remember, was a 6-to-1, maybe 7-to-1 favorite," Daly says. "Millions 
doubted he could be beaten." 
</P>
<P>
 But he was not among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I can prove it," he insists. "There's a version of it on film that 
captures me saying it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The round ends and David Frost, who was doing the broadcast of the fight, 
turns to me and says, 'So. What do you think?' 
</P>
<P>
 "And I say, 'Ali, KO, eighth.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Truly, I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Let the record show that referee Zack Clayton counted out the fallen Foreman 
in the eighth round, as Ali danced in a nearby corner. It was they who had done 
the punching, but it was John Daly who was hooked.

SENIOR GOLF AT RANCHO PARK; IT JUST KEEPS ON GETTING BETTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once Arnold Palmer became interested, there was little doubt the Senior PGA 
Tour would succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 There were some things that could have held it back. For one, there was the 
fear Jack Nicklaus, a Lee Trevino or a Raymond Floyd would win all the time. 
There was also concern that there might not be enough good players at 50 and 
over to make it competitive every week. 
</P>
<P>
 Such problems never materialized, and senior golf mushroomed. 
</P>
<P>
 A case in point is the $750,000 Ralphs Senior Classic, the 54-hole tournament 
beginning today at Rancho Park. Nicklaus, who plays infrequently, and Trevino, 
who is ailing, are not here. Floyd is playing, but has not been at the top of 
his game, especially his putting. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, competition will run deep as the senior golfers try to slow Dave 
Stockton's drive to a second consecutive money title. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those challenging Stockton are Jim Albus, one of four who has already 
won $1 million this year; two others who are close, Jim Colbert and Tom Wargo 
defending champion Dale Douglass and the always dangerous Floyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus didn't take over the tour, in part at least, because he wasn't that 
interested. Injuries set back Trevino, and Floyd wasn't sure what tour he 
wanted to play. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another reason for the competitiveness of the tour. It has developed 
a new class of golfers -- club professionals and amateurs who failed to reach 
potential early. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the group are such late comers as Wargo, Albus, Larry Gilbert, 
Walt Zembriski, Jay Sigel, John Paul Cain, Simon Hobday, Rocky Thompson and 
numerous others. None made it on the regular tour, although Sigel and Cain were 
world-ranked amateurs. What is amazing is that they are winners, despite the 
presence of stars from the regular tour. 
</P>
<P>
 In any given tournament, there are at least 30 capable of winning. In the 
early years, there were maybe half a dozen who could win. In 1985, Australian 
Peter Thomsom won nine of the 27 tour events. This year there are 44 events, 
few repeaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, several unknowns move into contention, making it tougher for the 
established stars to keep winning. Newcomers breaking through this year include 
Sigel, Kermit Zarley, Tony Jacklin and Dave Eichelberger. 
</P>
<P>
 To show how difficult the tour has become, Stockton, the 1993 player of the 
year, hasn't won since mid-August. Trevino, out for the year because of a disk 
problem, is winless since July. And Floyd last won in May. 
</P>
<P>
 This tournament is one of only three more that count in this year's money 
battle. Next week there is the Kaanapali and in mid-November there is the 
$1.35-million Golf magazine tour championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle for the money title and a new record for earnings is keen. 
Stockton, who won $1,175, 944 last year, has already won more than that -- 
$1,321,135. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is still a small chance he could lose the money title. Floyd is at 
$1.17 million, Albus at $1.08. Amazing, considering that in 1982, total purses 
on the senior circuit were $1.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A sad note is that Palmer won't be here. He is winding down his career and 
Arnie's Army will have to find someone else to follow. Maybe it will be Chi Chi 
Rodriguez, grand marshal of the Rose parade, or the former commissioner of the 
regular tour, Deane Beman.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; NEWMAN STANDS OUT DESPITE INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Safety Anthony Newman, the hero in the Rams' 17-10 victory over the Giants 
last week with a game-ending interception, said in six years of practicing 
against Jim Everett he never intercepted an Everett pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd go No. 1 defense versus No. 1 offense in training camp and then I'd play 
on the scout team and I never picked Jim Everett," Newman said. "A lot of times 
you're out there and it just happens, Chris Miller throws a ball and you 
intercept it. I'm definitely due." 
</P>
<P>
 Newman seriously injured the little finger on his right hand before last 
week's game and made the key interception with his right hand so heavily 
bandaged it looked like a club. This week he will attempt to play with only his 
last two fingers protected by a cast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The throbbing has stopped, but I'm very conscious of it," Newman said. "I 
don't shake hands or open doors, and I need help putting on my shoulder pads 
and snapping my chin strap." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the inconveniences, Newman played against the Giants and has continued 
to practice effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he slit his finger and that bone was sticking out, there was still no 
doubt in his mind that he was going to play," said Joe Vitt, Ram assistant head 
coach. "It wasn't up to the doctors, it was up to Anthony and it shows what 
kind of attitude he has." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Erkenbeck, Ram offensive line coach, worked previously as offensive 
coordinator for Jim Mora's Philadelphia/Baltimore Stars in the USFL, and 
Erkenbeck said Mora will not allow the New Orleans Saints to pack it in because 
of two consecutive losses and a 2-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's absolutely no chance of that; there is no panic in this guy," 
Erkenbeck said. "When the bullets start flying, none of it fazes him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive tackle Jimmie Jones missed practice with a sore hip, but Coach Chuck 
Knox said he will play against the Saints. . . . Tom Newberry has been promoted 
to offensive team captain while Jackie Slater recovers from a torn triceps 
muscle. Knox said Slater is expected to be ready to play again after the bye 
next week. . . . Knox said rookie wide receiver Isaac Bruce continues to 
improve, but Jessie Hester remains the starter opposite Flipper Anderson. . . . 
Rookie Wayne Gandy will start again at right tackle although Knox said Darryl 
Ashmore "just needs to get bumped around and gain some confidence." Ashmore, 
who was projected to start at right tackle this season, injured a knee earlier. 
Center Bern Brostek remains on crutches with his broken leg in a cast. The team 
hopes to have him return in three to five weeks. T.J. SIMERS

LINEBACKER SMALL CAME UP BIG AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME FOR USC; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: 
SURVIVING SERIOUS CAR ACCIDENT HAS LEFT TROJAN PLAYER WITH A NEW ATTITUDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the space of half a minute last Saturday at Palo Alto, USC executed what 
could arguably be called its three best plays of the football season.  
</P>
<P>
 With about 4 minutes 30 seconds left and USC leading Stanford, 20-13, the 
following transpired: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom completed a short pass to Anthony 
Bookman, and USC cornerback John Herpin knocked him into yesterday with a 
jarring tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Two plays later, Stenstrom tried the same pass, but USC linebacker Errol 
Small made a leaping, one-handed interception from a range of about 12 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the next play, USC tailback Shawn Walters swept around Stanford's left 
side on a 61-yard touchdown run, the longest run from scrimmage by a Trojan 
back in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 But for pure athleticism, Small's interception at point-blank range has to be 
the leader for USC's play of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 Is this guy in the right sport? Shouldn't he be playing third base for 
someone? 
</P>
<P>
 Fact is, Small is grateful to be playing any sport. 
</P>
<P>
 He and two 1993 Trojan teammates narrowly escaped death in an auto accident 
last Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Small's parents got the most unsettling kind of phone call parents can get 
early that morning. It was from Erroll, calling from West Hills Regional 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom, I've been in a wreck," Small said. "They're hurt. Please come." 
</P>
<P>
 Small and two teammates, Jason Oliver and Michael Jones, had just survived a 
frightening accident on the Ventura Freeway near Calabasas.  
</P>
<P>
 It happened at 3:30 a.m. Small, the driver, saw a car moving erratically as it 
entered the freeway from an on-ramp. Later, it would be learned, one of that 
car's axles had just broken. 
</P>
<P>
 The car spun out of control and Small turned hard right to avoid it. His car 
skidded, then flipped 7 1/2 times. It slid, wheels up, for 300 feet, then 
tumbled into a drainage ditch.  
</P>
<P>
 "I blacked out, but I wasn't out long," said Small, who was the least injured 
of the three. 
</P>
<P>
 There was blood everywhere, from deep cuts on Oliver's hand and arm. Oliver 
screamed from the pain. Jones was quiet.  
</P>
<P>
 "I got out of my seat belt upside down, and got out and got the back door open 
to get Michael," Small recalled.  
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who had been sleeping in the back seat, was unconscious. An asthmatic, 
he also was not breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 Small, who had never had instruction in CPR, brought his teammate back to 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pulled him out of the car and was blowing into his mouth, and he started 
breathing again," Small said, adding that at that moment an ambulance arrived.  
</P>
<P>
 Oliver was hospitalized for three weeks. His cut hand became infected and 
doctors briefly considered amputating fingers. Jones has more than two dozen 
pins in his right arm, which was broken in seven places. He faces further 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Small had minor cuts and bruises.  
</P>
<P>
 Small, Oliver and Jones are close friends. They had come in together to USC's 
football program in the summer of 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, Jones and Oliver are junior varsity coaches at Montclair Prep in Van 
Nuys.  
</P>
<P>
 And Errol Small is a football player with a new attitude.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have a totally different outlook on life, since the accident," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, who knows how long I'll play this game? I enjoy one day at a time. I 
go out to practice every day and do the very best I can, and try to appreciate 
everything I used to take for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 And his new attitude shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Small's remarkable interception Saturday was yet another big play by a 
big-play player, defensive coordinator Don Lindsey said.  
</P>
<P>
 A 6-foot-2, 240-pound senior outside linebacker, Small is making up for lost 
time. He's had two knee operations and one on his shoulder since USC recruited 
him at Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High and never did crack the starting lineup 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he's starting ahead of heralded junior college transfer Izzy Ifeanyi and 
playing the kind of football Lindsey says can get him into the next NFL draft.  
</P>
<P>
 "Errol's big assets are that he plays hard, he's very aggressive and he's 
fast," Lindsey said. "Guys like that tend to make big plays and that's exactly 
what he's doing. If he plays the rest of the season like he's played the last 
couple of games, he'll attract some NFL attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, as Lindsey points out, coaching has something to do with all this 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "When our outside linebackers are being blocked on a pass play, and when they 
see a (right-handed) quarterback's left hand come off that ball, we want them 
to get their hands up in the air. If they can't block it, we at least want them 
to force the quarterback to put more hang time on the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, best of all, catch it.  
</P>
<P>
 "The ball came point-first right into my palm, and I just hung on to it," said 
Small, describing his Brooks Robinson play.  
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Robinson, after reviewing the play on video Sunday morning, noted 
that everyone on the field -- including Small -- was stunned by the play.  
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as he caught it, I'm yelling, 'Run! Run!' " Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "But he went stationary, like everyone else. Errol turned a 30-yard return 
into a plus-four." 
</P>
<P>
 Small came to USC as a running back. At Notre Dame High, he ran for 275 yards 
in the season opener of his senior season. He was also a 200-pound free safety. 
 
</P>
<P>
 He gained 1,567 yards his senior year, averaging 7.7 yards a carry, and scored 
21 touchdowns. Yet always, he knew he'd be a defensive player in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nearly everyone who recruited Errol pegged him as a safety or linebacker in 
college," said his prep coach, Kevin Rooney. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a big, tough physical runner, but didn't have that burner speed to be 
a running back on the major-college level." 
</P>
<P>
 Small was recruited principally by USC, UCLA, Notre Dame, Washington and 
Colorado.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 12, I played Pop Warner football for the East Valley Trojans," 
Small said. "I always wanted to be a Trojan."

CHERRINGTON SPARKS SANTA ANA VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Orloff has spent much of the season trying to convince his young Santa 
Ana Valley team that if it played hard for an entire game, good things could 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
 The message came through loud and clear Thursday as the Falcons ruined 
Orange's homecoming with a 28-21 Century League victory at El Modena High. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest gate crasher was workhorse running back Dwayne Cherrington, who 
rushed for 190 yards -- 137 of which came in the first half -- and two 
touchdowns and returned a kickoff 95 yards for another score with about 10 
minutes left in the game that gave Santa Ana Valley (3-4, 1-1) its ultimate 
margin of victory. Cherrington later said it was "our biggest win." 
</P>
<P>
 "He is definitely a Division I (college) back," Orloff said. "He's run behind 
a young line all season, but he's helped us come together as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange (4-3, 1-1) had productive performances, too. Markus Garza gained 158 
yards and scored a touchdown, and Sam Cureton added 51 yards and a touchdown. 
Quarterback Andy Lauridsen had an off night throwing, completing only seven 
passes, but one was a 15-yard scoring toss to Anthony Adame with 1:19 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Ana Valley recovered the ensuing onside kick, and hung on for the 
upset. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley took the lead for good in the second quarter after a 
Lauridsen pass was intercepted in the end zone. On the seven-play, 80-yard 
drive, Cherrington controlled six plays. The two biggest carries were a 54-yard 
gain that took the ball from the Falcons' 21 to the Panthers' 25, and a 
three-yard run for a touchdown with 38 seconds remaining.

ORANGE LEAGUE; BREA-OLINDA GETS PAST ANAHEIM

<P>
 Reuben Droughns proved again Thursday night that he is the best running back 
in the county, but his passing abilities doomed Anaheim in its 14-10 loss to 
Brea-Olinda at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colonists had the ball at Brea-Olinda's 14 with less than a minute left 
when Droughns took a pitch from quarterback Rudy Herrera and swept right.He 
tried to throw the ball across the field to Herrera, but the Wildcats' Ben 
Evers intercepted Droughns' pass and returned it 34 yards to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda (5-1-1, 1-0-1) had taken a 14-10 lead with 1 minute 30 seconds 
left on a 63-yard touchdown pass from Matt Kalcevich to Andy Wirz. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim (5-1-1, 0-1-1) had the ball on its 35 after Wirz's kickoff landed out 
of bounds. Droughns then single-handedly put the Colonists in scoring position. 
He caught a pass from Herrera behind the line of scrimmage and took it 30 yards 
to Brea-Olinda's 35. He then rushed for 15 and six yards before his pass ended 
Anaheim's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns finished with 120 yards in 21 carries. Brea-Olinda held him to six 
yards in seven carries in the first half, but he broke loose for a 36-yard 
touchdown run with 2:12 left in the third quarter to tie the game, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Vasquez kicked a 47-yard field goal with 7:58 left, giving Anaheim a 10-7 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda took a 7-0 lead in the first quarter on Jerome Owens' two-yard 
touchdown run, which was set up by a 45-yard pass from Kalcevich to Wirz, 
putting the Wildcats at Anaheim's four-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colonists sacked Brea-Olinda quarterbacks five times, including four in 
the second half, when they held the Wildcats to 78 yards. GABE LACQUES

SAVANNA TAKES TO THE AIR, BEATS VALENCIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Savanna Coach Fred Di Palma knew it would be tough to run through Valencia's 
physical defense, so the Rebels threw over it. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna quarterback Jeremy Klemp tossed three touchdown passes in the first 
half to help the Rebels, ranked 10th in Orange County, post a 28-7 victory over 
Valencia in an Orange League football game Thursday at Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
 Klemp, who completed nine of 13 passes for 206 yards with one interception, 
connected on his first seven passes. Two completions were long touchdown passes 
to wide receiver Roy Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were fortunate that we made some big plays," Di Palma said. "Myers had a 
couple of big catches and he's starting to come into his own." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers' first catch came on the fourth play from scrimmage for Savanna (6-1, 
2-0 in league). With Valencia's pass defense using tight coverage, Myers raced 
past the secondary and caught a 61-yard touchdown pass from Klemp only 1 minute 
57 seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia's defense responded on the Rebels' next possession, forcing Daven 
King to fumble and Mario Zavala recovered for the Tigers (1-5-1, 0-1-1) at the 
Savanna 47. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia moved 47 yards in 10 plays and scored on a fourth and one from the 
Savanna six. Valencia quarterback Joe Secoda faked a handoff to Jermaine Gray, 
who rushed for 65 yards in 17 carries, and found a wide-open Chris Roussin in 
the corner of the end zone for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Secoda kicked the conversion for a 7-6 lead with 1:04 remaining in the first 
quarter, but that was Valencia's last highlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna answered with Klemp moving the Rebels on a seven-play, 52-yard scoring 
drive in 2:25, capping it with a six-yard touchdown pass to Eric Shine. Klemp 
scored the two-point conversion on a keeper to make the score 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
 On Savanna's next possession, Myers caught a 49-yard touchdown pass from Klemp 
to make it 20-7 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia kept it close by shutting down Savanna's potent running attack for 
the first half, limiting the Rebels to 40 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it was going to be tough running against Valencia because their 
defense is so physical," Di Palma said.  
</P>
<P>
 King, who rushed for 65 yards in 14 carries, broke loose in the second-half 
scoring on a 28-yard touchdown run on Savanna's first possession of the third 
quarter.

CENTURY LEAGUE; SMALL STATURE DOESN'T KEEP JACOBS OUT OF THE BIG PLAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Receivers don't normally lead the county in interceptions in their first year 
of playing defense. And 5-foot-10 receivers don't normally catch balls intended 
for players half a foot taller than them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Canyon quarterback Adam Hoover has been watching Greg Jacobs do the 
unexpected since their Pop Warner days. And Hoover has come to understand that 
nothing Jacobs does on the football field is normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has something you can't coach -- something that makes up for his size," 
Hoover said. "His vertical (jump) is only about 32 inches or so and he's only 
5-10, but put Greg in a game and he becomes a different player. He'll out-jump 
people much taller than him and he'll outrun people faster than him. I envy 
him. I can step it up a notch for the game, but he is incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Incredible, and virtually unstoppable. In six games this season, he has caught 
a county-leading 48 passes for 520 yards and four touchdowns, and he has 
intercepted six passes. He is tied with Esperanza's Anton Hector and Valencia's 
Rhett Shepard for the interception lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've already beaten last year's (personal) record of 38 catches," said 
Jacobs, a senior. "It's shocking, but I just hope I can keep it going. I'm 
praying a lot that I can get a good scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
 If Jacobs' mailbox is any indication, it appears his prayers might be answered 
soon. He has received letters from many Division I colleges, including 
California, USC, UCLA, Colorado, Fresno State and San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover said he doesn't have any doubt that Jacobs will be a starting receiver 
for a Division I program. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was by far the best receiver in our league as a sophomore, and he just 
kept getting better," Hoover said. "He'll have to step it up in college because 
he'll be playing against bigger and faster people, but he's always stepped it 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, Jacobs has had a hard time taking any steps without a crowd 
around him. Since he broke into the starting lineup as sophomore, Jacobs has 
seen double and occasionally triple coverage, but Canyon receivers coach Kevin 
Emerson said traffic has never bothered Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll know where he has to go across the field and he can feel pressure 
around him," Emerson said. "He gets so absorbed with the ball, he blocks 
everything else out." 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes that includes blocking out other players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Against El Modena last year, Greg jumped for the ball in the end zone and 
didn't originally have it," Emerson said. "But by the time he came down to the 
ground, he had taken it away from the defender who had it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs' end zone theft was a personal favorite of Hoover's too, but Jacobs 
said his catch against El Dorado in this season's opener would lead his 
highlight film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adam threw me a 12-yard out and I just dove and totally extended my body like 
a wooden board, then I pulled it toward me with one hand," Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours of practice have made one-handed catches almost routine for Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adam and I do one-handed contests before each season," Jacobs said. "We try 
to outdo each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hoover: "He doesn't know it, but I'm kind of testing him in those 
sessions. I throw it high and outside and see just how far he can extend 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, Hoover said, Jacobs winds up making his errant passes look pretty 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not perfect and he makes up for a lot of my imperfections," Hoover said. 
"I'll take chances on passes to Greg that I wouldn't with any other receiver. I 
know if he can't get it, no one else will." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs' knack of coming up with the spectacular catch has made him a 
quarterback's nightmare as a cornerback. Against Corona del Mar, Jacobs 
intercepted three passes and caught four more as a receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what it's like to be a receiver, so I can think with the receiver," 
Jacobs said. "In high school, most quarterbacks latch onto one receiver. When I 
see that look in his eyes, that's when I make my break." 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, Jacobs figures to have a hand, or maybe two, in the outcome of 
tonight's Century League showdown against visiting Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be an air show," Jacobs said. "If the offense isn't looking too 
hot (tonight), I'll give it all I have on defense and try to make a play." 
FOOTHILL VS. CANYON

RETURN TO POWER; FORMER COACH ANCICH HAS LED REVIVAL OF FOOTBALL PROGRAM AT ST. 
PAUL HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is an hour before kickoff and already the bleachers are filling up at St. 
Paul High in Santa Fe Springs. Parking is at such a premium that many neighbors 
have converted their driveways and lawns into lots and are making a little side 
money. Fans have to wait in long lines to buy tickets, and a program full of 
local ads costs a hefty $3. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this, though, is welcomed by the blue-collar community nestled between 
Whittier and Norwalk along I-605. Until last season, St. Paul had gone through 
an 11-year drought in football, and finding a seat at a home game was no 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 During the losing spell, fans tended to reminisce about happier times. For 20 
years, until 1981, the football team was a power in the Southland. Coach 
Marijon Ancich had a glittering record of 188-31-5, four undefeated seasons and 
three Southern Section titles. Kids in the area grew up dreaming of playing for 
the Swordsmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Things peaked in 1981, when St. Paul defeated Colton, 30-9, in the 
championship game before 30,000 at Anaheim Stadium and finished at 14-0. Ancich 
then surprised everybody by leaving to become the offensive coordinator at 
Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. The boisterous booster club held a 
wake. 
</P>
<P>
 That wake, for all practical purposes, lasted until last season, when Ancich 
returned. Hundreds of friends and supporters turned out for a welcome-back 
party that reportedly raised thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marijon is obviously like the messiah coming back," said Steve Grady, the 
veteran coach at Loyola, another Catholic powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Ancich, 56, is revered at St. Paul. His program was often mentioned among the 
best in the nation. Local Pop Warner, elementary and junior high football 
coaches knew his system and used it with their teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The four coaches who succeeded Ancich could never escape his shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wanted to live up to what he did," said Ron Henke, St. Paul's coach 
in 1991 and '92 who had a record of 8-14. "He was the one that started all the 
tradition. I know I had a lot of respect for what he did." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 St. Paul was opened in 1954. Ancich, a native of Yugoslavia who graduated from 
San Pedro High, often scouted for the football team while working as a 
longshoreman before becoming its coach in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era when relatively few teams made the playoffs, St. Paul was a frequent 
visitor, playing in five title games. From 1967-77, the team did not lose a 
home game. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's field, Cranham Stadium, seats 4,500, but crowds twice that size 
were not uncommon. The turf, Ancich's pride and joy, was immaculate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ancich earned a reputation as a stickler for detail, putting in 90 or more 
hours a week in preparation for that weekend's game. He was described as a 
strong disciplinarian who demanded respect. 
</P>
<P>
 His departure left a void. The football team was dropped from the prestigious 
Division I to III and had four losing seasons. Enrollment dropped from a peak 
of 1,500 in the early 1980s to a little more than 900 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Ancich did not even last a season at Northern Arizona, admitting later that 
the move had been a mistake. He eventually signed to coach at Tustin High, 
where, beginning in 1984, he spent nine years rebuilding the football program. 
The Tillers won four league titles and advanced to two championship games 
during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, St. Paul supporters were putting pressure on administrators 
to bring Ancich back. When Henke resigned after the '92 season, Father Robert 
Gallagher agreed it was time to go after Ancich. 
</P>
<P>
 "A gift from heaven," Ancich said when offered the job. "In the back of my 
mind I had always hoped I would return someday." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At his first meeting with St. Paul players last year, Ancich received a 
five-minute standing ovation. Former assistant coaches and players held a golf 
tournament in his honor and praised his return. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact was immediate. The football team, back to Division I status, 
finished the regular season 7-3 and nearly upset Mater Dei in the first round 
of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 A team that had been out of the media spotlight was suddenly back in the 
headlines. Enrollment is back to more than 1,000, with this year's freshman 
class the largest in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had $250,000 to spend, I could not have bought better advertising for 
the school," Gallagher said. "Football is an important part of any school, and 
the team has certainly lifted the spirits around here. Instead of having to 
make cuts, we're growing." 
</P>
<P>
 That emphasis on football also draws criticism. Some question putting 
athletics over academics. Ancich's record has drawn accusations of recruiting, 
and many outsiders question his tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Football players get special privileges at St. Paul, including top priority in 
the weight room. Ancich is regarded as a workaholic who keeps coaches away from 
their families during the season and requires too much time of his players. 
</P>
<P>
 He is not reluctant to chew out a player during a game, often resorting to 
various forms of intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is the infamous "spying" incident, which continues to hound Ancich 
after two decades. Three St. Paul assistants were caught observing a practice 
at Pioneer High in Whittier on Nov. 20, 1974, from a van across the street. The 
incident led to a forfeit and expulsion from the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 To this day, Ancich says his assistants were in the area only because they 
were eating at a nearby restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swordsmen, who play host to Encino Crespi tonight at 7:30, are 6-0 and 
back in winning form after upsetting Loyola last week. But the season has not 
been without controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Gerry Ceballos was involved in fight with several Santa Fe players 
three weeks ago at a local fast-food restaurant. Ceballos told police he had 
been cornered and punched in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools traded angry barbs about the incident, and Ceballos, playing with 
a black eye, led his team to a 28-0 victory later that week. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident might have gone unreported a few years ago but it is news now. 
St. Paul football is suddenly important again. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Paul players appear united. In a recent game against Redlands, the 
reserves held hands on the sideline while on the field the team posted a 28-7 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "The football program had gotten away here, and we're just trying to get 
everybody back on the same page," Ancich said. "We don't have many college 
prospects here, so we've got to be more prepared than the next guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our players are overachieving right now, and that's what has to be done. 
We've got years of work ahead of us."

GOLDEN WEST LEAGUE; SERVITE POSSESSIONS DEEP-SIX OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Servite scored on all six of its first-half possessions and defeated Ocean 
View, 48-13, in a Golden West League game Thursday at Huntington Beach High. 
</P>
<P>
 David Bedard scored on an 18-yard run and a 43-yard reception as the Friars 
(5-2, 2-0 in league) built a 41-6 halftime lead.Bedard then returned the 
second-half kickoff 91 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View (0-7, 0-2) has lost 36 in a row, the longest streak in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The dominant first-half offensive performance by the Friars, who gained 295 
total yards before intermission, overshadowed a career-best performance by 
Ocean View quarterback Ted Norman. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman, a junior, passed for 264 yards and rushed for 67 more. He accounted 
for both Seahawk touchdowns, connecting with Jared De La Chica on an 84-yard 
pass in the first half and scoring on a 21-yard run in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior defensive end Sebastian Hernandez set up two scores on special teams 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 A blocked punt by Hernandez on the opening possession of the game set the 
Friars up at the Ocean View 18, and Bedard scored on the next play for a 7-0 
lead. After Frank Patti scored on a four-yard run in the second quarter to make 
it 27-6, Leland Washington muffed the ensuing kickoff and Hernandez recovered 
at the Ocean View 11. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next play, David Martin passed to tight end Phil Dumas for a touchdown.

PACIFIC COAST LEAGUE; LAGUNA HILLS TOPS ESTANCIA, WINS FOURTH IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two teams heading in opposite directions stayed the course as Laguna Hills 
held off Estancia, 21-9, in a Pacific Coast League game Thursday at Newport 
Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks (5-2, 2-0) won their fourth consecutive game while the Eagles lost 
their third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks were led by Brendan McGraw, who scored two rushing touchdowns and 
one receiving touchdown. McGraw, a senior, ran for 168 yards in 37 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills opened the scoring with 1 minute 41 seconds left in the first 
quarter as McGraw found the end zone on a 28-yard pass from Cory Pardoe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (3-4, 0-2) got their best field position of the game when Karlo 
Amaya returned the second-half kickoff 51 yards to the Laguna Hills 46-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten plays and almost four minutes later, a 36-yard field goal by Ben Novak 
closed the gap to 7-3. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ensuing drive McGraw completed a 14-play, 70-yard drive with a two-yard 
run to put Laguna Hills ahead, 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks put the game out of reach with McGraw's 24th touchdown of the season 
from nine yards in the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles were led by Novak, who caught a game-high eight passes for 88 
yards, including a late eight-yard touchdown pass from Frough Jahid. MATT

 Freddie Knight's one-yard run with 1 minute 7 seconds remaining gave Covina a 
31-31 tie with Rancho Alamitos in front of 2,300 Thursday night at Covina 
District Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The play before the touchdown run caused a ruckus.On fourth and inches from 
outside the one, and Rancho Alamitos holding a 31-25 lead, running back Knight 
was penalized for a false start. However, after a meeting by the referees and a 
discussion with both coaches, the penalty was waved off.  
</P>
<P>
 Since Knight didn't make contact with any other player, the officials ruled 
his movement legal. 
</P>
<P>
 With the ball back on the one, Knight lunged over the top, tying the score, 
31-31. Moises Gallardo missed the extra-point kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos' Leo Kosi returned the ensuing kickoff to the Colts' 48-yard 
line. Quarterback John Frank (eight for 11, 184 yards) completed a 33-yard pass 
to Jeff Turbarg. 
</P>
<P>
 Turbarg fumbled and Covina's Jason Glapsy recovered, ending the final 
offensive threat of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros (4-2-1) were led by Frank and senior running back Chris Young. 
Young rushed for 135 yards in 17 carries and two touchdowns. He also recovered 
a blocked field goal and returned it 82 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Michael Ulrich rushed for 155 yards in nine carries with two 
touchdowns for the Colts (5-1-1). He was also eight for 16 for 84 yards and one 
touchdown. TONY ALTOBELLI

GARDEN GROVE LEAGUE FOOTBALL; SUMMERS LEADS PACIFICA PAST BOLSA GRANDE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacifica scored on its first three possessions and went on to a 42-7 victory 
over Bolsa Grande in a Garden Grove League game Thursday at Bolsa Grande High. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Johansen connected with Mike Parsons for a 30-yard touchdown pass and 
Tommy Summers rushed for touchdowns of 13 and 28 yards on back-to-back plays, 
all before the second quarter, for Pacifica (3-4, 2-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Summers, who sat out the entire second half, rushed for 104 yards in 12 
carries to lead the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Burt scored on a three-yard touchdown run late in the second quarter to 
give Pacifica a 28-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners held Bolsa Grande (1-6, 0-3) to only three yards of offense in 
the first half and 68 for the game. Pacifica sacked Matador quarterback David 
Price six times in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica's Eric Westlund, who carried 22 times for 71 yards, scored from eight 
yards out, and punter Mike Fernandez ran 52 yards for another touchdown after 
dropping the snap to give the Mariners a 42-0 lead late in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 A banged up Price finally scored for Bolsa Grande with 56 seconds remaining 
when he scrambled 35 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss is the sixth consecutive for Bolsa Grande. GEOFF BILAU

MACLEAN TAKES STAGE UNDER CENTER; GRANADA HILLS QUARTERBACK BECOMES AREA'S 
LEADING PASSER IN 1ST YEAR AS STARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian MacLean wore No. 50 in practice this week. A most ill-suited numeral for 
a quarterback -- especially a football-slinging, pass-happy Granada Hills High 
quarterback -- but OK for a tight end. 
</P>
<P>
 At tight end is where MacLean figured to spend his senior season, catching the 
odd pass and maybe mopping up as the backup quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 But he lucked out because of an early retirement plan last summer. Incumbent 
quarterback Jim Landress, whom MacLean had backed up since the two friends were 
in ninth grade, quit football to concentrate on baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Guess who finally got to shine? 
</P>
<P>
 MacLean, the goateed, unorthodox thrower with blue-collar footwork, is now in 
the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 He wears a very quarterback-like No. 14 in games, and he has more than lived 
up to that number by leading the area in passing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still surprising myself, " he said with a bemused smile at practice this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he loped onto the field into a seven-on-seven passing drill and lofted a 
long, high toss down the sideline. His receiver was blanketed by a Highlander 
defensive back. No way would it be a completion. But MacLean's pass dropped 
perfectly into his receiver's arms, inches beyond the defender's fingertips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Damn!" the defender yelled. "How'd that get through?" 
</P>
<P>
 His wasn't the only head turned by MacLean's progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember back in summer passing leagues we were having trouble getting him 
to throw a spiral," Granada Hills Coach Tom Harp said. "He may not have the 
greatest technique int he world, but we just let him use his natural ability. 
Now he's putting the ball on the money." 
</P>
<P>
 MacLean has passed for 1,330 yards and 14 touchdowns, both area bests, and he 
ranks sixth in the state in passing yardage. Tonight at 7, he leads Granada 
Hills (4-2, 3-0) at Taft (5-1, 3-0) in a first-place showdown in the Northwest 
Valley Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering its 3-7 record last season, Granada Hills' success is a mild 
surprise. Ditto MacLean's breakthrough -- though it is not totally unexpected. 
Last season, he filled in when Landress suffered a concussion, passing for 259 
yards and a touchdown in a start against El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was never any doubt that Landress was the man. Luckily for MacLean, 
Landress is a promising professional baseball prospect who decided this summer 
to focus exclusively that sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Harp immediately named MacLean the starter. The former starter had a friendly 
word of advice. "I told him, 'This is your chance -- have fun,' " Landress 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity was a long time in coming. Landress and MacLean became friends 
when they attended Notre Dame as ninth graders. They shared rides to school but 
did not share time under center -- MacLean was the second-stringer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nothing back then," he said. And there was no role reversal after they 
both transferred to Granada Hills before their sophomore years. MacLean 
remained the understudy. 
</P>
<P>
 Then suddenly, last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of happy (that Landress quit)," MacLean said. "I wanted to play 
quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates and coaches believed he had potential -- "We didn't go, 'Oh, 
no!' " wide receiver Jason Ascencio said. "We knew that Brian was going to come 
through" -- and MacLean has justified that belief. 
</P>
<P>
 After starting slowly, Granada Hills has won its last three games, beginning 
with a 7-6 upset of Kennedy sparked by a MacLean touchdown pass. MacLean and 
his teammates eagerly await highly regarded Taft. "This is our Super Bowl," 
MacLean said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyperbole, perhaps, but the game and the sport loom large in MacLean's life. 
He says his two loves are football and his lowered, white Chevy truck. He works 
at a gas station on weekends and pours the money -- and his time -- into his 
car. "My God," teammate Eric Carpenter groaned. "If that truck had emotions, I 
think he'd propose to it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Carpenter doesn't complain because MacLean gives him rides and throws him 
plenty of passes. Carpenter is second in the area with 40 receptions and leads 
the area with 607 receiving yards and seven touchdowns (tied with Westlake 
All-American Billy Miller).  
</P>
<P>
 MacLean's tosses also find Ascencio, who has 21 catches for 365 yards and four 
scores, and Afri Walker, with 17 catches and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some parents call us the MAAC Attack," Carpenter said. "For MacLean, 
Ascencio, Afri and Carpenter." 
</P>
<P>
 To the winners go the nicknames. 
</P>
<P>
 But whither MacLean? He would like to play in college, but the market for 
6-foot-1, 180-pound college quarterbacks is not large. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got some growing to do," he said grinning, adding that he has not been 
contacted by any college recruiters.  
</P>
<P>
 But for now, he is content. After all, a year ago, he was a reserve tight end. 
Today he is the area's leading passer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never suspected anything like this."

ICE AGE COMES TO VENTURA COUNTY; MARINERS OPEN HOME HOCKEY SEASON AGAINST 
JUNIOR DUCKS TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Setting sail upon a frozen sea, the Ventura Mariners hockey team opens its 
home season tonight at the Easy Street Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The team of teen-aged players, classified as "Junior B" and comparable to high 
school teams in U.S. hockey hotbeds in the Northeast and Upper Midwest, squares 
off against the Anaheim Junior Ducks at 9 p.m. in the Mariners' first home 
contest of a 30-game season that runs until the end of February. The teams play 
again Saturday at 7 p.m. and Sunday at 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura, 3-0 after a season-opening three-game sweep of the Arizona Bandits 
earlier this month, is a member of the six-team Western States Hockey League, a 
developmental circuit that allows top-notch 16-19-year-old players to skate 
against a higher level of competition without having to move east. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned and coached by Sean McGillivray, the Mariners are one of 29 Junior B 
teams in the United States and have players from Northridge, Thousand Oaks, 
Simi Valley and even Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 McGillivray has sunk more than $100,000 of his own money into the Mariners 
with about half earmarked for ice time. He also owns the Easy Street Arena and 
its twin ice surfaces, and has supervised a furious rush to get the building 
open in time for tonight's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Easy Street rinks, both the Mariners and the WSHL are new creations. 
The Mariners came into being in June, when McGillivray heard of WSHL President 
and Anaheim team owner Don Thorne's efforts to form a league. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-team circuit includes Anaheim, Salt Lake City, Las Vegas, San Jose and 
Phoenix. Each team, McGillivray said, is backed and financed by individuals 
willing to gamble, at least in part, on the entertainment value of teen-age 
hockey players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gonna work like heck to break even," said McGillivray, who is hoping for 
crowds of about 400 fans at $3-$5 a ticket to the team's 15 home games. 
</P>
<P>
 "But even if I don't, I think it's a tremendous investment in the future. It's 
badly needed in terms of players having a place to play. Before, there was no 
place for a skilled (16-19-year-old) player to go except back East or Canada." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to say the Mariners won't be visiting those places this season. In 
addition to its 30-game regular season, the team will travel to upstate New 
York in December for the Rochester Americans tournament, which will draw nearly 
40 college scouts, McGillivray said. The team also likely will play in 
tournaments in Vancouver and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Throw in the fact that the Mariners often practice five times a week and that 
some also hold part-time jobs, and dedication becomes a must for surviving on 
and off the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are very serious about hockey; it's a big part of their lives," 
said McGillivray, who often presides over 6 a.m. practices on the weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have to push them to practice or deal with excuses, and they want to 
go to tournaments and do off-ice training. It's a big commitment and the road 
trips can be brutal, but they want to go to college and play hockey." 
</P>
<P>
 And their parents back them up. Monique Weiss, mother of 17-year-old forward 
David Weiss, said hockey's high cost in money and time is worth it if her son 
is happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to me that he be busy and this is the one thing he wants to 
do," she said. "I want him to be able to do it because he's a good kid and he 
does well in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Mariners will rack up some impressive travel mileage by bus and 
plane, the players can at least continue to live and attend school in Southern 
California. Fourteen Mariners are still in high school, while the five other 
team members attend Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 Three team members moved from Saskatoon to attend school and play for the 
Mariners. McGillivray said the Canadians are a welcome addition to his team, 
although they are not its stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not one dominant player; our scoring comes from all three lines," 
McGillivray said. "We have a fast-skating team that has good puck skills. I 
think we can play with any junior team in the country . . . if we keep the game 
wide-open." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no slowing McGillivray's hopes for the future. He sees a day when the 
fledgling WSHL blossoms and moves up a notch to become an established Junior A 
league scouted by college coaches. Many of the Mariners have their sights set 
on playing in college as early as next season. 
</P>
<P>
 "(NCAA hockey) is probably the ultimate goal for a majority of the guys on our 
team," said Sean McGillivray Jr., who like many of his teammates has seen only 
a handful of Division I college games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always heard of guys like Brian Leech (New York Rangers) and Paul 
Kariya (Mighty Ducks) who made the NHL and also got their degrees. It's great 
hockey in a scholastic atmosphere and it would be nice to go where everybody 
recognizes the sport and you can get financial aid for playing."

CSUN ATHLETES TRY TO COPE IN WAKE OF NEGATIVE VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING and MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Swanson couldn't stand the tension, so he took a walk outside the Cal 
State Northridge athletics office as he waited out the results of a crucial 
election tally Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Swanson, an assistant athletic director, choreographed the campaign that 
sought a $49 increase in fees charged to students each semester to underwrite 
Matador athletics. A student-athlete recognized that Swanson, pacing the 
sidewalk, was on pins and needles and tried to break the anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 She stuck her head out the window and said: "Swanson, it's a boy." 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been the last laugh in that neighborhood for a long time. The 
Northridge student body this week voted down the plan by a margin of 2,315 to 
2,116. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the second athletic referendum defeat of 1994. Sure, the skies were 
crystal clear Thursday, but athletes and coaches could sense that budgetary 
thunderclouds are forming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an opportunity to bring this university to a level of national 
prominence," said Peter Micelli, a member of the men's basketball team. "Now we 
might have to take steps in the opposite direction. That's sad. It's just sad." 
</P>
<P>
 More tears could be forthcoming, and soon. 
</P>
<P>
 With the athletic department facing a possible $700,000 in cuts next year from 
a budget that stands at $3.6 million in 1994-95, difficult decisions loom. 
Namely, if no additional sources of funding are identified, selected men's 
teams could be axed. After five years at the NCAA Division I level, a move to 
Division II also remains a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the elimination of programs is our only option, then that's the option 
we'll have to take," said Ron Kopita, the dean of students. 
</P>
<P>
 How bad is it? Kopita said athletics is "struggling this year to make ends 
meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Football has been mentioned as a sport facing the budgetary chopping block, 
which didn't go over big at practice Thursday -- especially during homecoming 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Football Coach Bob Burt spoke with the team before practice in an attempt at 
damage control. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're disappointed, concerned and rightfully so," Burt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Football players were predictably downcast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that gets me most isn't that we're not being funded the way we 
should, it's that the vote shows there's no school spirit," said Dan 
Lazarovits, a freshman defensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morale's low, especially from where I'm standing. I finally get to college 
and it's not exactly what I thought it would be." 
</P>
<P>
 Kopita met with Burt on Thursday and told the coach not to assume anything was 
a done deal. Kopita has a "brainstorming" session scheduled today with 
athletics administrators. The group will explore potential funding sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to give them some time to lick their wounds and regroup," Kopita 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopita, echoing the sentiment of many in the athletics department, believes 
the election outcome was dictated by the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the 'no' vote was a pocketbook vote as opposed to a vote 
specifically against athletics," Kopita said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some athletes sensed the vote would be close. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to think it was going to pass, but I knew a lot of students couldn't 
support it," said Shannon Jones, a former all-conference softball player and a 
member of the women's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "To people who are working 40 hours a week, paying rent and working their way 
through college, $49, that's a lot of money. That's the thing, to a lot of 
students it was just too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Turnout for the election set a school record and reinforced the verdict from a 
similar referendum last spring, which was defeated, 993-906. In both elections, 
those voting against the proposal made up 52% of the tally. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Crouse, a junior on the women's basketball team, considered the 
outcome a reflection of the apathy and selfishness of her fellow students. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people look at their own area, their own programs, and stick to 
that," Crouse said. "People didn't want to do it unless it directly affects 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't the only athlete standing in that corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's embarrassing," said Keven Kempton, a senior on the baseball team. 
"People here wear around a $59 UCLA sweatshirt and then they don't support us. 
Can you believe it? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't play ball just for myself, I play for the school." 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes carried the promotional burden of the campaign, making the defeat 
doubly bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did everything we could," Micelli said. "We passed out literature for two 
weeks. We set up an information booth. We had people canvassing the whole area. 
We had phones out for people to vote. We talked to every club on campus. We 
talked to classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no stone left unturned." 
</P>
<P>
 If the school reverts to Division II, athletes will face some difficult 
decisions as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I decided to come here, (the school's divisional status) wasn't a 
concern," said Carlos Velazco, a freshman on the baseball team. "I wanted to 
come to a Division I school with a good program, a tradition. Now. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 This week's election was conducted by touch-tone telephone. Students last week 
were mailed personal identification numbers to use when logging their vote, 
though many students complained that PIN codes didn't arrive in time for the 
two-day election, which began Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge baseball Coach Bill Kernen polled his players Monday and said 17 of 
26 hadn't received their PIN code in the mail. Students were told this week 
that codes also could be picked up in person at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is John Q. Student going to make that extra effort? I don't know," Kernen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Students Senate considered invalidating the results because of 
the PIN code snafu. At the weekly Senate meeting on Tuesday, the first day of 
the two-day election, student senator Vladimir Cerna unsuccessfully sought to 
have the vote scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 If Cerna pursues the issue at next week's meeting, he could get the 
straight-arm. Two senators said Thursday that they doubt the Associated 
Students would be willing to fund another election in light of the record 
turnout, which easily eclipsed the former record of 2,800 votes. Cerna could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really see any basis for it," said Bruce Najbergier, a senator who 
supported the referendum. "The students have spoken."

MOORPARK IN NEED OF CALCULATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Who goofed? We've got to know. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this week, Moorpark College led state junior college football teams in 
total defense, allowing only 152.5 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 But it turns out those numbers didn't exactly add up. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark coaches say there have been discrepancies between the statistics they 
have reported to Don Adams, Western State Conference sports information 
officer, and what has appeared in the weekly statistical releases. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams reports conference statistics to the state junior college athletic 
bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has incorrectly added some totals," said Will Thurston, Moorpark offensive 
coordinator who reports statistics to Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams told this story. 
</P>
<P>
 "They give me game stats and call right at deadline (2 p.m. Sunday)," Adams 
said. "Each school is supposed to give me season totals. Whatever (Thurston) 
gives me, I have to total real fast to send to the state office." 
</P>
<P>
 At Moorpark, Thurston said, coaches designate a reserve players on offense and 
defense to keep statistics on the sidelines. Game films are reviewed only when 
inaccuracies are suspected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a statistician that sits in the stands," defensive coordinator 
Gil Mendoza said. "I try to make it someone who will do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, it doesn't seem to work out quite smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for instance, Moorpark's 23-20 upset of Bakersfield on Oct. 8. According 
to the team, Moorpark allowed 112 yards rushing, 187 yards passing and 299 
total yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield, however, claimed 188 yards rushing, 202 yards passing and 390 
total. The Times -- does this sound like a boxing score card? -- had it 201, 
200 and 401. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders could use a little creative bookkeeping now. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark (3-2) allowed 515 yards in a 28-14 loss to Valley last Saturday, 
falling to fourth in the state at 235.0 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems like a lot of folks on defense goofed on that one.

SAUGUS IS A PAIN FOR BURBANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Injuries have been such a problem for the Saugus High football team that 17 
players have been forced out of action. The casualties include five knees, four 
ankles and four ribs and an assortment of other ills. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing eases pain quicker than a victory and Saugus took a step toward a 
healthy future by defeating Burbank, 21-6, Thursday night in a Foothill League 
game at Canyon High. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Mushinski scored two first-half touchdowns for Saugus (4-2-1, 2-0 in 
league play). 
</P>
<P>
 The junior running back scored on a five-yard run late in the first quarter 
and added a one-yard run to give the Centurions a 14-6 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Mushinski finished with 95 yards in 19 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got quite a few guys that are out," Saugus Coach Jack Bowman said. "But 
we're getting healthier and I know we'll be better next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman had concerns about stopping Burbank running back Carlos Baker. His 
concerns were warranted, as Baker rushed for 138 yards and one touchdown in 21 
carries for the Bulldogs (3-4, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 "Baker is the best back we have faced so far," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker scored Burbank's touchdown on a four-yard run in the second quarter, 
capping a 52-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus was able to put away Burbank when it drove 62 yards in 13 plays. Phil 
Waterman scored on a two-yard run early in the fourth quarter. Burbank tried to 
rally but saw its last drive stall at the Centurion 25-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss, Burbank Coach John Hazelton had an upbeat attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to feel good about a loss, but I'm proud at how my kids played," 
Hazelton said. "If a couple of plays were run differently, we could have been 
in it. And that wasn't the case last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus gained 241 yards, with 216 coming on the ground. Burbank finished with 
160 net yards. Baker accounted for 161 yards rushing and receiving.

ANGELS TRY TO GIVE FANS SOMETHING OF INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, troubled by declining season-ticket sales and thwarted by the 
inability to make off-season moves because of the baseball strike, recognized 
their perilous situation. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks they pondered how to persuade the public to buy season tickets. They 
had the same miserable team and no way to assure there would even be a 1995 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans are the cornerstone of any franchise," club President Richard Brown 
said. "We kept racking our brains for an incentive to bring the fans back." 
</P>
<P>
 The brainstorm hit Brown at 3 one morning, waking him from a sound sleep. The 
idea would guarantee fans a 1995 baseball season, or at the least, pay them for 
their trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 The slogan: "We guarantee the '95 season, and you can bank on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it may be impossible for the Angels to promise that their scheduled 
season opener against the Milwaukee Brewers will be played April 4 at Anaheim 
Stadium, they can at least guarantee earnings to their season-ticket holders if 
the season is delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have pledged to pay 5% interest on season-ticket advances paid by 
Jan. 13, 1995, if the season is delayed. And considering that the going rate is 
about 3.5% on savings accounts, fans can actually profit if the strike 
continues. Fans will not only be repaid the cost of their original tickets, but 
a 5% surcharge for each game canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who owned season tickets in 1994 have the option to apply the refund due 
them for this season's canceled games toward the purchase of 1995 season 
tickets. They will receive 5% interest on their money dating to Aug. 23, the 
scheduled date of the first canceled home game, until Jan. 13. They, too, would 
then be eligible to receive 5% for games canceled during the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that the Angels finished the 1994 season with the American 
League's worst record, and second-worst in baseball, who could blame fans for 
rooting for the strike to continue? 
</P>
<P>
 "God, I hope not," said Kevin Uhlich, Angel vice president of operations. 
"Certainly, that's not our intention." 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the program is not much of a risk for the Angels. They are paying 
5% interest only for five months on the advance money from 1994 season-ticket 
accounts, which is about $3.80 an average season ticket. The interest simply 
will be deducted from the total 1995 ticket price. 
</P>
<P>
 And for those new season-ticket holders, the Angels won't have to pay a penny 
if the season starts on time, even if it means playing with replacement 
players. In fact, even if the entire season were canceled, the Angels would be 
responsible for only $18.23 in interest to each season-ticket holder. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the Angels have generated spirited response. They claim that only 60% of 
their 1994 season-ticket holders are seeking refunds, and the rest have told 
the club to keep their money for the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been quite a success in its early stages," Brown said. "The money we're 
paying is better than they'll get in their bank account. It's a no-lose 
situation for the fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Uhlich: "The (San Francisco) Giants and Philadelphia (Phillies) are also 
crediting season tickets with interest, but we're the first club to guarantee a 
season to our customers. We believe there will be a season, anyway, but if for 
some reason there isn't, the fans will make a lot of money in interest." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' season-ticket base of 12,395 last year was the lowest since 1979, 
and it has declined for four consecutive years since selling a franchise-record 
18,747 in 1990. Even if there had been no strike, the Angels were projecting 
ticket sales of only 1.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The club lost $8 million in 1994, according to owner Jackie Autry, and $24 
million during the last six years. Autry has become so disenchanted that she 
has the club up for sale.  
</P>
<P>
 "You run into bad economics and bad teams, and either one can kill you," Brown 
said. "Well, we had both, and that equals murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know what is most attractive to any fan is a winning team and, 
obviously, we haven't had that for several years." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels finished with a 47-68 record in 1994 and have had only one winning 
team since their last division championship team in 1986. They had hoped to 
generate interest early in the off-season by signing designated hitter Chili 
Davis to a multiyear contract, trading for a bona fide bullpen stopper, finding 
a power-hitting first baseman and maybe even acquire a top-notched starter. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike wiped out everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of plans that are put on hold," Brown said. "So meanwhile, 
we're going to become more pro-active in ticket sales. It used to be that we'd 
sell season tickets only when someone came to our office or called. 
</P>
<P>
 "Needless to say, that's going to change." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the Angels will hire a director of ticket sales. They will assemble 
a booster club to assist in ticket sales, offering trips with the team as 
incentives. And they will launch a telemarketing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing things that will bring us into the 20th Century, and the 21st 
Century," Brown said. "We're finally going to be in line with the other 
baseball clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the benefits from the strike -- although I hope never to go through 
another one of these -- is that it gave us the opportunity to address the needs 
and weaknesses of this organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to see us go out into the community and sell the California 
Angels like it has never been done before." Angel Season-Ticket Sales

COMMENTARY; HERE'S HOPING PAT RILEY STAYS PUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since Pat Riley came to the New York Knicks, there has been no better coach or 
manager in professional sports, even if he came up one game short last season. 
Everything began to change for the Knicks, and at Madison Square Garden, when 
Riley took the job as Knick coach. Dave Checketts, president of the Knicks and 
also interim president of the Garden now, is the one who finally got Riley to 
say yes in the spring of 1991. Now Checketts very much wants to sign Riley to a 
new contract, for more money than anyone with a job like Riley's has ever 
thought about. 
</P>
<P>
 Except that the new contract, which has been on the table for a while, never 
seems to get signed by Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley has one season left after this one on the contract he signed in 1991. 
Checketts wouldn't come close to talking about money this week and neither 
would Riley. I believe the new offer has to be worth twice what Riley is making 
now. That would mean $3 million per season. But the longer that money stays on 
the table at the Garden, the more you must at least wonder if Riley believes 
his coaching future is somewhere other than New York. You wonder if he might 
take one more shot at the title with this group of players and then look to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Riley will sign this week. But if he does not have a new deal by the end 
of this season, I'm not convinced there will be a next season for him with the 
Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of the preseason talk has been about other contracts. The Knicks have 14 
guaranteed contracts, and only 12 roster spots. Charles Oakley is working on a 
new contract of his own, looking for some $10-million balloon payment down the 
road. There is not so much talk about Riley's contract, even though he 
sometimes feels like the biggest star of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been going on for over a year, actually," Riley said. "It's been over a 
year, with three different owners (Paramount Communications, Viacom, now ITT / 
Cablevision). I believe that's where the problem is. But I really don't believe 
it's an issue right now. I tell the players who are in negotiations all the 
time, there's a business side of things, and a basketball side, and you should 
never mix the two. And that the business side should always be conducted 
quietly." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley paused and said, "But there always comes a time on the business side 
where you reach an impasse. It hasn't come to that point with me yet. If it 
does, then I'll have to make a decision. Right now, you've got one set of 
owners (Viacom) wanting to close a sale and another set of owners (ITT / 
Cablevision) looking to close a purchase. It's a difficult setting in which to 
get anything done." 
</P>
<P>
 I said, "But the new guys have made you a big offer." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just the contract," Riley said. "It's other things." 
</P>
<P>
 "What other things?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't want to get into the details," he said. "The business side 
will take care of itself. While it does, I'm only interested in coaching my 
team. People have to remind me every so often to find out how the negotiations 
are going." Riley laughed. "My wife is one of those people. My feeling is that 
this will all get sorted out, one way or the other. I'm in no hurry, even 
though I'll eventually reach the point where I'll have to make a decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Riley paused again. "I'll have to look at everything, decide if it's good for 
me or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Checketts: "All I'm going to say about this is that I think Pat Riley is 
a great coach. So do my bosses. We will do everything in our power to keep him 
here for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not Neil Smith of the New York Rangers vs. Mike Keenan. There is no 
animosity between Riley and Checketts, Riley and Ernie Grunfeld, the Knick vice 
president and general manager. There is no intrigue. ITT / Cablevision has 
authorized Checketts to pay Riley a ton of money. Riley just seems to be in no 
hurry to pick up the money. If there is no impasse, it sounds as if the 
possibility for one sure exists. 
</P>
<P>
 When Riley talks about "other things," he has to be talking about more power. 
Maybe if he can't get that kind of CEO power with the Knicks, he will ask to go 
elsewhere when this season is over. Maybe without the accusations and lies -- 
and without a championship -- maybe he will go off to be king the way Mike 
Keenan did in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said, "All this has nothing to do with what we're trying to accomplish 
with this team this season. The players know I won't let anything get in the 
way of our goal to win a championship. All that matters are the next nine 
months. We have to make a nine-month commitment to each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, whether Riley stays or goes, it will be interesting to see 
if he can have the Knicks playing in nine months for the championship. He has 
been a fascinating character since he arrived in New York, at times the biggest 
sports star in New York, not just with the Knicks. No one has celebrated 
Riley's work more than I have. I hope he stays at the Garden until the end of 
the century.

SAN MARCOS BEATS CLOCK, BUENA; WATER POLO: BULLDOG DEFENSE LETS DOWN AT CRUCIAL 
TIMES IN 8-6 CHANNEL LEAGUE SETBACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although Buena High's water polo team was outscored by four goals in the first 
quarter of its 8-6 Channel League defeat to top-ranked San Marcos on Thursday 
at Buena, it was not in the first seven minutes of the match that the Bulldogs 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in the last five seconds of too many San Marcos possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a good job defending them until the last five seconds of the 
(35-second) shot clock," Buena Coach John Siman said. "Then, at what I call 
crunch time, they picked it up and we didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 A perfect example of what Siman is talking about came with 2 minutes 24 
seconds to play in the match, just after Buena had rallied from a 4-0 
first-quarter deficit to pull to within 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
 As the shot clock wound down to three seconds on a San Marcos possession, 
Buena players, thinking they had forced a turnover, took off to set up their 
offense at the other end of the pool. But San Marcos hole-man Jeff Kircos 
grabbed the ball and flipped it into the net just before the shot clock 
expired. Kircos, an All-American, scored six goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lowered our level (of intensity) and they lifted theirs up," said Buena's 
Jeff Malas, who scored four goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of San Marcos' goals, particularly the first four, came on Buena 
defensive letdowns as the shot clock wound down. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first quarter we were playing really good defense except at crunch 
time," Siman said. "And in the second, third and fourth quarters, we played 
really solid . . . except at crunch time." 
</P>
<P>
 Buena gave up only single goals in the second and third quarters, both by 
Kircos. Buena pulled to within 6-3 on a breakaway goal by Malas with 5:53 to 
play in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 After another goal by Kircos, Buena's Aneel Chima scored a 6-on-5 goal to make 
the score 7-4. But Kircos' fifth goal, the buzzer-beater, ended Buena's hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena made the score more respectable with Malas' goal at the 1:41 mark and 
one by Ty Tatsch with three seconds to play. Buena's Curtis Tolmie had 15 
saves. 
</P>
<P>
 San Marcos (15-6, 6-0), which is ranked No. 1 in Division IV of the Southern 
Section, remained alone atop the Channel League. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Bulldogs (10-11, 3-3) are ranked sixth in Division IV, they need 
to finish in the top three in the Channel League to make the playoffs. Buena is 
third, one game ahead of Dos Pueblos. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Buena's ranking, a fourth-place finish would rule out an at-large 
playoff berth because the Bulldogs would have an overall losing record, Siman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs could have made things easier for themselves had they not lost to 
second-place Santa Barbara, ranked No. 2 in Division IV, and San Marcos this 
week.

TENNIS / DANA HADDAD; XANTHOS CONTINUES TO HOLD COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So Paul Xanthos has retired. Do you think he's slowed down? 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't had the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Xanthos, who in 1993 retired as the Pierce College men's tennis coach after 
leading the Brahmas to 23 conference championships in 29 seasons, has continued 
to coach part time when he is not running around the country accepting awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Xanthos, 73, was given outstanding service awards by organizers of the Ojai 
Valley Tennis Tournament in April and the board of trustees of the Los Angeles 
Community College District in June. In July, he was the first inductee into the 
American Hellenic Educational Program Assn. Sports Hall of Fame -- the largest 
Greek-American service organization in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But those were mere tokens of appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Xanthos was the first junior college coach to be inducted into the 
NCAA/Intercollegiate Coaches Assn. Hall of Fame. Two weeks ago he was named 
Coach of the Year by the United States Professional Tennis Assn. for the second 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start way down at the bottom of a pyramid, but when you reach the Hall of 
Fame you reach the top of the pyramid," Xanthos said. "A lot of coaches don't 
think a JC coach belongs." 
</P>
<P>
 But Xanthos is the exception, not merely because he had a 550-94 record at 
Pierce -- including conference winning steaks of 96, 50, 37 and 27 matches -- 
and won 25 championships in tennis, basketball and cross-country in 17 years at 
North Hollywood High. 
</P>
<P>
 Xanthos is considered a pioneer in teaching players and other coaches en 
masse. The United States Tennis Assn. considers him a pioneer of its many 
instructional techniques and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Woods, USTA director of player development, said Xanthos' ideas paved the 
way for its Schools Program and National Teachers Conference. Former Princeton 
women's Coach Eve Kraft remembers how Xanthos traveled from state to state 
introducing tennis at schools during the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was two decades before the USTA's School Program was developed," said 
Kraft, a Xanthos colleague on the USTA Education and Resources Committee. 
"People today do not realize that Paul's efforts helped lay the groundwork for 
the current program." 
</P>
<P>
 Kraft said Xanthos also introduced group teaching at a Midwest coaches' 
convention in 1969. Shown there were old film clips of Xanthos and a throng of 
North Hollywood physical education students practicing forehand, backhand and 
service strokes in unison. Thus the Midwesterners got their first glimpse of 
group lessons, which Xanthos had started nearly two decades earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the pros in the audience could not believe it was possible," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The world tennis community still seeks his expertise. Xanthos spent three 
weeks last fall conducting workshops in Greece and might do the same in Egypt 
in December. A corporation in Taiwan has asked Xanthos to serve as a consultant 
in starting its own governing body, much like the USTA. In a Japanese tennis 
magazine, a well-recognized Xanthos endorses Converse shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The week he retired from Pierce, Xanthos became director at the Burbank Tennis 
Center. With Xanthos aboard, the City of Burbank decided to redevelop 
McCambridge Park. It plans to add a championship court and modern clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 He continues to teach young players, sometimes free of charge. Recent students 
include Nick Tatsis and Sofia Managadze, prodigies from Greece and the former 
Soviet republic of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been coaching for over 45 years and I'm still attending clinics, taking 
notes, filming videos," Xanthos said. "If you're going to coach, you've got to 
give back." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Top Seed grows: Top Seed Tennis Academy, which transformed the 
once-floundering, now burgeoning Calabasas Park Tennis Club in one year, now 
hopes to do the same at North Ranch Tennis Club in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Dexter MacBride, formerly adult development pro at Calabasas, took over as 
head pro at North Ranch earlier this month. Director and manager Steve McAvoy 
and head pro Desi McBride will continue to run Calabasas, which has a 
successful junior program that attracted over 300 players to its summer camps 
and has a core group of 90. 
</P>
<P>
 MacBride said North Ranch has no junior tennis program but he expects Top Seed 
to eventually compete at a high level at this new facility. "There is enough 
people and enough interest in the sport -- enough for everybody," said 
MacBride, 29, a five-year teaching pro and former nationally ranked junior 
player in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 McClain to stay: Tennis Director Bill McClain has tentatively decided to 
remain at what is now the L.A. Fitness Warner Center Club. 
</P>
<P>
 McClain, who coaches Junior U.S. Open champion Meilen Tu of Northridge, was 
planning to leave the club in December because he was dissatisfied with the 
ownership. But L.A. Fitness, which bought the slumping club in September, asked 
McClain to assist in a rebuilding effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I'd be out of here -- I was frustrated, tired, fed up," said 
McClain, 56. "But I've got a lot of kids I would hate to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 The new ownership has vowed to rebuild the clubhouse while assisting McClain 
in increasing tennis instruction and building a junior program.

SIDELINES; NOTRE DAME'S SCHWARY KNOWS HOW TO PLAY POLITICAL FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Neil Schwary graduates from Notre Dame High in June, a political reign 
that would make Franklin Delano Roosevelt envious will come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwary, starting left cornerback on the football team, has served as class 
president seven of the past eight years. Last year marked the first time since 
fifth grade he failed to win an election. Even then, he was appointed vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't realize it, but the campaign trail is really hard," Schwary 
said. "I spend a lot of time reaching out to younger students." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwary's years in office have been free of scandal (homecoming week always 
runs smoothly); his campaign tactics are void of personal attacks (he 
distributes pencils bearing his name); and his administration has no foreign 
policy (he has never met with leaders of rival Crespi). 
</P>
<P>
 Seriously, chairing an 18-member student council takes a lot of time. And soon 
after Schwary, senior class president, drops his gavel, he straps on a helmet 
as a member of a defense that has allowed an average of only 9.3 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 As for a political career, Schwary, a self-described moderate with 
conservative tendencies, wants to make one thing perfectly clear: he is 
uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know yet," he said. "In politics, there are a lot of people who 
support what you do, and then there are people who don't like what you do. You 
can't please everybody." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Musical players: Newbury Park High's football team has taken specialization to 
a new position: quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Czernek, a sophomore, and Justin Vint, a junior, are likely to rotate at 
quarterback the rest of the season. The game situation will determine who 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Vint is bigger, has a stronger arm and is a better runner. Czernek is better 
at the short, ball-control passing game. Against Westlake last week, the 
players switched frequently -- occasionally in the middle of a series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes you put in a fast tailback when you want to go outside or a big 
tailback when you want to go over the middle," Coach George Hurley said. "We 
are doing the same thing with quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good hands people: He wears a Valley College jersey and can catch a football 
with the best of them, but Casey Fenwick hasn't played a down even though the 
team is coached by his father, Jim. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: Casey is 11 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 As ballboy for the Monarchs, he positions himself behind the goal posts after 
extra-point and field-goal attempts, fielding them like a veteran return man. 
Unfortunately, Dad often is too busy to notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people saw him and pointed it out to me," Coach Fenwick said. No 
surprise there. Fenwick has another son, Tyler, who is a receiver on the 
Chaminade High team. Stats  
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge receiver Duc Ngo, who learned shortly before fall 
practice that he had another season of eligibility remaining, is making the 
most of his "second" senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ngo has 100 receptions in his career, moving him to within six of the school 
record set by Dick Billingsley in 1966-67. Billingsley is football coach at Oak 
Park High. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Productive players: Running back Terrence Thomas and receivers Billy Parra and 
Tom Herman have accounted for 81% -- 1,228 of 1,508 -- of the yardage gained by 
Cal Lutheran. Thomas has 639 yards rushing and receiving. Parra and Herman have 
gained 441 and 148 yards receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Black is blue: An inexperienced offensive line and recurring problems with a 
twisted ankle have put the brakes on Michael Black. The West L.A. College 
running back and former Kilpatrick standout has only 358 yards rushing in six 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 In Black's best game, he gained 87 yards in a 19-10 loss to Glendale last 
week. He has only two touchdowns, both against Pierce in a 36-20 loss two weeks 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Black injured his ankle in a game against Moorpark on Sept. 24 and hasn't been 
able to regain the form he displayed last season when he rushed for 1,336 yards 
in 189 carries and scored 10 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Block party: In the five games she has been a starter for the Northridge 
women's volleyball team, freshman Rene Goth has 26 blocks -- second to Heather 
Anderson (28 blocks) during that span. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About face(s): The Cleveland High football team, 1-9 last season and winless 
in Northwest Valley Conference play, is 4-2, including a 3-0 conference mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Johnny Lopez, who last season didn't throw a touchdown pass and 
had seven interceptions, has eight touchdowns and only two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 End of futility: The Santa Paula High football team had not scored a rushing 
touchdown this season -- spanning 21 quarters -- until Jeremy Johnson scored on 
a 13-yard run in the second quarter last week against Calabasas. Johnson has 
scored all five of the team's touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Big-play man: Every time Saugus High senior linebacker/tight end Matt Gillis 
gets near the ball, he seems to make a big play. In six games, Gillis has 39 
tackles, eight sacks, four fumble recoveries, one fumble caused, one 
interception and one blocked punt. He has caught only three passes, but they 
have produced two touchdowns and a two-point conversion. Things to Do

EMPIRE LEAGUE FOOTBALL; VEGA'S FINAL KEY PLAY HELPS CENTURY BEAT EL DORADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ignacio Vega's interception in the closing seconds clinched a 6-3 victory for 
Century over El Dorado in an Empire League game Thursday at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega had several other important plays.He had a 72-yard run and a five-yard 
reception for first down on Century's scoring drive. He also had a sack from 
his defensive back position. 
</P>
<P>
 His interception came at the Century 11 with seven seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by quarterback Mike Marzicola and helped by a 15-yard penalty for a late 
hit, El Dorado had driven 62 yards in 27 seconds and had a first down at the 
Century 13 with 35 seconds left. Century's Robert Villegas and Luis Ramirez 
sacked Marzicola for an 11-yard loss on the next play. Marzicola, who to that 
point was four of four for 49 yards in the drive, had his next pass 
intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Had El Dorado been able to hang onto the ball earlier, there might not have 
been a chance for late-game heroics. The Golden Hawks fumbled on the Century 
four after opening the game with a 17-play drive that took almost 11 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Century (3-4, 1-1 in league) then drove 94 yards for a touchdown. On third and 
seven at the Century 17, Vega went in motion, took a handoff and ran 72 yards 
to the El Dorado 11. He got an important downfield block from Jose Serratos. 
</P>
<P>
 His five-yard reception on third down gave the Centurions a first down inside 
the El Dorado one. Quarterback Stan Villanueva scored on a one-yard dive.

LOARA TURNS SEVEN KATELLA TURNOVERS INTO 28-7 VICTORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Loara took advantage of seven turnovers to beat Katella, 28-7, in an Empire 
League game Thursday night at Western High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Loara (3-4, 1-1) forced five fumbles, intercepted two passes and converted two 
turnovers into touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saxons jumped ahead late in the first quarter after both teams struggled 
offensively. Running back Kerry Peoples scored on a three-yard run on Loara's 
third possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Katella (0-7, 0-2) fumbled on each of its next three possessions, the last 
resulting in a Loara score. Loara running back Korei Kilborn scored on an 
eight-yard run with 59 seconds left in the half to put the Saxons up, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights' Drew Kroger returned the ensuing kickoff 85 yards for Katella's 
only score, making the score 14-7 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Loara started slowly in the third quarter, but struck again on their third 
possession of the half. Quarterback Jim Kirkland hit Eddie Williams on a 
12-yard touchdown pass for a 21-7 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilborn scored his second touchdown of the game on a three-yard run with five 
minutes remaining to seal the 28-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkland completed eight of 20 passes for 92 yards and Kilborn ran for 40 
yards in 10 carries for Loara. JON CLIFFORD

TRI-VALLEY MUST REMAIN IN DIVISION IX PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal that would have dropped the Tri-Valley League from Division IX to 
Division X for this season's football playoffs was defeated by the Southern 
Section Council on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a realignment of playoff groupings in 1992, three Division VIII 
leagues (Los Padres, Frontier and Pioneer) were dropped to Division IX, and 
three former Division IX leagues (De Anza, Olympic and Santa Fe) were dropped 
to Division X. The Tri-Valley remained in Division IX, even though student 
enrollments for member schools more closely match those of Division X schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The average enrollment among Division IX teams is 602. In Division X, it's 
406. The average among Tri-Valley teams is 449. 
</P>
<P>
 Tri-Valley football members -- Bishop Diego, Carpinteria, Fillmore, Oak Park 
and St. Bonaventure -- complied with the realignment in 1992, but hoped the 
playoff groupings would change for the 1994-96 cycle. PAIGE A. LEECH

SECTION STANDS FIRM ON FOOTBALL PLAYOFF STRUCTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a flurry of protests, the Southern Section Council will not change any 
playoff pairings for the 1994 football season. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from Divisions IV, VI, IX, and X sought restructuring of their 
leagues before the playoffs begin next month. But at the meeting at the Sequoia 
Athletic Club Thursday, the appeals were rejected by the voting body. 
</P>
<P>
 That still did not answer the question of whether low enrollment schools can 
realistically compete with larger ones. At least not for those making the 
appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Chandler, principal at Agoura Oak Park and representing the Tri-Valley 
League, argued that the top five teams in the De Anza League average 934 
students in enrollment, while the top five teams in his league average 531 
students. "It doesn't make sense for the Tri-Valley schools to be in a higher 
(division)," Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Southern Section is historically leery of making such changes in 
mid-season. And, as Carpinteria Athletic Director Jim Bashore later said, "The 
bigger schools don't care. They've got enough kids that they can say, 'Bring on 
anybody, and don't bother us with your problems.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Plutko, principal at Temple City, will head a committee to look at 
designing regional playoff groupings, a plan the Southern Section would not 
implement next season. The committee will begin work next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Plutko, who attended Thursday's meeting, wants to believe he will take the 
ideas expressed and incorporate them into the committee's eventual report. But 
he is realistic about what faces his group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like when you drop a pebble in a pond," Plutko said. "The further out 
you go, the fewer the schools of equitable size. We have to find a way to keep 
equitable competition among them. That's the real challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they wouldn't have formed the committee if they didn't think there was 
any way to improve the system." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Section Commissioner Dean Crowley said the rule against fighting -- 
which was further refined before the season -- has been responsible for about 
11 ejections per week. "That's at all levels of football," Crowley said. "Maybe 
one or so is in water polo, but more than 90% have been football." The rule, 
invoked last year to restore a degree of sportsmanship, states that in the 
opinion of any official, if any flagrant foul is deemed to be a fight, the 
fighting penalty is evoked. This can include but is not exclusive to an attempt 
to strike an opponent with the arms, hands, legs or feet, or a combative action 
by one or more players. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley said officials weren't calling the penalty much last year but are this 
season since the rule was clarified. "Officials have better understanding (of 
the rule) and so do coaches," Crowley said. "Eleven sounds like a lot, but it 
isn't when you consider we have a lot of programs going."

PREP ROUNDUP; VILLA PARK CLINCHES CENTURY LEAGUE GIRLS' TENNIS TITLE

<P>
 Seventh-ranked Villa Park clinched its first Century League title since 1982, 
defeating ninth-ranked Canyon for the second time in a week. The Spartans, led 
by No. 1 singles player Faye DeVera's three victories, defeated Canyon, 12-6, 
Thursday after a 10-8 victory a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was convincing," Villa Park Coach Sue Gardiner said. "These kids have 
what it takes. They're not letting down against anyone and they're not letting 
anything slip away." 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park (12-1, 8-0 in league) leads Canyon (13-3, 5-3) by three games and 
second-place El Modena, which has been beaten twice by Villa Park, by two games 
with two matches left. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to DeVera's sweep, Villa Park got three victories from its No. 1 
and No. 2 doubles teams of Jill Riley and Shawn Lerer and Susan Shaw and Carrie 
Ota. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon received two of its six points from No. 1 singles player Shannon 
Wilkins. DAVE McKIBBEN

SOTO BRINGS SOME GLITTER TO CAL STATE FULLERTON SOCCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eddie Soto grew up wanting to play soccer for UCLA, not Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 With the movie star good looks of a Keanu Reeves or an Andy Garcia, Soto could 
have fit right in amid the glitter of Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Bel Air. 
</P>
<P>
 But when things didn't go as planned, Soto's world was turned upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA certainly had shown interest in him. He had been Southern Section 
Division 3-A player of the year at Cerritos High School. Soto and his close 
friend, Jorge Salcedo, had talked often about how they would be UCLA teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it came time for it to happen, Soto failed to qualify academically. 
Salcedo went to UCLA, and Soto was left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was devastated," Soto said. "Jorge and I had been playing soccer together 
since we were 5. I was so disappointed that I thought about giving up the game 
entirely." 
</P>
<P>
 With his soccer future uncertain, Soto enrolled at Chapman. He didn't play his 
first year there in 1990, but he heard all about how UCLA won the national 
championship, and about how in the NCAA final Salcedo had scored the winning 
goal on a penalty kick. "You can imagine how I felt that year," Soto said. "It 
was hard, knowing how you could have been there." 
</P>
<P>
 But Soto picked himself up, played one season at Chapman, then transferred to 
Cal State Fullerton with three years of eligibility remaining. Soto brought 
immediate life to the Titans, who were struggling for recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a lot of ways, Eddie put our program on the map," Coach Al Mistri said. 
"He was a player that the soccer community in our area knew well. He had been a 
phenomenal player in high school, and had played on a national championship 
under-19 team at Huntington Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri recruited Soto out of high school, but couldn't compete with what Soto 
saw as "the glamour" of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, I didn't think Fullerton's soccer program was what I wanted," 
Soto said. "And the way I looked at it, you could get a lot of recognition at 
UCLA because it was UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Fullerton program improved during Soto's two years at Chapman, and he 
eventually decided he could be the difference for the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any striker has to have a good supporting cast to be successful, and he had 
that," Mistri said. "But Eddie became the catalyst for us. . . . And what I 
told him would happen with the program, has happened." 
</P>
<P>
 As a sophomore, Soto had 12 goals in 39 shots, with eight assists, and was 
named second team All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't fare as well statistically as a junior with eight goals in 46 shots, 
but Soto helped the team turn the corner. Fullerton reached the NCAA final four 
by winning playoff games at Fresno State, San Diego and San Francisco. The 
Titans, however, lost to South Carolina, 1-0, in the semifinals. Soto was only 
an honorable mention All-American selection. Mistri recalls him missing four 
penalty kicks during that season. 
</P>
<P>
 The successful sophomore season and his solid junior year made Soto a marked 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult position to be in," Mistri said. "I have a lot of admiration 
for the way he puts himself on the line every time he goes out there. He's 
really been roughed up a lot this season, too. . . . The word has gotten around 
that the way to play him is to mark him hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents' rough play, however, hasn't caused Soto as much problem as illness 
has during his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came to camp in the best shape he's ever been in," Mistri said. "He was 
bubbly, ready to go. He got married this summer, and I think that helped settle 
him down. And he seemed a lot more focused. But he's run into some bad luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Soto has gone from one illness to another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had some problems with tendinitis at the end of last season, and I took an 
anti-inflammatory for that," he said. "But that created some small erosions in 
my stomach. I got over that, and then I had trouble with heat exhaustion for a 
period of time. I woke up in the middle of the night really sick and dizzy with 
a high fever. Then I had stomach flu for a while. Then, if you can believe it, 
last Friday I had a small case of food poisoning." 
</P>
<P>
 All this in the span of a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problems, Soto has shown flashes of brilliance. He had five goals 
in three consecutive games in mid-September, scoring twice against New 
Hampshire and Vermont. For the season, he has seven goals in 30 shots along 
with one assist. He leads the team in points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans have six regular season games remaining before the Mountain Pacific 
Soccer Federation playoffs. Fullerton plays at UCLA today. Soto's friend, 
Salcedo, has finished his UCLA career, but it still is a game Soto eagerly 
awaits. "I've never scored against them, and I'd like to be able to do that," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are no burning regrets now about not being at UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
 "Things always seem to happen for the best," he said. "I know now, though, 
that if I had put as much effort into my studies in high school as I have in 
college I could have gone anywhere I wanted. But then I was always putting 
soccer before school. And when I wasn't playing, I'd go surfing. I loved that, 
too, and it was great stress relief for me. I also was traveling a lot then 
because of soccer, and missed quite a bit of school. I was gone a month when I 
was trying to qualify for the Junior World Cup team." 
</P>
<P>
 But that, Soto says, is old news. He's hoping for a strong finish to his 
college career. And he wants to continue playing after that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been playing for a long time, and I'd like to finally be able to make 
some money at it," he said. "I'll keep my options open . . . the Salsa, the new 
outdoor league, overseas, the indoor league. Those are all possibilities. I 
have quite a few contacts overseas from soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, Soto is pleased he has been able to help elevate Fullerton's 
program, and is hopeful the progress will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Before practice earlier this week, he seemed content. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people always want to go to the big-time schools," he said. "But 
when you think about it, why not go to a school where you can make an imprint 
on something?"

REPORTS ON JOBS AND HOUSING FAN INFLATION FEARS; ECONOMY: SURPRISING FIGURES 
BOLSTER WORRIES THAT THE FED WILL RAISE RATES SOON. STOCKS AND BONDS PAY THE 
PRICE.

 Another round of bullish economic news, including a surprising 4.4% nationwide 
surge in September housing starts and an unexpected drop in new jobless claims, 
reignited inflation fears Thursday, sending stock and bond prices skidding. 
</P>
<P>
 A Commerce Department report showing new homes in September being built at 
their fastest pace of the year -- fueled by a 21% surge in the West -- prompted 
many analysts to speculate that the Federal Reserve Board will once again raise 
interest rates to cool the economy and keep inflation from soaring. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite five Fed-engineered boosts in interest rates since February, housing 
starts shot up to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.53 million units, the 
highest since last December, when it reached 1.61 million, the peak of the 
current economic expansion. And both the July and August gains were stronger 
than initially estimated. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the government reported that a post-earthquake surge of 3.9% in 
the personal incomes of Californians -- boosted by billions of dollars in 
federal aid and insurance payments in the aftermath of the January Northridge 
temblor -- fueled a 1.9% overall gain in the income of the average American in 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong economic news was blamed for the Dow Jones industrial average 
tumbling 24.89 points to close at 3911.15, wiping out a 25-point gain over the 
previous three days. The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, which 
rises when bond prices fall, climbed to 8% for the first time in more than two 
years before falling back slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest government reports on prices have suggested that rising inflation 
remains more a threat than a reality. But the economy has shown few signs of 
slowing down, and many economists say that at least one more boost in interest 
rates is now a foregone conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Fed will raise rates by a half-point or so after next month's 
election, and then push it up again around the end of the year," said Robert 
Davis, chief economist of the Savings and Community Bankers of America in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Labor Department reported that the number of Americans seeking 
unemployment benefits for the first time posted an unexpected decline of 3,000 
last week to a seasonally adjusted 326,000. Analysts had expected an increase 
of 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Philadelphia Fed said manufacturing activity surged during 
October in eastern Pennsylvania, Delaware and southern New Jersey. The number 
of manufacturers reporting higher prices for raw materials in the region also 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond investors are already demanding higher yields to protect themselves 
against a comeback in inflation, which would erode the value of their holdings. 
Thursday's 8% yield on the 30-year bond was up from 7.89% on Wednesday, and the 
highest since May, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economic data is now clearly indicating that the economy is not slowing 
down and that inflationary pressures are, if anything, intensifying," said 
Joseph McAlinden, chief market strategist at Dillon, Read & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 September's 4.4% gain in new-home construction nationwide was fueled by a 
sharp 21.4% increase in the West. Big increases in Arizona and Nevada offset 
continued weakness in California's construction industry, analysts said.

PHONE SYSTEMS GET PERMISSION TO COMPETE WITH CABLE; TELECOM: CABLE INDUSTRY, 
CONSUMER ORGANIZATIONS CRITICIZE FCC RULING, SAYING COST WILL BE BORNE BY 
EXISTING CUSTOMERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Brushing aside the protests of cable television operators and consumer groups, 
the Federal Communications Commission on Thursday gave local telephone 
companies the green light to build networks to compete with cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling lifts a cloud of uncertainty over so-called video dial-tone 
services by throwing out two dozen petitions challenging the FCC's 1992 
decision to allow phone companies to carry video programs on their network. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's decision was cheered by investors because it is expected to spur a 
multibillion-dollar upgrade of the nation's aging local phone system over the 
next decade. The improvements will benefit not only video programmers, but also 
computer users who require high-capacity phone lines to transmit data. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling was decried by the cable industry and consumer groups, who say 
phone companies will make their existing users shoulder the massive cost of 
developing the new video networks. They fear the companies will thus be able to 
compete unfairly against cable TV operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FCC has failed to establish rules for the road to protect consumers . . . 
while granting the telephone companies the authority to build," said Bradley 
Stillman, legislative counsel for the Washington-based Consumer Federation of 
America. "Using the most conservative numbers, we are talking about an 
additional $16 per month on the phone bill of every American household for the 
next 20 years" to pay for video dial tone, Stillman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Upgrading the telephone network for video is expected to cost between $100 
billion and $400 billion, analysts say. The overhaul will require phone 
companies to extend their deployment of costly fiber-optic cable and install 
new phone switches capable of handling video. 
</P>
<P>
 In principle, the phone companies will not be allowed to fold the cost of the 
video networks into their regular capital improvement programs, which would 
enable them to pass the costs along to telephone ratepayers. But as a practical 
matter, it will be difficult for the FCC's staff of 26 auditors to determine 
how much of the cost of a new network should be attributed to the 
video-carrying capability and how much to the more traditional function of 
handling phone calls. The FCC decided Thursday to evaluate such cost 
allocations on a case-by-case basis rather then impose definitive regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 For years -- concerned about federal and state regulatory constraints that 
keep them from directly entering the cable business -- phone companies had been 
reluctant to risk money modernizing their phone networks to deliver video 
signals. Instead, they sought rule changes that would allow them to profit from 
the creation and sale of programs rather than just transmitting video content 
as a common carrier for others. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC still prohibits phone companies from directly investing in cable firms 
in their own service area, or even contracting with a so-called anchor 
programmer that would supply the bulk of their video programming. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent months, as fiber-optic prices have fallen, phone companies have 
found the lure of video dial tone more compelling. The falling prices have made 
it more cost-effective to replace aging copper lines with the fiber-optic 
cables needed to take play in the $20-billion cable TV business. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, with business and telecommuters clamoring for more line capacity 
to transmit computer data, more phone companies now believe that offering 
broad-band common-carrier services could offer additional income. 
</P>
<P>
 "The race is on to offer these (broad-band) services," said Bill Deatherage, a 
telecommunications analyst for S.G. Warburg & Co. in New York. "I think (phone 
companies) will be very aggressive once they get" their individual video 
dial-tone applications approved. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC has already given Bell Atlantic limited permission to offer a 
commercial video dial-tone service, but 28 other applications have been delayed 
while the agency formulated final rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "From our perspective, the drive to upgrade the phone network does not come as 
much from the possibility of new (video) revenues than it is driven by the 
possibility of cost savings and providing . . . new kinds of telephony," said 
Steven Harris, a vice president at Pacific Bell. In the past, he said, "the 
regulatory process has been both a direct holdup and put a cloud over 
investment." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents vowed to press on with their fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an incredibly bad decision that flies in the face of all logic and 
the record before the FCC, and we will appeal it," said Decker Anstrom, 
president of the National Cable Television Assn., a Washington trade group.

IS THIS A FAIR TRADE?; MARKET MAKERS DRAW CRITICISM, LAWSUITS FOR IGNORING 
CUSTOMER ORDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One day in late June, options trader Steven I. Malitz was poised to buy 1,200 
shares of American Colloid stock at $13 a share -- a quarter of a point more 
than any of the Nasdaq-listed stock's market makers were offering to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Small investors certainly would have done better to sell to Malitz at his 
price. But they never got the chance. Instead, market makers ignored Malitz's 
order -- "traded through" it, in market parlance -- and continued to sell at 
$12.75, a price better for themselves and worse for their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 After three minutes, as a reporter watched, Malitz's order automatically 
expired -- unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 A cornerstone of the nation's securities laws is the "best execution" rule, 
meant to guarantee that brokerage customers get the best price available when 
they put in orders to buy or sell stock. 
</P>
<P>
 But much of the time on Nasdaq they don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get traded through all the time," says Malitz, a veteran floor trader at 
the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Throughout the day, by telephone from his 
trading post, Malitz buys and sells Nasdaq shares to limit the risks of his 
dealings in options on Nasdaq stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Securities Dealers, which owns and operates Nasdaq -- 
the nation's busiest stock market -- says the market could not operate without 
trading through. The NASD insists it carefully balances the interests of both 
market makers and its customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in one 15-minute span on the raucous floor of the Chicago options 
exchange that day, a reporter witnessed two other apparent instances of 
Malitz's better-priced offers being traded through by Nasdaq market makers. 
Longtime investors and securities professionals say that on any given day, 
thousands of better-priced orders never get executed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Chicago trader, Mark Shaprow, says he quit trading options on Nasdaq 
stocks out of frustration with getting traded through. Now he deals only in 
options on IBM, a stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange, where trading 
through is banned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're professionals and we see it happen," says Shaprow. "Then we think about 
the people who aren't professionals. They get cheated the same way, and they 
don't even know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Trading through is just one of the ways the vast Nasdaq trading system 
produces big profits for market makers at the expense of millions of investors, 
small retail customers and professionals alike. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice, long banned on most exchanges, helps maintain Nasdaq's wide 
"spreads," the gap between the price at which market makers offer to buy from 
sellers and the price at which they will sell to buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 By ignoring better-priced offers from the public that are "inside the spread" 
-- offers either to sell shares for less than the market maker is demanding or 
buy them for more -- the firms protect their own interests while slighting 
those of their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department said this week that its antitrust division has launched 
an investigation into allegations that market makers, rather than competing, 
work together to keep spreads wide and increase their profits. The NASD and 
many large market makers insist the allegations are baseless. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission, too, is beginning to apply strong 
pressure on Nasdaq to address some parts of the problem. But many believe that 
the proposed reforms, though they have provoked strong complaints from the 
market makers, fall short. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard G. Ketchum, the NASD's chief operating officer, says trading through 
is justifiable because of the nature of the over-the-counter market. 
</P>
<P>
 If it were banned, he says, some market makers who deal in Nasdaq stocks might 
lose money and decide to leave the business. The NASD says competition between 
market makers is at the core of Nasdaq's structure, leading to better prices 
for customers. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no signs that the profits of Nasdaq market makers are precarious. 
Indeed, with Nasdaq's steady growth, the number of firms making markets in its 
stocks has risen. There are now 510, up 21% from 1990. They include the big, 
well-known, Wall Street investment houses, such as Merrill Lynch, PaineWebber 
and Morgan Stanley, as well as lesser-known firms that do little besides make 
markets in Nasdaq stocks, such as Troster Singer Corp. and Herzog, Heine, 
Geduld Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD says it has no data on its member firms' profits from market making. 
But using the NASD's own figures -- average daily volume of 299 million shares 
multiplied by an average spread of 34.3 cents -- indicates that the market 
makers' revenue each day from spreads comes to $102.6 million, or more than $26 
billion a year. (They also make additional trading profits, or losses, on the 
stocks they hold in their own inventory.) 
</P>
<P>
 At the heart of trading through is something called a "limit order." On 
Nasdaq, as on the New York and other stock exchanges, customers can place limit 
orders to buy or sell stock at a specified price, as opposed to "market orders" 
to buy or sell at the current market price. 
</P>
<P>
 But the way limit orders are handled is dramatically different on the NYSE or 
American Stock Exchange than on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nasdaq, market makers may continue to trade at their quoted bid and asked 
prices while limit orders sit unfilled. Despite a recent rule change, small 
investors who put in limit orders are most affected: Their limit orders often 
have to wait until the market price happens to hit the price they specified. 
</P>
<P>
 This occurs in part because Nasdaq has set up no centralized mechanism for 
handling limit orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are there multiple market makers for each stock, but on Nasdaq, limit 
orders may go into one of many different computer trading systems without 
appearing on the others. Some of the systems are owned by the NASD, while 
others are operated by independent companies such as Reuters or Los 
Angeles-based Jefferies & Co. Still others are in-house systems for giant 
brokerage firms such as Merrill and PaineWebber that execute most of their 
customers' Nasdaq stock orders themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 So orders sitting in one computer system are likely never to be seen by market 
participants not using that system. And even those who use a particular system 
might not see an order; the typical trader at a market-making firm may be 
responsible for watching 40 or 50 stocks at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, unlike on the NYSE, there is no true "price discovery" on Nasdaq: 
The quoted market prices do not reflect the prices at which all market 
participants at any given moment are willing to buy or sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "My frank opinion after 37 years in this business is that I'd rather trade on 
the New York Stock Exchange, for one basic reason: You really do have 'price 
discovery,' " says Benjamin L. Lubin, a former member of the NASD's board of 
governors and president of Securities Industry Management Corp., a Connecticut 
consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the way trading works on the NYSE is a sharp contrast to the 
fragmented Nasdaq system. 
</P>
<P>
 On the NYSE, in most cases, customers trade with other customers. A 
"specialist" on the floor is the exchange's only market maker for each stock. 
All customer limit orders are recorded in one centralized list, the 
specialist's "book." Mostly, the specialist matches up customer orders (for a 
commission) and generally buys and sells stock for his own account only when 
there is a shortage of public buyers or sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no trading through on NYSE or the Amex; their rules require that if 
an investor is offering a better price than the market maker, that order must 
be filled before the specialist is allowed to trade for his own account at the 
same or a worse price. 
</P>
<P>
 Assume, for example, that the specialist in Exxon stock is offering to buy 
shares at $60 and sell at $60.125. If an investor comes along who is willing to 
sell the stock at $60, the investor's order will be filled before the 
specialist is allowed to sell anyone stock at $60.125. The specialist's only 
revenue from the transaction is his commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Ketchum, the NASD's chief operating officer, says having no central 
limit-order book is basic to the way Nasdaq operates. "Market makers handle 
their own limit orders and provide the quality of execution they want to," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the freedom to trade through, he says, market makers would leave the 
business, drying up liquidity and harming the Nasdaq market: "The net result is 
you're going to eliminate market making as you know it." 
</P>
<P>
 The extent of trading through on Nasdaq has so irked Malitz and a group of 
fellow options traders in Chicago that several filed a federal class-action 
lawsuit in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Their suit accuses major Nasdaq market makers of deliberately trading through 
better offers, conspiring to fix prices, colluding to maintain -- even widen -- 
spreads and restraining competition by punishing fellow market makers who break 
the spreads. The Justice Department investigation covers many of the same 
alleged abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The market makers deny the allegations. NASD officials say they are unaware of 
the options traders' complaints and have no comment on this and other 
class-action lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC, meanwhile, says it is concerned about trading through on Nasdaq. "I 
don't think we're resigned to any pricing inefficiency," says Brandon Becker, 
director of the SEC's division of market regulation. But Becker says the agency 
has no immediate plans to crack down on the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet options traders are not the only people complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter last month to the SEC, Jeffrey P. Ricker -- a San Francisco-based 
consultant to institutional investors and an individual investor himself -- 
recounted what happened last year when he put in a limit order to sell shares 
of a Nasdaq stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I was unsuccessfully trying to sell 1,500 shares of MTC Electronics at 
$19 a share, other hapless investors were buying at 19 1/4," he wrote. "They 
were cheated, and I was cheated."

</P>
<P>
 * Bid: The posted price at which a market maker is willing to buy a stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Asked: The posted price at which a market maker is willing to sell a stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spread: The gap between the bid and asked prices. This is essentially the 
market maker's profit margin for acting as a dealer in the stock. Market makers 
buy from investors at the bid and sell at the higher, asked price. 
</P>
<P>
 * Limit order: An order to buy or sell a stock at a specified price. 
</P>
<P>
 * Market order: An order to buy or sell a stock at the current market price. 
</P>
<P>
 * Market makers: Firms that put up their own capital to "make a market" in 
particular Nasdaq stocks, acting as dealers by continuously posting prices for 
the stocks on Nasdaq's computer and standing ready to buy or sell. Unlike the 
New York Stock Exchange, where a single "specialist" is the sole market maker 
for each stock, each Nasdaq stock has multiple market makers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trading ahead: Also known as front-running, the practice of a market maker 
buying or selling for the firm's profit ahead of an order from the firm's own 
customer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trading through: Practice of market makers continuing to trade with the 
investing public at their quoted bid or asked prices, ignoring offers that are 
better for customers. The customer who puts in the better-priced order often 
does not get it filled. Other investors never know about these pending orders 
and thereby miss out on opportunities to buy stock at less than the quoted 
asking price or to sell at more than the quoted bid price. About This Series

SEC MOVES TO TIGHTEN THE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Nasdaq, when it comes to deciding whose trade takes precedence -- a 
customer's or a market maker's -- the winner often has been the market maker. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Securities and Exchange Commission called earlier this year for 
eliminating one practice that has allowed brokerages and market-making firms to 
ignore their own customers' orders. And in recent months the SEC has been 
moving to do just that, forcing reforms that Nasdaq's operators had long 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice is known as "trading ahead." It occurs when a market maker 
receives a customer limit order and then trades for its own account at a better 
price without filling the customer's order. While trading through is mainly the 
result of the fragmented nature of the Nasdaq market, trading ahead is almost 
always due to willful action by individual market makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Also known as "front running," it is considered particularly egregious, 
because it represents the market makers favoring themselves over their duty to 
their customers. It allows market makers to make profitable trades based on the 
knowledge that market prices are likely to move once their customers' orders 
are executed. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the SEC approved a rule banning trading ahead by big brokerage firms 
that execute their own customers' orders. But the ban contained a big loophole: 
It allowed many large market-making firms that execute trades for independent 
brokerages to go on trading ahead of customer orders. Now, the SEC has proposed 
banning that, too. 
</P>
<P>
 As things stand now at these firms, a customer might put in a limit order to 
buy shares of a stock at 20 1/4. If the market-making firm that gets the order 
is offering to buy shares itself for 20 and sell for 20 1/2, the firm commonly 
will let the order sit unfilled while continuing to buy stock from other 
customers at 20. The firm gets a better price; other customers get a worse 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 If the firm buys enough shares at 20, the market price of the stock will jump, 
moving up to 20 1/4 bid, 20 3/4 asked -- at which point the market maker will 
execute the customer's limit order. 
</P>
<P>
 But having waited until the market price moved, the market maker is now in a 
position to make a 1/2-point profit by immediately reselling the stock at the 
new asked price of 20 3/4. If the market maker had executed the customer's 
order immediately, it most likely would only have made a 1/4-point profit in 
reselling the stock.

 Like trading through, trading ahead has long been forbidden on the New York 
Stock Exchange and other exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 Why has the NASD resisted eliminating the practice? Because it says the 
additional profit market makers earn by trading ahead of customer orders is 
justifiable compensation for the risks they incur making markets and for 
providing a liquid market in Nasdaq stocks.

 Aerospace Corp. to Lay Off 150: The nonprofit research and development concern 
said the work force cuts, effective Nov. 4, represent 5% of the firm's 3,320 
employees. The El Segundo-based company said the layoffs stem from reduced 
funding from the Defense Department, at $335 million in the fiscal year that 
began Oct. 1 from $360 million the prior year. Aerospace Corp. said its 
employment has fallen 25% since 1990 because of steady declines in federal 
funding.

 Regulator Outlines Risk-Reduction Measures: Attempting to counter a perception 
that financial derivatives are unregulated, Deputy Treasury Secretary Frank 
Newman described 80 actions taken to reduce risk in the markets, particularly 
for the exotic securities. But he reaffirmed that regulators won't ask Congress 
to pass broad laws to restrict derivatives dealings. Newman discussed a report 
by the four major financial regulators on efforts to reduce risk in the 
markets: the Treasury Department; the Federal Reserve Board and the comptroller 
of the currency, which are proposing that banks hold more capital to guard 
against losses from market movements and credit risk, and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission, which monitors the risks securities firms take in their 
derivatives dealings.

GM'S STOCK DIVES ON ANEMIC EARNINGS; AUTOS: THE NO. 1 CAR MAKER SUFFERS ANOTHER 
HUGE LOSS IN ITS NORTH AMERICAN OPERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 General Motors Corp. reported improved but surprisingly weak earnings Thursday 
as it suffered another big loss in North American auto operations despite the 
most robust U.S. vehicle market in years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three months ended Sept. 30, the nation's No. 1 auto maker earned $552 
million, or 40 cents a share, compared to a loss of $113 million, or 49 cents a 
share, in the year-earlier period. The earnings were boosted by a one-time, 
$200-million tax credit. 
</P>
<P>
 In its key North American operations, GM lost $328 million, compared to a loss 
of $825 million a year ago, not including special items. However, the company, 
which has lost $17 billion in North America since 1990, is still likely to be 
profitable domestically for the full year. 
</P>
<P>
 GM blamed the weak North American results on slow launches of new vehicles, 
production limitations and two strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The operating results were well below Wall Street expectations and GM shares 
plunged as low as $42.375 on the earnings news, but they recovered somewhat to 
close at $43.125, down $3.75 for the day. It was the most heavily traded issue 
on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Street reacted so negatively because of what this says about GM's 
long-term profitability," said David Garrity, analyst with Smith Barney 
Shearson in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors are concerned that GM lost money on its core auto business even 
while U.S. car and truck sales were booming. Only the tax credit and good 
performance of GM's non-auto units allowed it to report a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 GM officials blame the deficit in North America on increased overtime to meet 
buyer demand, higher product development costs and strike-related production 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not very happy with the third-quarter results," said Michael Losh, 
chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
 GM's performance pales in comparison to its competitors and comes amid the 
strongest car and truck market since 1988. Chrysler Corp. reported earnings of 
$651 million in the third quarter and Ford Motor Co. is expected to report 
earnings of about $900 million next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, GM lost an average of $296 on every vehicle it sold in 
North America. In comparison, Chrysler made about $1,000 per vehicle in the 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to slow production start-ups and excessive overtime, GM was hurt 
by two strikes that closed numerous assembly plants and cut production by about 
40,000 vehicles. The strikes translate to about $150 million in lost profits, 
Losh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the firm's GM Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary reported 
third-quarter earnings of $244 million, a 9% gain, on a fractional rise in 
revenue to $3.4 billion. Operating profit jumped 29%.

 Teledyne Agrees to Settle Allegations: The firm will pay $5.56 million to 
settle a whistle-blower's charges that it failed to properly test an electronic 
identification system and filed false labor charges. Steve Reddy, a former 
senior program manager at Teledyne's Electronic Division in Newbury Park in 
Ventura County alleged that Teledyne had falsified testing on its APX-109 
"friend or foe" electronic identification system used on Air Force and Navy 
jets.Reddy will receive $869,000 of the settlement under provisions of the 
False Claims Act that allow a whistle-blower to share in recoveries. The 
settlement dismisses allegations Reddy made that Teledyne had illegally hired a 
former Egyptian general to get business with the Egyptian military. However, 
the dismissal was made under provisions known as "without prejudice," allowing 
the government to reopen the case.

CELLULAR PHONE LEADERS ALLY TO BUILD A NATIONWIDE SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The headlong consolidation of the booming wireless communications business 
continued Thursday as four cellular telephone powerhouses announced that they 
will join forces to build a nationwide service and bid on licenses for a new 
generation of mobile communications services. 
</P>
<P>
 AirTouch Communications, the former Pacific Telesis subsidiary, will join with 
the Baby Bell telephone companies Bell Atlantic, Nynex and US West in an 
alliance that could pose a formidable challenge to the firms' one-time parent, 
AT&T Co., and its newly purchased cellular subsidiary, McCaw Cellular 
Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 The quartet aims to offer seamless cellular service for customers traveling 
around the country and plans to jointly develop a name, a marketing strategy 
and a common "look and feel" for wireless products and services. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the companies will likely bid aggressively in the Federal 
Communications Commission's December auction of licenses for the 
next-generation wireless services known as personal communications services 
(PCS). Bell Atlantic and Nynex, which had previously agreed to merge their 
cellular operations, had been in negotiations to join with long-distance 
carrier MCI in the PCS auctions, but that deal has apparently collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said those discussions hit a snag over MCI's insistence that its name 
brand, marketing prowess and national presence should warrant concessions from 
the other players. 
</P>
<P>
 With a presence in 15 of the nation's top 20 markets and more than 4.1 million 
customers, the alliance announced Thursday is well positioned both to upgrade 
existing cellular networks and to spend the billions of dollars that will be 
needed to acquire PCS licenses and then build PCS networks, analysts said. 
AirTouch and US West had previously agreed to jointly manage their cellular 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more cooperation there is among the Bells, the less they have to bid," 
said Sharon Armbrust, a senior analyst with Paul Kagan & Associates, a research 
firm in Carmel. "That makes it much less risky." 
</P>

PEOPLE: FIRST INTERSTATE CHOOSES SIART TO REPLACE OUTGOING CHAIRMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Interstate Bancorp named William Siart, 47, its president since 1990, to 
replace Edward M. Carson as chairman and chief executive when Carson retires in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
 Siart's promotion to the bank holding company's two top spots was widely 
expected.Carson, who has headed Los Angeles-based First Interstate for the last 
four years, will turn 65 in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts expect few changes in the bank's corporate strategy. Last month, both 
executives said they did not want to turn First Interstate into a nationwide 
banking empire and will instead concentrate on building a "super-regional" bank 
that does business primarily in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Siart, like Carson, is also expected to want to keep First Interstate 
independent. Both men have voiced their opposition to informal merger proposals 
made by Wells Fargo Bank over the past year. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Prudential Insurance Co. of America elected Arthur F. Ryan, president and 
chief operating officer of Chase Manhattan Bank, as its new chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, 52, will join the largest U.S. life insurer on Nov. 1. He will succeed 
Robert C. Winters, 62, as chairman and CEO on Dec. 1.

TIMES MIRROR OPERATING INCOME RISES IN 3RD QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Modest but steady newspaper advertising growth and unexpectedly strong results 
in professional and textbook publishing helped Times Mirror Co. boost its 
third-quarter income from continuing operations to $39.8 million from $15.2 
million a year ago, although net income fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror, parent of the Los Angeles Times, announced Thursday that it 
logged net income of $52.3 million, or 41 cents a share, in the quarter ended 
Sept. 25, compared to $77.7 million, or 60 cents a share, in the third quarter 
of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The current-year figure includes a non-recurring gain of 3 cents a share, 
while the 1993 quarter included gains on cable television asset sales of 37 
cents a share. Excluding those gains, third-quarter net income would have been 
$48.1 million this year, compared to $30.1 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert F. Erburu, Times Mirror chairman, president and chief executive, said, 
"While we were very pleased with our third-quarter results, they also benefited 
by comparison with modest third-quarter results in 1993." 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror's newspaper publishing group, which includes The Times, Newsday, 
New York Newsday, the Baltimore Sun papers and the Hartford Courant, had 
third-quarter revenue of $493.2 million, up 4.9% from $470.4 million a year 
earlier. Advertising revenue was $372.2 million for the 1994 period, up 7.6% 
from $346.0 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Group operating profit hit $33.0 million this year, up from $13.7 million in 
1993's third quarter, although the latter figure was diminished by a 
$3.8-million charge for voluntary separation programs at The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's professional information group, including health sciences and 
college textbook publishing and the Matthew Bender & Co. legal publishers, set 
quarterly records with revenue of $288.5 million, up 9.1%, and operating profit 
of $68.4 million, up 19.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer multimedia group, including magazine and consumer book publishing 
plus new consumer multimedia software and television programming businesses, 
had a third-quarter operating profit of $3.4 million on revenue of $77.2 
million, compared to year-ago operating profit of $2.4 million on revenue of 
$72.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first nine months of 1994, Times Mirror net income was $120.4 million, 
or 93 cents a share, compared to $155.4 million, or $1.21 a share, in 1993. 
Excluding non-recurring gains, net income for the first three quarters of 1994 
would have been $109.7 million, compared to $105.0 million the year before.

IBM ISN'T FEELING SO BLUE ANYMORE; NET INCOME RISES SHARPLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long-suffering Big Blue is suddenly looking a little rosier. 
</P>
<P>
 International Business Machines Corp. on Thursday topped Wall Street 
expectations with a third-quarter net income of $689 million, contrasted with 
an $87-million loss in the same period a year ago.Revenue rose 8.6% to $15.43 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnaround resulted from lower costs, largely the result of extensive 
staff cuts, and strong worldwide sales. But the Armonk, N.Y., computer giant 
acknowledged that mainframe and other computer prices continue to be under 
pressure and said its overall gross margins are expected to stay flat through 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, though IBM's struggling personal computer division is enjoying good 
growth in revenue outside this country, U.S. sales are still sluggish -- a 
situation that won't be helped in the near term by IBM's gross underestimation 
of demand for its new Aptiva line of PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM's per-share earnings of $1.18 wowed many analysts, who had projected about 
92 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is extremely pleased with the way earnings are evolving," said John 
B. Jones Jr., an analyst in the San Francisco office of Salomon Bros. 
Investors, on the other hand, were less impressed. IBM stock sank 50 cents a 
share to $74.875 on the New York Stock Exchange. MARTHA GROVES

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: SOUTHLAND IPOS A FLOURISHING CROP DESPITE RISKS 
</P>

<P>
 In an otherwise difficult stock market, a surprising number of private 
Southland companies are finding willing buyers for their initial public share 
offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, despite another dive on Wall Street, San Diego-based health care 
management firm FPA Medical Management went public by selling 1.3 million 
shares at $10 each. Over the past week, Los Angeles companies coming to market 
have included linen retailer Strouds Inc., which sold 3.3 million shares at 
$12.50 each, and Sports Club Co., which sold 4.6 million shares at $9 a piece. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a tally of initial public offerings (IPOs) by Securities Data Co. 
shows that, since July 1, nine of the 15 new California stock issues hitting 
the market have been from Southland companies. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a reversal of the longstanding trend, in which Northern California 
issues dominate the IPO list because of the usually heavy flow of stock deals 
out of Silicon Valley. For 1994 to date, for example, 52% of the state's IPOs 
have been from companies based north of Santa Barbara. In 1993, the North had 
56% of the total offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferation of Southland IPOs is unquestionably a positive development 
for the local economy. By issuing stock, young companies like Strouds and 
Sports Club get the cash they need to grow, which often translates into job 
creation. Sports Club, for instance, will use some of the net $38 million it 
raised to open new Spectrum Club fitness facilities in Northridge and Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Protection One, a Culver City-based security alarm monitoring service, will 
use most of the approximately $16 million its September IPO raised to pay off 
debt, giving the firm more financial flexibility to expand through acquisitions 
of smaller security companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Southland IPOs due in the near future: Burbank-based industrial pump 
maker Haskel International, "VCR Plus" developer Gemstar International in 
Pasadena, and Dove Audio, a Beverly Hills-based firm that is the publisher of 
the new book on Nicole Brown Simpson's life. 
</P>
<P>
 The question for investors, of course, is whether these new stocks are of high 
enough quality to provide a reasonable chance of decent price appreciation. So 
far this year, results are mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors in Variflex, a Moorpark manufacturer of roller skates and 
skateboards, have seen their shares rocket 42% from the offering price of 
$15.50 on June 17. Owners of Dominguez Hills educational-games maker 
Educational Insights, on the other hand, have lost 38% of their money if they 
bought at the $10 offering price on April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the 1994 Southland IPO crop's performance so far may say little 
about the companies' long-term prospects. Even so, some pros warn individual 
investors to be careful about virtually any IPO being pitched by brokers today. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years into the bull market that began in October, 1990, we're at the 
point in the IPO cycle where new offerings are likely to be of significantly 
higher risk than those of two or three years ago, says Samuel Stewart Jr., a 
veteran stock picker at Wasatch Advisors in Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bull market, Stewart says, the top-quality IPOs always hit the market 
early. As the bull ages, "You tend to get poorer-quality companies at 
unattractive prices," he says. While he isn't ready to call the start of a bear 
market, "We're clearly in the second half of the IPO cycle" for this bull 
market, Stewart says. One sign of that, he says, is that he is increasingly 
getting IPO phone solicitations from "a lot of (brokerages) that I don't 
recognize and don't usually do business with." 
</P>
<P>
 The size and experience level of IPO brokerage underwriters is always 
important, but never more so than in a dicey stock market, Wall Streeters note. 
A stock that isn't well launched or well supported by its underwriter can 
quickly flounder after hitting the market, aggravating its new investors and 
embarrassing the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael DiCarlo, manager of the John Hancock Special Equities stock fund in 
Boston, says that regardless of the general market mood, "It's not a good sign" 
if a new stock quickly drops below its IPO price after the offering. While 
underwriters often blame a weak market backdrop in such cases, DiCarlo says, 
"It may be that the stock was mispriced in the first place, or it was put in 
the wrong hands" -- too many institutional owners, for example, and not enough 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite their blanket warning about buying IPOs today, both Stewart and 
DiCarlo note that every issue must be judged on its own merits. But given where 
we are in the IPO cycle, a high level of skepticism may be a good ally.

CONSUMER BRIEFS; CAR RIP-OFFS TOP COMPLAINT LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American consumers were the victims of billions of dollars worth of fraud in 
1993, ranging from car sales to mail-order and telemarketing scams, a consumer 
watchdog group said Thursday. In its annual report of consumer rip-offs, the 
Consumer Federation of America said most of the worst scams of 1993 involved 
services sold by fly-by-night phone and mail companies, though the biggest 
number of complaints involved new and used cars. The CFA reported a rising 
number of complaints over home improvement and telemarketing, especially when 
they involved sweepstakes and other contests. The overall number of complaints 
was down slightly, to 546,000 from the 550,000 received in 1992. The survey was 
compiled from data provided by 43 U.S. state consumer protection agencies.

 Cyberspace Quake: Sony Corp.'s Imagesoft division and ABC's interactive unit, 
working with multimedia company Haukom Associates, have developed a CD-ROM 
called "Earthquake." The disc, incorporating ABC News' library of earthquake 
footage and moderated by Ted Koppel, has more than 40 minutes of video and 
thousands of photographs, maps and charts. "Earthquake" has information on the 
significant quakes of the 20th Century, including Anchorage, Alaska, in 1964; 
Tangshan, China, in 1976; Mexico City in 1985; Maharashtra, India, in 1993, and 
Northridge this year. The CD-ROM includes instructions on what to do during a 
quake, tips on survival supplies, and suggestions on how to deal with the 
emotional stress of a quake. "Earthquake" has a suggested retail price of 
$59.95 and is available initially for IBM-compatible multimedia computers. A 
Macintosh version will be released later this year.

 A Beer or a Bonbon?: Beer drinkers and chocolate lovers might cringe, but a 
major London brewer has come out with chocolate beer. Whitbread Beer Co. of 
London began introducing Fuggles Chocolate Mild in 2,000 British pubs this 
week. The beer contains 4.6% alcohol by volume and an "absolutely minimal" 
amount of chocolate flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting chocolate in a beer is not gimmicky," said Lorraine Thomson, 
marketing manager for Whitbread's ales. "The Belgians have been putting fruit 
in beer for years. In Scotland, they use heather. We're just adding another 
natural ingredient." The company has not announced plans to sell the beer in 
the United States.

 Crackdown on Ticketing Scams: Last year's Rose Bowl left hundreds of 
University of Wisconsin fans frustrated and angry despite the Badgers' win 
because their tour packages turned out not to include game tickets. Now the 
government is cracking down on such scams. The Transportation Department 
recently announced new "truth in ticketing" rules, aimed at banning tour 
operators from advertising package deals to an event unless they have tickets. 
Under the proposed rules, tour operators may not accept payment for a tour 
unless an actual or contracted ticket is available for the purchaser. 
</P>
<P>
 If no ticket is available, payment must be refunded within three days. The 
rules are expected to be in place by the college bowl season in December, 
officials said. In addition to sports, they will cover any tour organized for 
the purpose of attending an event whose admission price is advertised as part 
of the tour, the department said.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND CHUCK PHILIPS: WARNER MUSIC ROCKING WITH CHAOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It's panic time at Warner Music Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months after Chairman Robert J. Morgado's dramatic corporate restructuring 
shook the foundation of the world's biggest record conglomerate, sources say 
the company is in chaos and at risk of losing its top-selling rock act, R.E.M. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is Morgado's stormy relations with several top executives. Sources 
say Warner Bros. Records President Lenny Waronker, who was supposed to take 
control of the Burbank-based label early next year, is so fed up that he may 
resign. 
</P>
<P>
 If Waronker walks out, R.E.M. is expected to exercise a contract option and 
follow suit. Managers of other top Warner Bros. Records acts have also 
expressed concern about the future of the powerful label. On another front, 
executives at Interscope Records, whose acts include Nine Inch Nails, are said 
to be at an impasse over the possible sale of their label to Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 The main beneficiary of the revolt could be record mogul David Geffen, who is 
planning to start a label as part of his new studio partnership with director 
Steven Spielberg and former Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
Sources say Waronker, R.E.M., outgoing Warner Bros. Chairman Mo Ostin and other 
defectees could all end up in Geffen's camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're seeing is the dismantling of the most successful and stable label 
in the music business right before our very eyes," said one Warner Music 
executive. "Morgado just keeps doing things that undermine the confidence of 
key executives." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgado, who is based in New York, declined to comment. So did Waronker and 
Geffen. If the dispute cannot be resolved, Waronker would be the third 
executive to defect from Warner Music since August, when Morgado announced a 
restructuring that forced the exit of two of the industry's most respected 
executives: Ostin and Elektra Entertainment Chief Bob Krasnow. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostin and Krasnow reportedly refused to implement what one senior executive 
characterized as Morgado's "slash and burn" strategy to "gut" their labels' 
staff and artist rosters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tragic blow to every artist signed to Warner Bros. Records when Mo 
Ostin announced that he was going to leave his job," said the manager of one of 
Warner's biggest acts. "It's going to be a real one-two punch if Lenny walks 
out the door. The only reason we signed with Warner was because of those two 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the upheaval comes at a time when Warner Bros. acts are dominating 
the record charts. R.E.M.'s "Monster" is the country's No. 1 record. Warner 
Music leads in domestic market share, with 22.05%. 
</P>
<P>
 The management tensions appear to derive from Morgado's effort to streamline 
Warner Music -- the parent of Warner Bros. Records, Atlantic Group, Elektra 
Entertainment and Warner Music International. When the 50-year-old executive 
took over in 1985, the labels had a reputation for behaving like warring 
factions. To smooth out those problems, Morgado recently named Atlantic chief 
Doug Morris to manage the U.S. labels. 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes are also expected at the company, which boasts a diverse stable 
of recording acts that includes Tom Petty, Madonna, Jose Carreras, Stone Temple 
Pilots, Natalie Cole and Metallica. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgado, who will rank 19th on Entertainment Weekly's upcoming Power 101 list, 
has been described by industry observers as "arrogant," "insensitive" and too 
quick to take credit for the contributions of his key executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, members of the hard rock group Metallica publicly blamed Morgado's 
behavior as the reason they filed a lawsuit in San Francisco seeking to sever 
their decade-long association with Elektra Entertainment. Drummer Lars Ulrich 
said Morgado reneged on a former executive's promise to restructure their deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Another misstep Morgado apparently made was the way he handled the courting of 
Sire Records chief Seymour Stein, who is said to be ready to leave the Warner 
Bros. fold to work at Elektra. Sources say Waronker was upset he was not 
consulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Morgado's problems have even spilled over to his relationship with 
Interscope Records, the successful label founded by Ted Field and Jimmy Iovine 
and part-owned by Warner. Interscope has received buyout offers from other 
companies. Sources say Field and Iovine are still waiting for Morgado to weigh 
in with a counterbid that will allow them to stay. The price to Warner for 
acquiring the remaining 75% of Interscope is said to be $300 million. If 
Morgado makes the deal, sources say, Iovine could end up running Warner Bros. 
Records. If not, Interscope could join the parade to Geffen.

 Bidding buddies: Former Sony Pictures co-Chairmen and producing partners Jon 
Peters and Peter Guber ended up bidding against each other for the rights to 
"The Horse Whisperer," a first-time book by British filmmaker Nicholas Evans, 
who is represented by Creative Artist Agency's Bob Bookman. The bidding reached 
$2.5 million to $3 million late Thursday. Peters, based at Warner Bros., 
reportedly bid with actor Clint Eastwood. Sony-based Guber is partnered with 
Wendy Finerman. Disney is bidding on behalf of Robert Redford, and Paramount 
wants the book for the team of Scott Rudin and Sydney Pollack.

 Multimedia: Cable operator Tele-Communications Inc. said Thursday that it has 
invested about $80 million in cash and stock for a 10% stake in Acclaim 
Entertainment Inc., the Oyster Bay, N.Y.-based publisher of "Mortal Kombat" and 
"NBA Jam," two of the best-selling video games of all time. The companies said 
they plan to develop games that can be played over cable and fiber-optic 
networks by many players at once.Under terms of the agreement, TCI and Acclaim 
will set up a separate company with its own management to develop and acquire 
game technology for networks. Acclaim will own 65% of the company and TCI will 
have the balance. The new firm will also develop technology to enable consumers 
to receive the games through next-generation cable set-top boxes. Though plans 
by Englewood, Colo.-based TCI and other communications firms to build a 
futuristic information superhighway have hit regulatory and technical snags in 
recent months, Chief Executive John Malone said games will help drive demand 
for interactive services. "We think that competitive games of skill over 
broad-band networks will represent a major new segment of our business," he 
said. AMY HARMON

<P>
 The highly anticipated music video channel being jointly launched by Warner 
Music, Sony, PolyGram, EMI and BMG appears to be on the back burner amid 
questions if it will ever become a reality. Insiders say recently enacted cable 
legislation has made the venture more costly than originally projected, while a 
Justice Department antitrust inquiry has also been a major cause of concern. 
The new video channel was originally designed to give labels an alternative to 
MTV for music video exposure.

LUCAS HOPES TO WORK HIS MAGIC ON WARY MARIN COUNTY RESIDENTS; MOVIES: THE 
FILMMAKER FACES STIFF OPPOSITION TO PLANS TO EXPAND HIS SKYWALKER RANCH COMPLEX 
IN RURAL SAN RAFAEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 George Lucas' high-tech film wizards have brought dinosaurs to life in 
"Jurassic Park" and enabled Tom Hanks to shake hands with John F. Kennedy in 
"Forrest Gump." 
</P>
<P>
 But the force hasn't exactly been with the "Star Wars" creator in his efforts 
to work a different sort of miracle in growth-averse Marin County -- that of 
vastly expanding his movie-making empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas has proposed spending $81 million to build state-of-the-art facilities 
on hilly ranchland adjoining his Skywalker Ranch here. The aim is to cement 
Lucasfilm Ltd.'s reputation as the premier practitioner of digital film 
techniques and give the company's burgeoning multimedia software business room 
to bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 Past proposals, dating from 1988, have been stalled by complaints from 
residents and planning officials. But Lucasfilm officials say the sizzling pace 
of change in their industry makes the situation urgent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The need to build this is inescapable," said Gordon Radley, Lucasfilm 
president. "Sooner or later, it's all going to be digital." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Radley said, Lucas' groundbreaking special effects house -- 
Industrial Light & Magic, in San Rafael proper -- is turning away clients, 
despite a recent doubling of the number of high-tech workstations to 160. 
</P>
<P>
 The planned facilities would supplement ILM, the world's largest high-tech 
production center using computer graphics to accomplish special effects for 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas brought his innovative film company to western Marin County in 1985. 
Skywalker Ranch, named for rebel hero Luke Skywalker in the "Star Wars" 
trilogy, encompasses a sumptuously appointed Victorian headquarters mansion, 
along with other offices, overnight accommodations, a lake, a fire station and 
a fitness and day-care center for 180 employees. All structures are hidden from 
the view of passing motorists on Lucas Valley Road (named not for the movie 
mogul, but for an early settler). 
</P>
<P>
 In documents submitted to county officials last week, Lucas laid out plans for 
640,000 square feet of new offices on the Grady and Big Rock ranches adjoining 
Skywalker, about 25 miles northwest of San Francisco in rural San Rafael. 
</P>
<P>
 The new project would create as many as 640 jobs. Parking would be 
underground, and Lucas has even offered to pay for new traffic lights and a 
freeway ramp off U.S. 101 should traffic planners deem them necessary. To 
appease conservationists, Lucas plans to leave 97% of the acreage untouched and 
to permanently dedicate two smaller ranches across the road as undevelopable 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents see the plan as a big improvement over previous proposals, 
which called for the damming of a creek, the removal of more than 5,000 live 
oak and bay trees and the relocation of ILM to Grady Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucasfilm officials contend that their project would have no more deleterious 
effect on the land than would the alternative -- the building of 206 
residential units. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents and environmentalists continue to object, out of fear that 
the project would change the character of their rustic haven by opening the 
door to commercial ventures and clogging their winding country road. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you allow this kind of industrial use in areas that are residential, how 
do you tell the next person no?" wondered Joy Dahlgren, a resident active in 
the Marin Conservation League, which is concerned with the preservation of 
agricultural lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the new facilities, Lucasfilm officials maintain, the company risks

 Hoping to win over nearby residents and officials, Lucas held an informational 
party recently at Skywalker Ranch, serving up sandwiches and glimpses into how 
ILM pulls off its magic film tricks. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind all this wooing lies a subtle, rarely stated threat that Lucas might 
have to take his business elsewhere should this latest expansion effort fail. 
For the county, that would mean the loss of high-paying jobs and a prestigious 
company that pumps tens of millions of dollars into the local economy.

 Without county approval in the next year or so, Radley said, "we'd have to 
evaluate our options."

BIG NEWS, BUT WHERE ARE THE BIG PLANS?; MOVIES: UNCERTAINTY IS THE BYWORD ON 
NEW BIG-THREE STUDIO. SOME ARE EVEN ASKING IF ONE MOTIVE COULD HAVE BEEN 
SPIELBERG AND GEFFEN HELPING THEIR FRIEND KATZENBERG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has now been over a week since The Announcement -- the headline-grabbing 
disclosure by entertainment titans Steven Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey 
Katzenberg that they were joining forces to create a new studio. 
</P>
<P>
 While a wave of euphoria initially greeted the startling news, the mood in 
Hollywood has since been tempered by a sense of uncertainty as questions 
persist about what will happen next. 
</P>
<P>
 With few details emerging about the partnership's plans, some are wondering if 
the "Dream Team" venture wasn't launched too hastily (it still hasn't been 
christened publicly with a name) and how it will actually take shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are even asking if the announcement, given at a packed Beverly Hills 
press conference, had another purpose: Spielberg and Geffen helping their 
friend Katzenberg land on his feet in a splashy way after his rancorous 
departure as head of Walt Disney Studios last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just found it kind of like a non-event that was given great prominence," 
one veteran film executive said of the venture. "If you are going to start a 
studio, you really do your homework, have a name for your business, know what 
you are doing. This is an announcement to agree on something. It just seems 
puzzling. Why did this come about? I figured that Katzenberg just needed an 
announcement of what he was going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 No one doubts that a partnership of Spielberg, Geffen and Katzenberg is 
formidable, but interviews with studio executives, talent agents and 
entertainment attorneys indicate that while Hollywood has valid reasons to be 
excited about this proposed venture, many don't expect seismic shifts in power 
as a result -- and some reserve judgment until more is known. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions abound. To begin with, there is Spielberg. Had the Oscar-winning 
filmmaker announced he was exclusively committed to directing a slate of movies 
for the partnership, sources said at least that would have been something 
substantive. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spielberg made it plain at the press conference that his directing 
services were not exclusive to the new venture. He is going forward with plans 
to make a "Jurassic Park" sequel for Universal and has several other film 
ventures in the works. He did say that after his existing commitments are 
fulfilled at Amblin Entertainment, he will fold that company into the new 
studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steven is not dropping everything to devote his time to this new company," 
one industry observer said. "His immediate future seems spoken for. How much of 
Steven Spielberg did they get? Or, does he get a third just for lending his 
name?" 
</P>
<P>
 Geffen, from a motion picture standpoint, isn't a heavyweight, observers said. 
"He has been very good at building record labels," said one film executive. 
"There is no question he is a bright and aggressive guy, but I'm not really 
clear on what he is really committed there to." 
</P>
<P>
 Some are now wondering whether the real timing of the announcement was 
centered on Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving as chairman of Disney Studios when he was passed over for the 
presidency of the company, Katzenberg -- known as the most hyperactive 
executive in the business -- was not about to sit still for long. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm Jeff Katzenberg, do I sit on the beach?" asked one veteran Hollywood 
observer. "No. You've got to keep moving. . . . So, he talked to his friends 
who backed him in his fight with Disney and said, 'Why don't we start a studio? 
I'll take a third and you each take a third.' He gets Spielberg and Geffen to 
lend their names and, perhaps, some of their efforts. . . . That's one way for 
him to have a studio." 
</P>
<P>
 Should a new studio emerge, sources say, it may not alter the Hollywood 
landscape as much as many predict. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, a new buyer could enhance the already powerful positions of big 
talent houses like Creative Artists Agency and International Creative 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are in the talent business, this news cannot hurt," said entertainment 
attorney Peter Dekom, commenting on the new partnership. "If you are in the 
studio business, it is not cheery news." 
</P>
<P>
 Agents naturally welcome a new buyer in town. Rival studios naturally worry 
about more competition in a fierce marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggest that even though the agencies may be rejoicing, the "Dream Team" 
will have little effect on the money lavished on big-name actors like Arnold 
Schwarzenegger, Kevin Costner and Harrison Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 "A star's price is not based on these three guys coming together," said Marc 
Platt, president of TriStar Pictures. "Jim Carrey has two hits in a row, and 
most any studio will go out and offer him whatever he can get if it's a comedy 
and high concept." 
</P>
<P>
 All three are known to be fiscally cautious, particularly Katzenberg. Indeed, 
it was Katzenberg who once warned Hollywood in a now-famous memo to rein in its 
freewheeling spending habits. And, it was Katzenberg who relished going 
toe-to-toe with actors and agents over fees. 
</P>
<P>
 One agent, lunching over pasta at a Beverly Hills restaurant, recalled how 
Katzenberg, while at Disney, used to boast how he faced down big-name actors in 
contract negotiations. "He would say, 'I'm kicking movie star butt today,' " 
the agent recalled. Still, Katzenberg's presence as co-owner of a new studio 
could, directly or indirectly, give agents a critical bargaining tool in 
dealing with rival studios. Even the three partners might have to raise the 
stakes to get what they want. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are they going to pay more or less (for talent)?" asked attorney Dekom. "If 
they want something badly enough, they have to pay what it takes. But, 
remember, Jeffrey Katzenberg is the author of the phrase, 'You don't have to 
have it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the question of how superagent Michael Ovitz, whose agency 
CAA represents Spielberg as a director, will fare with the new partnership, 
given his strained relationships with Katzenberg and Geffen over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say that Ovitz may be reluctant to spar with those two given the new 
arrangement. However, they note, CAA President Ron Meyer is friends with both 
Katzenberg and Geffen. 
</P>
<P>
 One agent who knows the players well said that once there is a new buyer as 
aggressive as Katzenberg -- backed by the prestige of Spielberg and Geffen -- 
that venture will naturally become a magnet for the best talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people can come to this town with money, but the great thing about 
these guys is they come with a pedigree," he said. Despite the good will many 
in Hollywood feel toward the trio and their dream, there is still a good amount 
of skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been this euphoria, but you look through it and say, 'Where is the 
substance? What are they really talking about?' If they said, 'Spielberg is 
making so many pictures for us, we are filing with the SEC (Securities and 
Exchange Commission), we are raising so much capital, we have worked out a 
plan,' that would be one thing. But this is the announcement long before any 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's the beef?"

TELEVISION / HOWARD ROSENBERG: ARRESTING COP SHOWS ARE RARE, EXCEPT THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a tired, shot-up genre, carrying around a belly full of lead and cliches. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, though, every decade or so comes a U.S. crime series -- from "Naked 
City" to "N.Y.P.D." to "Police Story" to "Hill Street Blues" -- that far 
surpasses the ordinary. Yet never before have two such stunners surfaced in the 
same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing this unique pedestal in 1994 are ABC's hit "NYPD Blue" and NBC's 
staggering "Homicide: Life on the Street." And come to think of it, NBC's 
popular "Law & Order" is no slouch either, affirmed by this week's artful 
episode linking a contemporary robbery to anti-war radicals of the '60s. A 
series to like. 
</P>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue" and "Homicide" are even loftier, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Bochco and David Milch's "NYPD Blue" streaked into the 1993 fall season 
with a fleet of blue noses smoking on its tail, snorting fire over the show's 
use of nudity and coarse street talk on a scale unheard of for major commercial 
networks. Fearing a public and advertiser backlash, some ABC stations timidly 
refused to carry the series last season; its subsequent good ratings proved 
they were the ones out of touch. Station clearances have risen this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of us initially misread the series as basically a bluer version 
of Bochco's "Hill Street Blues," it created a distinctive ambience for its 
intriguingly flawed pair of protagonists, veteran detectives John Kelly and 
Andy Sipowicz, played respectively by those good actors David Caruso and 
Emmy-winning Dennis Franz. Jimmy Smits next month will succeed Caruso as 
Franz's partner, Caruso having announced after last season that he would leave 
the series to make feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue" is nubby to the touch, from crime-and-crack-clogged urban 
neighborhoods to its brooding, complex characters and their untidy personal 
lives. This season's opening episodes have been great stuff: Kelly and Sipowicz 
under fire for busting some dirty cops (turf warfare riddles their workdays); a 
sweet romance uniting Sipowicz and assistant Dist. Atty. Sylvia Costas (Sharon 
Lawrence); and Kelly's lover, former detective Janice Licalsi (Amy Brenneman), 
going on trial for murdering a mobster. 
</P>
<P>
 The courtroom sequences are strikingly intense, with Licalsi's attorney, the 
snarly James Sinclair (Daniel Benzal), making O.J. Simpson defender Robert 
Shapiro look like a squiggly Don Knotts. "The truth and a trial," this 
swaggering cynic informs his client, "have as much to do with each other as a 
hotdog and a warm puppy." Observers of the Simpson preliminaries may be 
reaching the same conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although capable of occasional tenderness, Kelly and Sipowicz themselves are 
no warm puppies, and it remains to be seen whether the Smits-for-Caruso switch 
will in any way blunt the show or alter its chemistry. Nothing should affect 
its sharp, colorful writing or the grungy, sweaty allure of Sipowicz, who wears 
disorder like thick chest hair and whose messy history includes divorce, hard 
boozing and an explosive temper that he struggles to control. Every good cop 
series has someone who seethes, and no one on TV seethes better than Sipowicz, 
who speaks in short, jabbing sentences that impact like body punches. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Although raging inside, he bit off words as tight-lipped as a ventriloquist 
last week in threatening a man who had savagely beaten his wife: "You wanna 
wind up on a pier? I'm talkin' about goin' off the end of a pier with a rock 
tied to your middle and a noose around your neck. I'm talkin' about suckin' 
water in your lungs until you're dead, until nobody knows what happened to you. 
Do not beat this woman again. Do . . . not . . . beat . . . her!" 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the seething on "Homicide" falls to Frank Pembleton, the brilliant, 
complicated Baltimore detective whom the electrifying Andre Braugher portrays 
with such an interesting edge. A shaky fall returnee after two brief trials 
that yielded much higher critical praise than ratings, "Homicide" resumed last 
week with more of its underwhelming Nielsens, ranking an ominous third in its 
time period. One hopes that NBC recalls how long it took its late, great "Hill 
Street Blues" to build an audience sufficient to ensure its survival through 
much of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the magnetism of its characters, the sheen of its ensemble cast and the 
brainy, cinematic way it re-creates and carves texture into the grim reality of 
the streets, just why "Homicide" has not yet caught on is mystifying. Executive 
producers Barry Levinson, Tom Fontana and Henry Bromell are wed to a style of 
filmmaking that's arresting, but it's one that many viewers perhaps find 
disorienting, whether from those nervous jump cuts or the fluidity of a 
hand-held camera that either orbits like a circling predator or bounces as if 
on a bungee cord. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the case, from its dream-like opening credits in shadowy black and 
white to its present three-episode plot encompassing serial murders of 
do-gooder Catholic women found nude except for white cotton gloves, "Homicide" 
is seductively different and unlike anything else on U.S. television. 
</P>
<P>
 That big bear of a commander, Lt. Al Giardello (Yaphet Kotto), still paces a 
boisterous Baltimore squad room, where last week the African American Pembleton 
exploded and flew at his tormentor when called "boy" by a white cop. It's where 
detectives John Munch (Richard Belzer), Meldrick Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Tim 
Bayliss (Kyle Secor) are making plans to purchase a neighborhood bar, where 
Det. Kay Howard (Melissa Leo) is fielding unwanted calls from the estranged 
wife of her partner, Det. Beau Felton (Daniel Baldwin). 
</P>
<P>
 "Homicide" is increasingly interested in the private lives of its detectives. 
New shift commander Lt. Megan Russert (Isabella Hoffman), for instance, is 
having a secret affair with Felton when not playing Mommy to her kids or 
heading the gory serial-murder case -- a corking good mystery, by the way -- 
that has shaken the Catholic Pembleton's faith in police work and his religion. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also a media bogyman lurking in the person of an unsavory tabloid TV 
host who relentlessly pressures newcomer Russert for inside dope on the 
murders. "What do I do?" she asks the more seasoned Giardello tonight. "You 
could always lie," he grins. "I do it all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of "Homicide," viewers get loose ends to ponder after next week's 
apparent conclusion of the serial-murder case, an episode featuring a 
remarkable scene in which Pembleton seems almost to seduce a suspect during a 
crucial interrogation in a glassed-in room known as "the box." In a sense, 
"Homicide" itself is in "the box," closely watched by NBC while under pressure 
to deliver a sizable audience to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both "NYPD Blue" and "Homicide" are grand entertainment. Whereas "NYPD Blue" 
ripples with violence, though, "Homicide" depicts only the consequences of 
violence. And "Homicide" also has a terrific sense of humor, much of it 
expressed through Det. Stan Bolander (Ned Beatty) and his partner, the 
straight-faced Munch. In a future episode, when Munch visits his mortician 
brother to price caskets for a dead friend, the brother asks: "How guilty are 
you feeling?" 
</P>
<P>
 "NYPD Blue" has almost no sense of humor. The producers do their smiling on 
the way to the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 * "NYPD Blue" airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42). 
"Homicide: Life on the Street" airs Fridays at 10 p.m. on NBC (Channels, 4, 36 
and 39). "Law & Order" airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. on NBC.

JAZZ NOTES : AFTER 60 YEARS, BENNY CARTER'S STILL KING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Asked recently if he had any idols, alto sax great Phil Woods said without 
hesitation, "Benny Carter. The guys like him who keep going into their 70s and 
80s are the true heroes of American society. The main lesson in life is 
instilled in Mr. Carter. They don't call him 'King' for nothing. To play for 60 
years is a helluva accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, 87, one of the founders of the Swing Era big-band style and, along 
with Johnny Hodges, the most influential alto saxophonist of that period, has 
had an extraordinary career as a performer, composer and arranger, doing 
everything from playing at the White House -- several times -- to writing for 
films and television. Still, Carter doesn't take plaudits like Woods' lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter was typically humble and gracious at the recent banquet of the Los 
Angeles Jazz Society, at the Biltmore Hotel, where he was given the society's 
annual Tribute award. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very grateful and honored," said Carter, who has received honorary 
doctorates from Princeton, Harvard and Rutgers universities and is an Ellington 
Fellow at Yale. "They say, 'You're known by the company you keep.' That night, 
I was in such good company, and that includes the audience, the members of the 
Los Angeles Jazz Society and the other awardees. I hope I'm recognized by 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter didn't perform at the society's bash, which also honored vibist Red 
Norvo, composer-arranger Lalo Schifrin, singer Ernie Andrews, pianist Donald 
Vega, retailer-aficionado Vicki Pedrini and this writer. (The performers at the 
event included Vega, a young and prodigiously talented Venezuelan pianist, the 
ever-stunning Andrews, pianists Roger Kellaway and Gerald Wiggins and a group 
of 11 saxophonists who played two Carter compositions.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Carter will play an extremely rare club date tonight through Sunday at 
Catalina Bar & Grill. Getting Carter to appear at the room was easy, said 
Catalina Popescu, the club's owner. "I saw he was getting this award, so I 
called him up and asked him and he said, 'Yes,' " said Popescu. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter will be backed by a solid rhythm section of Larry Nash (piano), Larry 
Gales (bass) and Larance Marable. He admitted that playing the alto can be a 
bit tough these days. "First, I have to massage my mouth a little," he said a 
little tongue-in-cheek. "There are no immediate results. Like anything else, 
you have to work at it." 
</P>
<P>
 The octogenarian says he's as active as he'd like to be at this stage of his 
life. He's performed several times this year -- including a small band tour of 
Europe and a club date in the San Francisco Bay Area that spotlighted Kellaway 
-- and he's at work on a new composition for large ensemble that will be 
recorded in January by MusicMasters Records, for whom he's made numerous 
albums. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no complaints," Carter said, when asked to assess his career. "If I 
have any, they are with yours truly. Life has been good to me." 
</P>

<P>
 Festive Birthday: Gerald Wilson, another artist with a bountiful career in 
music, turned 76 on Sept. 4, and he found a dandy way to celebrate: by playing 
before a crowd of 65,000 at the Chicago Jazz Festival in Chicago. "It was 
really great to see all these people, and then they got up and sang 'Happy 
Birthday' to me," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's All-Stars -- with Teddy Edwards, Buddy Collette, Snooky Young, 
Marshall Royal and many others -- is one of the headliners at the fourth annual 
"Jazz at Drew" Legacy Music Series, the two-day festival being held Saturday 
and Sunday from 2 p.m. to 10 p.m. on the campus of the Charles R. Drew 
University of Medicine and Science in Willowbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 Other notables in the lineup include Joe Henderson, Bobby Hutcherson, Cedar 
Walton, Jimmy Smith, Billy Childs, Ernie Andrews, Jimmy and Jeannie Cheatham, 
Patrice Rushen and Ndugu Chancler and the B Sharp Jazz Quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival organizers say that with such a strong roster, they are expecting a 
much larger crowd than last year, when the festival drew only about 2,000 
people. Perhaps that was due in part to the bash's unfamiliar location (take 
the 105 Freeway east to the Wilmington Avenue exit, then go south to the 
festival grounds at 1730 E. 120th St.) and its moderately high ticket prices -- 
$28 at the gate, $25 in advance, per day. Ticket information: (213) 563-9396. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 No Cover: The Club Brasserie in the Bel Age Hotel has reverted to its original 
no cover/no minimum policy, dispensing with the $7.50 charge that had recently 
been in effect. Vibist-pianist Buddy Montgomery plays tonight and Saturday. 
Information: (310) 854-1111.

RESTAURANT NOTES: A TOAST TO CHEFS WHO ARE RISING STARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHIE JENKINS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to the Robert Mondavi Winery, Todd English is once again a "rising 
star." Not only was English, chef-owner of the successful Olives in Cambridge, 
Mass., voted a Rising Star award by the James Beard Foundation three years ago, 
but he snagged the same honor again last month when the winery named 13 
American chefs as "rising stars." Each will be featured in a 30-minute segment 
of a PBS television series debuting in January called . . . "America's Rising 
Star Chefs." The Mondavi family worked closely with the San Francisco 
production company Santa Fe Ventures in developing the series, which will, 
yawn, be marketed with a companion cookbook. Robert Mondavi, his wife, Margrit, 
and sons Michael and Tim even appear in various episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other "rising stars" include L.A. chefs Hans Rockenwagner (Rockenwagner) and 
Dave Danhi (Georgia), San Francisco chefs Elka Gilmore (Elka, Liberte), George 
Morrone (Aqua) and Nancy Oakes (Boulevard), Hawaii's Alan Wong of Canoe House 
at the Mauna Lani Bay Hotel and pastry chef Gale Gand of Trio in Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 The chefs were selected by a panel of judges chaired by Margrit Biever 
Mondavi, which included Wolfgang Puck, the indomitable Julia Child, Ferdinand 
Metz (president of the Culinary Institute of America), Barbara Fairchild 
(executive editor of Bon Appetit), John Mariani (a free-lance food writer) and 
Axel Fabre (director of special events marketing at the Napa Valley Winery). 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a brand-new program but we plan to do it every year," says Fabre, who 
as director of Mondavi's great chefs program has brought virtually every 
important French and American chef to teach at the winery. "We felt it was 
about time to work with a new generation of chefs, rising stars, that people 
have not read about."

 Rising stars? Morrone, who once cooked at Bradley Ogden's Campton Place in San 
Francisco and headed the kitchen at the Bel Air Hotel, has been hot since he 
opened his stylish seafood restaurant in San Francisco three years ago. Hans 
Rockenwagner has been turning out impressive California-eclectic cuisine for 
the past 10 years, first in Venice and then at his larger Santa Monica space. 
Wong not only was nominated as a Best Regional Chef by the James Beard 
Foundation this year, but he's also the author of "Alan Wong's Pacific Rim 
Cuisine." And the peripatetic Gilmore cooked all over Los Angeles before she 
headed for San Francisco two years ago. All four have long been receiving a 
tremendous amount of press. 
</P>
<P>
 And Dave Danhi -- who is he? Even Puck had never heard of the L.A. chef. "I 
don't know where they found certain people," says Puck, who couldn't remember 
who he nominated. In fact, Puck was hard pressed to name L.A.'s up-and-coming 
star chefs. "Kazuto (Matsusaka) was one of the last ones but he was at Chinois 
for 10 years, so he's not so new anymore. Maybe Josiah Citrin at Jackson's. I 
had dinner there and he was very good. You could call him a rising star." 
</P>
<P>
 To be eligible for a James Beard Rising Star award, a chef must be under 30 
years of age. Food & Wine, which also presents "best new chefs" awards, 
requires that nominees be heading up a kitchen for at least one but no more 
than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 At Mondavi the requirements were looser. "We feel that a rising star can be 
anyone who is not Julia Child or Wolfgang Puck or Alice Waters or Jeremiah 
Tower," says Fabre. "Those star chefs who have been around for a decade or 
two." Try three decades. And for Julia make that four. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Puck acknowledges that some of these requirements were bent by the 
judges. "My friend Alan Wong might not be as well-known here, but he is one of 
the best chefs in Hawaii," says Puck, laughing. "Maybe he's a rising star on 
the Mainland?"

 Swank and Secret: So what if the House of Blues on Sunset Boulevard and 
Renaissance on the Promenade in Santa Monica have already opened private rooms. 
Or that Sanctuary, the supper club due to open next month in Beverly Hills, has 
planned a cozy VIP room. That hasn't stopped "Miami Vice" creator Tony 
Yerkovich from taking his sweet time opening his exclusive, swank Buffalo Club 
on Olympic near 17th in Santa Monica. He's been working on the place for three 
years now. (Don't be fooled by the dumpy looking exterior or the neighborhood; 
the decor is said to be spectacular.) 
</P>
<P>
 Consulting chef Patrick Healy insists no opening date has been set, but 
sources swear the members-only club will quietly open next week for dinner -- 
that's Wednesday through Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The secretive screenwriter would not return Calendar's calls. Nor would 
manager Tom Kane comment on the opening date or the membership fee (a source 
says it's $600). "The club is entirely Tony's deal," Kane says. "I'm caught in 
the middle and I don't want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Yerkovich and Co. aren't the least bit worried by L.A.'s sudden 
obsession with private rooms. The question is: Are there enough real celebs to 
go around? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any idea what anyone else is doing, but I know it isn't going to 
be what we're doing," says manager Kane. "It can't be. It's a signature thing. 
I know this will be different."

 Restaurant Shopping: Yujean Kang still hasn't closed escrow on the old La 
Toque space on Sunset, even though his feng shui gave the site the high sign a 
year ago. Now word has it that the feng shui may have another gig, checking out 
the former Giuseppe space on Beverly. According to Kang's wife, Yvonne, the 
Pasadena restaurateur is negotiating to buy that, too. "Nothing has been 
settled yet but we're very close," says Yvonne Kang. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the couple have still reserved their option to purchase La Toque. 
"We haven't given up on it yet."

 Phoenix, SFV: It was business as usual 6 a.m. Wednesday morning when Art's 
Deli reopened at last. Destroyed by fire after the January quake, the 
37-year-old Studio City landmark had to be rebuilt from the ground up.

TWO ARTISTS BRING U.S. TO 22ND BIENAL IN BRAZIL; EXHIBITIONS: THE SELECTION OF 
BETTYE SAAR AND JOHN OUTTERBRIDGE IS UNUSUAL IN TWO RESPECTS -- THEY ARE FROM 
THE WEST COAST AND THEY ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Exhibitions of two Los Angeles artists -- Bettye Saar of Pasadena and John 
Outterbridge, former director of the Watts Tower Art Center -- are representing 
the United States this year in the 22nd Bienal, a biannual exhibition that this 
year features work by 206 artists from a record 71 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretched across 275,000 square feet and including 1,000 works, the Bienal is 
expected to draw more than 2 million artists, curators, collectors and other 
visitors from throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Saar, 67, and Outterbridge, 61, are recognized for their assemblage work, 
created mainly of found or discarded material woven into poignant, evocative 
sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 Though both artists are well-known in the United States, their presence here, 
supported by the U.S. Information Agency and Arts America, the National 
Endowment for the Arts and private foundations, represents something of a 
departure for the U.S., whose international appearances often are dominated by 
East Coast artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Saar and Outterbridge are not the first African American artists to represent 
America at the Bienal; Chicago sculptor Martin Puryear exhibited here in 1989. 
Still, Lizzetta LeFalle-Collins -- an independent curator who proposed the two 
artists -- said the selection of Outterbridge and Saar is significant for its 
recognition of African American work. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a way that 'internationalism' has been defined that doesn't include 
the aesthetic judgments of people of color," said LeFalle-Collins, who moved to 
Oakland two years ago from Los Angeles, where she served for six years as a 
curator at the California Afro-American Museum, the site of a major solo of 
Outterbridge's work last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "People follow things that were originated in Europe and by European 
Americans, and much of it becomes copy work. They become the 'aesthetic 
markers.' What makes Bettye and John different is that they derive their art 
from these other sources that, over the years, have been deemed not to be that 
important." 
</P>
<P>
 Works by other American artists, notably Robert Rauschenberg, are also on 
display here under a separate invitation of the Bienal. The two-month Bienal 
also features artists from throughout Europe, Asia and Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Saar's work incorporates her interest in mysticism and the occult, deepened 
with studies in phrenology, palmistry, voodoo and shamanism. "Mojotech," for 
instance, combines computer chips and wires with candles and hearts, suggestive 
of the connection between science and indigenous belief systems. "Sanctuary," 
created for the Bienal, includes a life-sized canoe, doll-size chairs, lights, 
figurines and wax moldings of human body parts to "talk about the boat people, 
the Haitians, the Chinese, the Vietnamese, all of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Outterbridge uses containers, cloth, rags and discarded metal in his works. 
His room-sized "Lie Lye Soap Conference With Seven Scarecrows" includes rags, 
sticks, gourds, washtubs and bricks to create scarecrow figures, clotheslines 
and a laundry setting that recalls the folk heritage of his youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Both artists' works will remain on view here until mid-December; in February, 
they move to a biannual exhibition in Johannesburg, South Africa.

NICKELODEON EXPANDING ITS LINEUP; TELEVISION: THE CHANNEL'S SCHEDULE IS 
DESIGNED TO APPEAL TO BOTH OLDER AND YOUNGER CHILDREN. THE PRESCHOOL SLATE IS 
AN ATTEMPT TO TAKE ON AN AREA DOMINATED BY PBS. 
</P>

<P>
 Two weeks ago brought "The Secret World of Alex Mack," a series about a 
12-year-old girl who accidentally gets sprayed by an experimental chemical and 
develops supernatural powers that she uses to deal with the problems of 
adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week brought "My Brother and Me," a series about an 8-year-old boy in 
North Carolina who relies on his older sibling to help make sense of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 And two more new series arrive Monday as Nickelodeon, the 15-year-old cable 
channel, rolls out a fall schedule designed to bolster its appeal both with 
older children watching in prime time and younger ones watching on weekday 
mornings. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickelodeon president Geraldine Laybourne said the new slate of shows for 
older children, including "The Secret World of Alex Mack" and "My Brother and 
Me," represents "an expansion of Nickelodeon into new genres such as 
comedy/adventure and sitcoms." 
</P>
<P>
 But the preschool programming on weekday mornings is perhaps even more 
ambitious: It represents an attempt to increase the channel's profile in an 
area that has long been dominated by PBS' Big Bird, Barney and King Friday. 
Nickelodeon plans to spend $30 million during the next three years on new 
series for preschoolers.  
</P>
<P>
 The first of the new entries are "Allegra's Window," a puppet show about the 
everyday life of a 3-year-old girl, and "Gullah Gullah Island," a musical 
series featuring an African American family who explore the traditions of the 
South Sea Islands of South Carolina. Interspersed between programs will be a 
series of two-minute vignettes featuring new Muppet characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickelodeon has produced shows for preschoolers for many years, but its new 
initiative with the "Nick Jr." morning block puts increased emphasis on 
original production for the 2- to 5-year-old audience.  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Laybourne and Alice Cahn, the director for children's 
programming for PBS, both downplayed any competition between the two networks, 
saying that an increase in good programming for children can only benefit young 
viewers. But each clearly is an advocate for her network's approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We (at PBS) use TV as a teaching tool for children, and we've been doing that 
successfully for 25 years," Cahn said. "We have established outreach programs 
with teachers and local communities to ensure the carry-over of the learning 
that takes place on the TV program." 
</P>
<P>
 "We (at Nickelodeon) are not aiming to teach kids a curriculum like the 
alphabet," Laybourne said. "Our approach with our preschool programming is to 
create an electronic playground where kids can use playful thinking and other 
tools that will build their self-esteem and prepare them for life today."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Underlying Nickelodeon's new shows -- which also include an animated series, 
"Aaahh! Real Monsters," premiering Oct. 30 -- is a pro-kids approach that has 
made the children's TV network one of the most popular and profitable cable 
channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most prime-time shows with kids surround adults with unrealistic kid 
characters," said Herb Scannell, senior vice president of programming for the 
channel, which reaches about 60 million homes. "We make the kid the center of 
the show, seeing the world from his or her perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 That his or her is important. In a world of macho Mighty Morphin Power 
Rangers, Nickelodeon has taken the unusual step of making competent girls the 
heroes of some of its shows. Television programmers traditionally have been 
reluctant to base children's series around girls because it was believed that 
boys wouldn't watch, whereas girls were willing to tune in shows about boys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alex Mack," for example, is something of a younger sister to "Clarissa 
Explains It All," a popular Nickelodeon comedy about a bright teen-age girl who 
was an expert on sibling rivalry. "Clarissa," which has gone out of production 
but continues in reruns, predated NBC's "Blossom" and ABC's "My So-Called 
Secret Life," which also center around teen-age girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Like MTV, its sister network, Nickelodeon has been very successful at creating 
a feeling among young viewers that this is a network for them . In addition to 
meeting with kids to discuss program ideas and issues that affect them, the 
network communicates with children through computers and sponsors events such 
as "The Big Help," which led to kids across the country pledging volunteer 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of Nickelodeon as a relationship with kids," said Laybourne, a former 
educator who is credited with much of the success of the network. "We have a 
promise to our audience that we're not going to sell them short, and we're not 
going to talk to them as if kids are born stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 That relationship is translating into loyal audiences, with Nickelodeon 
accounting for 30% of the total viewing time children spend with all children's 
shows on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Nickelodeon (which includes the Nick at Nite lineup of "classic" sitcoms) 
showed an estimated $115 million in operating profits in 1993 on $282 million 
in revenue (from advertising and affiliate fees), according to Bill Marchetti, 
an analyst for Paul Kagan Associates. Marchetti estimates that Nickelodeon will 
take in $331.1 million in total revenues this year, with operating profits of 
$145 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been very successful at creating a brand identity and loyal viewing," 
Marchetti said, "and advertisers are willing to pay a premium for that." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Secret Life of Alex Mack" airs Saturdays at 8 p.m. "My Brother and Me" 
airs Sundays at 6:30 p.m. "Allegra's Window" premieres Monday at 11 a.m., 
followed by "Gullah Gullah Island" at 11:30 a.m.

HUFFINGTON DECLARES SUPPORT FOR PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN and DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a decision likely to add new fire to an already furious contest, Republican 
Senate candidate Mike Huffington on Thursday endorsed Proposition 187, the Nov. 
8 ballot initiative that aims to cut off government services to illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a quickly arranged news conference in San Bernardino, Huffington 
said illegal immigration has become such a serious problem that it is time to 
send a message to illegal immigrants as well as to leaders in Washington that 
Californians have had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have cut corners, looked the other way and sent the wrong message -- that 
breaking the law pays, that only fools go through the proper immigration 
channels," he said. "Well, no more. I believe Proposition 187 will finally draw 
a line between illegal immigration -- which is harmful and divisive -- and 
legal immigration -- which is beneficial to the nation and California." 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-illegal immigration measure has become the hottest and most emotional 
political issue in California this year. It is leading strongly in recent polls 
and has been favored by most Republican leaders in California, but it is 
opposed by many Democrats and some nationally prominent conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has been asked his views on Proposition 187 repeatedly since last 
week, when during a speech in San Francisco, he stumbled when questioned about 
the measure and appeared not to know what it was about. "I have not yet made a 
public stand on 170-er, what was that?" he said, prompting several audience 
members to shout its correct name. 
</P>
<P>
 By declaring his support for the proposition, the Santa Barbara congressman 
puts pressure on incumbent Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein to announce her 
stand. She is expected to announce her opposition to Proposition 187 in a 
speech today in the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The vitriolic and closely fought U.S. Senate campaign has become the costliest 
congressional race in U.S. history with $27 million in total spending so far. 
Some observers said Huffington's decision on Proposition 187 could benefit him 
in the race, particularly among conservatives, nearly a quarter of whom favored 
Feinstein in a recent Times poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you'll see a major jump, up to 5 points, I believe, for Huffington on 
this one issue," said Harold Ezell, the controversial former INS western states 
director who helped write the initiative. "This is the issue in the election. 
It's not crime. It's not 'three strikes you're out.' It's illegal immigration 
and you're out. That's the issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, at a makeshift podium outside a convention hall, said Thursday 
that, "like other Californians, I've seen the strain illegal immigration places 
on our infrastructure and services. As a businessman, I understand the complex 
economic issues that underlie the problem . . . (and) as an American, and as 
the husband of a legal immigrant, I understand the blessings and rich 
contributions immigrants have made to our culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "But something has changed. In recent years, the problem of illegal 
immigration has grown beyond previously imaginable proportions. Our hospitals, 
our schools, our prisons are overflowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to send a message to those illegal immigrants who disregard our 
laws and take advantage of our government's misplaced generosity. Equally 
important, it is high time we send a message to Washington. The taxpayers of 
California are sick and tired of paying for Washington's federally imposed 
mandates while Washington ignores their federal responsibility at the border." 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation about Huffington's views on the immigration measure heightened 
this week when two GOP mainstays -- former Cabinet members Jack Kemp and 
William J. Bennett -- denounced it as racially divisive, constitutionally 
questionable and a slap at this nation's debt to immigrants. Politically, Kemp 
added, "it corrodes the soul of the party." 
</P>
<P>
 Notwithstanding his regard for Kemp and Bennett, the latter a sort of 
political tutor, Huffington said he decided to support Proposition 187 as a 
first step toward tackling illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. 1, they don't live in California. They both live in Washington, D.C., and 
they don't understand the passion of the people of this state," Huffington told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the measure's opponents say it would be divisive, Huffington insisted 
that it can be just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hostility of this state toward illegal immigration has risen in direct 
proportion to the weakness of our political leaders to enforce the immigration 
laws already on the books," Huffington said. "This hostility will decrease once 
people know that it will become much harder to disobey the law of the land." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the measure's requirement that non-citizen children be expelled 
from school, Huffington said: "Right now our schools are overburdened . . . and 
the kids just aren't getting the education we got as young children. Do I care 
about the education of all the children of the world? The answer is 'Yes.' But 
it is up to their host countries . . . to provide that education." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Huffington said he was not troubled by arguments that the measure 
portends a "Big Brother" future for California -- one that, in Kemp's words, 
would "turn teachers and nurses into agents of the INS." 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that proof of citizenship hardly constitutes a police state, 
Huffington said he had no qualms about requiring people in this country to 
display identification before receiving public services.

 As Election Day nears, the uproar surrounding Proposition 187 continues to 
draw national attention. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, former GOP presidential candidate Patrick J. Buchanan strongly 
endorsed the plan, calling it "pro-family and pro-American." Buchanan dismissed 
the arguments made a day earlier by Bennett and Kemp. 
</P>
<P>
 He said their charge that the measure is "nativist" is "not only wrongheaded; 
it is a slander on the millions of Californians who support the proposition. 
The truth is the exact opposite," Buchanan said. "It is not bigotry to put your 
own country and your own family first. That is the essence of true charity and 
patriotism." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the issue, Vice President Al Gore became the 
highest-ranking official in the Clinton Administration to denounce Proposition 
187. 
</P>
<P>
 "My personal view is that it's not the correct thing for California to do. If 
I were a California voter, I would speak out against it," Gore told Latino 
journalists Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration has been a major topic on the campaign trail this year. In the 
Senate race, both candidates have broadcast television commercials that 
highlight their commitment on the issue and that attack their opponent's.

PUBLIC ACCESS TO SIMPSON JURY SELECTION LIMITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 After days of debating how to protect prospective jurors from publicity about 
the O.J. Simpson murder case, Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito elected 
Thursday to shut down some public access to jury selection, a move that drew 
immediate criticism from civil libertarians, media lawyers and legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ito's decision, the judge joined defense attorneys and prosecutors 
behind closed doors and continued questioning prospective jurors, interviewing 
18 and excusing six. Ito refused to release transcripts of the closed session 
Thursday, though he left open the possibility that news organizations could 
renew their requests for the documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's order represents his most aggressive step to date in his 
continuing attempts to curtail coverage of the celebrated Simpson trial -- 
although the full scope of his ruling was not immediately clear. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a court spokeswoman, Ito said he had only meant to exclude the 
press and public from individual questioning of the current group of 80 or so 
prospective jurors about their exposure to the media, including a new book 
about Nicole Brown Simpson that has greatly irritated Simpson's lawyers and the 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "His ruling only applies to the 'media' portion of voir dire," said Jerrianne 
Hayslett, the court spokeswoman, adding that reporters will again be admitted 
sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Once questioning about exposure to the media is complete, Hayslett said, Ito 
intends to reopen the process, presumably by allowing a small number of 
reporters to attend the sessions and to permit others to listen via an audio 
hookup to a pressroom in the court building. That is the system that has been 
in place since the judge and attorneys began questioning jurors this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Thursday, Ito released a written order outlining his plans to close some 
jury selection sessions. His order did not address the possibility of reopening 
the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito and the lawyers in the case are attempting to find 12 jurors and eight 
alternates who can impartially weigh the evidence against Simpson, who has 
pleaded not guilty to the June 12 murders of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Lyle 
Goldman. Their bloody bodies were found just after midnight June 13, and 
Simpson was arrested June 17.  
</P>
<P>
 Faced with Ito's proposed limitation on coverage, news organizations and civil 
liberties groups balked, arguing that the public has a right to observe jury 
selection. An array of news organizations, including The Times and the 
Associated Press, said they expected to file their appeal this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no factual findings that support the unconstitutional order that 
the judge entered today," said Douglas E. Mirell, a lawyer representing the 
American Civil Liberties Union Foundation of Southern California. Referring to 
Ito's courtroom, he added: "We have a star chamber going on up on the ninth 
floor. That is intolerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito has frequently said he respects the right of the public to 
observe the court proceedings in the Simpson trial, he has grown increasingly 
frustrated about publicity. That frustration appeared to reach a peak this week 
with the release of a salacious new book, "Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private 
Diary of a Life Interrupted." 
</P>
<P>
 The book is co-written by a National Enquirer columnist and a woman who says 
she was Nicole Simpson's best friend. In it, the authors say O.J. Simpson 
threatened his ex-wife repeatedly in the months leading up to her death. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and family of Nicole Simpson have contested the accuracy of certain 
portions of the book, and defense attorneys argued this week that their client 
can no longer receive a fair trial in part because of the book. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day, one of Simpson's lawyers, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., said 
some of the 18 potential jurors questioned admitted that they had some 
knowledge of the book, though none said they had read it. Cochran would not say 
whether anyone was removed because of what they knew about the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Ito's concerns about protecting the jury were redoubled 
when two prospective jurors complained to him about the media. One said she had 
been in an elevator with journalists who were discussing the case, and the 
other said someone had seen her picture on television, which would violate 
court rules against broadcasting jurors' faces. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said at the hearing Thursday that he had "invited" Simpson's defense 
lawyers and the prosecution to join in a motion to ask for closing the jury 
selection proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 In a show of unity rare except where media issues are concerned, both sides 
argued for the closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to get around the public's right to know," Cochran said, 
"but we're in a very sensitive area." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman told the judge that the closure was 
necessary so the proceedings would "remain sacrosanct and within the four walls 
of this courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides said they were concerned that jurors would be less candid if anyone 
other than the judge, lawyers and court personnel were present. They also 
worried, they said, that jurors waiting to be queried would learn through news 
reports of the questions being asked and have time to tailor their answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirell of the ACLU noted that Ito had admonished the prospective jurors not to 
watch television, listen to radio, read any newspapers or magazines and to stay 
out of bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're not following that admonishment," Mirell said, "then they have no 
business being on this jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Kelli L. Sager, representing The Times and the Associated Press, 
agreed and cited a landmark 1984 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in which the court 
found that the public has a right to observe the jury selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 That case stemmed from the decision of a Riverside County Superior Court judge 
to exclude the press from all but three days of a six-week jury selection in 
the trial of a man accused of rape and murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Before jury selection began in that case, the Riverside Press-Enterprise asked 
that the process be open to the press and public. But the district attorney's 
office opposed the motion, contending that if the press were present, juror 
responses would lack the candor necessary to ensure a fair trial. The judge 
agreed and allowed the press only to observe the general questioning of jurors 
but not the individual sessions with them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the guarantee of open public 
proceedings in criminal trials covers oral questioning of prospective jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process of juror selection is itself a matter of importance, not simply 
to the adversaries but to the criminal justice system," Chief Justice Warren 
Burger wrote for the court. "The value of openness lies in the fact that people 
not actually attending trials can have confidence that standards of fairness 
are being observed; the sure knowledge that anyone is free to attend gives 
assurance that established procedures are being followed and that deviations 
will become known."  
</P>
<P>
 The court did find that jury selection sometimes can be closed, but only when 
a judge makes specific findings about why that is necessary and he or she 
narrowly tailors the remedy to the perceived problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong language of the Press-Enterprise case could make it difficult for 
Ito to close off the portion of the jury selection process devoted to 
determining whether jurors have been influenced by media coverage of the case, 
some legal experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are real constitutional problems with (Ito's decision)," said 
Erwin Chemerinsky, a USC law professor and constitutional expert. "I think this 
violates the 1st Amendment." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "Press-Enterprise leaves open one possibility. It says that when 
there is questioning about deeply personal matters, then it would be 
appropriate to close voir dire as to those questions -- such as whether you 
have been raped. . . . But I don't see justification for closing it about their 
exposure to media." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor, agreed that the Press-Enterprise case 
provides important guidance, but argued that several things distinguish it from 
the situation faced by Ito. In the Press-Enterprise case, the judge never 
considered alternatives to closing the questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito cited the Press-Enterprise ruling Thursday but said the extent of 
publicity in the Simpson trial so far exceeds the earlier case that they cannot 
be fairly compared. "My clerk advises me," Ito said dryly at one point, "that 
there have been 27,000 newspaper and magazine articles about this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that he has received press clippings from as far as Tibet, Ito said: 
"This case exponentially differs from Press-Enterprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Ito's irritation and frustration with the media coverage was stoked again 
Thursday when two jurors complained to him about the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito said he would take up their complaints at a scheduled Nov. 7 hearing, 
after which he will decide whether to end television courtroom coverage of the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In another action Thursday, Ito unsealed and then quickly resealed a 
transcript from a closed session Wednesday morning, during which Simpson made a 
statement to the judge about his intentions during the infamous low-speed 
freeway chase the day of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The resealing occurred after "one of the sides" objected to the transcript 
being released, said Hayslett. Defense lawyers had said Wednesday that they 
wanted the transcript released. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ruling closing the jury proceedings, journalists would be barred 
from the courtroom for at least five days and no audio of the proceedings would 
be fed to a courthouse pressroom where all but a few reporters who were allowed 
in the courtroom had previously listened to the selection process.

POLICE CRIME LAB MAKING COCAINE FOR DRUG BUSTS; NARCOTICS: SANTA ANA POLICE 
DEFEND THE PRACTICE, CITING SAFEGUARDS THAT ARE IN PLACE. OTHERS QUESTION THE 
ETHICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County authorities have been secretly manufacturing rock cocaine for 
Santa Ana Police Department undercover operations targeting neighborhood drug 
buyers, including those in an area near a middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys mounted a legal challenge Thursday to halt the practice, 
which many law enforcement officials consider extremely risky, including police 
in Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 For 18 months, Santa Ana police have sought special court orders to make 
hundreds of sales, Police Chief Paul M. Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not playing games here," the chief said. "We're trying to give the 
streets back to the residents and we're making progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters said the department resorted to so-called reverse sting operations -- 
where officers act as drug dealers -- because they were not making a dent in 
trafficking by posing as buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Powder cocaine seized in Santa Ana drug busts is taken to the Orange County 
Crime Laboratory, where it is cooked into rocks, also known as crack cocaine. 
It is sold in $10 and $20 pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the operation started, officers have arrested about 350 people -- about 
100 of them within a few blocks of Willard Intermediate School in Santa Ana, 
Capt. Bruce Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two of those arrested have been minors, said Dean Allen, head of the 
public defender's Juvenile Court office. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to keep kids away from drugs, I think there are probably a lot 
of better ways to do it than just to sell them drugs," Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler said his office is preparing to 
challenge the legality of having government agencies manufacture drugs for use 
in undercover investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm aware that the reverse stings have been upheld (in court)," Butler said. 
"But I think this raises the goofiness of that rule to a higher level. It's 
shocking, really." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing serious potential liabilities involved with distributing narcotics, the 
Los Angeles and San Diego police departments say they do not employ the 
technique used in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have got to ask yourself if it is worth doing," said Lt. Sergio Diaz of 
the Los Angeles Police Department, who supervises street narcotics 
investigations on the Westside. "What happens when a suspect makes off with the 
dope or they put it in their mouths? You have just introduced a drug into the 
community that wouldn't have been there." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Arenberg, executive director of the National Assn. of Police Chiefs in 
Washington, said the technique is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd hate to be the department that permits this to happen, and it turns out 
that somebody overdoses or has a heart attack," Arenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Carl Armbrust said no other Orange County police departments are 
doing reverse stings with real narcotics, and he was unaware of any other 
department processing its own crack at the county crime lab. 
</P>
<P>
 But Armbrust said he would encourage other departments to conduct similar 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they abide by the guidelines and the district attorney (approves), I'd say 
that's great," said Armbrust, who supervises the district attorney's Narcotics 
Enforcement Team. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities familiar with regulations governing crime laboratories said the 
Orange County lab is licensed by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to 
manufacture drugs used by officers in undercover investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters acknowledged that reintroducing drugs to the streets is somewhat 
unorthodox, but he said no one -- neither police officers nor buyers -- has 
been injured. Police said some buyers have ingested the rocks before they could 
be arrested, but Walters said there have been no reports of buyers suffering 
ill-effects from swallowing the drugs. And he said undercover officers have 
tried to avoid sales to juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 During processing at the crime lab, the individual rocks are coated with a 
special dye that causes any part of the body touched by the drug to glow when 
illuminated under a black light. That helps police identify suspects who 
swallow the drugs or try to drop them. 
</P>
<P>
 Since sales have been made in such small quantities, Carlson said, harmful 
quantities of the drug are not being put on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason we are doing this is because there is drug activity occurring 
in these neighborhoods," Carlson said. "We're trying to do what works. " 
</P>
<P>
 Reverse sting operations are common in the drug wars in which investigators 
flash large amounts of narcotics to net big dealers. But the tactic of selling 
small amounts of drugs to capture small-time drug users is controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, a Florida appeals court put a stop to a similar operation, 
ruling that the Broward County sheriff acted illegally in manufacturing crack 
cocaine for undercover investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court in Florida upheld the ruling, resulting in the 
reversal of hundreds of cases. "It is incredible that law enforcement's 
manufacture of an inherently dangerous controlled substance, like crack 
cocaine, can ever be for the public safety," the court said. Defendants 
arrested in the Florida cases have filed a federal class-action lawsuit asking 
for more than $1 million in assets that were seized after the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana officials emphasize that the operation has passed California legal 
tests, and scrutiny by the Santa Ana city attorney's office and the Orange 
County district attorney's office. The Orange County Sheriff's Department, 
which runs the county crime lab, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last decade, the Orange County district attorney's office has had a 
policy requiring a five-kilogram minimum for major reverse sting operations in 
drug cases. Prosecutors approved Santa Ana's request for the street sales 
program when the Police Department agreed to follow strict safety guidelines, 
Armbrust said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we got our guidelines established, we didn't consider it extreme," 
Armbrust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson said the department chose not to use rock cocaine confiscated off the 
streets because it could contain harmful impurities. "Processing it through the 
crime lab ensures that it's pure cocaine that we use," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one police officer is granted access to the county lab to retrieve the 
drugs, police said. Carlson said the drug buys are videotaped, and a supervisor 
is always on the scene. He acknowledged, however, that the drugs are not always 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional security measure requires police to obtain court orders for each 
batch of rock cocaine released. Police say they have obtained as many as five 
court orders authorizing the reverse stings. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Michael Brenner's signature appears on the 
court orders, but the judge said this week that he did not recall the requests. 
But Brenner said he does recall approving larger quantities in the "multi-kilo 
range" for use in larger police investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing the drug for use in sting operations "does have an unseemly side 
to it, doesn't it?" Brenner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys with the public defender's office said they have encountered 
hundreds of the Santa Ana reverse sting cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, it's sort of an easy way to make a lot of felony arrests for 
drugs and show statistically that you're making busts," said Bob Knox, a deputy 
public defender.

ISRAEL SEALS OFF GAZA, WEST BANK; MIDEAST: PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY WARNS CLOSURES 
MAY TURN PEOPLE AGAINST PEACE PLAN. RABIN'S CABINET OKS NEW MOVES AGAINST 
HAMAS. VIDEO SHOWS ALLEGED SUICIDE BOMBER.

<P>
 Responding to Wednesday's deadly bombing of a Tel Aviv bus, the Israeli 
Cabinet on Thursday ordered the West Bank and Gaza Strip sealed indefinitely, a 
move the Palestinian self-governing authority immediately denounced as an act 
of "economic and social war." 
</P>
<P>
 The nation was plunged into mourning as families buried 14 of the 20 Israelis 
killed in the bombing. A Dutch tourist and the bomber also died. Drivers for 
the Dan Bus Co., whose No. 5 bus was incinerated in the attack, kept their 
headlights on all day as they traveled their routes, a gesture of solidarity 
with the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 And by Thursday afternoon, a videotape began airing on Israel Television of 
the man who is believed to have carried out the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 In the videotape, Salah Abdel-Rahim Hassan Souwi Nazal, 27, who carried a 
briefcase packed with explosives aboard the No. 5 and is thought to have blown 
himself to bits in the bombing, bade farewell to his friends and family. Nazal 
cradled an Israeli-made Galil rifle as he somberly addressed the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 The neatly dressed man said he wanted to avenge the deaths of three Hamas 
militants killed by Israeli soldiers Oct. 14 in the army's failed attempt to 
rescue an Israeli soldier kidnaped by the extremist group. The kidnaped 
soldier, Nachshon Waxman, and another Israeli soldier were killed in a raid on 
the West Bank house where Waxman was held. 
</P>
<P>
 Nazal also said that his brother had been killed by Israeli soldiers during 
the Palestinian uprising, or intifada , that erupted in the Israeli-occupied 
West Bank and Gaza Strip in December, 1987. The army put Qalqiliya, Nazal's 
West Bank hometown, under curfew and said it would demolish the home of Nazal's 
family, even though a survivor of the bombing who said she sat behind the 
attacker told Israeli Radio she did not believe the man in the videotape was 
the one on the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli police said Thursday that 22 bombing victims had been identified, but 
that the condition of the bodies made it difficult to determine if that is the 
final death toll.  
</P>
<P>
 The curfew and the planned demolition appeared to be the government's first 
show of force in what Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin has promised will be 
a war against Hamas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cabinet, called into emergency session by Rabin on Thursday morning, 
agreed with the prime minister that security forces could use unspecified 
"additional means . . . to strengthen their activity against the Hamas and its 
military wing." 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing the nation Wednesday night, Rabin said he did not want the security 
forces hampered by the guidelines of the Landau Commission when dealing with 
Hamas. The commission devised guidelines several years ago for security forces 
to use "limited physical pressure" in the course of interrogations, in 
situations where lives could be saved by obtaining information from a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to reporters after the Cabinet meeting, several ministers, including 
Justice Minister David Libai, said they had persuaded Rabin not to put forward 
a proposal to let security forces use harsher methods during interrogation of 
Hamas militants whenever they are apprehended. But it appears likely that 
security forces will start rounding up Hamas activists in the West Bank and 
subjecting them to "administrative detention" -- arrest and imprisonment 
without charges being filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Palestinian and Israeli human rights groups Thursday called on the 
government to refrain from practicing collective punishment that will affect 
wide segments of Palestinian society. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call upon the Israeli government to refrain from implementing any measures 
which bring harm to innocent persons, such as house demolition and sealing, 
curfew, unacceptable treatment of the families of wanted persons," the B'tzelem 
and five other human rights groups said in a statement faxed to news 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 But already, the entire population of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank is 
forbidden to enter Israel to work or visit, unless granted special permission. 
The new restrictions cut off the livelihoods of tens of thousands of 
Palestinians and limit the movements of nearly 2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see in these resolutions adopted by the Israeli Cabinet today a declaration 
of war, an economic and social war against the Palestinian society that will 
negatively affect the whole process," said Marwan Kanafani, spokesman for 
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat. "I do not know how we 
are going to go ahead with implementation of the peace process with such an 
attitude," Kanafani told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that the continuation of the closure of the Gaza Strip and 
West Bank will have grave consequences on the Palestinian people from a 
security, social and economic point of view," said Palestinian Authority Labor 
Minister Samir Ghoshe. Ghoshe said more Palestinians will be driven into 
opposition to the peace process if the closure is lengthy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Israeli Cabinet ministers were in no mood to sympathize with the 
Palestinians on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not just a closure," said Tourism Minister Uzi Baram, referring to 
the new restrictions. "It is a closure and also the return of people who are 
illegally (inside Israel) and also a series of operative activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Ministers spoke of a "strategic separation" between Israel and the territories 
where Palestinians live. They said that the government soon will increase the 
number of foreign workers allowed into the country. There already are about 
25,000 foreign workers -- most of them from Asia and Eastern Europe -- legally 
working in Israel, and 15,000 more will be authorized. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Israel did not suspend its talks with the PLO on expanding 
its authority throughout the West Bank. Rabin withdrew his chief negotiator, 
Danny Rothschild, from the talks in Cairo after Waxman was kidnaped. Rothschild 
on Wednesday completed another round of talks that made little progress toward 
agreement between Israel and the Palestinians on Palestinian elections in the 
West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Government spokesman Uri Dromi said Wednesday that Rabin and his Cabinet are 
more inclined now to speed up those talks and to speed up the transfer of 
authority to the Palestinians in the West Bank than they were before the 
bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long run, what is important is not so much the decisions the 
government took today, but the shock of this tragedy," Dromi said. "People are 
suddenly realizing that this sort of attack can happen in the heart of Tel 
Aviv. More Israelis are open to the conclusion that their security can be 
better assured if they are not wrapped in a bearhug with the Palestinians." 
</P>
<P>
 But about 120,000 Jewish settlers live on the West Bank either in the midst of 
or near Palestinian communities. The army has yet to figure out how to provide 
security for those settlers after it redeploys out of Palestinian population 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 And it must find a way to confront Hamas -- which has pledged to destroy the 
Israeli-Palestinian peace process -- without alienating both the Palestinian 
Authority and the vast majority of Palestinians living in the territories who 
feel they are being punished for the acts of an extremist minority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope that this (closure of the territories) will not last a long time, 
because there is a clear distinction between the PLO and Hamas," said Culture 
Minister Shulamit Aloni, a member of the left-leaning Meretz parliamentary 
bloc. "We are conducting a strategy (for) peace. We will continue with it and 
therefore, it will be necessary to keep building it."

SEISMIC HAZARD IS GREATER THAN BELIEVED, SCIENTISTS SAY 
</P>

 The Northridge temblor in January, the most costly American earthquake since 
1906, measurably rearranged more than 1,900 square miles of metropolitan Los 
Angeles, leaving portions two feet higher than before, according to a 
wide-ranging report released today. 
</P>
<P>
 The severe shock -- now reassessed at magnitude 6.7 -- also forced scientists 
to revise their estimates of the seismic hazard facing the densely inhabited 
suburbs of metropolitan Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 In the most comprehensive assessment of the Northridge earthquake so far, the 
scientists of the U.S. Geological Survey and the Southern California Earthquake 
Center say that people in the Los Angeles area should expect at least one 
earthquake every year of magnitude 5.0 or more for the foreseeable future. 
There is a 45% likelihood of another Northridge aftershock above magnitude 5.0 
by the end of July. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists said that with almost 100 faults in the Los Angeles area known 
to be capable of a magnitude 6.0 or greater earthquake, emergency planners must 
recognize that urban earthquakes can no longer be considered rare events. Over 
the long run, contractors should expect that homes and buildings might be 
subjected to severe ground shaking -- at the extremes of the stresses 
considered in present building codes -- several times in the structure's 
lifetime.  
</P>
<P>
 "The full extent of the urban corridor from San Bernardino through Los Angeles 
and northwest to Santa Barbara is at risk from both the thrust faults (like 
Northridge) and the San Andreas Fault, and the two risks are comparable," the 
scientists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, the scientists suggested "that the northern Los Angeles region 
faces one of the greatest seismic hazards in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 The study's conclusions, reported in today's issue of the journal Science, 
represent an unusual scientific consensus on the events of Jan. 17, when as a 
result of a few seconds of brutal whiplash -- in which the Earth rippled at 
speeds up to five feet per second -- at least 57 people were killed, 9,253 
injured and more than 20,000 left homeless. As scientists evaluated their 
findings in the months since, they have adjusted the magnitude of the quake 
several times. Most recently they had assigned it a 6.8 figure, but now 
consider it a 6.7 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge quake produced the most severe ground motions ever recorded in 
a North American city, giving researchers their best close-up look at a thrust 
quake. After evaluating their findings, the scientists concluded that such 
devastating shaking should be considered the norm near any large thrust 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The fault responsible for the Northridge earthquake belongs to a system of 
thrust faults related to a bend in the San Andreas Fault between Ft. Tejon and 
the Cajon Pass. There are so many hidden faults underlying the basin, however, 
that any safety efforts must be regional in scope, the scientists said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We can't focus our attention on individual faults . . . because there are so 
many blind faults and it's so complicated, we have to look at this in a 
regional sense," said Thomas L. Henyey, executive director of the Southern 
California Earthquake Center at USC.  
</P>
<P>
 The detailed scientific portrait of the Northridge quake and of the 
implications for future earthquakes in Los Angeles was the work of scientists 
from Caltech, USC, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Columbia University and UC 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a debate over what happens when you are right on top of an 
earthquake," said Lucile M. Jones, a USGS seismologist who led the team that 
prepared the report. "That argument is over." 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge earthquake, Jones said, "really rammed home the nature of the 
complicated fault zone that we are sitting on. This is an incredibly complex 
web of faults underlying all of Los Angeles -- more complex than we thought."  
</P>
<P>
 The entire Los Angeles Basin is becoming more seismically active, and the data 
from the Northridge quake reinforced the expectation that the area should 
continue to experience at least one 5.0 temblor or greater every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many minor controversies are still unsettled, the scientists reached 
agreement on the temblor's major lessons relatively quickly -- barely nine 
months after the earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 In part, the researchers reaped the benefit of the large number of sensors 
that lace the region to record subtle ground motion and changes in position, 
experts said. They also were able to evaluate their conclusions quickly, in 
part because of computer communications on the Internet, which enabled 
researchers on distant campuses to share the latest findings with great speed. 
</P>
<P>
 In assessing the engineering implications of the Northridge earthquake, the 
scientists paid special attention to building codes in California and how well 
the construction standards anticipate the severe shocks of even moderate 
earthquakes.  
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake left more than 3,000 buildings unsafe for habitation, but the 
scientists blamed much of that damage on faulty construction and inadequate 
building inspections.  
</P>
<P>
 Even simple, cost-effective safety measures, such as securing computers, 
lights, water pipes and bookcases, could save billions of dollars in future 
earthquakes.  
</P>
<P>
 Federal and state emergency officials are still collecting damage reports. On 
Thursday, officials at the County-USC Medical Center announced that the complex 
sustained $1 billion in quake damage, more than any U.S. hospital ever has 
sustained because of a natural disaster.  
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis on protecting against loss of life says nothing about the cost 
of repair to restore the buildings to usability," said Douglas Dreger, a 
research seismologist at UC Berkeley who praised the group's findings. "Under 
the present codes, the buildings may not collapse but may not ever be usable 
again. It may be advisable to strengthen the codes to prevent much more of the 
damage that can occur in strong earthquakes."  
</P>
<P>
 * HOSPITAL DAMAGE: County-USC quake damage tab estimated at $1 billion. B1 
(Southland Edition, A28) Analyzing the Quake 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some findings of a wide-ranging report on the Northridge earthquake: 
</P>
<P>
 * The slip on the fault was greater than normal for thrust faults with a 
rupture surface of less than 97 square miles. The maximum slip exceeded 10 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Almost 100 faults in the Los Angeles area have been identified as capable of 
magnitude 6 or greater earthquakes. But only a few of these will produce such 
events in our lifetimes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earthquakes as large as the Northridge one probably occur an average of 
every 40 years in the Los Angeles area, according to geologic and geodetic 
estimates of slip on faults in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Earthquakes similar to Northridge will occur several times within the 
lifetime of a structure. Therefore, the focus of design practice on avoiding 
collapse should be reconsidered.

THE TIMES POLL; VOTERS SHIFT TO GOP BUT REJECT PARTY'S POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As the congressional election approaches, Americans are rejecting key elements 
of the Republican campaign platform, but seem intent on handing the GOP a 
victory anyway, according to the latest Los Angeles Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's popularity appears to have turned up slightly in the last 
month -- from a rating a month ago of 42% approval and 52% disapproval to a 
better, but still negative, 44% to 50% in the current poll. What improvement 
there has been seems to have come on the basis of foreign policy, where poll 
respondents are now practically evenly divided on his performance -- 48% 
approve and 46% disapprove -- as opposed to his 36%-55% rating in September and 
similarly negative ratings during most of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 By 51% to 42%, those polled approve of Clinton's handling of the situation in 
Haiti, and by 59% to 30% they approve of his handling of Iraq -- about the same 
rating that former President George Bush received during the months immediately 
before the 1991 Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 But the foreign policy upswing has been insufficient to stem the Republican 
drift of the electorate, the poll indicates. Respondents gave Clinton 
remarkably little credit for any accomplishments, even in areas where he has, 
in fact, won victories. And on issues across the board, they now say that they 
believe the Republicans can do a better job than Democrats to solve their 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked which party can do a better job on the country's major problems, 36% 
favored Republicans, 29% chose Democrats and 15% said neither party -- the 
first time during Clinton's presidency that Republicans have had an advantage 
on that question. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP holds similar edges on individual issues, including crime, welfare 
reform, the economy and the federal budget deficit. Even on health care, where 
the Democrats once enjoyed a large margin, the two sides are now even, at 38%, 
with 14% saying that neither party is up to the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The GOP edge generally has not come about because Republicans have won major 
improvements in their ratings as problem-solvers. Instead, respondents turned 
away from the Democrats, dropping their ratings. Moreover, the percentage 
saying they think that neither party can handle the nation's problems has 
risen.  
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of the cause, however, the GOP has reaped the benefit. Asked which 
party's candidates they intend to vote for next month, those surveyed on a 
"generic ballot" now give a 5-point edge to the Republicans, 45% to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional elections, of course, are won and lost on a local basis, not by 
a single national vote. In many races, individual factors, from the financial 
strength of incumbents to the ideological differences between particular 
candidates, could help Democrats stave off Republican efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the generic ballot has served as a fairly reliable political 
barometer over the years. Generally, Democrats have lost seats when the 
Republicans have approached parity on the question. The current GOP lead -- 
something that has not occurred since July, 1953, except briefly after the Gulf 
War -- could forecast a Republican surge large enough to win control of the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, supervised by Times Poll Director John Brennan, surveyed 1,272 adult 
Americans, including 1,016 self-identified registered voters, between Oct. 17 
and Oct. 19. The results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 
percentage points for the entire sample and 4 points for the registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The apparent Republican edge in the upcoming election exists despite the fact 
that majorities of those polled disagree with the Republicans on many key 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Most strikingly, on the issue on which Clinton has tried to focus the campaign 
during the last two weeks, those polled said, by 46% to 35%, that they would 
prefer to "stick with President Clinton's programs" for the economy rather than 
"return to the types of programs put forth by Ronald Reagan when he was 
President." 
</P>
<P>
 Those polled said they think the government should spend more on domestic 
programs, by 61% to 32%; 25% said the government should spent a "great deal 
more." The percentage who said defense spending should increase has gone up 
notably since Clinton's inauguration but still -- by a narrow 48%-45% margin -- 
respondents said the country should not spend more on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 More strikingly, asked if they believe that the United States has "adequate 
military strength," 44% said yes, with another 25% saying that U.S. defenses 
are "more than enough." Only 28% accepted the argument of leading Republicans 
that U.S. defense strength no longer is adequate to deal "with all potential 
international crises." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the Republican promise, made in the party's "contract with 
America," to cut taxes, increase defense spending and still balance the budget 
simultaneously, 55% said they believe the package to be "unrealistic," while 
only 30% called it realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Even among self-described Republicans, nearly a third call the party's pledge 
unrealistic. Democrats may have limited ability to capitalize on that, however, 
because 82% of those polled said they had never heard of the Republican 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll shows strong support, 77% to 19%, for placing a limit on the number 
of terms a member of Congress can serve. But, asked whether they prefer to be 
represented by an "experienced politician" or a "political outsider," those 
polled chose the experienced politician by a 51%-36% margin -- rejecting what 
has been a key message of Republicans across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Democrats may be winning the argument on many individual issues, 
they are losing the allegiance of key blocks of swing voters -- a trend driven 
by Clinton's unpopularity and voter unease over the future of the economy. In 
the 1992 congressional elections, The Times' exit polls showed that Democrats 
won the backing of a narrow, 49%-43% plurality of independent voters. They also 
won the battle of the crossovers, picking up 16% of Republican voters while 
Republican candidates won the votes of only 10% of self-described Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, all that has changed. Independents are swinging Republican by a 
47%-28% margin. And, while 12% of Democrats said that they plan to defect, only 
5% of Republicans do. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bloc that appears to be swinging the election is the roughly 
one-fifth of registered voters who are not Republicans, but who said that they 
plan to vote for Republicans this year. That group is predominantly male, 
white, older, middle income, and moderate-to-conservative ideologically. They 
are overwhelmingly anti-Clinton, with only 19% approving of his job 
performance, and deeply cynical about the political process -- 55% said neither 
Clinton nor the Republicans have done much that is worthwhile, compared with 
41% of respondents overall. 
</P>
<P>
 By a majority of nearly 3 to 1, respondents describe themselves as "angry" 
about how the federal government is working. But the swing-bloc voters are 
particularly angry. Among the smaller group of voters who described themselves 
as "very angry" about Washington, Republicans lead, 57% to 21%, on the generic 
ballot. Democrats lead, although narrowly, among all other voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But what, exactly, people are angry about is less clear. Asked about gridlock 
in Washington, for example, 48% said it is bad but 42% agreed with the 
statement that gridlock is good "because it keeps Congress and the President 
from passing new programs that would hurt the country." 
</P>
<P>
 And on several fronts, the poll indicates a sharp disconnect between how 
people view conditions that they can directly experience and their perceptions 
of the nation as a whole. For example, a majority of respondents, 53%, said 
they believe that the economy remains in recession, despite more than a year of 
steady economic growth. At the same time, however, a large majority, 69%, said 
their own personal financial circumstances are "very secure" or "fairly 
secure." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, respondents said, 66% to 26%, that the country is on the "wrong 
track." But across the country, with the notable exception of California, those 
same respondents tend to be more positive about their own states. In the 
industrial Midwest, for example, those polled said by 56% to 34% that their own 
states are on the right track; but by 61% to 27%, they said that the nation is 
on the wrong track. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the anger appears to be focused on Clinton, and the President 
continues to be a drag on his party's ticket. One-third of the registered 
voters polled said they would be less likely to vote for a congressional 
candidate who would support Clinton, compared with only 19% who said that they 
would be more likely to vote for such a person. 
</P>
<P>
 A big part of the reason why these and other voters have swung away from the 
Democrats seems to be the impression that Clinton and his party have not 
accomplished much in the 20 months he has been President. Clinton and his aides 
have labored to reverse that perception by a constant repetition of Clinton's 
accomplishments, but so far their effort have not changed the perception. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, asked about Clinton's promise to reduce the budget deficit by 
half before the end of his term, only 16% of those polled said he has made 
either a "great deal" or a "good amount" of progress, while 47% said he has 
made "not too much" progress and 32% said he has made none at all.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the deficit for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 is now estimated 
at about $220 billion, compared with a projection of $305 billion before 
Clinton took office. Next year's deficit is estimated at $167 billion, compared 
with a projected $302 billion. In Bush's last year as President, the deficit 
hit a record $290 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Clinton has trimmed 75,000 workers from the federal civilian 
payroll of about 2.1 million and is on track to reduce federal employment by a 
total of 275,000 during the next several years. But only 22% of those polled 
said he has made progress toward his promise to "reduce the size of the federal 
work force," while 23% said he has made no progress and 47% said he has not 
made too much progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has won congressional passage of a scaled-down version of his national 
service program, which puts young people to work on public service programs in 
return for help in paying for college. The program will enroll 20,000 young 
people by the end of the year, but in this area only 21% said Clinton has made 
much progress toward creating such a program while 54% said he has made no 
progress or not much. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the crime bill that Congress passed in August contains funds to help 
local governments hire additional police officers. Clinton has promised to 
increase the number of police by 100,000 officers. Critics have said the bill 
will fund a somewhat smaller number. Of those polled, 19% said Clinton has made 
no progress toward the goal, 38% said he has not made much progress and only 
36% said he has made a great deal or a good amount of progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked separately to assess whether Clinton has made good proposals that 
Republicans have blocked or bad proposals that should have been blocked, 35% 
credited Clinton with having put forward good policies while 17% said his plans 
were bad and Republicans were right to block them. A plurality, 41%, said that 
neither Clinton nor the Republicans have proposed much worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Clinton, those who take that "plague on both houses" view 
said by a 55%-24% margin that they plan to vote Republican this year. Treading

</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,272 adults nationwide, by telephone, Oct. 17 
through 19. Included in the sample are 1,016 registered voters. Telephone 
numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the nation. Random-digit 
dialing techniques were used so that listed and non-listed numbers could be 
contacted. The sample was weighted slightly to conform with census figures for 
sex, race, age and education. The margin of sampling error for the total sample 
is plus or minus 3 percentage points; for the registered voter sample it is 
plus or minus 4 points. For certain sub-groups the error margin may be somewhat 
higher. Poll results can also be affected by other factors such as question 
wording and the order in which questions are presented.

GI SUICIDES IN HAITI ALERT ARMY TO THE ENEMY WITHIN; MILITARY: ALL MISSIONS 
HAVE STRESSES AND STRAINS. BUT THE IMPOVERISHED NATION IS TAKING ITS TOLL ON 
U.S. TROOPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sgt. James DeCoite's wants as a military police officer in Haiti are simple. A 
shower without mud. A day off. Cold water to drink. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saudi Arabia was 10 times better than this," DeCoite said amid the filth of a 
Port-au-Prince street market as he watched over the Dessalines Street police 
station. "It's rougher here. Even though I was under threat in Saudi, this is 
rougher and more frustrating mentally." 
</P>
<P>
 The suicides of three American soldiers in as many weeks has focused new 
attention on the morale of the men and women serving in the operation to 
restore democratic government to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The suicides -- 15 times the U.S. national average -- have raised questions 
about whether the mission in Haiti is taking an unusual toll on the troops. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, it shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 In marked contrast to the backdrops for military endeavors in Saudi Arabia and 
Somalia, this is a non-hostile environment where crowds are more likely to 
cheer soldiers than shoot at them. 
</P>
<P>
 But, say the counselors and mental health specialists assigned to the 
military, each deployment has its peculiar sources of stress and strain. 
</P>
<P>
 American soldiers stationed here voice complaints that range from the quality 
of their living conditions to shock over the poverty of Haiti to frustration 
with the changes in and limitations of their mission. 
</P>
<P>
 And the swift way in which the nature of the Haiti operation shifted -- 
overnight, from an invasion to an unchallenged occupation -- gave soldiers 
little time to adjust and created confusion, the counselors say. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Somalia, you knew from the beginning what was going to happen," said 
infantryman Anthony Paquin, standing on a dirt road as Humvees roared by. "When 
we first got here, we didn't know what to expect. First we were told we were 
going on an invasion. And then it was a peacekeeping mission." 
</P>
<P>
 Many servicemen and women note especially the frustration of not being allowed 
to intervene more directly in stopping "Haitian-on-Haitian" violence. 
</P>
<P>
 GIs frequently break up fights if they happen upon them, but they are 
generally supposed to leave the pursuit of criminals and detentions to 
international police monitors working with Haitian police. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to get too involved, because we want to go home, but we want to 
do something," DeCoite said, a short distance from where ever-present crowds of 
curious Haitian children stared at him over barbed-wire coils. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're frustrated about how much power we can use. . . . We're military 
police. It's inbred in us. We want to stop (violence). But we can't. The 
Haitians are supposed to take care of Haitian problems." 
</P>
<P>
 While U.S. Army officials caution that the suicides are still under 
investigation, they acknowledge alarm at the phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 After the most recent suicide, the Pentagon announced an increase in the 
number of psychiatrists and mental health workers assigned to troops in Haiti, 
although officials here said the increase was part of routine deployment. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, delivery of mail and access to U.S. news have increased. Duty 
is rotated to vary a unit's contact with the Haitian public. 
</P>
<P>
 The counselors say they encourage the troops to talk out their problems and 
seek the listening ear of a chaplain or psychiatrist or psychologist. 
Forty-seven chaplains are available to attend to the 20,000 troops here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We emphasize that suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem," 
said Maj. Eric D. Cipriano, a behavioral scientist with the 528th Combat Stress 
Control Detachment out of Ft. Bragg, N.C., in an interview Thursday with a 
small group of reporters. "You always want people to understand the reality of 
the situation, but you don't want them to dwell on it. Some troops talked about 
it. The majority we've talked to have dealt with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The three suicides, military spokesmen said, were Army Spec. Alejandro Robles, 
20, of Los Angeles, who shot himself while on patrol in Port-au-Prince on Sept. 
29; Marine Lance Cpl. Maurice A. Williams, 21, of Detroit, who shot himself 
while aboard the transport ship Nashville, docked at Puerto Rico, on Oct. 5, 
and Army Pvt. Gerardo D. Luciano, 22, of New York, who shot himself in 
Port-au-Prince on Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Robles and Luciano belonged to the same brigade of the Army's 10th Mountain 
Division, and Cipriano said there is some concern about possible copycat 
suicides. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one suicide in Somalia, where 96,000 troops served for more 
than a year. There were eight suicides during the Persian Gulf War, where 
500,000 troops were deployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Soldiers guarding the entrance to a series of vacant lots near the port here 
said Thursday that morale was in flux. 
</P>
<P>
 A few feet from where the soldiers stood, a woman had been bathing her feet in 
water from Haiti's ubiquitous open sewer canals. And not far away, thousands of 
Haitians were picking through a mountainous garbage dump in search of food. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (morale) varies," Sgt. Orlando Pendleton said. "It's high one day. Next 
day, it's low. . . . Some of us feel sorry for a lot of them (the Haitians). We 
wish we could help more." 
</P>
<P>
 "The rich people don't want us (here)," Paquin said. "They don't like us. You 
can tell by the way they look at us. They snub their noses." 
</P>
<P>
 As the dust kicked up in air almost too hot to breathe, Sgt. Jesse Spencer 
added: "The biggest question is when are we going to go home. There's a lot of 
uncertainty." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially for the troops attached to the 10th Mountain, the heat and sun take 
their toll. These GIs are required to wear hard helmets, thick flak jackets and 
often long sleeves in temperatures that soar well above 90 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's physically tiring. The sun sucks every drop out of you," said Spec. 
David Erickson, a medic attached to the military police unit at the Dessalines 
police station. He had just patched up a Haitian machete victim who bled for 
three hours, treated a local prostitute who was sick and almost delivered a 
baby (the Red Cross arrived in time to assume that task). 
</P>
<P>
 Erickson said many soldiers are falling ill with dysentery and respiratory 
infections. His MP unit had worked three weeks without a day off, he said, and 
the worst part was the crude conditions of the camp where they sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shower in the mud," DeCoite said. 
</P>
<P>
 Counselors say separation from family is the problem that most plagues the 
troops. And, especially in a place like Haiti, a major source of stress is a 
sense of helplessness and a loss of control over one's situation and the 
immediate environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the poverty of the surroundings challenges a soldier's own value 
system, the counselors say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soldiers who haven't seen it before do" experience shock, said Capt. Chester 
Egert, a chaplain attached to the 10th Aviation Brigade of the 10th Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Young soldiers who never traveled outside the U.S. are the ones who are most 
taken aback. It's disbelief. They can't believe people live in some of these 
conditions, without electricity, without water, in the kinds of houses some 
people live in." 
</P>
<P>
 Egert said the quickness with which soldiers are deployed in the modern Army 
has robbed the men and women of time to decompress and sort out their feelings 
after grueling missions such as Somalia or Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "In today's Army, you're on the other side of the world in 24 hours," he said. 
"It happened in Vietnam too. A guy would be back on the streets of L.A. in 18 
hours, with no time to process his experiences, and come back to a community . 
. . with no one to talk to." 
</P>
<P>
 As for a consistent trait that counselors look for to identify potential 
suicides, Cipriano, the behavioral scientist, said there is no exact science to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't give you a profile," he said. "Everybody's at risk. No one is 
immune."

 To plenty of people in Walnut Park, the April firebombing of Calvin Bailey's 
house came as no surprise. A cheery roofer with the muscled arms of his trade, 
a husband and father of four, he nonetheless made perfect sense as a target. He 
had, after all, gone and started a Neighborhood Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 While no one was injured, the charred remains of the Baileys' quarters 
appalled the city at large, drawing attention from the mayor, television 
newscasts and the daily paper. All he did was abide by the law and ask others 
to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the city's struggling northwest section where the late-night blast 
occurred, most reaction was more muted. Tongues clucked; heads nodded 
knowingly. In this part of town, tales like Calvin Bailey's are as common as 
plywood-sealed windows, as familiar as hollowed-out cigars refilled with 
marijuana for sale on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Over on Wren Avenue, Maria Paschal could have told the Baileys what being a 
block captain can mean. Her earnest newsletters and attempts to hold meetings, 
she is sure, are the reasons someone shot her car full of holes a year ago. She 
now commutes by bus. 
</P>
<P>
 To the west, on Harney, Pamela Boyd started organizing her neighbors against 
crime. Then three police officers stormed into her living room and aimed their 
revolvers at her head. They were responding to an anonymous tip that she was 
harboring a wanted felon, a man whose name she had never heard before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pam, can't you see?" said her husband, after the police apologized and left. 
"Pam, you are definitely stepping on somebody's toes." 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 20 years, law enforcement agencies nationwide have touted 
Neighborhood Watch as the key to conquering fear and crime. Take control, 
police urge citizens. This is the covenant they offer: We will show you how to 
make your homes secure. You be our eyes and ears, block by block by block. On 
the familiar orange-bordered Watch signs, the slogan under a cartoon of a 
lurking, masked man says it all: "We report suspicious activity." 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, it's the right thing to do," said Betsy Cantrell, crime prevention 
director of the National Sheriffs Assn., which has popularized Watch groups. 
"We can't expect law enforcement to protect us all." 
</P>
<P>
 But on the streets that need reclaiming most, poverty-etched terrain infested 
with dealers, muggers, prostitutes and pimps, Neighborhood Watch can seem a 
puny, even dangerous, tool. Understandably, scores of decent people are 
unwilling to join in. 
</P>
<P>
 On Robin Avenue, for instance, a four-block road in Walnut Park where five 
people were murdered in 1993, Addie Gill sponsored two Watch meetings, but 
nobody came. In retrospect, she's glad: "I just retired and I want to live a 
little." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a sad development, especially considering the Watch's history: 
conceived in the wake of the Watts riots as a way to build community strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood Watch can actually increase fear while having little effect on 
crime, according to a study of four Chicago communities. And former Los Angeles 
Police Chief Ed Davis, who created the Watch in 1969, said it has often been 
misapplied. 
</P>
<P>
 How to do it right, particularly in the most crime-afflicted sectors, is 
increasingly a matter of debate. Prescriptions include getting professionally 
trained, intensive guidance, and using Watch groups to attack root causes of 
crime, such as idleness or lack of jobs. Others advocate a shift in emphasis, 
from standing up publicly against crime to more furtive maneuvers: In Waterloo, 
Iowa, cards can be filled in and returned unsigned to block watch captains, and 
in one Chicago housing project, a telephone hot line has been installed for 
anonymous tips. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardy souls of Walnut Park, the core who won't give up, are trying all the 
new moves they can think of. Lately, they've had help. The city has 
experimented with community policing in the neighborhood. An idealistic new 
alderman has urged residents to join Watch groups. And the St. Louis chapter of 
the Urban League has attempted to revitalize its own block units which, in 
Walnut Park, tend to be combined with Neighborhood Watch groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, only 20 of the 200 blocks in Walnut Park boast active groups, and crime 
rates are rising. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows that of 13,000 residents in Walnut Park, there are many more 
good people than bad. But trust is in very short supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Who wants to open up a house for a block Watch meeting when addicts could 
attend and case the place for a burglary? Who wants to show up when a dealer's 
grandmother or girlfriend could report back on who was there and what they 
told? 
</P>
<P>
 For that matter, what police officer wants to take the risk of revealing law 
enforcement plans when someone there might warn the targets? 
</P>
<P>
 Such worries have proved quite legitimate here. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, a round-faced man with a gap in his smile approached the 
driver of a St. Louis Police Department squad car. He said, in essence: "Help." 
The supplicant was Calvin Bailey, then aged 32. 
</P>
<P>
 The houses on the 5200 block of Emerson Street, where Bailey lived, were being 
taken over by cocaine merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer, Reginald Williams, couldn't offer much solace. He would pass the 
information along to detectives, but he suspected it would get lost in the 
shuffle. The complaint was hardly big-time stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the situation was typical for the east side of Walnut Park, a onetime 
retirement community which followed a classic urban spiral downward during the 
1970s: the purchase of homes by middle-class blacks; white flight; two-bedroom 
houses suddenly available for rent; six and seven tenants at a time moving in. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came decay -- porches falling down, weeds springing up. Then drugs. With 
three ramps to Interstate 70, Walnut Park became a convenient stop-off point 
for customers and wholesale suppliers alike. Groups of small-time dealers 
within a block or two banded together, calling themselves gangs. A routine drug 
case to police now involves a cache worth $5,000 to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The west side, with its brick Tudors and Georgians, stayed more stable, but 
trouble spots showed up as the community veterans grew older. One new resident 
asked a longtime homeowner if he could borrow some baking soda because company 
was coming and he wanted "to make some biscuits." What he actually wanted to 
prepare was crack. Soon cars were coming and going at all hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson Street is east. There, the crickets' rusty-hinges drone had long since 
been drowned out by louder rhythms: "Gunfire pop pop pop," in Bailey's words, 
"and music boom boom boom." Desperate women with cravings hailed drivers at the 
stop sign: "I need some; I'll do anything you want." Buyers who couldn't wait 
till they got home would smoke their coke on the nearest porch, no matter whose 
it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, pregnant with her fourth child, Denise Bailey hit on what she 
thought was a solution: Neighborhood Watch. If the police couldn't, or wouldn't 
help, they would do the job themselves. She wanted so much to be able to let 
the children play outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnout at the inaugural gathering was three. But in time their ranks 
swelled to a membership of eight. Then the intimidation began. 
</P>
<P>
 "You bought a watch from me," one man told Calvin Bailey. "You bought stolen 
property." His meaning was unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
 Knots of young men started gathering on the sidewalk on Neighborhood Watch 
nights in front of whichever home was the meeting site. Their presence was not 
meant to reassure. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor in the Watch moved away; she wanted her son out of the area 
because he too had started selling drugs. Another announced she also would be 
leaving; her husband had died. It was easy, and seemed prudent, to let the 
whole effort slide. 
</P>
<P>
 Police involvement with the Watch groups was intermittent at best. Pamela 
Boyd, president of the Urban League's block-group effort in Walnut Park, 
complained that William (Butch) Henderson, the community relations officer, was 
"hard to get hold of." Henderson in turn complained that he didn't even know 
who the block captains were. He said the Urban League would not release the 
names. "They say it's confidential," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 But other forces were at work. The city began an experiment with community 
policing. Freed from the endless stream of emergency calls, Officer Reggie 
Williams and his partner, Robert Farrow, were charged with getting to know the 
residents and figuring out how to clean up Walnut Park. 
</P>
<P>
 They baby-sat. They painted over graffiti. And they decided that one or the 
other of them should always accompany Henderson on his Neighborhood Watch 
meeting rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The political landscape was changing, too, with the election last fall of 
Gregory J. Carter as alderman for the 27th Ward. Beating back crime was high on 
his agenda. He plugged Neighborhood Watch in his first newsletter to voters. 
"I'm asking you to either start or reactivate your block units," he wrote on 
the front page. 
</P>
<P>
 Exasperation set in fast. Williams, hoping to encourage one nervous gathering, 
confided that a nearby drug house was going to be raided. The day the police 
zeroed in, their quarry greeted them at the door, laughing. "We moved 
everything last night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and Carter concluded that someone at the Watch meeting must have 
leaked word. Williams went so far as to accuse Pam Boyd. For a time, she was 
incensed. But they both knew they needed each other. 
</P>
<P>
 To show the good folks they would find other ways to help, Williams and Farrow 
began bringing city building inspectors along on their narcotics busts. Even if 
the suspects bailed out or charges weren't filed, enough serious code 
violations could almost always be found to evict everyone from the house. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the inspectors lived nearby. He drove his city car home one night, and 
the empty vehicle was set ablaze. Now only inspectors from outside the area 
come out for the raids.  
</P>
<P>
 The dangers of direct action were already apparent to most neighbors, thanks 
to citizen marches on drug houses organized by Khatib A. F. Waheed, director of 
Caring Communities Programs. Waheed, with his close-trimmed beard, suspenders 
and tie, cut a familiar figure throughout Walnut Park because of his work to 
strengthen families, from school tutoring to substance abuse counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "You sell drugs! You must go!" Waheed's protesters, anywhere from five to a 
dozen, chant before each target home on alternate Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 The voices, however, belong to outsiders, usually clergy or college students. 
This is because of a shoot 'em-up in early 1991 that sent ammunition slamming 
into three houses, all with school-age children in residence, on the same block 
of Beacon Street. Someone from each place had marched with Waheed. After the 
bullets flew, the locals stopped participating.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was becoming clear that Neighborhood Watch alone offered no simple fix. 
Some thought that should have been obvious from the start. "Neighborhood Watch 
don't work," said Chris Carter, brother of Alderman Carter, between phone calls 
in the alderman's storefront district office. "There's no one in charge and no 
money involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, scholars say they understand why so many turned first to the Watch. 
They blame hype. "I think Neighborhood Watch was basically oversold in the 
'80s," said Dennis P. Rosenbaum, director of the Center for Research in Law and 
Justice at the University of Illinois-Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Practically every police and sheriff's department in the nation now has an 
officer who is supposed to help citizens form Watch groups. Forty of 70 
programs financed through the Clinton Administration's Summer of Safety program 
included the organizing of Neighborhood Watch. Spinoff attempts are legion: 
Fleet Watch, Postal Watch, Harbor Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 At any given time, about a third of America is involved in Watch activities, 
said Cantrell of the sheriff's association. Most of that territory, she added, 
is middle class. "Where you have a homogeneous community, where people have 
money invested," she said, "it's easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even those chapters quite often fall apart, usually because participants 
get bored. The average life span, Cantrell said, is about two years. Indeed, a 
New Jersey policeman once estimated that 25% of the Watch signs in his town 
were mere shipwrecks, marking the spots where a block group went down. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes perfect sense to Matt A. Peskin, director of the National Assn. of 
Town Watch, based in Wynnewood, Pa., an affluent Philadelphia suburb. Peskin 
founded his organization in 1981 as a resource for block captains like himself 
who wanted to trade information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watch groups can only do so much. They have quietly done a lot of what they 
were designed to do," he said. He believes that the Neighborhood Watch mission 
should be limited to preventing break-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 Ex-chief Ed Davis, for one, has higher ambitions for his brainchild. What he 
had in mind all along was a working partnership between police and the good 
people they protect, fighting illegal activity together, in communities of 
every class and color. "It was supposed to be universal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Davis rules, citizens should be in constant touch with an 
officer they know. Police in turn are supposed to send suggestions based on 
what they hear up through the chain of command. 
</P>
<P>
 Those underpinnings disappeared in Los Angeles, he said, when he left the 
chief's post. They never showed up, he added, in most places that picked up the 
Watch theory after Davis "licensed" it to the sheriffs' organization in 1972. 
The reasons were various: from misunderstanding of the concept to resistance by 
officers who perceived the Watch as interference from civilians or a "lite" 
version of real police work. 
</P>
<P>
 The lofty goals, however, remained part of the conventional Watch wisdom. And, 
though there have been many success stories, the separation of the means from 
the ends also led to problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, a Northwestern University team examined Watch organizing 
in four Chicago neighborhoods, all middle class but experiencing racial or 
economic transition. The researchers expected the experience to increase 
optimism about the communities, help residents get to know each other, make 
them feel safer and reduce actual crime. Most of their results showed the 
opposite happening. The siege mentality actually intensified. 
</P>
<P>
 When the scholars compared the Watch areas to citywide surveys, they found no 
evidence that block groups made a difference at all. 
</P>
<P>
 This method of community crime prevention, they concluded in a 1988 book about 
their observations, "fails for the most part to offer a workable or meaningful 
solution." 
</P>
<P>
 Those were fighting words back then. Rosenbaum, who was one of the professors 
involved, said he was harshly criticized for writings that questioned the 
Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he has company. "Neighborhood Watch is kind of passe," said Bonnie 
Bucqueroux, associate director of the National Center for Community Policing at 
Michigan State University. 
</P>
<P>
 As violent crime spreads beyond pockets in large cities to middle-sized towns 
and suburbia, the lessons being learned in the Walnut Parks of America can be 
applied to other types of areas as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is changing," said Lin Squires, a founder of Mad About Rising 
Crime in the San Fernando Valley. Where Squires lives, in Chatsworth, 
traditional Neighborhood Watch is "an excellent piece of the puzzle," she said. 
"But it's limited. We need more."  
</P>
<P>
 While she belongs to a Watch on her block, Mad About Rising Crime also 
sponsors softball leagues at local parks and offers counseling to parents and 
teens with troubled relationships. "Its focus," she said, "is on trying to 
create crime-resistant neighborhoods, to look at what caused this drastic 
situation and change that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, Calvin Bailey vowed to try the Watch again. With the police 
stepping up their community effort, there was more backup around, he told 
himself, and it could work. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, he stopped at each of his block's 21 houses, even the seven where 
he knew that narcotics dealers were at work. He explained his intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the meetings would be held in public buildings, not in private 
homes. But it wasn't enough of a change. On the first official evening of the 
new, improved Watch, in the community room at Walbridge Elementary School, 
Bailey sat by himself for an hour before giving up. 
</P>
<P>
 For two months, no one came. By the third month, he had drawn only three 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey decided he needed a gimmick. He researched city programs and printed up 
a handbill advertising that the next Watch meeting would feature information 
about grass seeds and paint. Seventeen people -- a record -- showed up. "They 
thought that something was coming free," he said, chortling at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
 With that triumph, the old flow of threats resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 The messages were delivered, on the street or at the corner store, by people 
he knew slightly, by just their first name or their last. 
</P>
<P>
 "You better watch your back," warned Andre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get home before it's dark," Mrs. Simmons said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gonna get you. They know you snitching." This time it was Mike. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dark morning hours of April 20, Bailey woke smelling smoke. He made his 
way from his bedroom to the living room, which was on fire. He walked outside 
and saw a spine of flame flickering on the wall. Peering at its source on the 
roof, he remembers, he realized, "It's one of them cocktail bombs." Molotov's 
recipe: gasoline in a bottle, a rag for a wick. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone escaped. Calvin and Denise; Calvin Jr., 15; Dana, 13; Devin, 4; 
Carlton, 2. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire gave off a vivid glow. The sirens wailed at ear-blasting level. 
Bailey noticed, however, that nobody on the block was looking out to see what 
had happened. "We report suspicious activity," indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "After all I've done," he thought and for the first time, bitterness stirred. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get me the U-Haul," said his wife, Denise, half-hysterical. It was time to 
give up, to flee the house where they had spent the last 10 years. That night, 
lying beside her husband in a hotel near the airport, she sobbed for a very 
long time. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the morning, she said, "I'm staying." She didn't want to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a brief, heartening period. 
</P>
<P>
 Without being asked, Khatib Waheed corralled some of his regular marchers for 
guard duty at the house. In pairs, they worked four-hour shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 After two days, one asked, "Khatib, man, how long we gotta do this?" But 
Waheed insisted that they continue. "This is a Waterloo," he said, "for this 
family and for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey's employer donated a new roof. Another company installed gray carpeting 
and contributed linoleum for a new kitchen floor. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the scrutiny from the media and City Hall, drug activity stopped. And 
on April 28, the Baileys held a Neighborhood Watch meeting. Thirty-three people 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, like Alderman Carter, were elected officials. Some were pastors. 
Amazingly, however, most were locals. They came from other blocks of Emerson 
and from Alcott, the next street over. 
</P>
<P>
 One was Robert Keys, 55 years old, tall and bespectacled. The crime had been 
getting to him. "I was thinking of just packing up and going," he said. "I 
figured I'm alone. What can I do? I'm one person." 
</P>
<P>
 The firebombing changed his mind. It was Calvin Bailey's turn to be an 
inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 But recent Watch meetings have attracted only 10 people, and the peace is 
over. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are sure they know who pitched the firebomb onto Bailey's roof and also 
who commissioned and paid him with one or perhaps two $20 rocks of cocaine. But 
there's no prosecutable case; their witness is too scared to step forward. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks now, every night at about 10 p.m., the shooting has started up on 
Emerson Street. The drug dealers are back on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 When Denise Bailey steps out on her porch to sweep up, she hears the comments: 
"She thinks she's too good to talk to anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors are spreading about Calvin, that he sold his share of narcotics himself 
in the past. And the No. 1 rule at the Baileys' house is that the children, for 
their own safety, must stay indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Official Neighborhood Watch handbooks recommend that residents leave outside 
lights burning at night, and offer tips about locks and window bars. Ask block 
captains in Walnut Park what advice they would add and they come up with 
suggestions like these: 
</P>
<P>
 * Print two agendas, the real one and the censored backup prepared in case a 
stranger or someone obviously untrustworthy shows up. An alternative: the 
"meeting before the meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 * Forget the "phone tree." Be careful about who gets your number. 
</P>
<P>
 * Even though the police say they won't stop first at your house if you call 
in a complaint, they do it all the time. Then you've been fingered as the 
snitch. Don't phone 911 cold (your address will show up) unless it's a matter 
of life and death. Instead, contact someone in the department that you know. 
</P>
<P>
 * When the adults stop providing information (and they will when they get 
scared), buy a bunch of Freeze-Pops for the children, who will snack on your 
front stoop and fill you in on the latest goings-on. 
</P>
<P>
 * At the least, joining Neighborhood Watch means some of your neighbors will 
whisper that you're mean, self-righteous, or priggish, or all three. At worst, 
you could get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "God takes care of babies and fools," Maria Paschal said. "That's how I cope 
with fear."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; PROPOSITION 187; BUSINESS LEADERS ATTACK IMMIGRATION 
MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Saying Proposition 187 would take an economic and moral toll on California, 
several leading business executives Thursday spoke out against the ballot 
measure that would deny many public services, including schools and 
non-emergency medical care, to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's flawed legislation if you deal with the issue of the numbers," said 
Michael Rossi, a vice chairman of Bank of America, at a Downtown news 
conference. Rossi cited the potential loss of billions of dollars in federal 
revenue and added costs for law enforcement if illegal immigrant children are 
expelled from public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just a question of dollars and cents," said Bruce Corwin, president 
of Metropolitan Theatres Corp., which serves largely Latino communities. The 
measure is "evil, awful" and discriminatory, Corwin said. "It's no different 
than what happened to the Jews in the '30s, the Japanese in the '40s." 
</P>
<P>
 The executives' statements came the same day that a university-based policy 
organization released a survey showing that most California school 
superintendents whose districts include large numbers of Latino students 
believe passage of Proposition 187 would hurt far more than it would help. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost half the superintendents who responded to a 50-district survey by the 
Tomas Rivera Center predicted higher costs if voters approve the measure Nov. 
8. At least three-fourths said the removal of illegal immigrant children would 
neither reduce class size nor cut bilingual education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents argue that many of California's problems -- from the high cost of 
government services to crime -- are aggravated by illegal immigration. They 
contend that denying public services to illegal immigrants will reduce costs 
and discourage foreigners from entering the state without government 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
 The business leaders who spoke Thursday -- including J.P. Morgan Securities 
managing director Michael George, former Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. 
Chairman Benjamin M. Reznik and Michael R. Peevey, a former president of 
Southern California Edison Co. -- made clear they were speaking as individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tomas Rivera Center's survey of school superintendents added up to 
"overwhelming rejection" of the measure by "individuals who have the whole 
picture" of their districts, the center's president, Harry P. Pachon, said at a 
separate Downtown news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one-fourth of superintendents said they expected overall education costs 
to decrease if the ballot measure becomes law, while almost 82% anticipated 
that the requirement for schools to verify student citizenship or immigration 
status would increase district administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked to cite potential benefits of the measure, 71% of superintendents 
said there were none. Much smaller percentages (from 4% to 8%) listed greater 
school stability, more resources available for other students and better test 
scores as possible benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no mechanism for determining how many of the 5.2 million students in 
California public elementary and secondary schools are in the country 
illegally. Estimates range between 200,000 and 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which has not taken a stand on Proposition 187, conducts research 
on Latino policy issues and operates from the Claremont Colleges in Claremont, 
the University of Texas at Austin and Trinity University in San Antonio. Pachon 
said the organization took care to ensure that the survey was unbiased.

LEGISLATORS VOW TO FIGHT WILSON OVER PRISON FUNDS; FINANCES: GOVERNOR HOPES TO 
RAISE $2 BILLION NEXT YEAR. SEVERAL LAWMAKERS QUESTION SPENDING PROPOSAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Wilson Administration is pressing ahead with plans to raise $2 billion for 
prison construction next year, while some legislators, reacting to published 
reports about the high cost of prisons, vowed to fight the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, the Legislature killed Gov. Pete Wilson's call for $2 billion in 
spending on prison construction. Although some officials and political leaders 
maintain that there is need for more prisons, several legislators questioned 
additional spending on prison construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have not convinced anyone (of the need for more prisons)," said 
Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), who is running for state Senate. 
"They don't deserve it yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Brown, undersecretary of the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency, which 
oversees the Department of Corrections, said his agency is working on plans to 
raise as much as $2 billion by selling bonds to build more prisons next year. A 
spokesman for Wilson confirmed that the Administration intends to propose the 
spending plan in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections analysts predict that the prison population, now at 126,000, will 
reach 232,000 by the turn of the century, requiring the construction of 25 more 
prisons, and ultimately doubling the department's $3-billion annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison officials say the number of prisoners will increase dramatically, 
largely because of the tough new "three strikes" sentencing law. Proposition 
184, an initiative identical to "three strikes" legislation signed by Wilson 
earlier this year, is on the Nov. 8 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the Department of Corrections probably will propose that part of 
the $2 billion be raised by the Legislature approving the sale -- without 
voters' approval -- of lease revenue bonds. By the time interest is repaid on 
the bonds, the cost would double. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's probably our expectation," Brown said of the lease revenue bonds idea. 
"We haven't finalized a proposal, but obviously we will come back with some 
prison financing proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward), who led the effort to block 
the prison bond deal this year, said he will battle such a spending plan again. 
Lockyer called lease revenue bonds, which cost 20% more than voter-approved 
general obligation bonds, "irresponsible financing." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are wasting millions of dollars by overbuilding fortress-like prisons, and 
neglecting the alternatives," Lockyer said. "It's very frustrating to see money 
that is so tight wasted in those ways." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported in a four-part series this week that prisons, which 
consumed less than 3% of the state budget before the building boom, now take 
more than 7% of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 California has been adding about two new prisons a year, with little oversight 
from state auditors or legislators. And the California Correctional Peace 
Officers Assn., the main union representing prison workers, has grown into one 
of the most aggressive lobby forces in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 California's prison program is by far the nation's most costly. Each new 
prison costs $200 million or more to build, and an average of $73 million to 
operate each year. Government experts say that if the Department of 
Corrections' predictions are accurate, the prison budget will soon double, 
forcing the state to gut other state programs, such as higher education, or 
raise taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our costs appear to be way out of line," said Assemblyman Louis Caldera 
(D-Los Angeles), citing comparisons reported by The Times which show that 
California builds the most costly prisons in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to monitor it much more closely," Caldera said. "Wall Street 
investors, lawyers, contractors and others are becoming very wealthy. We need 
to rethink our approach because this will literally bankrupt the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom McClintock, Republican candidate for controller, pledged to undertake a 
complete audit of the Department of Corrections' building and operations 
programs if he is elected Nov. 8. Citing The Times series, McClintock said 
California has created "an armed bureaucracy with all of the waste and 
mismanagement connected with bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 The controller's office has not performed a wide-ranging audit of the 
Department of Corrections since the prison building boom began a decade ago, a 
fact McClintock attributes to the power of the California Correctional Peace 
Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has wanted to take on the prison guards," McClintock said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union endorsed McClintock's opponent, Democrat Kathleen Connell, donating 
$10,000 so far to her campaign. Connell said she intends to intensely audit all 
departments, with no particular emphasis on the Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the problem is just in Corrections," Connell said. "It's an 
institutional problem. We saw government growing without any controls. I wasn't 
in Sacramento, so I don't know why that happened."

UC OFFICIALS CALL FACULTY UNDERPAID; EDUCATION: PROFESSORS ARE LEAVING AT A 
FASTER RATE AND IT IS MORE DIFFICULT FOR CAMPUSES TO STAY COMPETITIVE. FOR 
FIRST TIME IN A DECADE, THERE ARE NO PLANS FOR RAISING STUDENT FEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 University of California officials on Thursday painted a picture of a faculty 
that is underpaid, fraught with tension over salary disparities and leaving for 
jobs in other colleges and universities like never before. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of the UC Board of Regents, the officials also described how 
recruiting quality faculty was increasingly difficult and said that minority 
teachers were being plucked from the UC system almost as quickly as they are 
hired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we can do more for our faculty, there are hard times ahead for us," 
Regent Roy Brophy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion of faculty problems came on the day that the regents were 
presented with budget proposals for the coming year that for the first time in 
a decade did not include a call for raising student fees. During the past five 
years, student fees have increased from $1,634 to $4,072. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommended budget asks for an extra $145 million in addition to the $1.83 
billion being allotted to the system this year, with UC officials saying the 
increase should be enough to stabilize the system. Much of that money is 
earmarked for salary increases. The budget will be voted on by the regents in 
November and forwarded to the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 In his opening remarks, UC President Jack Peltason said salary increases rank 
among the highest of priorities because the system has fallen behind the pay of 
comparable schools by about 9%. The average salary for a UC professor is about 
$65,000 per year. Entry level pay is $35,900 per year and the top salary, 
excluding medical doctors and a few other professional categories, is $135,000 
per year.  
</P>
<P>
 "A salary lag of this magnitude is virtually certain to bring down the quality 
of our programs in the long run unless we take action to correct it," Peltason 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most dramatic examples of what other schools are offering came 
from Scott Waugh, dean of social sciences at UCLA. He described how UCLA has 
been faced with several cases in which the kind of money being offered 
elsewhere to a professor was astounding. 
</P>
<P>
 In one, the school recently lost a geography professor to the University of 
North Carolina. The professor, who made $72,000 a year at UCLA, was paid a 
$100,000 base salary, another $67,000 for summer work, $27,000 more in various 
stipends, plus $7,000 for each course he teaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Waugh said he is now in negotiations with a sociologist who is being offered 
$167,000 in salary, a yearly $50,000 research fund and $20,000 for equipment. 
Waugh said the professor's UCLA salary is $70,700 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Members of the faculty are not stampeding to leave," Waugh said. "However, 
there does come a point where a rational economic calculation kicks in and 
says, 'I am losing too much by staying.' " 
</P>
<P>
 University officials said the cost of living in California was a deterrent to 
recruiting faculty members, while raids on the UC system were becoming 
increasingly common. 
</P>
<P>
 "Raids by other universities have increased and target the best and brightest 
of our faculty and especially our minority faculty," said Marjorie C. Caserio, 
vice chancellor for academic affairs at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The regents were clearly alarmed by the faculty issue. "The world is filled 
with universities and this one is unique in its excellence," Regent Dean 
Watkins said. "If we lose that, we've lost everything."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; INSURANCE COMMISSIONER; AGENTS URGE CLIENTS TO BACK 
QUACKENBUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of letters and telephone calls are going out from insurance agents 
to their customers urging the election of Republican Assemblyman Charles W. 
Quackenbush for insurance commissioner -- and drawing bitter criticism from the 
outgoing commissioner, Democrat John Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement this week, Garamendi contended that the new effort will 
backfire, just as in the "war of insurance initiatives" in 1988 when the 
industry fought against Proposition 103 while promoting ballot measures of its 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the people know and understand that the insurance industry is not 
trustworthy," Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has their own personal experience. Everybody is going to be 
questioning why the companies and agents are doing so much to support 
Quackenbush. The answer is perfectly clear: They want their own lackey in the 
insurance commissioner's office." 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush spokeswoman Lynn Anderson said: "I think it's very unfortunate 
that Commissioner Garamendi has chosen to single out a segment of our small 
business community for such ridicule. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people involved in supporting Chuck Quackenbush for insurance 
commissioner know and understand that it is precisely this anti-business 
attitude on the part of the commissioner and his handpicked candidate, (state 
Sen.) Art Torres, that has brought the economy in California and the attitude 
of the voters to its present dismal state." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, Quackenbush's Democratic opponent, said: "I think it's a sad day in 
California when the industry still arrogantly thinks they can buy their own 
commissioner." 
</P>
<P>
 Central to the dispute is the Allstate Co., the state's third-largest auto 
insurer, with 1,550 agents and 2.5 million active auto and other policies. It 
has directly encouraged its agents to send out pro-Quackenbush letters and 
participate in telephone banks.  
</P>
<P>
 Allstate reports obtained by The Times show that a considerable number of 
agents have responded to the request from the company's California political 
action group. The reports show that Allstate is suggesting that, in making 
their phone calls, agents identify themselves as representing the Peace 
Officers Research Assn. of California rather than Allstate. 
</P>
<P>
 Letters have also gone out from independent and State Farm agents, but State 
Farm says it is neutral in the race and has not encouraged its agents to write. 
Another company, Farmers Insurance, has urged its agents to give money to 
Quackenbush, but has not suggested that they write to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 State Farm is California's largest auto insurance seller, while Farmers is 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, recalling that he fined Allstate $1 million for misconduct toward 
its policyholders after the Oakland Hills fire, charged that Allstate has 
intervened in the race because it wants a commissioner who will not fine the 
company again. 
</P>
<P>
 Quackenbush spokeswoman Anderson acknowledged that the Republican's campaign 
has provided some of the language for sample letters Allstate sent to its 
agents. But she said apart from that, the effort is independent of Quackenbush. 
</P>
<P>
 Delia Chilgren, head of the Allstate political action group, said that 
although Allstate "is encouraging our people to get involved" in the contest, 
"there's nothing here that intends to be coercive" and that an agent is free to 
back Torres without reprisal. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents are being asked, however, to report back what they do, and company 
documents indicate that one criterion for evaluating the performance of 
Allstate agents is the extent to which they respond to suggestions for such 
outside activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Susan Foster, a State Farm agent in South Pasadena who has sent 
pro-Quackenbush letters to her customers, said she and other State Farm agents 
had not received any instructions from their company. 
</P>
<P>
 "From where I'm sitting, the insurance industry is in total turmoil," she 
said. "We need to have a commissioner with a personal interest in cleaning up 
this mess, and it's pretty obvious to us that Quackenbush is our best bet." 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Rosenfield, author of Proposition 103 and head of a group that seeks 
its full enforcement, said this week that a review showed that since the 
beginning of 1991, Quackenbush has received $935,855 in contributions from 
industry members. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenfield said he has information that the industry "may give $2 million more 
before Election Day in an all-out $3-million attempt to buy the office." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Rosenfield, Quackenbush campaign manager Greg Butler responded: 
"If there are plans by the insurance industry to put $2 million into our 
campaign, I'd be interested in knowing." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler did not deny that Quackenbush has gotten $935,855 from insurers.

NEIGHBORS BLOCKADE SLUDGE MOUNTAIN; ENVIRONMENT: A DISPUTE OVER NATIVE AMERICAN 
PROPERTY RIGHTS DIVIDES MEMBERS OF A TRIBE IN THE COACHELLA VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If this were suburbia, the battle among neighbors might be conducted in a more 
conventional way: in court or at City Hall or through the homeowners 
association. 
</P>
<P>
 But here in the Coachella Valley, angry residents -- reinforced by 
out-of-towners -- have blockaded a neighbor's property since Monday, erected 
overnight tent encampments and staged passionate Native American ceremonial 
dances under the full moon. 
</P>
<P>
 The protests are aimed at Geraldine Ibanez, a member of the Torres-Martinez 
band of Desert Cahuilla Indians, who decided to make a buck off her 120 acres. 
She is leasing the land to companies that have found the hot, dry desert valley 
a great place to bake the tar-like sludge from Southern California sewage 
treatment plants into fertilizer for farms and back-yard gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Ibanez's neighbors -- her fellow tribal members -- say they resent the 
smell, flies, dust and sight of the sludge. Most galling to them is a 
250-yard-long pile as high as the date palms that grow a few miles away. Locals 
call that heap Mount San Diego, in droll recognition of the source of the 
sludge. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest has pitted members of the Torres-Martinez tribe against one 
another in a pitched debate over Native American property rights. And the 
round-the-clock blockade has attracted support from the United Farm Workers, 
Greenpeace, the American Indian Movement and even a local school board member 
who worries about school buses passing by the site. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is just who, exactly, can tell Ibanez how to use her property. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibanez -- who lives on her husband's reservation near Temecula more than 50 
miles away -- contends that she can do as she pleases with her land. Although 
most reservation land in the country is held in trust by the federal government 
for tribes to govern and allocate to its members, some Native Americans -- 
including members of the small Torres-Martinez tribe -- were awarded land in 
their own individual names, essentially as homesteaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "These allotments were given out by the (federal Bureau of Indian Affairs) to 
individual tribal members, and nobody can interfere with our right to do with 
it what we want," said tribal member Kim Lawson, who supports Ibanez's 
position. "Some of us are worried that if the tribe can stop one individual 
from operating a business, what's to stop them from preventing others from 
doing the same? We treasure that freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 But George Auclair, spokesman for the tribal council, says such individual 
freedom can only stretch so far before the tribe must step in. "She doesn't 
need our permission for a little business, but the tribe has to decide whether 
something this big is OK," he said. "And we wouldn't have allowed this if we 
knew it was going to grow so large." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem here, though, is that no written rules exist within the 
Torres-Martinez tribe on how to resolve such disputes. It has no constitution 
and resolves disputes through customs and traditions that have been passed down 
over the years, Auclair said. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic, unwritten tribal policy, he said, "is that you can do what you want 
on your property as long as it doesn't bother other people or the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Muddying the debate is whether the tribal council's opposition to Ibanez has 
the support of the entire voting membership of the tribe, which has about 180 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawson said that at a general tribal meeting last spring, a majority of voting 
members supported Ibanez's business -- a decision that, he said, the sitting 
tribal council has ignored. And he protests that the tribal council has refused 
to call a full tribal meeting since then, to again poll its members on its 
sentiments about sludge. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the tribal council fired off a letter to the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, asking it to stop the sludge-drying operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the Bureau of Indian Affairs ordered the operation to cease, but the 
operator refused and there has been no enforcement. The closure was ordered not 
over the issue of whether the land use violated local tribal policy, but 
because Ibanez's land lease with the sludge company had not received federal 
approval and because the sludge operation had not undergone an environmental 
assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibanez's lawyer refused to be quoted for the record on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Smith, deputy area director for the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 
Sacramento, said the agency has since received a proposed lease between Ibanez 
and Terra Farms Inc. for the sludge operation. The bureau is seeking guidance 
from the White House Council on Environmental Quality on whether to approve the 
lease even before an environmental assessment of the sludge site is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 If the site passes environmental muster, he said, the bureau is likely to lift 
its cease-and-desist order and allow the operation, at least until the 
environmental tests are reviewed. But if the Council on Environmental Quality 
insists that no business lease be approved until the environmental assessment 
is completed, the operation will be ordered closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the tribe has the authority to govern land use on the reservation 
-- but the tribe has no written laws in place to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is dispute within the tribe itself about this issue," Smith 
acknowledged. "Not all the people in the tribe are opposed to it. The blockade 
involves only a handful of tribal members; the rest are from San Francisco or 
Washington state . . . or other places." 
</P>
<P>
 Terra Farms took over the operation after another company, which had dried 
sludge on Ibanez's property since 1990, went bankrupt and, according to Terra 
Farms President Jay Houston, left the property a mess. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribe tolerated the previous sludge company until subsequent ground-water 
tests, done after the first company left the site, detected the presence of 
heavy metals and fecal coliform bacteria. The tests also showed high levels of 
nitrates and salts that already plague the Coachella Valley's water supply 
because of years of heavy agricultural use. 
</P>
<P>
 But Houston maintains that someone sabotaged the wells by dumping sludge 
directly into them, and that more recent water monitoring tests by his company 
show no underground water contamination. The EPA conducted its own tests, and 
the results are expected to be released any day. 
</P>
<P>
 To help mend bad tribal feelings, Houston said, he would remove the unsightly 
Mount San Diego sludge, which was created by the previous operator, to a West 
Covina landfill. If he is kicked off the property, Houston said, the huge 
sludge pile will just remain a blight on the desert landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten trucks carried 210 tons of the sludge off the site Monday -- just before 
the blockade was established. Remaining are about 500,000 tons of sludge, which 
has lost too much of its nutrient content to be of value anymore as fertilizer, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the blockade has stopped the daily delivery of 1,000 tons of sludge 
to Ibanez's land. Instead it is being trucked to more distant drying sites or 
is simply being dumped in urban landfills by hauling companies.

 Auclair, the tribal council spokesman, pledges that the blockade will continue 
for as long as it takes to shut down Terra Farms. And when it does, he said, he 
hopes the Bureau of Indian Affairs will clean up Mount San Diego "or San Diego 
will come up here and take its (sludge) back."

THE WASHINGTON CONNECTION / JAMES BORNEMEIER: A GLEEFUL TIME SPANKING THE 
DEMOCRATS

 Looking down from the House press gallery, it was clear which side was having 
fun. The Republicans were grinning and coltish. The Democrats were slumped and 
grumpy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the House has no filibuster rules, the Republicans were luxuriating 
in the next best thing: whacking the shins of the California Desert Protection 
Act with a superbly mounted barrage of delaying tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue was sending the House-Senate version of the massive land use bill to 
a conference committee, usually a routine matter approved by voice vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Speaker, I move to table the previous question," said Rep. Jerry Lewis 
(R-Redlands), archfoe of the desert bill and jovial ringmaster of what would 
prove to be a five-hour stellar performance of parliamentary nit-picking. 
</P>
<P>
 A psychic groan rolled through the chamber as another roll-call vote was 
forced by the ebullient Republicans, who eye-winked and back-patted 
conspiratorially. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the minority party, it doesn't get any better than this. Even though the 
Republicans knew they would eventually run out of these mischievous maneuvers, 
those imperious Democrats would surely know they've been in an alley fight. 
</P>
<P>
 When their day was done, the desert bill foes were able to force 
time-consuming roll calls an amazing 12 times -- a virtually unprecedented 
attack on a single piece of legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the California desert bill went on to pass Congress and awaits the 
President's signature, its near-death experience exemplifies the nasty, crabby 
and downright mean-spirited partisanship that has virtually paralyzed 
legislators.  
</P>
<P>
 And this happened to legislation that both houses, by comfortable margins, 
actually wanted to pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody must have slept with the rule book last night," observed a House 
press gallery staffer. 
</P>
<P>
 But delaying tactics have been part of congressional give-and-take since the 
beginning. The Senate was only 6 months old in 1789 when opponents slowed down 
consideration of a bill to locate the nation's capital on the Susquehanna 
River. The first full-blown filibusters were unfurled in 1841 over the 
appointment of the official Senate printers. 
</P>
<P>
 The House, with no similar tradition of unlimited debate, nonetheless can be 
slowed to a crawl by an exhaustive imposition of all procedural votes -- a la 
the desert bill. 
</P>
<P>
 And although the clear goal is to hinder legislation, such delaying tactics do 
provide the minority a chance to showcase viewpoints that the majority has 
little interest in. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis and his fellow Republicans said that throwing a dozen parliamentary 
monkey wrenches at the desert bill was the only recourse against an 
irresponsible, power-drunk majority that dismissed GOP sentiments on the 
legislation, railroaded it through the House and was hellbent on bargaining 
away their hard-won amendments in conference deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Pish, said Democrats. All you Republicans want is to deny Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein, the desert bill's chief sponsor, a legislative victory to bring home 
to her rocky reelection campaign -- and you'll stoop to the basest procedural 
shenanigans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If this sounds more like nonsense than government, bear in mind that, come 
November, it may be the Democrats who will be conducting such rear-guard 
actions against ruling Republicans. That is why the arcane rules stay in the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis' attack on the desert bill earlier this month used some of this stealth 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 A staffer on the House Natural Resources Committee, chaired by desert bill 
champion Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), alerted reporters that a room in the 
Capitol had been reserved for 2 p.m. for the House and Senate conferees to iron 
out their differences.  
</P>
<P>
 This suggested that Lewis and company were not expected to contest Miller's 
scheduled midday vote to move the bill to conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we get (to conference), we must dance the dance of legislation," 
Miller said on the House floor, perhaps with crossed fingers, "and I would hope 
that all of my colleagues would understand and give us a little bit of 
tolerance they have left in this session of the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Right. 
</P>
<P>
 A tired Miller finally did get to that Capitol meeting room, but not until 
nearly 7 p.m., pushing further action on the bill into the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis and his comrades had lost the war, but won the battle. Yes, the bill was 
on its way to passage, but the Democrats had been righteously spanked, their 
power mocked, their timetable thrown off. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, a good day's work.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS; GOVERNOR; BROWN ASSAILS WILSON OVER COLLEGE FEE HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHLEEN DECKER, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown, moving quickly to frame newly proposed college fee 
increases as a political liability for Gov. Pete Wilson, said Thursday that the 
Republican incumbent had engineered such hikes as hidden tax increases on the 
middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hastily arranged appearance in front of the Long Beach headquarters for 
the California State University system, Brown said that as governor she would 
refuse the proposed 10% fee increase voted upon by CSU trustees two hours 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees did not formalize the increase, saying they would prefer that the 
Legislature and the governor find enough money to cover their shortfall for the 
coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1995-96 fees for undergraduate students would rise to $1,740 if the 
increase is implemented, up from $1,584 this year. Graduate fees would rise to 
$1,830. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a system that used to be affordable and accessible for all," said 
Brown, whose father, Edmund G. (Pat) Brown, was instrumental in developing the 
state's university system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it isn't affordable and it isn't accessible anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has long derided Wilson for the dramatic fee increases that have 
occurred during his term as governor, and she has gained substantial support 
from college students who are angry over the high cost of education.  
</P>
<P>
 Her effort Thursday was meant to broaden that support beyond students who vote 
in low numbers to their more dependable -- politically speaking -- parents. She 
targeted her arguments toward the "middle class," a term she repeated several 
times, and cast them along classic Republican lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just another example of Pete Wilson trying to levy yet another tax on 
middle-class Californians," she said. "As we all know, these so-called fee 
increases are really simply hidden tax increases, hidden tax increases on 
middle-class families who are trying to send their kids to college." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson spokesman Dan Schnur sharply rebuked Brown for criticizing the fee 
increases in an election year when, he said, she had not objected previously. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she has any evidence of any lobbying she did, any letters she wrote, any 
written correspondence, we'd love to see it," he said. "What Kathleen Brown 
didn't say today is how she would pay for this fee increase: She would raise 
taxes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who has sworn she will not raise taxes, contended that Wilson's support 
for past fee increases and her refusal to allow them next year signaled a clear 
demarcation between the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The incumbent governor believes California can solve problems by raising 
taxes and fees," she said. "I think we've got to cut, not tax." 
</P>
<P>
 Such conservative language is meant to attract the ear not only of 
tuition-paying parents but also moderate voters who may be fearful of 
stereotypes about Democratic spending and Republican thriftiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is targeting those same voters with television commercials alleging 
that Brown would sharply increase taxes if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 In seeking to turn party stereotypes on their ear, Brown faces an uphill 
struggle: In Los Angeles Times polls taken in September and early October, 
voters rated Wilson as the candidate best equipped to handle the economy. He 
also was rated better than Brown on fighting crime and grappling with illegal 
immigration. Brown's strength was seen as the subject she addressed Thursday: 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic nominee, when pressed by reporters, said she would be able to 
fund education at current levels without harming any other state programs 
because she would generate savings through a performance review of all state 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown says that such a review would pinpoint $5 billion in savings over four 
years. Since the review has not been undertaken, she cannot say specifically 
where the savings would occur, but insisted Thursday that she was confident of 
finding the excess. 
</P>
<P>
 "My budget plan does not contemplate fee increases at community colleges and 
CSU next year, and I'll be fighting to hold the line," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her brief remarks, which were applauded by a few college students gathered 
nearby, Brown cited college system studies that blamed Wilson-era budget cuts 
for slicing 5,000 courses out of the CSU schools. In the last three years, as 
fees have risen 130%, nearly 200,000 students have dropped out of the state's 
colleges and universities, including 30,000 CSU students, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur, however, countered that the University of California system recently 
reported record high enrollments, suggesting that higher fees have not 
dissuaded students there.

PIPELINES BURST, IGNITING TEXAS RIVER; 69 HURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two pipelines beneath a roiling river burst Thursday, sending 100-foot flames 
of burning gasoline snaking more than a mile down the San Jacinto River. At 
least 69 people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like hell opened up on the water and the whole river was gasoline," 
said Mike Norman, who was on the bank trying to retrieve his sailboat when the 
explosion occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Skies were clearing, the murky water had begun to recede in most areas, and 
some of the 11,500 evacuees had started returning to their damaged homes when 
the pipeline broke east of Houston, sending smoke and flame hundreds of feet 
into the air. The flooding has claimed at least 15 lives since heavy rain 
started Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The burning mixture wound 1 1/2 miles downstream, setting fire to homes and 
boats along the banks. Schools and businesses in the path of the smoke were 
evacuated. Most of the injured were treated for smoke inhalation. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion occurred near "The Spaghetti Bowl," the mouth of the nation's 
interstate pipeline network. A second pipeline ruptured around 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena surveyed the scene by helicopter 
and said the blast was likely caused by the rain-swollen river. The flooding 
since Sunday has claimed at least 15 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The two pipelines, about 8 feet apart, are buried about 3 feet beneath the 
floor of the river, said Sam Whitehead, spokesman for Atlanta-based Colonial 
Pipeline, which owns both lines. 
</P>
<P>
 They run beneath the river for about 2 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 The first line, 40 inches in diameter, carries gasoline from nearby Pasadena 
to New Jersey. The second line, 36 inches in diameter, carries No. 2 diesel 
fuel, Whitehead said. Whitehead said the company doesn't know what caused the 
ruptures or how many gallons of fuel spilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency crews had trouble putting out the fire because their boats could not 
handle the swirling river currents and fire trucks were blocked by flooded 
roads, said Coast Guard Cmdr. Eric Nicholas. Most of the fire was out by 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said they shut off valves on either side of the 40-inch 
pipeline after noticing a drop in pipeline pressure.

U.S. CHALLENGES BAR TO SEIZURE OF FELONS' ASSETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department Thursday urged the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to 
reverse a unanimous ruling that bars the government from taking the criminal 
proceeds of convicted felons on grounds that doing so violates the 
constitutional guarantee against double jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a petition for rehearing filed with the court in Los Angeles, U.S. Atty. 
Norma M. Manella said that the Sept. 6, 1994, ruling by Judge Stephen 
Reinhardt, supported by two colleagues, "will gravely impair the government's 
ability to enforce civil forfeiture remedies as intended by Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling came in the case of James Wren and Charles Arlt, who after being 
convicted of methamphetamine manufacturing, money laundering and conspiracy, 
were ordered in a civil proceeding to forfeit bank account funds, automobiles, 
silver bars, a helicopter and a ship. 
</P>
<P>
 The two -- both serving sentences at Lompoc federal prison -- appealed, saying 
that the forfeiture was double jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 In defending against the double jeopardy appeal, the government cited rulings 
by federal circuit courts in New York and Atlanta which held that a civil 
forfeiture and the underlying criminal case were part of "a single, coordinated 
prosecution" and thus not double jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 9th Circuit panel, which included Judge Cecil Poole and senior 
district court Judge Jack Tanner, said that reasoning "contradicts controlling 
Supreme Court precedent as well as common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 "We fail to see how two separate actions, one civil and one criminal, 
instituted at different times, tried at different times before different fact 
finders, presided over by different district judges and resolved by separate 
judgments, constitute the same 'proceeding,' " the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Justice Department source said that the ruling could lead to an undetermined 
number of convicted criminals seeking to overturn their convictions and would 
force the government to limit its use of civil forfeiture in the 9th Circuit, 
which includes California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, Montana, Nevada, Idaho, 
Hawaii and Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 If the full 9th Circuit declines to reconsider the case or, in the end, 
decides against the government, an appeal to the Supreme Court would be likely 
because of the split in circuit court holdings on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The government said that the 9th Circuit panel had misconstrued a 1989 Supreme 
Court ruling by holding that all actions brought under the civil forfeiture 
statutes in the Los Angeles case constitute "punishment" and thus may not be 
imposed on an already convicted defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department said that the 1989 ruling held that such civil action 
sanctions against an already convicted defendant constitute a second punishment 
only in "rare circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress has clearly expressed its intent by repeatedly authorizing the 
government to pursue both criminal and civil sanctions in parallel actions," 
Manella argued in the rehearing petition.

GULF WAR SYNDROME MAY BE CONTAGIOUS, SURVEY SHOWS; HEALTH: RESULTS OF 
GOVERNMENT STUDY FIND SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF VETERANS' SPOUSES, CHILDREN 
EXHIBITING SYMPTOMS OF THE MYSTERIOUS ILLNESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Preliminary results from a new survey have raised suspicions that the 
mysterious illnesses that have afflicted more than 20,000 Persian Gulf War 
veterans since their return home may be contagious, Senate sources said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Responses from the first 400 of a planned 1,000 servicemen and women to be 
polled has found that some of the symptoms, known collectively as Gulf War 
syndrome, also have affected 78% of their spouses and 25% of their children who 
were born before the 1991 operation, according to an aide to Sen. Donald W. 
Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs 
Committee, which is conducting the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, of those responding, 65% of children born after the veterans' return are 
suffering chronic health problems, said the committee official, who declined to 
be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be the result of a virus or bacteria" acquired in the gulf, "or it 
is possible that some chemical exposure could have depressed their (the 
veterans') immune systems" making it easier to become infected with an organism 
and, subsequently, to transmit that organism to a family member, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the children affected, those born after the war appear to be suffering from 
chronic infections, including respiratory, yeast, sinus, ear and others, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These children are being born with these infections," he said, which is 
puzzling because "they're in a sterile environment until and when they are 
born." 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Defense officials said they are aware that family members also 
have become sick but insisted that they have not yet been able to find a 
scientific link to Gulf War participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are aware of these complaints," said Col. Doug Hart, a Pentagon spokesman. 
"We don't take them lightly. But at this point we have not been able to 
establish a scientific link -- we cannot come to any conclusion that they are, 
or are not, related." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Howard, a spokesman for the federal Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention, which is working with the Pentagon and the Veterans Affairs 
Department, said that "we do not have a definitive infectious agent linked to 
birth defects or illness in the veterans or their family members," although the 
possibility has not been ruled out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to make any snap decisions or quick judgments," Howard added. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 20,000 or more of the nearly 700,000 troops who served in the 
Persian Gulf four years ago have reported numerous ailments, including fatigue, 
skin rashes, muscle and joint pain, headaches, memory loss, shortness of breath 
and gastrointestinal problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Their complaints have prompted a series of investigations that thus far have 
yielded no definitive conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Banking Committee study -- which is not expected to be completed until the 
end of the year -- asks both veterans and spouses a series of questions about 
symptoms that they have experienced or have seen in their offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We even threw in a couple of 'ringers' (questions about symptoms that are not 
among those considered part of the syndrome)," the Riegle aide said, and the 
responses thus far have been consistent, meaning that no one claims to be 
suffering from ailments that have not been among those previously reported. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the responses received thus far indicate that spouses and children 
born before the war are experiencing some -- but not all -- of the symptoms 
that have afflicted the veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will have 3 or 4 or 5 of them, whereas the vet may have 18," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He emphasized that the committee survey is not intended to "be a medical 
study," but "to prompt a medical study." 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless a preliminary investigation is done, a medical investigation will 
never be done," he added. "We want to put some hard numbers in front of the 
medical community and say: 'Hey, we've got to deal with this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said the Pentagon also is conducting a survey of 700,000 individuals, 
half of whom served in the gulf and, for comparison purposes, half of whom did 
not to "see if there are any statistically significant differences" in their 
health status. 
</P>
<P>
 No single substance or organism has been identified as the cause of the health 
problems suffered by Desert Storm veterans. But many of the troops were exposed 
to a variety of potentially toxic chemicals, such as fumes and smoke from oil 
well fires, diesel fumes, toxic paints, pesticides and depleted uranium used in 
munitions and armor. They were also given three drugs, including one to prevent 
the effects of chemical warfare, which many have blamed on their health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The drugs given soldiers included pyridostigmine bromide, a drug to protect 
against chemical warfare, which has known gastrointestinal side effects and 
which is licensed only for the treatment of myasthenia gravis, a chronic muscle 
weakness disorder; an as yet unapproved vaccine to combat botulism, and a 
licensed vaccine to protect against anthrax. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the three are being administered to soldiers serving in the current 
deployment.

EUROPE; SERB PRESIDENT GETTING REWARDS DESPITE DEFIANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the rush to reward Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for his pledge to 
be a partner in the search for Balkan peace, Western governments have swept 
aside evidence of his flouting of the outside world's will and conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider these acts of defiance, which once spurred Western outrage but now go 
unmentioned in diplomatic exchanges: 
</P>
<P>
 * Serbian government officials have failed to repatriate two kidnaped American 
children known to be held in Serbia, despite eight court decisions ordering 
them returned immediately to their mother in California. 
</P>
<P>
 * Human rights monitors from the 53-nation Conference on Security and 
Cooperation in Europe continue to be barred from the volatile Serbian regions 
of Kosovo, Vojvodina and Sandjzak -- the very regions where Balkan turmoil 
threatens to spread. 
</P>
<P>
 * Banished from Yugoslavia in April, 14 foreign correspondents, including one 
from the Los Angeles Times, remain unable to enter the country in which 
Milosevic wields unchallenged power. 
</P>
<P>
 Shayna Gluck -- whose children Sasha Lazarevich, 12, and Andre Lazarevich, 9, 
were seized from Santa Cruz by her ex-husband five years ago -- says she is 
astounded that the United States would help reward Milosevic when Washington's 
entreaties for her children's release have been ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 American and Yugoslav courts have consistently ruled in Gluck's favor on her 
claim to full custody of the children. The U.S. government and its embassy in 
Belgrade have pressed her appeals to find and return the children, taken after 
a September, 1989, weekend outing in Santa Cruz by their father, Dragisa 
Lazarevich. 
</P>
<P>
 But earlier this month, the Serbian Justice Ministry informed the top U.S. 
diplomat in Belgrade that a Belgrade court had temporarily reassigned custody 
to the father on the advice of a "team of experts" who had examined and 
interviewed the children at a time and site Serbian officials refused to 
reveal. 
</P>
<P>
 Gluck has now been told by U.S. authorities to pursue her search through the 
Serbian legal system. 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic, considered the mastermind of the deadly wars that have racked the 
Balkans since 1991, made a break with his Bosnian Serb proxies in August, 
proclaiming a cutoff of all fuel and military aid until they sign a peace plan. 
He turned on his longtime allies at the encouragement of the Contact Group, the 
mediation effort waged by diplomats from the United States, Russia, Britain, 
France and Germany. The Contact Group had hinted that there might be relief 
from a May, 1992, economic embargo imposed on Serb-led Yugoslavia for 
instigating the Bosnian war. 
</P>
<P>
 A month after Milosevic's much-heralded break with Bosnian Serb rebels, and 
despite assertions by Defense Secretary William J. Perry that the blockade was 
less than ironclad, the U.N. Security Council reinstated air travel, sports and 
cultural contacts in reward for Milosevic's proclaimed support for the Contact 
Group's peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 That international effort to force Bosnian Serbs to capitulate has also 
muffled the European security conference's desire to return human rights 
monitors to Serbian trouble spots. Milosevic had the monitors expelled last 
year after they issued reports documenting systematic abuses of the rights of 
minority Albanians, Hungarians and Muslims living in Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Western concern about press freedom and security has also been heightened. 
Earlier this month, the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists was 
preparing an appeal to the Yugoslav government for restoration of press 
credentials lifted from 14 Western journalists in April in retaliation for a 
NATO air strike against Bosnian Serb rebels attacking the U.N. "safe haven" of 
Gorazde. U.N. Sanctions in the Balkans 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations restricted travel and trade in an effort to end the war in 
the Balkans. As a reward for Slobodan Milosevic's peace efforts, the U.N. 
Security Council later lifted some sanctions in the rump Yugoslavia. FORMER

PROBE INDICATES AMATEURS PLOTTED ASSASSINATION OF MEXICAN POLITICIAN; LATIN 
AMERICA: HIRED GUNS SKIPPED TOWN WITH THOUSANDS FROM ALLEGED RINGLEADERS IN 
KILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 All Carmelo Herrera Gomez knew when his lover summoned him to meet a 
well-connected businessman at a cheap Mexico City hotel in June was that it 
involved "a matter of a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 When he got there, according to Herrera's sworn testimony released Thursday, 
he learned that he would have to kill for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The target: Francisco Ruiz Massieu. The reward: nearly $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At the prodding of his girlfriend, Herrera agreed. It was not until several 
days later, Herrera stated, that he learned that his prospective target was no 
less than the second-ranking official in Mexico's powerful ruling political 
party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too risky," Herrera decided, and he fled, along with his girlfriend and tens 
of thousands of dollars in prospective blood money. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the latest testimony made public, that was the second time the 
alleged masterminds of a killing that rocked Mexico last month were burned by 
hired guns who skipped town with their money. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was the latest evidence that the political aides and underworld figures 
now charged with plotting Ruiz Massieu's murder here on Sept. 28 were amateurs, 
at best. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the hundreds of pages of testimony that the government is 
accumulating under the direction of Ruiz Massieu's brother, Mario, who is 
heading the investigation for Mexico's attorney general's office, it is nothing 
short of amazing that the assassination took place at all. 
</P>
<P>
 After several hired killers backed out and disappeared with hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in cash in the spring during the two previous attempts to 
have Ruiz Massieu killed, the man who finally carried out the job nearly 
failed: The assassin's Tec-9 pistol jammed after he got off a single shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, the testimony indicates, one of the co-conspirators who had 
attempted to hire Herrera and his girlfriend -- and the others before them -- 
was easily traced to the home of his mistress. 
</P>
<P>
 He had forgotten to get a visa to use a plane ticket that he said he had been 
given to escape to France. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of fugitive ruling-party legislator Manuel Munoz Rocha, a 
key suspect who continues to elude a nationwide dragnet and an FBI hunt in the 
United States, most of those identified as the principal co-conspirators in 
Ruiz Massieu's slaying are now in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that same amateurish plotting, it seems, that has allowed Deputy 
Prosecutor General Mario Ruiz Massieu to reconstruct his brother's killing with 
such methodical ease. 
</P>
<P>
 More difficult for the veteran prosecutor as he assembles the testimony of 
more than a dozen accused conspirators -- some of it implicating key members of 
his own ruling party -- has been the political tightrope he has had to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to charges from leaders of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, or PRI, that his daily disclosures of suspects' sworn statements have 
been "inappropriate," the prosecutor strenuously and emotionally defended 
himself at a news conference Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruiz Massieu said the decision to publicize the testimony is essential for a 
"fed-up society that wants to know the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Unstated but clearly implied is widespread public dissatisfaction with the 
progress of another high-profile investigation -- the probe into the March 
slaying of ruling-party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, which 
officially is still blamed on a single gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 A former deputy prosecutor has suggested a nexus between Mexican narcotics 
traffickers and corrupt, hard-line politicians behind the slaying of Colosio. 
Like Ruiz Massieu, Colosio cast himself as a ruling-party reformer. 
</P>
<P>
 During his news conference, Mario Ruiz Massieu said he was open to suggestions 
that a similar link was behind his brother's killing. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, Ruiz Massieu found himself facing widely publicized 
concerns that his own party loyalties -- and his political future -- could 
overwhelm his desire to uncover the extent of the conspiracy behind his 
brother's killing. If the plot to kill his reform-minded brother goes much 
higher than a single renegade legislator, critics say Ruiz Massieu may be 
reluctant to pursue it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither lies, malicious plots nor slander" will deter the probe, he declared, 
adding: "We are investigating presumed criminals independently of their 
political affiliation. It has been said that I will trade my future in exchange 
for a subsequent political position. This is false and insulting." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the prosecutor denied charges that his investigation has become 
increasingly confused and bogged down in minutiae. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no confusion about anything," he said. "And in any case, the advance 
of the investigation will clarify doubts." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans and outsiders alike, though, are confused by the intricate web of 
relationships among the accused co-plotters. Among the 15 men and women caught 
so far in the prosecutor's net are various sets of brothers, lovers, couples 
and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 At the core of the plot that prosecutors have presented to the public are 
three brothers named Rodriguez Gonzalez: Fernando, Jorge and Marco Antonio. 
Fernando was a legislative aide to the renegade Munoz Rocha, whom all three 
brothers say ordered Ruiz Massieu's killing and offered $1 million for the job 
as long ago as 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the brothers have further testified that Fernando initially 
used Marco as his front man, the original recruiter who hired Herrera and his 
girlfriend to kill not only Ruiz Massieu but also the other hired guns who had 
fled with advance payments. 
</P>
<P>
 When Herrera and his lover disappeared, the Rodriguez Gonzalez family closed 
ranks. Fernando's wife and her family were brought in on the plot, which some 
of their testimony indicates went from targeting Francisco Ruiz Massieu and the 
previous hired guns to include an extensive hit list. On that roster were the 
names of other senior ruling-party officials who favored reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, testimony indicates, Fernando turned to his brother Jorge to recruit 
the assassin and purchase weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
 They bought the machine pistol for about $600 and an AK-47 assault rifle for 
about $1,300 from a rural police officer in their home state of Tamaulipas. The 
police officer is now in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge later confessed in sworn testimony that for $15,000, he enlisted Daniel 
Aguilar Trevino, a ranch hand from Tamaulipas, to fire a full clip from the 
9-millimeter machine pistol into Ruiz Massieu outside a hotel in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar, the first to be arrested in the case, was tackled in the driveway of 
the Casa Blanca Hotel when the gun jammed.

MACARTHUR RETURNS AGAIN, WITH A SPLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gen. MacArthur tumbled into the surf, and the Marines were all Filipino. But 
the rest was a more exact replay of history Thursday, the 50th anniversary of 
the U.S. landing on Leyte Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Philippine marines in World War II American battle dress stormed the beach, 
while U.S. veterans exchanged memories of one of the turning points of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Four U.S. Army divisions came ashore on Oct. 20, 1944, the first main American 
landing in the campaign to recover the Philippines from the Japanese, who 
occupied Leyte in early 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 What followed was history's biggest battle of the seas. U.S. forces destroyed 
the Japanese fleet within days, but it took them six months and nearly 4,000 
American lives to gain control of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry and Gen. John M. 
Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined President Fidel V. 
Ramos in commemorating the landing on Leyte. Representatives from 10 other 
countries also took part. 
</P>
<P>
 The re-enactment might have gone off without a hitch except that Ken Metcalfe, 
the actor playing Gen. Douglas MacArthur, fell from his landing craft.

 A man from Azerbaijan was detained for trying to sell 26 ounces of 
weapons-grade uranium. Istanbul's Nuclear Research Center identified the 
material as enriched uranium-238, suitable for making nuclear bombs, Turkey's 
Anatolia news agency reported. Ramis Shageldiev, 46, who tried to sell the 
uranium for $60,000 to undercover agents, told police he had bought the uranium 
in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, Anatolia reported.

 A documentary chronicling the mercy killing of a severely debilitated man was 
shown on Dutch television in the first known filming of euthanasia in the 
Netherlands.The one-hour documentary, "Death Upon Request," told the story of 
Cees van Wendel de Joode, who suffered from the degenerative muscle disorder 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's Disease. Van Wendel 
de Joode was believed to be 55. While mercy killing is still officially illegal 
in the Netherlands, doctors are guaranteed immunity from prosecution if they 
follow the euthanasia policy, the most liberal in the industrialized world.

CHINA PLANS 'A FEW MORE' NUCLEAR TESTS; ASIA: EFFORT AIMS TO FEND OFF 
'BLACKMAIL.' BEIJING ALSO CONSIDERS COMPUTER SIMULATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 China plans to conduct "a few more" underground nuclear tests during the next 
two years, or at least until an international test ban treaty is reached, a 
senior official in the Foreign Ministry said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a little more nuclear testing just to show that we can do it, so no 
one will try to blackmail us," said the official during an unusually candid 
discussion with a few Western reporters. The "blackmail" reference dates to the 
Korean War, during which China claims that the United States threatened it with 
nuclear attack in what it termed at the time "nuclear blackmail." 
</P>
<P>
 The official, who has an extensive background in arms control negotiations, 
also said China is interested in pursuing a proposal by U.S. Secretary of 
Defense William J. Perry that it substitute computer simulation for nuclear 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said, the computer simulation procedure, while an attractive idea 
among the five major nuclear powers, faced likely opposition from non-nuclear 
countries that view it as another form of nuclear proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whereas it might be technically feasible, it may not be politically 
feasible," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, who visited China earlier this week, said in a news conference Tuesday 
that he had discussed with senior Chinese officials "ways of eliminating the 
need for testing (that) had to do with computer simulation techniques." 
</P>
<P>
 "We discussed the possibility of exchanging information in that field," Perry 
said. "To the extent we can do that without compromising security, I think that 
would be a positive step forward." 
</P>
<P>
 One objective the U.S. defense secretary set as part of his four-day visit, 
which ended Wednesday, was to dissuade the Chinese from further nuclear 
testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Oct. 5, 1993, the Chinese have conducted three underground nuclear 
tests, breaking a moratorium observed by the four other nuclear powers -- the 
United States, Britain, France and Russia. The most recent blast, estimated at 
between 40 and 150 kilotons, took place at China's remote Lop Nor testing 
ground in Xinjiang province on Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Beijing argue that since China has the fewest warheads among the 
nuclear powers, it needs the testing to close the technological gap between it 
and the four other countries. According to arms control specialists, China's 
nuclear forces are made up of about 300 warheads mounted on intermediate- and 
long-range missiles, bombers and submarines. 
</P>
<P>
 Some arms control specialists speculate that the latest round of testing is 
aimed at improving China's submarine nuclear weapons system, the only one in 
its arsenal capable of threatening targets in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials are encouraged by Chinese pledges to halt all testing by 1996, 
or even before, if a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is reached in Geneva. On 
Thursday, the senior Foreign Ministry official reaffirmed this position. 
</P>
<P>
 "China has made a political decision not to conduct nuclear tests after the 
signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he suggested that the 1996 deadline for signing the treaty may not be 
firm. "It's an artificial date just to show there is political will," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest block to the conclusion of the treaty, the official said, is U.S. 
opposition to a statement promising that it will not be the first party to use 
nuclear weapons in a conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "A U.S. commitment on non-first-use, as well as the commitment of other 
powers, would certainly help in China's participation," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The briefing for foreign reporters was the latest in a series of steps by the 
Chinese government to be more open about its nuclear programs.

RUSSIA PREMIER PUSHES TOUGH BUDGET CUTS; ECONOMY: EMBATTLED PRIME MINISTER 
SQUELCHES RUMORS OF RESIGNATION, CALLS FOR SLASHING SUBSIDIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russia's embattled prime minister scotched rumors that his Black Sea vacation 
might turn permanent with a splashy return to the Kremlin on Thursday featuring 
a super-strict fiscal plan for next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin's 1995 budget proposal, seemingly 
designed to delight Western economists and draw billions in loans, called for 
such tough cutbacks on subsidies to agriculture, defense and failing factories 
that the government could get by without borrowing from the Central Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a decisive breakthrough," Chernomyrdin told a special Cabinet 
meeting, according to the Itar-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the "Black Tuesday" collapse of the ruble last week and the 
widespread buzz about the prime minister's impending resignation, 
Chernomyrdin's very appearance in Moscow was something of a breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk of his departure had grown so persistent that one Moscow radio station 
reported it as fact, prompting indignant denials, and Vice President Al Gore 
asked about it in a phone conversation. Much was also made of Chernomyrdin's 
protocol-breaking absence during Queen Elizabeth II's visit to Russia this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday, the 56-year-old technocrat brandished the new $275-billion 
budget plan as justification for his days in sunny Sochi, and called for 
painful belt-tightening to keep Russian inflation under control. The budget has 
yet to be modified and approved by lawmakers, but the Cabinet gave it a 
preliminary nod. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget has a new ideology, according to Economics Minister Alexander N. 
Shokhin. Instead of fueling inflation by printing money to pay its debts, the 
government will cover its expenses by collecting taxes more efficiently, 
issuing bonds and attracting international loans. The proposal limits the 
budget deficit to about 8% of the gross domestic product and banks on about $8 
billion from international lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the only way in today's situation for 1995 to become a year of 
stabilization," Shokhin told Itar-Tass. Until last week, Russian leaders were 
claiming that the economy was beginning to pull out of its long post-Soviet 
dive. Then the ruble suddenly dropped in one day by about 28% against the 
dollar. From a relatively modest 6% a month, inflation shot back up to more 
than 10% a month in the first two weeks of October. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic outlook was so gloomy that many predicted President Boris N. 
Yeltsin would soon be scouting for a replacement for Chernomyrdin. In addition 
to rising inflation, unemployment is expected to hit 1.7 million -- more than 
2% of workers -- by December, an unprecedented level in this nation of former 
full employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in Moscow on Wednesday night, however, Chernomyrdin assured reporters 
that he was not going anywhere. "Frankly speaking, I don't think many people 
will want to take my place now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia may be growing more stable, but it still has a habit of going into 
spasms of political intrigue whenever Yeltsin or Chernomyrdin is away. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now that the prime minister is back, commentators expect a shake-up in 
the government to coincide with a Cabinet report and a vote of no confidence 
scheduled for Thursday in Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 One Western economic adviser here said it could well be that Chernomyrdin's 
whole push for a tough new budget was only a resignation gambit. Chernomyrdin 
is ready to quit, the adviser speculated, but he wants to be remembered as "the 
austerity prime minister" and not the man who oversaw the ruble's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seattle on Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said that 
Yeltsin's overhaul of the Finance Ministry last week apparently had stabilized 
the ruble.

AT LEAST 48 KILLED AS BUSY S. KOREA BRIDGE COLLAPSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At least 48 people were killed and many more were feared trapped underwater 
today after a bridge in central Seoul collapsed during the morning rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The central span of the four-lane Songsu bridge plunged into the Han River, 
taking with it cars, a van and at least one fully loaded city bus. Some of the 
vehicles fell about 50 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said there was no warning before the 150-foot section of the 
steel-supported bridge sheared cleanly away from the main structure and 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt the car shaking suddenly and something caving in, then I passed out," 
Kim Min Ja, a 38-year-old teacher whose car fell into the river, told Yonhap 
news agency. "When I regained consciousness, water was rushing into the car. I 
left through a broken window, swam away and was saved." 
</P>
<P>
 She was traveling with two colleagues, one of whom was rescued and another who 
was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Boats, divers and helicopters rescued about 30 people, news reports said. Some 
of the injured were put into nets and flown to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 But rescue operations were hampered by pouring rain and chaotic traffic caused 
by the closure of one of the city's busiest commuter routes. 
</P>
<P>
 On the wreckage of the collapsed span, workers lined up bodies to be ferried 
to city morgues. The fallen segment rested on the riverbed, and the road 
surface remained above the water level. The badly mangled bus, a van and two 
cars rested on it. 
</P>
<P>
 One witness said he thought at least 10 more vehicles had plunged into the 
Han, which is about 20 to 30 feet deep at that point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Songsu bridge, opened 15 years ago, is one of 17 across the Han that are 
normally packed with traffic during rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 State television said repairs were carried out on the bridge Thursday evening, 
but the structure was cleared for rush hour this morning.  
</P>
<P>
 A city official whose department oversees road repairs said the bridge was 
only being resurfaced. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said the work 
could not have caused the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Home Affairs Minister Choi Hyung Woo directed the rescue operation at the 
scene of the collapse, and President Kim Young Sam demanded a thorough 
investigation and heavy punishment for those responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago another bridge crossing the Han collapsed, but it was still 
under construction and there were no casualties.

'CHUNNEL' PR EVENT HAS TROUBLE GETTING ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was meant to be the showoff run of the new, high-speed Eurostar train under 
the English Channel from London to Paris that would relieve passengers of the 
strain of airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was a public relations disaster Thursday when the sleek train 
failed to move from Waterloo Station and had to be replaced, causing a one-hour 
delay for about 400 passengers from the media. 
</P>
<P>
 Cases of celebratory champagne and countless boxes of food had to be 
transferred from the broken-down train to its twin replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Television cameras were on hand to document the embarrassing delay as 
frustrated passengers lined up for coffee and rolls instead of rocketing 
through the countryside at speeds of up to 186 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The $38-million train was found to have an electrical fault in a circuit 
breaker in one of its power cars.  
</P>
<P>
 The highly publicized breakdown derailed Eurotunnel's faltering stock price -- 
sending shares of the private British-French consortium that built and operates 
the tunnel to a new low in the wake of the many delays in the long-awaited 
Channel Tunnel train service. 
</P>
<P>
 The multibillion-dollar "Chunnel" project has opened late and faces severe 
financial difficulties, partly because of the loss of passenger revenues. It is 
not scheduled to carry its first paying passengers between London and the 
Continent until Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the train was late getting under way Thursday, it eventually made the 
journey to Paris' Gare du Nord in a record two hours and 50 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Eurostar trains will be competing for the lucrative London-Paris passenger 
route with airlines, which make the journey in about an hour. By car and 
fastest Channel ferry, the journey is a minimum of 4 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Thursday's journey was designed to show the advantages of traveling 
directly from the heart of London to the center of Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, a Eurostar train on a test run from Paris to London broke down in 
England's Kent County and had to be towed away for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shall be reviewing the whole standby train situation," said a Eurostar 
spokesman, "and we shall be applying the lessons we have learned today."

WIFE TURNS ON CONFESSED CIA MOLE, CALLS HIM UNFEELING 'MONSTER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the eve of her sentencing for espionage, Rosario Ames broke with her 
husband for the first time Thursday, describing confessed CIA mole Aldrich H. 
Ames as "a monster . . . incapable of loving anything or anyone other than 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Her attacks, which included a claim that he told her he was sexually impotent 
because she was "ugly," were aimed at reducing her prison sentence from the 
approximately five years she agreed to in the couple's plea agreement last 
April. She is to be sentenced today. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a separate court filing, federal prosecutors called the portrayal of 
her as a victim "utter nonsense." They pointed out that hundreds of hours of 
FBI-monitored conversations in the months before the couple's arrest last 
February showed "numerous instances where Mrs. Ames encouraged her husband in 
his illegal conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 On those tape recordings, revealed in court last spring, she urged her husband 
to exercise caution in packing suitcases with classified documents. She also 
helped him deposit hundreds of thousands of dollars in spy payments in U.S. 
banks, according to previous testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, prosecutors acknowledged that she was "a lesser participant" in the 
espionage conspiracy and that Aldrich Ames had "substantially complied" with 
his part of the plea agreement by disclosing details of his spying to FBI and 
CIA interrogators. The prosecutors recommended "a significant term of 
incarceration" for her within the agreed-upon period of 63 to 72 months. 
</P>
<P>
 In his court-approved plea agreement, Ames, 52, acknowledged eight years of 
espionage for the former Soviet Union and later Russia and accepted a term of 
life in prison without parole on condition that his wife receive no more than 
approximately five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 He also agreed to cooperate with investigators by fully disclosing the extent 
of his spying as chief of Soviet counterintelligence in the CIA's Soviet-East 
European division, for which he received $2.5 million in secret payments. He 
confessed that he gave the KGB the names of as many as a dozen Soviet and 
Eastern bloc officials cooperating with U.S. intelligence, all of whom either 
disappeared or were executed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosario Ames, 41, played a role considerably smaller than her husband's, 
according to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The government documents said of Aldrich Ames that "his cooperation has been 
substantial and has included significant new information about espionage 
activities not available from other sources." 
</P>
<P>
 But government interrogators "believe that Ames has not been completely 
forthcoming," a concern they said was supported by a polygraph exam given him 
on Sept. 20, the documents said. They did not elaborate on their suspicions, 
stressing instead that "he has, on balance, substantially complied with the 
agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers for Rosario Ames, Washington attorney John P. Hume and two 
associates, joined the case after she said she wanted to replace her 
court-appointed counsel. In their filing, the new lawyers noted that U.S. 
District Judge Claude M. Hilton in Alexandria, Va., "is not bound by the 
recommended sentence in the plea agreement and may . . . impose any sentence 
permitted by statute." 
</P>
<P>
 It is understood that Hilton could sentence Rosario Ames to anything from the 
eight months already served to a maximum of 15 years on espionage and 
tax-evasion charges. 
</P>
<P>
 In her plea for leniency, she said through her lawyers that her husband "had 
already chosen the Russians over me, even before we were married" in the 
mid-1980s. She claimed that she did not learn of his espionage until 1992, 
saying her husband's life "was composed of lies, deceit and pathological 
manipulation of everyone and everything around him." 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, counterintelligence experts have said they intend to 
watch for signs that Russian officials are trying to funnel additional money to 
Rosario Ames. One U.S. official said the CIA often has extended financial 
support to foreign spies caught helping the United States.

TYLENOL USER WINS $8.8 MILLION FROM LAWSUIT OVER LIVER FAILURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal court jury awarded more than $8.8 million Thursday to a former White 
House official who contended that his liver was destroyed by the widely used 
pain-relieverTylenol. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Benedi, 39, of Springfield, Va., a former special assistant to 
President George Bush, said he was in good health until February, 1993, when he 
began taking Tylenol Extra Strength to treat the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Leebar, a spokesman for Johnson & Johnson, parent company of Tylenol 
manufacturer McNeil Consumer Products Co., said the award would be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking the recommended doses for several days, Benedi said, he slipped 
into a coma and was hospitalized. Doctors found that his liver had failed and 
he received a liver transplant Feb. 12, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, testimony showed that Benedi regularly drank wine with his 
dinner. Specialists testified that regular alcohol consumption can cause the 
liver to become overly sensitive and prone to damage from usually harmless 
doses of Tylenol. 
</P>
<P>
 Benedi's experts testified that McNeil had known for years that alcohol 
drinkers could suffer unusual liver damage from ordinary doses of Tylenol but 
had failed to warn the public. 
</P>
<P>
 A Food and Drug Administration panel recommended last year that an alcohol 
warning be included on Tylenol and several other types of over-the-counter pain 
relievers. Some Tylenol products carry the warning, but not the "Extra Strength 
Tylenol" that Benedi used. 
</P>
<P>
 Leebar said: "We believe the injuries sustained were caused by a pre-existing 
virus infection and not by Tylenol. Tylenol has established an excellent safety 
record from 30 years of patient use." 
</P>
<P>
 Another spokesman, Bob Kniffin, said all cases in which alcohol and Tylenol 
have been implicated in liver damage have involved alcoholics or an overdose of 
Tylenol or a combination of both. He said Johnson & Johnson is preparing labels 
for all Tylenol products that will warn patients consuming three drinks daily 
to consult a physician.

TRIP TO NORTHEAST GIVES CLINTON A BOOST; POLITICS: PRESIDENT IS GREETED BY 
ENTHUSIASTIC CROWDS AS HE CAMPAIGNS FOR KENNEDY, CUOMO. HE RENEWS ATTACK ON GOP 
'CONTRACT WITH AMERICA.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton came to the Northeast this week to lend what succor he could 
to two aging liberal lions, New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Massachusetts Sen. 
Edward M. Kennedy, but to his surprise found some relief from his own recent 
flagging fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 After enduring several weeks of late-night fund-raisers and small and soulless 
crowds, Clinton found generous welcomes in New York and Massachusetts, two of 
the few places in the United States where he is more popular than the Democrats 
he came to support. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy, warming up a packed house of Democratic faithful at the Framingham 
Memorial Building, was even so bold as to announce that he was looking forward 
to working for Clinton's reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as we reelect old Kennedy to the United States Senate, we're going to 
start on the '96 campaign to reelect Clinton," Kennedy said to a roar from the 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Democrats are vastly more worried about their own hides on Nov. 8 than 
about Clinton's fortunes two years from now. Many candidates have shamelessly 
shunned Clinton and spoken of him as an albatross in a year expected to produce 
large GOP gains in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kennedy was clearly buoyed Thursday by a new Boston Herald poll that 
showed him opening up a 50%-40% lead over his Republican opponent, businessman 
Mitt Romney. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's approval rating in Massachusetts is nearly 60%, higher than in any 
other state and well above the national figure of 46%. In New York, the 
President's job approval rating is 55%, while Cuomo's is only 45%. 
</P>
<P>
 Good-sized crowds lined the streets of Framingham, a working-class town west 
of Boston whose tree-shrouded neighborhoods were painted in the bright colors 
of a New England autumn as Clinton's motorcade passed. 
</P>
<P>
 The President, obviously delighted and a bit surprised at his warm reception 
here, stood before a huge U.S. flag and a living tableau of Democratic 
officeholders and office seekers as he urged the crowd inside the hall to 
reward Kennedy and other Democratic "agents of change." 
</P>
<P>
 He richly lauded Kennedy for his record of bipartisan achievements and scored 
Republican senators for blocking health care reform, environmental legislation 
and campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "So when you hear (Republicans) spouting their liberal epithets -- you know, 
'liberal, liberal, liberal' -- you say: 'All we know is, you guys didn't reduce 
the size of the federal government. We did. You guys talked about a crime bill. 
We passed one. You guys bad-mouthed the deficit. We lowered it. You guys talked 
about the economy. Our economy is coming back,' " Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he once again attacked the Republican "contract with America," a pledge to 
cut taxes, increase military spending and balance the budget. Clinton said that 
the GOP plan amounted to $1 trillion in promises with no revenue to back it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to make you $1 trillion worth of promises," Clinton said. "With 
$1 trillion worth of hot checks, I could show everybody in this house a good 
time tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Thursday, in a packed gymnasium at Framingham High School, Clinton 
signed a bill providing nearly $11 billion in aid to the nation's schools in 
1995 and $60 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton spoke at some length in the stuffy gym, as the students fanned 
themselves and dark-suited politicians squirmed. Near the end of his remarks, 
Clinton noted that marijuana use seemed to be rising again and urged the youths 
to keep away. 
</P>
<P>
 "All illegal drugs are dangerous. We have to drive down usage again," Clinton 
said. "It is a stupid thing to do, as well as an illegal thing to do, and I 
want you to help bring it back down." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday night, Clinton paid homage to Cuomo, who is facing his toughest 
political challenge as he seeks a fourth four-year term as New York governor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Manhattan hotel ballroom, Cuomo spun out 25 minutes of matchless oratory 
about his humble beginnings and his soaring ambitions. When his turn to speak 
came, Clinton shook his head and said: "I watched him tonight and I was 
thinking: Why is this a race? Why is this even close?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Cuomo is locked in a tight contest with state Sen. George Pataki, and he's 
looking for aid wherever he can get it, even to the President, who in many 
districts around the country is not popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's appearance helped Cuomo and New York Democrats raise an estimated 
$2.5 million. In the audience were singers Madonna and Carly Simon, and actors 
Robin Williams, John Cusack and Alec Baldwin.

ABDUCTED MAN FREED BY U.S., MEXICAN POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mexican and U.S. investigators teamed up Thursday to arrest nine accused 
kidnapers and rescue a San Diego businessman who had been abducted this week 
from his factory here. 
</P>
<P>
 After three suspects picked up $200,000 in ransom money at a pedestrian bridge 
south of the San Ysidro international border crossing, Baja state judicial 
police officers swooped in and arrested them Thursday, authorities said. They 
then raided a house in a tough Tijuana neighborhood and liberated Peter 
Barabas, 57. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico has been plagued by spectacular kidnapings of wealthy executives, and a 
surge in abductions-for-ransom caused Baja authorities to create a special 
anti-kidnaping unit this year. But FBI spokeswoman Jan Caldwell said kidnapings 
of U.S. citizens south of the border remain unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 The cross-border investigation benefited from good communications and fast 
teamwork by the FBI and Mexican police, Caldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barabas, unhurt during his two-day ordeal, owns a business in the San Diego 
suburb of Chula Vista and a picture frame factory in the heavily industrial 
Otay Mesa area of Tijuana. He was kidnaped Tuesday at or near his Tijuana 
factory by four men armed with pistols, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barabas' family in San Diego then received a series of phone calls demanding a 
ransom and giving instructions for dropping off the money. The family contacted 
the FBI, which along with Mexican police set up surveillance on both sides of 
the San Ysidro border crossing Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 After arresting the suspects with the money, Mexican police arrested two more 
suspects in a nearby car, Caldwell said. The trail then led to the Grupo Mexico 
neighborhood and the arrests of four suspects holding Barabas. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged kidnapers, eight men and a woman, may be connected to a kidnaping 
ring from the state of Nayarit that has been active in Baja, authorities said. 
The suspects face charges of kidnaping and extortion in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Barabas was reunited with his wife at the Tijuana headquarters of the state 
judicial police, Caldwell said.

MAN IS CHARGED WITH 'CLONING' CELLULAR PHONES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Jose man has been charged with making "clone" cellular phones that 
allowed users to make calls while the bills went to other unsuspecting cellular 
phone owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors said Clinton L. Watson, 44, who described himself to 
investigators as a computer consultant and music producer, sold 1,000 of the 
phones for $1,000 to $2,000 each.They allege that the phones were used to 
defraud cellular companies of more than $500,000 in a three-month period this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson was arrested at his home Monday and charged with three counts of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal grand jury indictment referred to 30 altered cellular phones, 16 
altered computer circuits and about 600 electronic serial numbers seized at 
Watson's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that Watson used a radio-wave scanner to record the serial 
numbers of passing drivers' car phones and then made the "clone" phones by 
tinkering with each set's serial number -- embedded with a computer chip -- so 
that its serial numbers matched one of the scanned phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls from the clones were billed to the phones of innocent owners.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY; WHY NOT BAN LENO'S JOKES? 
</P>

 As I watched KABC-TV artist Mona S. Edwards sketch the O.J. Simpson trial from 
her seat three floors above the courtroom, I saw the silliness of Superior 
Court Judge Lance A. Ito's order banning the press from the current phase of 
questioning prospective jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 At the exact moment Ito was booting the reporters into the hallway, Edwards 
was drawing her conception of the scene inside the courtroom, with the lawyers, 
the judge and the famous defendant all at their customary posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito had previously banned cameras from jury selection, creating a need for 
Edwards' talents. With no cameras in the court, reporters have been giving her 
descriptions of what the participants are wearing. "The judge is always wearing 
the same thing, the attorneys are always standing in the same position," said 
Edwards, who is also a fashion artist. From the descriptions and her memory of 
televised courtroom scenes, Edwards sketches a picture that looks as though it 
was done inside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Working furiously, Edwards finished a picture as the reporters were leaving 
the courtroom and handed it to a producer. As usual, it was run on Channel 7 
clearly labeled "artist's conception." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the judge thinks kicking out the press will produce a news blackout. 
But he doesn't understand the process of news gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 KABC's initiative will be matched by others as the media struggle to learn 
what's happening behind closed doors in the nation's hottest trial. Reporters 
will use all their skills and contacts. Leakers will be happy to help them, 
trying to portray jury selection in terms favorable to their side. 
</P>
<P>
 The wildest of speculation will abound, with nobody except those inside the 
courtroom having any idea of the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear from the beginning that Thursday would be a bad day for the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
 The court reporter, explaining she was acting on Judge Ito's orders, refused 
to give the reporters promised transcripts of Wednesday morning's session, when 
Simpson had a conversation with the judge. In fact, she snatched away the one 
copy she had given out, apparently prior to Ito's order, from the hands of a 
Fox Channel 11 producer, declaring sternly: "You can't have this." 
</P>
<P>
 We went into the pressroom, which has a speaker connection to the courtroom, 
to listen to what we thought would be another tedious round of questioning 
jurors. Instead, a couple of jurors spoke up with complaints about the press. 
</P>
<P>
 One had gone into an elevator occupied by reporters and they had discussed the 
Simpson case even though she was wearing a juror's badge. "I had to say I was a 
juror so please be quiet," she told Ito. The second juror complained that two 
friends reported they had seen her picture on television, indicating some 
station had violated the ban against photographing jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge seized on the disclosure, telling the juror to find out the station 
from her friends and call the court with the information. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Robert L. Shapiro was the first to ask that reporters be 
banned from the courtroom. Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark backed him all the 
way. So did Ito. In fact, it turned out the ban was Ito's idea. "The court 
invited the parties to make the motion," he disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner had Ito signed off on the ban than the sound was cut off in our 
pressroom. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Judge Ito's ban was only partial, extending through the 
period when jurors are being asked whether they have been influenced by what's 
been written and broadcast about the case. When this period ends, a court 
spokeswoman said, the press will come back in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 None of this makes much sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Ito said he was concerned about "cross-pollination of jurors by the 
media, accurate or otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 The coverage of the case, he said, was pervasive. His research attorney has 
counted 27,000 newspaper and magazine articles nationwide since July. It's been 
on Tibet TV. Jay Leno and David Letterman joke about the case. It's on all the 
networks, every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would a juror be concerned if David Letterman was telling jokes?" asked 
Kelli Sager, attorney for The Times and the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the point. The reporting inside the courtroom isn't polluting the 
atmosphere. Is the judge afraid the jurors will be intimidated by five 
reporters taking notes? Will they be influenced by the reporters's stories, 
which are straight accounts reflecting the tedium of voir dire proceedings? 
Does he actually think jurors will be inflamed by such reports?  
</P>
<P>
 Really, judge. The only thing worse than being banned from voir dire is having 
to sit through it. 
</P>
<P>
 The pollution is coming from the outside. From L.A.'s new literary light, Faye 
Resnick, author of a book smearing her alleged friend, Nicole Brown Simpson. 
From the supermarket tabloids. From the tabloid TV shows. From irresponsible 
magazines, locked in newsstand circulation wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Their reporting activities, all from outside the courtroom, are exempt from 
Ito's media ban. 
</P>
<P>
 If the judge followed the logic of his complaints, he'd ban Leno and 
Letterman. He'd get injunctions against every Sunset Strip comic who tells O.J. 
jokes. He'd have the Star, the National Enquirer and, on occasion, Newsweek, 
the New Yorker and Esquire, banned from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd order the burning of Faye Resnick's book.

OFFICIAL AT CENTER OF FRAUD INQUIRY IS ASKED TO HELP RUN COMPANY; 
INVESTIGATION: U.S. TRUSTEE'S OFFICE WANTS CHARLES B. RAU TO OPERATE A 
MOTORCYCLE PARTS MAKER THAT FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION. NO CHARGES HAVE 
BEEN FILED AGAINST HIM IN BANK PROBE. 
</P>

<P>
 A Newport Beach man under investigation for criminal bank fraud by one arm of 
the U.S. Justice Department has been asked by another part of the agency to 
help operate a company that filed for bankruptcy protection this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles B. Rau, who said he is waiting to see whether the U.S. attorney's 
office will seek criminal charges against him, said Thursday that he was hired 
this week by the U.S. trustee's office to operate a Costa Mesa motorcycle parts 
maker called Genuine Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Rau controlled 51% of Genuine Fisher until he and his wife, Lucy F. Looney 
Rau, who also is under federal investigation, filed a bankruptcy petition in 
June to liquidate their estate. Control then went to John M. Wolfe, the trustee 
appointed to sell the property in the Raus' estate. Wolfe put Genuine Fisher in 
bankruptcy Tuesday, he said, "to conserve any value" in the company for 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an assistant to the trustee," Rau said about his return to the company. 
The trustee does "everything in the best interests of all parties involved," he 
said, and, "anyway, who's better qualified to know what's inside this place?" 
</P>
<P>
 That was the reasoning behind bringing Rau back, said Leonard M. Shulman, an 
Irvine lawyer retained by Wolfe to represent the Rau estate. But Shulman said 
that Rau hasn't been hired technically, isn't being paid and won't be making 
any major operating decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very sensitive to all the issues surrounding the Raus," Shulman said. 
"We're aware that there is an ongoing criminal investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Rau, with help from his wife, is expected to give Wolfe a report on the 
ability of Genuine Fisher to continue in business. Rau's role should end when 
the report is turned in, which could be today, Shulman and Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the door could still be open to Rau. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the trustee (Wolfe) decides the business can continue to operate," the 
lawyer said, "his (Rau's) best role would be to assist in a marketing effort. 
That's where his expertise comes in." 
</P>
<P>
 If Rau does stay on, "he won't have any ability to misuse assets (because) 
he'll be carefully monitored," said Marcy J.K. Tiffany, the U.S. trustee in Los 
Angeles who monitors all appointed trustees, including Wolfe. 
</P>
<P>
 It's always difficult in taking over a business -- "especially from someone 
who may not be credible," she said -- to bring back the former operator. 
"Nevertheless, they know the business and they know where all the skeletons 
are," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Rau, acting on behalf of Wolfe, threw out the management at 
Genuine Fisher and changed the locks. He and his wife now occupy the offices 
under what he says is a joint effort with the government to resurrect the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I were a creditor, I'd be really happy now," Rau said. "Some are ecstatic 
that we're back." 
</P>
<P>
 He vowed to "give it the old college try" to revive the company and repay 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal problems for the Raus began last spring when the Bank of Newport 
investigated a number of loans that one of their companies, the Sonora Group 
Inc., had taken out. What the bank discovered led it to sue the Raus and to 
give the information it had gathered to federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sonora Group, a heavy-equipment leasing company owned and operated jointly 
by the couple, had obtained loans to buy trucks, forklifts and other work 
vehicles that would then be leased out. But, the bank asserted, the Raus took 
the money and never actually bought the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of Newport, already struggling with bad real estate loans, was sunk by 
the scheme. It said in early August that it had to write off $6 million on the 
equipment loans, putting its finances in a precarious position. Banking 
regulators seized and closed it a week later. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Richard Robinson said that the Raus are continuing to 
cooperate with his office in its criminal investigation of them, but he would 
not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feds sometimes appear to work slowly," Rau said, "but they're very 
effective and very thorough. I know we're talking criminal charges, and it's up 
to the U.S. attorneys to make the charges. We've cooperated all we can and will 
continue to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 While Rau waits for prosecutors to act, he said, he is trying to help Genuine 
Fisher find a plant that will manufacture his harmonic dampner, a device put in 
motorcycle crankshafts that is supposed to reduce vibration, providing a 
smoother ride. The company's production equipment, used as security for a loan 
that went into default, was seized by Eldorado Bank in Tustin and sold last 
week at auction. 
</P>
<P>
 Shulman said Genuine Fisher still has some raw material, inventory, accounts 
receivable and orders for more dampners. It also has the patent that Rau had 
received for the product. 
</P>
<P>
 Rau is eager to bring the company back to life, but his product may be 
difficult to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "A harmonic dampner doesn't do a damn thing," said Rod Page, service manager 
for Harley-Davidson of Fullerton. "Vibration is going to kick in anyway, and it 
just changes the r.p.m. level that the vibration kicks in. Actually, it makes 
it uncomfortable to ride the bikes at cruising speed. I take more of them off 
than I put on. They're junk."

ROCKWELL MAKES BID FOR RELIANCE ELECTRIC; MERGERS: THE $1.5-BILLION DEAL WOULD 
TAKE THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR ANOTHER STEP TOWARD PROMISING COMMERCIAL 
VENTURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rockwell International Corp., further abandoning its aerospace heritage in 
favor of growing commercial markets, Thursday launched an unsolicited bid to 
buy Reliance Electric Co. for $1.5 billion in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The tender offer by Seal Beach-based Rockwell stunned Reliance, which had 
agreed in August to merge with General Signal Corp. in a $1.3-billion stock 
swap. Cleveland-based Reliance makes motors, drives, generators and other 
industrial products. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rockwell, already perhaps the most successful aerospace and defense firm 
to shift its emphasis from shrinking government work to more promising 
commercial ventures, did not want to lose its chance of obtaining Reliance, 
which would complement its industrial automation business. 
</P>
<P>
 A merger of the two firms is "too compelling to ignore," Rockwell Chairman 
Donald R. Beall said in a letter sent to Reliance Chief Executive John C. 
Morley on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell generally is a cautious firm that prefers to grow from within, but 
its willingness to wage a hostile fight for Reliance shows how Rockwell, more 
than ever, views commercial markets as crucial to its growth, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The growth opportunities in the government market are really not visible," 
said Wolfgang Demisch, a veteran Rockwell analyst at BT Securities Corp. in New 
York. Rockwell wants to build an industrial-automation franchise "that has 
open-ended potential in the global economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell, builder of the space shuttle and the B-1B bomber, also has 
widespread interests in automotive parts, electronics and telecommunications 
equipment. Its Allen-Bradley unit, a provider of factory automation systems, 
has doubled its sales to $2 billion a year since 1985, and Rockwell sees 
Reliance, with 1993 sales of $1.6 billion, as a way to bolster Allen-Bradley's 
expansion around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of such systems are those used by major packaging and bottling firms, 
which fill, seal, label and box tens of thousands of products daily via 
high-speed conveyors and routing equipment. Allen-Bradley designs systems to 
precisely control those movements using computers, variable-speed drives, 
motors, sensors and a host of other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Such products "are not the things that have a whole lot of pizazz," Demisch 
said. "But they happen to be showing record sales and profits. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 A Rockwell spokeswoman said Thursday that the division's 144 employees in 
Orange County will not be affected by the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell had approached Reliance about a merger in July, only to be spurned as 
Reliance instead struck its pact with General Signal. So Rockwell decided to 
come back with its cash offer of $30 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry it worked out quite this way," Beall said in a telephone interview. 
He said he still hopes for "a friendly situation," but added, "Deals like this 
don't come along every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Reliance declined to comment on Rockwell's announcement. General Signal's 
chairman, Edmund M. Carpenter, issued a statement saying the Reliance-General 
Signal marriage "provides the best result for both companies." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wall Street will be watching to see if General Signal responds to 
Rockwell's bid with a higher offer. Rockwell's offer sent Reliance's common 
stock soaring $5.125 a share to $29.625 in New York Stock Exchange composite 
trading. Rockwell's stock fell 37.5 cents to $36. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell began weaning itself from Uncle Sam several years ago with the help 
of its last major acquisition, Allen-Bradley, which it bought for $1.6 billion 
in 1985. Since then, Rockwell has gotten high marks for deftly building its 
commercial lines at a time when contracts from the Pentagon and the National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration were either flattening out or declining. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Rockwell is not currently producing new space shuttles or B-1 
bombers, although it still garners revenue from modifying and servicing both. 
</P>
<P>
 In its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1993, Rockwell's profit -- excluding 
one-time accounting changes -- rose 16% from the prior year to $562 million, 
despite little change in sales at $10.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliance, with 14,000 employees, was owned by Exxon Corp. from 1979 to 1986, 
when Reliance's managers took their company private in a leveraged buyout. In 
1992, the firm went public with an initial public stock offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides industrial motors, Reliance makes transformers and other 
telecommunications equipment, a division that accounts for 27% of its sales. 
Rockwell said it will divest that business if it buys Reliance.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: MUSICSOURCE PLANS TO BUY STAKE IN MICHIGAN FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 MusicSource U.S.A. Inc., a provider of printed music, said Thursday that it 
has signed a letter of intent to buy a 51% stake in a Michigan company for 
$50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 MusicSource, which markets machines that print sheet music, plans to buy 
Integrated Marketing Professionals Inc., an incentive marketing company. 
</P>
<P>
 MusicSource, with four employees, made headlines in June when it sued a New 
York investment company and several law firms and individuals for allegedly 
participating in a stock scheme to defraud the company out of 1.6 million 
shares. The shares were dumped onto the market by Marsh Block & Co., the suit 
alleged, causing their value to plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that happened, but we are carrying on with business," said 
Dale R. Jacobs, president of the Newport Beach company. "We are positioning 
ourselves to acquire a lot of companies which can boost our revenues." 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. district judge in Santa Ana is expected to issue a ruling in the suit 
during the first week of November, Jacobs said.

BRIEFCASE: BANKING AND FINANCE; THEY'RE THINKING BIG BY AIMING TO SERVE SMALLER

 Larry D. Hartwig can't quite figure out why there hasn't been a major 
community bank dominating Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of Southern California Bank figures that the county will become, 
if it isn't already, the Southland's financial center for small- and 
medium-size businesses.Yet no county bank has grown much beyond $300 million in 
loans and other assets without merging into a regional bank -- or failing. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Bank, with $400 million in assets, moved its headquarters 
recently to Anaheim and plans to fill that void. With $16 million in cash from 
a recent stock offering, the bank can afford to grow 50% simply by buying a 
smaller bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking for banks that operate the same way we do," he said this week 
at a Center Club luncheon where he discussed the bank's strategy for growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank, with eight branches in Orange County and seven in Los Angeles 
County, looks to serve all the needs of its consumer and corporate customers, 
he said, and wants to acquire other banks that seek such long-term 
relationships with their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Bank could grow to a $1-billion institution in the next 
few years and already is looking beyond that, he acknowledged. And he believes 
that Orange County will rise from its recessionary doldrums to spur economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a corporate decision that we want to be part of the next great 
chapter in Orange County history," he said, "and we are confident that this 
region will lead California to a business renaissance in the years ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the downturn in the aerospace and defense industry hit the bank's 
old headquarters in Downey fairly hard too. Many small businesses that served 
the industry have folded, and many of the bank's customers moved to North 
County.

PROFIT AT ABBEY HEALTHCARE UP 35% FOR QUARTER; EARNINGS: CHAIRMAN SAYS PROVIDER 
OF HOME HEALTH SERVICES HAS REACHED 'TURNING POINT' IN ABSORBING RECENT 
ACQUISITIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 Though struggling to absorb a string of recent acquisitions, Abbey Healthcare 
Group Inc. reported Thursday that its profit jumped 35% from the same quarter 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa-based provider of home health care reported earnings of $5 
million, or 36 cents a share, for the quarter ending Oct. 1, compared with $3.7 
million, or 38 cents a share, during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Timothy Aitken called the third-quarter results "a turning point" and 
predicted that Abbey's earnings will continue to improve as it absorbs and 
integrates recent purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take some time to see all the things we've talked about come true," 
he said. "This third quarter is the turning point." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides buying more than 20 small companies this year, Abbey made headlines in 
1993 when it purchased Total Pharmaceutical Care Inc. in Torrance for $195 
million. In March, 1994, it paid $12 million in cash and stock for Protocare 
Inc. of Boston, which provides home infusion and nursing services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually when a company of that size makes the quantity of acquisitions that 
it has, it faces a not insignificant challenge in digesting those entities and 
creating a cohesive final organization," said Dave Anast, publisher of the 
Biomedical Market Newsletter in Costa Mesa. "It would appear that Abbey has 
been far more successful than others in the past, but their earnings reflect 
the inherent challenges." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Abbey, which provides home care services through a network of 
more than 200 facilities in 46 states, earlier this week called some analysts' 
predictions of earnings ranging from 33 to 35 cents a share "conservative." 
Other analysts had predicted earnings of about 40 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Tuesday, Helen O'Donnell, an industry analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. 
in New York, cut her estimate of Abbey's third-quarter earnings from 40 cents a 
share to 35 to 38 cents, saying that recent acquisitions were were proving a 
longer-than-expected drag on earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 But a frustrated Aitken slammed those analysts Thursday, saying the 
wide-ranging predictions were a reflections of analysts' laxity in updating 
their forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these analysts sit on Wall Street and they think managing a business 
day-to-day is about quarterly results," he said. "It's not. It's about managing 
people, growing a company. It's not about quarterly results." 
</P>
<P>
 For the quarter, Abbey said revenue from continuing operations increased 62.7% 
to $111.2 million, up from $68.3 million in the previous year's third quarter. 
Profit increased 86.7% to $14.3 million from $7.7 million in 1993. Operating 
margins improved 12.9%, up 1.7 percentage points from 11.2% in the prior year 
to 12.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 During the quarter, combined net income from continuing operations, 
discontinued operations and a gain on the sale of Abbey Pharmaceutical Services 
was $7.6 million, or 52 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The company sold its 51% stake in Abbey Pharmaceutical this year for an 
after-tax gain of $3.1 million, in a move to concentrate on its core 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the first nine months, net income from continuing operations increased 
to $11.6 million, or 87 cents per share, compared to $10 million or $1.05 a 
share last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Abbey announced this week that it has entered into an 
infusion-services agreement with the HMO subsidiary of PacifiCare Health 
Systems Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey Infusion Services, a wholly owned Abbey subsidiary, will provide home 
infusion services for 165,000 patients represented by specific provider groups 
in PacifiCare's commercial and Medicare HMO plans throughout Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nasdaq trading, the Abbey shares were up 50 cents, closing at $18. The 
company's earnings were announced after the market closed. Abbey Healthcare

NEW INDICTMENT DELAYS EX-AUTO EXECUTIVES' TRIAL; COURTS: THREE FORMER AMERICAN 
HONDA SALES OFFICIALS, ONE FROM O.C., ALREADY FACE FRAUD AND RACKETEERING 
COUNTS. NEW CHARGES OR EVEN NEW DEFENDANTS COULD BE ADDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Federal prosecutors have delayed the racketeering and fraud trial of three 
former American Honda Motor Co. executives as the government prepares an 
indictment that would add new charges or even new defendants to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The new action, called a superseding indictment, could be issued by late next 
week, according to sources. Although such a document could also be used to 
lessen or even dismiss existing charges, legal experts say this is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, originally scheduled to begin Nov. 1, will be postponed until early 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The former executives were charged in March in a nationwide probe of dealer 
complaints that some American Honda officials demanded huge bribes in the 1980s 
to award lucrative Honda franchises or to increase dealers' vehicle allotments. 
At that time, the cars were among the best-selling in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 How many new charges are being contemplated by prosecutors -- or whether the 
rewritten indictment will reach beyond American Honda in Torrance and into 
Honda Motor Co. headquarters in Tokyo -- could not be learned. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial indictment named 17 former American Honda officials. All but three 
have pleaded guilty, including four of the five Orange County residents 
charged. 
</P>
<P>
 The three former officials who had been scheduled to go to trial Nov. 1 in 
Concord, N.H., are Laguna Hills resident S. James Cardiges, senior vice 
president for sales until April, 1992; Dennis R. Josleyn of Penn Valley in 
Northern California, an American Honda West Coast zone manager until April, 
1992; and John W. Billmyer, a Raleigh, N.C., resident and American Honda's vice 
president for auto sales until March, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiges and Josleyn are charged with conspiracy, mail fraud and racketeering 
and face up to 30 years in prison. Billmyer is charged with conspiracy to 
commit mail fraud and faces up to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip D. Israels, Cardiges' attorney, confirmed that his client has been told 
that there will be a new indictment. Israels said he does not know the scope of 
the new charges but added that any additions to the list of defendants would 
support his longstanding claim that "Mr. Cardiges is merely a scapegoat." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for American Honda on Thursday said the company could not comment 
on any pending new indictment but has been cooperating with federal officials 
in their investigation. Honda, he said, "has been victimized" by the 
independent actions of a handful of rogue executives who acted without the 
knowledge or consent of company officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Honda investigation was spawned by a 1991 civil suit in which a New 
Hampshire dealer alleged that Honda's Acura division failed to deliver his 
allocation of the luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Michael J. Connolly said the probe ultimately expanded to 
26 states, including California. Investigators determined that only about 35 of 
American Honda's 1,200 Honda and Acura dealers had been involved in the 
kickback schemes that were in operation from 1979 until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In that period, investigators allege, defendants in the case took as much as 
$10 million in bribes from dealers who paid the money to get Honda or Acura 
franchises or to get more of the fast-selling cars than Honda allotted to their 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiges, according to court papers filed in March, led the pack, accepting 
about $5 million in bribes that he carefully logged into a special black 
leather ledger he kept locked in a cabinet at his home office. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Connolly said this week that a new trial date for Cardiges, 
Billmyer and Josleyn will be set on Nov. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Israels, Cardiges' attorney, said he has been told by federal prosecutors that 
his client will be arraigned under the new indictment that day.

 Formed in June, 1986, the company has reduced its number of outstanding shares 
to 3.8 million from 11.5 million.

officer. Shareholders approved the split at the company's annual meeting on 
Oct. 13.

IRVINE RATED AS STATE'S 2ND-BEST CITY FOR BUSINESS; RECOGNITION: CALIFORNIA 
BUSINESS MAGAZINE'S LIST OF TOP 100 CITIES IS BASED ON LICENSE COSTS, LEASE AND 
RENTAL RATES, CRIME RATES, SCHOLASTIC APTITUDE TEST SCORES AND COMMUTING TIME.

 There has been much talk among city leaders in recent years about making 
Irvine one of the state's most "business-friendly" cities. The September issue 
of California Business magazine says that Irvine has arrived, selecting it as 
the second-best mid-size city in the state in which to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had an unjust reputation that because of being a new city, we had some 
unnecessary regulations in place," said Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. 
"It was more perception than reality." 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's list of the "100 Best Cities to Do Business in California" is 
based on the cost of business license fees, lease and rental rates, crime 
rates, Scholastic Aptitude Test scores and commuting time. Lancaster was ranked 
No. 1 among the 49 mid-size cities -- those with populations between 85,000 and 
200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years ago, we definitely had a reputation of being against business," 
said Irvine Councilman Barry J. Hammond, citing previous proposals to raise 
business taxes to fund social programs. "Over the last few years, all of those 
additional business taxes that were proposed were killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine also established a flat $50 business license fee, eliminating fees that 
had been based on a company's number of employees, according to Brady. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa was the only other Orange County city among the list's top 10 
mid-size cities. City Manager Allan L. Roeder said that Costa Mesa's 
eighth-place ranking is a reflection of what the city has not done. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of cities have set up separate departments and spent quite a bit in 
financial resources to go out and do a lot of promotion," Roeder said. "We do 
very little of that. If you keep taxes to an absolute minimum and limit 
regulation, the word gets out that it's a good place to locate your business." 
</P>
<P>
 Other mid-size Orange County cities on the list include Orange, Fullerton, 
Huntington Beach and Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 In the large-city category -- those with populations of more than 200,000 -- 
only two Orange County cities made that smaller list of 12: Anaheim was ranked 
third, and Santa Ana ranked seventh. San Diego was ranked first, and Los 
Angeles came in 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 Of cities with populations below 85,000, the magazine listed 39, including six 
in Orange County. Tustin ranked fourth, and Fountain Valley ranked eighth, 
followed by Newport Beach and Brea.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: GATES' BRAVE, NEW WORLD OF FINANCES

<P>
 Just how serious is Microsoft about its future in the multitrillion-dollar 
personal finance marketplace? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," says Scott Cook, who simultaneously became the software juggernaut's 
latest centimillionaire and its first vice president of electronic commerce 
when Microsoft acquired his Intuit for $1.5 billion, "the idea of Microsoft 
buying a bank is kind of loony." That should come as a welcome relief to Alan 
Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, like a bank, Intuit offers a credit card to complement customers 
who use its popular Quicken brand of checkbook software. So when will Microsoft 
credit cards -- replete with frequent-flier, frequent-caller and 
frequent-on-liner tie-ins -- start popping up in people's wallets and purses? 
</P>
<P>
 "Microsoft is not going to have a credit card," insists Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? After all, what's strategic for Intuit and AT&T ought to be at least 
as strategic for Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to support everyone else's credit cards," Cook says. That should come 
as a welcome relief to the folks at Visa and American Express . . . or maybe 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft doesn't enter markets with the goal of becoming a profitable niche 
player; it enters markets with the intent of redefining and dominating them. 
The Intuit acquisition neatly crystallizes Bill Gates' latest intuition: 
peddling client-server software is nice and video games may be good at sucking 
discretionary dollars out of asocial adolescents, but the real money will be 
found in managing money. Personal finance -- not interactive entertainment or 
high-bandwidth groupware -- will be the "killer app" of the next decade, the 
one really useful thing that will get millions of people to buy a new 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, while Microsoft may not become a bank, an insurance company or a 
mutual fund, it is clearly prepared to invest billions to become a new kind of 
financial institution. Microsoft's failures -- despite tremendous resources -- 
to turn its own personal financial software into a market leader have now been 
completely obscured by its ruthlessly pragmatic decision to acquire not only 
Intuit but Scott Cook's vision as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Simply stated," says Cook, "our goal is to revolutionize how people manage 
their financial lives." 
</P>
<P>
 But how will the Microsoft that dominates desktop operating systems evolve 
into a Microsoft that dominates desktop personal finance? Clearly, the answers 
will be found as much in the networks Microsoft creates as in the software it 
designs. Indeed, it can fairly be said that the evolution of personal finance 
in America over the last 25 years is as much the byproduct of new network 
technologies as the result of deregulating old financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the leadership of Dee Hock in the 1970s, for example, technology enabled 
the regional BankAmericard to be transformed into a global Visa; banks 
collaborated to create a technical standard for credit transactions and 
settlements. The 1980s saw an explosion of automated teller machines -- in no 
small part due to the recognition that networks of ATMs made more sense than 
each bank having its own proprietary technology. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, reservation systems like American Airlines' Sabre created new 
kinds of competition in the travel industry that gave a competitive edge to the 
network provider. More recently, mutual funds and banks have begun offering 
touch-tone transactions for their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these technologies have combined and converged to create the 
infrastructures for today's overwhelming array of personal financial services. 
Intriguingly, these network technologies frequently demand new organizational 
structures to manage them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the technical infrastructure for fulfilling Scott Cook's vision of 
revolution does not yet exist. The financial service companies don't yet 
understand software, and the leading on-line service companies don't yet 
understand financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 H&R Block -- which owns CompuServe -- has recently acquired MECA, a leading 
personal finance software house, but it's not clear if and how the two might be 
combined. There's a huge infrastructure gap. That's the marketplace Microsoft 
wants to create, define and dominate. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft, Cook predicts, will become an "honest broker," a digital 
intermediary that will let individuals virtually sample mutual funds, annuities 
and other financial instruments on their personal computers as if they were 
shopping in a financial services mall. "Mall is an old-fashioned metaphor," he 
says, "and I think we need to come up with a better one." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, picking the right metaphor is Microsoft's real challenge. Cook 
promises that Microsoft will work cooperatively and collaboratively with 
financial service companies to help build this infrastructure. But does 
Microsoft want to become like Visa, coordinating a consortium of hundreds of 
financial institutions? Or does it want to be more like American Airlines' 
Sabre -- a proprietary transactions network? Or does Microsoft expect to set 
the personal financial operating systems standards for Bank of America and 
Citicorp, much as it does computer operating standards for IBM, Compaq and 
thousands of independent software developers? 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Gates has shown himself to be good at everything except creating the 
kinds of alliances needed to build the personal finance infrastructure. And the 
Justice Department is likely to look askance at any effort to buy the 
infrastructure and control it -- the kind of alliance building Microsoft seems 
to prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 So the question becomes whether Microsoft has really bought into Scott Cook's 
more cooperative vision and plans to let him implement it -- or whether the 
software giant really is, as its rivals insist, seeking nothing less than world 
domination.

DIOCESE, CHORUS OK SETTLEMENT IN MOLESTATION SUIT; COURTS: FINANCIAL TERMS ARE 
NOT DISCLOSED. FORMER MEMBER OF BOYS CHORAL GROUP ALLEGED THAT PRIEST SEXUALLY 
ABUSED HIM FOR 5 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange and the Costa Mesa-based All-American 
Boys Chorus have quietly settled a lawsuit brought by a man who charged that 
the priest who founded the chorus had molested him beginning when he was a 
10-year-old chorus member. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms of the settlement were sealed Tuesday at the request of the 
defendants, but the attorney for Stephen Archambo, the former chorus member, 
said he and his client are satisfied with the dollar amount. The suit, filed in 
U.S. District Court in Santa Ana in January, alleged that Father Richard T. 
Coughlin molested Archambo, now 26, over a five-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve is pleased. He's happy," said Mark Roseman, the Santa Ana attorney 
representing Archambo and another former chorus member who has filed a separate 
suit. "He trusts that the settlement is what he is entitled to under the 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Diocesan officials were unavailable to comment on the settlement. Coughlin, 
who resigned from the chorus in December, 1992, was not at the settlement 
conference and could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseman said he has been unable to find the 70-year-old priest, who has never 
been served with the suit. But Roseman said he was told by diocesan officials 
that the chorus -- which is not affiliated with the diocese -- continues to pay 
Coughlin $400 a month plus car payments. 
</P>
<P>
 A board member for the internationally known chorus would not comment on the 
settlement nor whether Coughlin receives payments from the group. Instead, 
board member John Bovaird read a statement saying that Coughlin "has had no 
contact or affiliation with the chorus" since he resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Father Coughlin's activities are completely and totally separate from the 
All-American Boys Chorus," Bovaird said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also named in the suit are the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, where Coughlin 
worked before the Diocese of Orange was formed in 1976, and, in separate 
allegations, Father Gary Pacheco and the Franciscan Friars of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Archdiocese of Los Angeles did not participate in the settlement and will 
most likely go to trial, Roseman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Archdiocese of Los Angeles "knew a whole long time, even before the chorus 
started, that Father Coughlin had some problems," Roseman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement of the Coughlin suit brings to partial closure the extremely 
public and tragic fall of one of Southern California's most popular and 
well-known priests. 
</P>
<P>
 Coughlin, who founded the chorus as an Anaheim parish youth project in 1970, 
was suspended by the diocese in January, 1993, when allegations surfaced that 
he had molested four chorus members between 1970 and 1983. A fifth man alleged 
that the priest molested him in Boston, where he worked before coming to Orange 
County in 1965.  
</P>
<P>
 The popular father was subsequently ordered to sever all ties with the chorus 
-- composed of about 100 boys ages 9 through 14 -- and told to stop functioning 
as a priest. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview in February, 1993, Coughlin said he had "absolutely no 
recollection, I swear to the Almighty, of these charges. . . . I'm a confused 
and very much destroyed man." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Archambo, Patrick O'Neill, another former chorus member, sued 
the priest. O'Neill's case, filed in Orange County Superior Court last year, is 
still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Archambo, now living in Illinois, alleged in his suit that while he was a 
member of the chorus from 1978 to 1983, Coughlin fondled him during long bus 
trips and on one occasion in the shower. Archambo did not link the alleged 
childhood sexual abuse to psychological problems he was having as an adult 
until last year, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
 Roseman said he did not know why the diocese and the chorus elected to settle 
the Archambo suit, but he said "implicit in the settlement" is that the 
organizations feel they would be at risk in a court judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Also settled as part of the same suit Tuesday were separate molestation 
charges against Father Pacheco, a former Franciscan who worked at Sts. Simon & 
Jude Church in Huntington Beach.

TRUSTEES OK HIGHER CSU FEES; EDUCATION: STUDENTS WILL PAY 10% MORE NEXT YEAR, 
BUT THE BOARD VOTES TO REQUEST ENOUGH STATE FUNDING TO AVOID ANOTHER INCREASE 
FOR 1996-97. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Amid student protests over escalating costs, California State University 
trustees on Thursday approved a 10% increase in student fees next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a last-minute amendment, however, the trustees unanimously voted to request 
that the Legislature and governor allocate enough extra money to the CSU system 
-- about $37 million -- so that a fee increase can be avoided the following 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objective is to have no fee increase," CSU Chancellor Barry Munitz told 
student representatives. "But if you want us to keep retaining excellent 
faculty and staff to serve students, this is what we have to do. There are very 
few choices." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton President Milton A. Gordon insisted that CSU officials do 
not want to increase fees. However, he said, officials have little choice, 
because the state has not been providing enough money to the system to keep 
pace with changing technology and student needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually, people will realize the impact of having a non-first-rate higher 
education system," Gordon warned. "They'll see it in their daily lives. They'll 
see they're paying more and more for (elementary and secondary) education and 
won't be getting a return in a well-educated work force." 
</P>
<P>
 The fee increase, if adopted by the Legislature, will mean that full-time 
undergraduate students who are California residents will pay $1,740 next year. 
That's $156 more than they will pay this year and more than double what they 
paid five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Student, faculty and staff representatives from throughout the 22-campus 
system protested the increase and pleaded with the trustees for relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just finished paying 10%-higher fees," said Alex Parr, a Cal Poly Pomona 
student. "And now we're hearing the board will raise fees 10% more -- it's 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Lowe, president of Associated Students at Cal State Fullerton and the 
board's student trustee, said that he is disappointed with the fee increase but 
sees hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been watching this process for four years, and this is the first time 
I've seen the trustees add a resolution to try to avoid raising fees," Lowe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Graduate students will pay $246 more next year under the plan. Trustees have 
previously tried to phase in higher fees for graduate students, but the 
Legislature has resisted. CSU officials said it costs more to educate graduate 
students than undergraduates. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of an improving California economy, CSU budget planners said they 
will seek more money from the state in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees on Thursday asked for nearly $1.7 billion from the state's general 
fund, 9.4% more than what the system received this year. If the Legislature 
approves the request, it would bring state funding for the CSU system back to 
1990-91 levels. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,200 more students are expected to enter CSU schools next year -- 
slightly more than Cal State Fullerton's 1994 freshman class. Currently, about 
326,000 students attend Cal State universities. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees' planned budget could be scrapped if analysts find by Nov. 15 
that the state has much less money than they had hoped. But Richard West, CSU 
vice chancellor of business and finance, was cautiously optimistic, saying that 
the state currently has about $476 million more than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 When they were pressed to explain raising fees, trustees angrily pointed to 
numbers showing the growing state prison system. Money for prisons comes from 
the same discretionary portion of the state general fund as money for higher 
education, trustees said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prisons are going to swallow us up eventually," Trustee Anthony M. Vitti 
said. Vitti and other trustees told students to demonstrate their frustration 
before the Legislature to change the ways politicians allocate money. 
</P>

SPECIAL DELIVERY; DEPUTY GOES BEYOND CALL OF DUTY WHEN BABY IS BORN AT JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 When Sheriff's Deputy Kirstin Goins heard a pregnant inmate screaming in her 
cell at the Central Women's Jail early Thursday, she knew something was 
terribly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Allison Urey, 25, had been examined by the jail's medical 
staff on Tuesday and told that her pregnancy, at seven months, was progressing 
normally. But it didn't sound normal to the deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was screaming; you wouldn't believe how loud she was screaming," said 
Goins, 29. "She looked so scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Goins and Deputy Kelly Rodriguez lifted Urey into a wheelchair and took her to 
the medical floor. As a nurse pulled Urey's file, which indicated that she was 
not due to deliver for another two months, there was another cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "She let out one big scream," said Goins, who then discovered that the baby 
was rapidly en route. "The baby was real small, so I caught it. It came out 
real fast. She was still in the wheelchair." 
</P>
<P>
 Goins, a five-year veteran with the Sheriff's Department, said that she had 
received some nursing training while attending Valparaiso University in Indiana 
and last month had received in-service training in cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation and first aid, so she knew what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "The baby was blue -- no movement, non-responsive, no breathing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While nurse Judy Hanson tried to stimulate the infant boy's breathing, Goins 
rubbed his feet to stimulate circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few moments of frantic efforts, there was a sound from the baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like the angels were singing, that first cry," Goins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The infant, weighing 2 pounds, 14 ounces, was taken to the intensive care unit 
of Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where he was in stable condition. His 
mother was also in stable condition at the same hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Urey, who was arrested by Newport Beach police on suspicion of grand theft, is 
scheduled to be released from jail on Nov. 29, according to Sheriff's Lt. Dan 
Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they believe Urey went into labor Wednesday but did not tell 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 Goins said she was especially grateful for her recent first-aid training, 
which she said prepared her for just such an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know it could happen; you just don't know when," Goins said. "The 
possibility is always there, but you say, 'Oh, it won't happen to me,' but it 
does. All your training comes back to you. You react to the situation, and it 
comes back to you. It's very emotional. . . . Thank God I just had it." 
</P>
<P>
 At almost the same time the baby was born at the Central Women's Jail, an 
inmate at the Central Men's Jail was pronounced dead at Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana. The man, who has not been identified, was discovered 
unconscious in a housing area restroom about 10 p.m. Wednesday, according to 
Martini. He died later at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said heart failure is suspected, but an autopsy has been scheduled to 
determine the exact cause of death.

1 DEAD, 4 HURT IN 5-CAR CRASH; ACCIDENTS: DRIVER WHO REPORTEDLY SPED THROUGH A 
RED LIGHT IS KILLED WHEN CAR FLIPS OVER IN TUSTIN INTERSECTION. IT IS THE WORST 
OF SEVERAL COLLISIONS ON AN ESPECIALLY DANGEROUS DAY ON LOCAL ROADS AND 
FREEWAYS.

<P>
 A man who apparently ran a stoplight died Thursday in a five-car crash here 
that left four other drivers injured -- the worst in a series of morning 
rush-hour accidents around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Scott Ryan Hoffman, 21, of Villa Park was speeding north through a 
red light on Tustin Ranch Road when his Ford Explorer struck a car crossing the 
intersection and flipped over onto a third vehicle. Two other cars were also 
damaged in the 8 a.m. crash, which forced the closure of freeway on-ramps 
nearby as well as streets leading to the El Camino Real intersection where the 
crash took place. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers used hydraulic equipment to free one of the drivers, Nahid Harvey, 
33, of Lake Forest. Harvey, who police said apparently was not wearing a seat 
belt, suffered internal injuries and was placed in the intensive-care unit at 
Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. Police said she was in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other drivers were treated and released from Tustin Hospital Medical 
Center: Keith Blood, 45, of Anaheim; Valry Pendergraft, 53, of Santa Ana; and 
Brenda Holm, 36, of Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness said she was about to cross the intersection on her bicycle when she 
noticed the Explorer bearing down. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were honking. Then they hit and went all over," said Sarah Remington, a 
13-year-old Tustin resident who was riding to A.G. Currie Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was going really fast. I was, like, why is he going so fast?" the 
schoolgirl said. "I could be dead right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a preliminary investigation indicated Hoffman was traveling at 
least 60 m.p.h. in a 40-m.p.h. zone when his vehicle struck Harvey's car. The 
Explorer flipped and landed on the hood of a BMW stopped at the light. 
Remington and another witness said the Explorer, its cabin crushed, briefly 
caught fire after the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey's car careened into two other stopped cars before coming to a stop on 
the sidewalk, with Harvey pinned inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is amazing, with all the damage to the cars, that there was only 
one fatality," said Police Capt. Steve Foster. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, a motorist was seriously injured after her car struck a 
mattress on the Costa Mesa Freeway and flipped over. In Westminster, a woman 
who fell asleep in her stalled car set off a minor crash involving three other 
cars near a freeway entrance on Beach Boulevard. And a five-car fender-bender 
on the San Diego Freeway in Huntington Beach slowed northbound traffic for more 
than an hour near Beach Boulevard. No injuries were reported in that accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Marilyn Hess Cross, 67, of Costa Mesa suffered multiple fractures when her car 
overturned on the Costa Mesa Freeway, and was in critical but stable condition 
in the intensive-care unit at UCI Medical Center in Orange, according to 
hospital officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the other accidents were minor, but the mishaps kept authorities busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bright and sunny. It's not even raining out there," said CHP Officer 
Joan Rivas. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivas said the sleeping woman was waiting for help after she ran out of gas on 
Beach Boulevard. Three cars were involved in fender-benders as traffic slowed 
to avoid the stalled vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers had to awaken the woman by pounding on her window, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was even after the accident occurred," Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The collisions continued into the afternoon Thursday, as a Long Beach police 
officer, en route to work from his home in Riverside County at 2:20 p.m., 
radioed the California Highway Patrol that he had just been passed on the 
Riverside Freeway by a man going about 100 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The police officer chased the 1994 Acura into Orange County past Weir Canyon 
Road, where the Acura driver lost control, crossed four lanes of traffic and 
became airborne. The car landed in the Santa Ana River bed, critically injuring 
the driver, identified by the CHP as John Nelson, 25, of Norco. 
</P>
<P>
 Three hours later, a 26-year-old Corona del Mar man was critically injured 
when the mountain bike he was riding was struck by a pickup truck at Jamboree 
Road and East Coast Highway in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The cyclist, who has not been identified, was not wearing a helmet and 
sustained severe head injuries, according to Newport Beach Sgt. Ken Cowell. The 
cyclist was airlifted to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where he was in 
critical condition late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic was blocked on three of the four westbound lanes of Coast Highway for 
more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the pickup was treated at the scene for cuts. No one was cited, 
Cowell said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Hills, 73-year-old Mary Gridley was critically injured when the car 
she was riding in collided with another car at El Paseo and Cabot Road at 7:17 
p.m. No one else was seriously injured.

 Chapman University celebrated the diversity of its students Thursday with 
Italian penne , Philippine kutchinta and some Bulgarian melba . 
</P>
<P>
 The pasta, custard and ice cream were part of tantalizing fare offered at 25 
tables decorated for the university's eighth annual International Fair.The 
school's 3,000-student body has 201 foreign students representing 40 nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair marked the 49th anniversary of the United Nations charter -- which 
was signed on Oct. 24, 1945 -- by releasing 124 snow-white homing pigeons that 
closely resembled doves, the symbolic bird of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred students and Orange residents wandered among tasting tables 
that represented a range of countries from Peru and Korea to Oman and 
Indonesia, and included an American table with hero sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 The event helps introduce the foreign students to the community and gives them 
a nice sense of welcome, said coordinator Nilani Abeyesundere, a 22-year-old 
senior dressed in a rust-and-black Sri Lankan blouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get here and they're afraid and they're homesick," she said of new 
students. "This gets the whole campus together in a multicultural event." 
</P>
<P>
 Graduate film student Cahl Garingan admitted being a little nervous when he 
arrived at Chapman this year because Orange is so different from his homes in 
the Philippines and Canada. But a feast like that at the fair helps everyone, 
he said. "The international department has made a great effort," he said. 
"You'll never get lonely." LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; SPECTACOR ENDORSED TO RUN AMPHITHEATER

<P>
 The Spectacor Management Group, a Los Angeles-based company that runs the L.A. 
Coliseum and Sports Arena and the Long Beach Convention Center, could be next 
in line to operate the Pacific Amphitheatre at the Orange County Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-member panel has recommended that the Orange County Fair and Exposition 
Center enter into a three-year contract with Spectacor. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair's board of directors will vote on the matter at its meeting Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Five bidders submitted applications to operate the 8,500-seat amphitheater, 
which was previously leased and operated by the Nederlander Organization. 
However, the outdoor facility was bought back by the Orange County Fair in 
April, 1993, after rock-'n'-roll bands caused complaints about late-night 
noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectacor was chosen over the others because it has experience in running 
government-owned facilities and promised to be sensitive to the needs of 
residents living in the area when booking bands, said Jill Lloyd, a spokeswoman 
for the fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the board of directors, the contract will take effect in 
January. TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; BUILDER FILES CLAIM AGAINST SCHOOL DISTRICT

<P>
 A Costa Mesa builder has filed a $2.5-million claim accusing a Los Angeles 
County school district of reneging on a deal to sell 13 acres of land in 
Cerritos where the developer planned to build homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The claim, filed by Warmington Homes against the ABC Unified School District, 
accuses the school board of breaching a joint-venture agreement that would have 
allowed Warmington to build 61 homes near Whitney High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the school district was to receive a percentage of money 
from each home sold, but problems arose earlier this month after the school 
board deadlocked 3 to 3 on the $18-million project. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's approval of the business plan and transfer of property from 
district to developer was among the last major hurdles before construction. The 
school board last year approved an agreement to sell 13 acres to the developer 
for $7.7 million. But the project's future became clouded after last November's 
election, when a new school board majority came to power. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cerritos City Council tentatively approved the development last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Warmington officials and their attorneys declined to discuss the claim, which 
is required before a lawsuit can be filed against a public agency. But board 
members who support the development say it would have brought in money to 
repair schools around the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Warmington planned to give the district about $100,000 once the developer had 
taken over the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members who voted against the project "put us into a multimillion-dollar 
liability situation," board member Dixie Primosch said. "They violated the 
contract."PSYCHE PASCUAL

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; PANEL BACKS PROPOSED MASSAGE ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission is recommending that the City Council adopt an 
ordinance requiring massage therapists to pass a national certification test or 
become members of a nationally recognized professional massage organization in 
order to obtain a license. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the ordinance, which has received mixed reviews by massage 
therapists, is to weed out the shoddy massage businesses that serve as fronts 
for prostitution, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, licensed massage therapists already practicing in the city would have 
three years to comply with the ordinance, should it be adopted in mid-November, 
when it is scheduled to be considered by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Some licensed massage therapists at last week's Planning Commission meeting 
voiced disapproval of the proposed ordinance. Some said they thought they are 
being treated unfairly by the city because their profession is associated with 
prostitution. Many complained that they already have to submit to 
fingerprinting, mug shots and health tests as a condition of renewing their 
licenses -- something the city does not require of other health care 
professionals, such as sports therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who have degrees in sports medicine and practice massage therapy on the 
side said they are insulted that they would have to pass a test to prove, in 
essence, that they are not involved in prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city needs an ordinance on prostitution, not on massage therapy," said 
Marisa Lepore, a massage therapist and personal trainer at a local club. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there were some massage practitioners who hailed the ordinance as a 
step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the toughest in the country," massage therapist Bob Dixon 
said.TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; JURY CONVICTS MAN OF STRANGLING WOMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 41-year-old unemployed computer technician who claimed he suffered from 
"concentration camp syndrome" was convicted of first-degree murder Thursday in 
the strangling of a Westminster woman who had helped him in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court jury deliberated less than two hours before 
finding Ly Van Nguyen guilty on the murder count, plus a special allegation 
that the slaying of 28-year-old Cathy Bui occurred during a burglary and 
robbery.He faces life in prison without parole when he is sentenced Dec. 16 by 
Judge David O. Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Lew Rosenblum contended during the trial that Nguyen broke into the 
victim's home in the middle of the night in June, 1993, looking for things to 
steal, and strangled her when she awoke and panicked. A neighbor had said she 
heard a female voice that night calling out, "Who are you? I can't see," and a 
male voice responding, "Don't you remember me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Bui, an electrician at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, found his wife's 
body when he returned home from a weekend business trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a day before the killing, Cathy Bui, a bank teller, had lent Nguyen $100, 
Rosenblum said. She and her husband also had let him stay at their apartment 
with his cousin, who rented a spare bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were nice to him," Rosenblum said. "They were trying to give the guy a 
hand." 
</P>
<P>
 In his closing arguments, Rosenblum attacked defense contentions that Nguyen 
went to borrow money from Bui that night and killed her during a flashback to 
the time he was imprisoned and tortured years ago in a Vietnamese concentration 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are thousands of people who have gone through this experience. It just 
doesn't give them a right to kill." ANNA CEKOLA

 A.G. Currie Middle School will celebrate its designation as one of this year's 
California Distinguished schools today by honoring teachers, students, parents 
and school administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is one of 180 middle and high schools statewide honored by the

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; RESIDENTS SEEKING LIMITS ON TRAIL USE 
</P>

<P>
 Along the miles of trails that wind through the city, the traffic is mostly 
children walking or riding to and from school and an occasional horseback 
rider. 
</P>
<P>
 But in some areas, the dust raised along the trails isn't from children's feet 
or horses' hoofs, but from cars and trucks. A little-known policy allows 
residents to obtain a permit to drive their vehicles on the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of residents have called on the city to stop the practice of granting 
permits and argue that the use of the trails should be limited to pedestrians, 
bike and horse riders. 
</P>
<P>
 But the City Council decided Tuesday to continue allowing cars and trucks to 
share the trails with children, horseback riders, bike riders and joggers. 
Ignoring pleas from residents to at least force permit seekers to receive 
council approval, the council gave full authority for granting permits to City 
Manager Arthur C. Simonian. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you really want to pass an ordinance giving sole discretion to the city 
manager to grant permits?" Joe Markus asked the council. "Keep control of the 
trails with the City Council. The trails should be protected to that degree." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Metz, president of a local equestrian group, said trails should be 
treated the same as ball fields and parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Motor vehicles on trails "interfere with my recreational space," Metz said. "I 
couldn't get a permit to drive my truck through a baseball field." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say there are fewer than 10 residents with permits allowing 
them to drive cars, trucks and recreational vehicles on the trails. Most are on 
the west side of town and are held by residents who want better access to their 
back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few are for people with RVs who only move them a few times a year," City 
Engineer Roy Stephenson said. "The rest are for people who need access for 
hauling manure and hay on a weekly basis." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

MENTOR PROGRAM

<TEXT>
<P>
 The county is seeking a $178,000 state grant to create a mentor program for 
troubled teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 The program would provide teens with "positive adult role models."Together, 
teen-agers and their adult mentors would take part in group and individual 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the program would be to provide the structure and emotional 
support that troubled teens often lack. The mentors would also help them focus 
on school and careers. 
</P>
<P>
 The program would be run by the county's Probation Department and the Anaheim 
Union High School District. It would serve teen-agers in Anaheim, Buena Park 
and Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also would be targeted at youths who have already committed one 
crime and are viewed by probation officials as potential repeat offenders, 
according to a county report on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said "at-risk" teens: 
</P>
<P>
 * Often perform poorly in school, possibly because they have learning 
disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exhibit behavioral problems at school and must be disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 * Abuse drugs or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 * Run away from home or join gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant application was submitted to the state Office of Juvenile Justice 
and Delinquency Prevention. SHELBY GRAD

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; CITY STUDIES RELEASE OF EMPLOYEE PAY 
DATA

<P>
 The City Council postponed a decision this week on releasing salary figures of 
city employees to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Sullivan asked his colleagues to release information about 
specific job positions -- but without the name of the employee -- along with 
the gross salary of those employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do recognize the need for a certain degree of confidentiality -- balanced 
with the public's right to know," Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members expressed concerns about employees' privacy rights. The 
council directed the city attorney's office to further examine the legality of 
the requested action, and asked that Sullivan make his request in writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Arthur Folger said the city does release salary ranges of 
specific positions. But some residents charge that the information does not 
portray the actual salaries and benefits of employees, such as overtime and 
other special pay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Citizens Bureau of Investigation, a watchdog group, supports the city 
release of salary figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very clear that all city employees are paid considerably more than 
workers in the private sector doing comparable work," CBI member Jim Bridges 
said. "This is the reason city employees want to keep their wages secret." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Ralph Bauer said that if the information were made public, citizens 
could use it to make attacks on employees. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Gail C. Hutton said in a report to the council that people don't 
give up their privacy rights simply because they are public employees. "The 
city has consistently taken the position that individual employees have a right 
of privacy that outweighs any public interest in disclosure of the exact 
dollars paid to the employee."DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; 8.4 ACRES DONATED FOR NEW CITY PARK

<P>
 The City Council this week agreed to accept a developer's 8.4-acre donation 
for use as the city's latest public park, Clipper Cove Park.  
</P>
<P>
 The park will have 3.5 acres for two playgrounds, picnic tables, a garden 
area, fitness stations and two turf areas not intended for use in organized 
sports.The park will be located between Thackeray Drive, Clipper Way and 
Kensington Drive and will be surrounded by almost five acres of landscaped 
slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement caps years of negotiations over the proposed park site. The 
delay stemmed partly from an argument between the developer, Shapell Industries 
and the city over who would maintain the slopes around the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the city will maintain 1.4 acres of slopes created when 
the land is graded and the local homeowners association will maintain the rest.

 The Santa Monica law firm of Strumwasser & Woocher was selected this week by 
the City Council to help defend the city against a lawsuit challenging its 
campaign reform ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 In closed-session action, Mayor Linda Moulton Patterson and council members 
Grace Winchell and Ralph Bauer voted to hire the firm.Councilman Victor Leipzig 
cast the opposing vote, and Councilmen David Sullivan and Jim Silva abstained. 
Councilman Earle Robitaille was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Arthur Folger estimated the cost of hiring the outside firm 
at $40,000 to $70,000, depending on how the case proceeds through the court 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was given four candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed Aug. 2 in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, charges that 
the city's campaign law restricts freedom of speech. The city attorney's office 
filed a motion that the suit be dismissed. A judge denied that motion. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit challenges the city's $300 limit on the amount an individual can 
contribute to a committee that uses the money to make independent expenditures 
for or against city candidates.DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; SISTER OF SLAYING VICTIM RECALLS LITTLE 
ABOUT WHAT SHE TOLD POLICE 
</P>

<P>
 The sister of a teen-ager who died after a paint-roller rod pierced his skull 
during a confrontation last year at a San Clemente beach testified Thursday 
that she could not remember much about what she might have told police that 
fateful night. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief testimony of Shellie Woods, sister of victim Steve Woods, came 
Thursday as a trial for one of six defendants charged with the slaying 
continued in Orange County Superior Court in Santa Ana.Juan Alcocer, 20, of San 
Clemente is charged with murder and other felony counts, including allegations 
that he is a gang associate. 
</P>
<P>
 Shellie Woods testified after being subpoenaed by the defense, which sought to 
question her about statements attributed to her in police reports about one of 
her brother's companions possibly being intoxicated on the night of the Oct. 
15, 1993, confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Woods said she recalled very little about what she might have told police. 
"I was in crisis," she testified, under questioning from defense attorney Gene 
E. Dorney. 
</P>
<P>
 She testified that the police report statement in question "didn't even sound 
like it was coming from me." 
</P>
<P>
 Under objections by Deputy Dist. Atty. Gary Paer, Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald 
blocked further questions on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about who or what might have provoked the fatal confrontation 
between Alcocer and his friends and Steve Woods and his friends that night at 
Calafia Beach County Park were the focus of an earlier trial for two other 
defendants in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The spearing took place as Woods and his friends were pelted with blocks of 
wood, paint-roller rods and other items as they tried to drive out of the only 
exit at the beach parking lot. Woods, 17, died about a month later, having 
never regained consciousness. ANNA CEKOLA

MISSED TAX APPEAL DEADLINES MAY COST COUNTY; GOVERNMENT: SEVERAL HUNDRED 
PROPERTY OWNERS FAILED TO GET TIMELY HEARINGS OF ASSESSMENT CHALLENGES. 
OFFICIALS SCRAMBLE TO LEARN THE FISCAL RAMIFICATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 County officials are frantically scrambling to size up the potential damage 
after learning that they might have to refund tax dollars to several hundred 
property owners for failing to hear their assessment appeals within the legal 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be working through the weekend so we can determine the magnitude of the 
problem," County Administrator Ernie Schneider said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation was launched after an assessment appeals board ruled Monday 
that the county must accept the Bank of America's valuation of a property in 
Brea that was about $100 million less than the county claimed, because the 
county missed a Sept. 15 cutoff date to hold an appeals hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 By violating a state law requiring appeals to be heard within two years, 
county officials figure, the county now will be obliged to refund to Bank of 
America $1 million a year for up to three years, the period between the date 
the county assessor received the bank's notice of appeal and the next 
reassessment of the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said it has been estimated that assessment appeals for as many as 
300 other parcels also may be near or past the deadline. Most of these 
properties are residences, which means the tax dollars in dispute won't be 
nearly as great as in the Bank of America case. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is investigating to find how the Bank of America mishap occurred 
and who might be responsible. He said he would have expected the county clerk 
to schedule the hearing before the expiration date, but he would also have 
expected the assessor's caseworker to be aware of upcoming deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 County Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs denied any blame Thursday, pointing at the 
supervisors and the county clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The assessor department does not handle the appeals process," Jacobs said. 
"Under the laws of the state, the appeals process is handled by the Board of 
Supervisors in their duty as a local board of equalization, and they appoint 
the hearing board. 
</P>
<P>
 "The clerk is the officer of the administrative proceedings, handles schedules 
and is responsible to obtain waivers." 
</P>
<P>
 Phyllis Henderson, the county clerk, was unavailable for comment Thursday. 
However, other county officials said she had a written opinion, issued 
previously by the county counsel's office, that she is not responsible for 
alerting the assessor to pending deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner said he was upset by the amount of 
"finger-pointing." 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears to me that authority has been divided between the assessor and the 
clerk of the board, and if that is true, it's pretty difficult to hold people 
accountable. People start playing the blame game." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner added that the loss of county revenues in the Bank of America case 
represented "a significant amount of money, especially when our budget is 
already strained." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was surprised by the situation, particularly because the board "led 
the effort to get the clerk of the board and the assessor the resources they 
needed to deal with their very heavy workload. . . . I don't understand why 
this has occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton said he also would like "to get a straight 
answer." 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems we can't associate a name and face with this misdeed," he said. 
"There has to be some accountability. People shouldn't be allowed to hide 
behind this shroud of bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanton equated the county to a business that has taken steps to reduce its 
expenditures and work force, then "fails to collect on its accounts 
receivable." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs acknowledged that the county has been struggling to keep up with a 
flood of appeals that has hit the assessor's office since a real estate 
recession sent property values plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his office has held or reduced assessments on 257,000 properties this 
year. In addition, he said his office has resolved 27,000 appeals of the 1992 
and 1993 tax assessment rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Schneider said, the county is working through a backlog of 36,000 
remaining appeals.  
</P>
<P>
 "Of those, 300 have somehow fallen through the cracks," he said. Henderson, 
the county clerk, was unable to find the original copies of those appeals to 
check whether the appeals review time has lapsed, Schneider said.  
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said Henderson contends that the assessor's office neglected to send 
them to her. Cary Walker, a spokesman for Bank of America, denied that the bank 
will be receiving a windfall from the county's oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's been suggested that Orange County will lose a considerable 
amount of tax revenue because it failed to grant in a timely manner a hearing 
that the Bank of America was entitled to," he said. "But that assumes the 
county's $119.8-million valuation would have prevailed at the hearing. In fact, 
we believe our valuation of $23.9 million is the correct one." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the property, which became excess with the merger of Bank of America 
and Security Pacific, is now on the market at an asking price of $55 million.

DMV REVIEWS HOW SPEEDER KEPT LICENSE UNTIL FATAL DRIVE; AFTERMATH: SPOKESMAN 
BLAMES GLITCH IN SYSTEM FOR ALLOWING YOUNG MAN WITH FOUR SPEEDING TICKETS IN A 
YEAR BEFORE SILVERADO CANYON TRAGEDY TO KEEP DRIVING. 
</P>

<P>
 As funeral services were arranged Thursday for the 20-year-old woman who was 
struck and killed by a chronic speeder, the Department of Motor Vehicles began 
reviewing a program that allowed the driver to remain on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services for Jasmin Cook will be at 1 p.m. Saturday at the Silverado 
Community Church in Silverado Canyon. Responding to news reports that Cook's 
parents, Ed and Tyra Cook, didn't have enough money to bury their daughter, the 
Shannon-Donegan Mortuary in Orange offered free services, said funeral director 
Gene Beckerbauer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook died Sunday when a driver of a truck struck her and two others -- Shane 
Graham, 19, and Timothy Smart, 21. Graham was released from the hospital 
Wednesday and Smart remains at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana in stable 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the driver, Shane Young, may have been racing with another driver 
heading west along Silverado Canyon Road when he swerved into the threesome 
near Shady Brook Drive. Young was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter and 
felony driving under the influence. The second driver, 19-year-old Clint 
Wamsley, was held on the same charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Young acquired four speeding tickets between May 16, 1993, and May 16, 1994, 
which was enough to get his license revoked, according to DMV officials. But he 
was allowed to retain his driving privileges because of a glitch in a 20-year 
research program that tracks errant drivers. But even if the department had 
suspended Young's license, he could have gotten it back by Monday through the 
DMV's hearing process, said DMV spokesman Bill Madison. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison said DMV officials met Thursday to review the program, called 
Negligent Operator Treatment Evaluation System. The focus of the review is to 
determine whether a chronic speeder such as Young could slip through the system 
again, Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the answer is yes, then we want to look at how we can change it," Madison 
said. "For now, the program is not scheduled to end." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, residents in the tightly knit Silverado Canyon community are trying 
to comfort the Cook family with moral and financial support. A trust fund for 
the family has been established, Silverado Canyon resident Judy Okonski said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt like the Cook family has other needs," Okonski said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $300 was collected Wednesday, said Judi Davis of Canyon Market, 
where the cash collection was taken in a coffee pot. Residents are also 
considering installing a plaque just outside of town urging drivers to slow 
down for the sake of the children, said Davis, whose granddaughter regularly 
plays on the same street where Cook was killed.

 The decision to close the city's Fire Department and join the countywide Joint 
Powers Authority has divided City Council candidates here as neatly as any 
canyon firebreak. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the eight candidates fighting for three open council seats said the 
controversy propelled them to run for office, and they have vowed to bring the 
city department back. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining candidates insist that the Fire Department issue is a "done 
deal" that few residents care about. They are turning to the same pro-business 
and anti-crime issues that fuel other Orange County campaigns. Transportation 
is also a hot topic, with a Buena Park Metrolink station already penned into 
the county's master plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur C. Brown, the only incumbent in the race, said voters understand that 
closing the Fire Department was a prudent financial move, and he has urged them 
to look instead at issues that will determine the future of the city. He 
carries endorsements from Supervisors Gaddi H. Vasquez and William G. Steiner, 
and he has raised about $6,000, including a $500 donation from the Buena Park 
Fireman's Assn. political action committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 57, a retired Los Angeles County deputy sheriff, boasts of the new 
business he has brought into the city. He would work to continue expanding Auto 
Row and the entertainment corridor, he said. He is a member of regional 
agencies such as the Southern California Assn. of Governments and the I-5 Joint 
Powers Assn. in his current council position. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most successful fund-raiser is candidate Patsy Marshall, a former 
journalist who worked in the public relations department of Knott's Berry Farm 
for 18 years and now has her own business. She has raised about $12,000, with 
donations from Knott family members and Steiner's campaign, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, 50, also said the Fire Department issue is moot, and she points to 
crime, business development and graffiti as the real concerns of the community. 
She would make city offices easier for businesses to navigate if elected, she 
said. As a specialist in tourism, Marshall said, she is prepared to shepherd 
the city through upcoming upheavals when Beach Boulevard and Dale Street are 
closed for major improvement projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Larry T. Wieck has raised only about $2,000, but he has name 
recognition from six years on the Planning Commission. An insurance agency 
owner, Wieck, 45, is in his third campaign for a City Council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieck has taken a middle road on the Fire Department issue. He would work to 
heal the divisions caused by the controversy, he said, and he believes his 
appeal to voters lies in his ability to reason and compromise with integrity. 
His expertise in land-use planning would give him an edge in developing new 
business, he said. He is the only candidate to be endorsed by both the Buena 
Park Police Assn. and the Buena Park City Employees Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Another planning commissioner stepping into the ring is Gerald N. Sigler, a 
former manager for U.S. Steel and Ameron Corp. He has pledged to smooth the way 
for new business development, search for government waste in the city and 
promote crime-fighting programs such as Drug Abuse Resistance Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigler, who has raised more than $5,000, is known for 20 years of work with 
the Buena Park Coordinating Council, which helps low-income and homeless 
residents. He also served two years on the Personnel Board and belongs to a 
slew of service groups such as the Elks and the Noon Lions. He has the 
endorsement of the Buena Park Police Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The third candidate to get the nod from the police union is Wiley S. Drake, 
pastor of the First Southern Baptist Church. Drake, 50, was a volunteer 
firefighter when he lived in Texas, and he has vowed to resurrect Buena Park's 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake also said he would propose firing the city manager because he rules by 
intimidation and does not defer to the authority of the council. In an unusual 
twist to the crime issue, Drake said he would fight crime, poverty and graffiti 
by bringing all the clergy of the community into City Hall to offer counsel on 
various issues. In general, he said, he would bring Judeo-Christian values to 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Accountant Larry Barstow, 56, said that he too was pulled into the race by the 
Fire Department controversy, but his main campaign issues are streamlining City 
Hall operations and establishing one-stop shopping for new business. Wasteful 
spending and over-regulation is keeping Buena Park from recovering from the 
recession, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Marilyn Kietzman, 60, points to a long career as a budget analyst 
for McDonnell Douglas as good council preparation. She said she would work to 
establish a new Fire Department and to raise money for the city by proposing an 
entertainment tax. She won the endorsement of the Buena Park City Employees 
Assn. by promising to give them a greater voice in affairs and to cut back 
contracts with outside consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest candidate, Leslie MacAdams, 26, is a physical therapist who was 
drawn into politics by the Fire Department issue. He advocates that the council 
draw up a long-range financial plan and stabilize its policies. And the council 
should be more aggressive in winning and retaining business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 MacAdams said that transportation issues need more attention and that he would 
work to make up for the demise of Dial-A-Ride with a new system. He would like 
to see the entertainment corridor be made more accessible to tourists through 
better transportation links.

LAGUNA BEACH TO BUY 3 LOTS WHERE HOUSES SLID AWAY; LITIGATION: THE ACTION, 
WHICH WILL COST $660,000, WILL FREE THE CITY FROM A TANGLE OF LAWSUITS, CITY 
MANAGER SAYS. THE HILLSIDE WILL BE RESTABILIZED AND THE PROPERTY RESOLD.

<P>
 To resolve a tangle of lawsuits stemming from a 1993 landslide that pitched 
three houses from their foundations, the city has agreed to spend $660,000 to 
buy the lots where the houses once stood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said the city will likely begin restabilizing 
the hillside next week so the lots can be resold. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report to the City Council this week, Frank outlined a web of lawsuits 
that "would brighten the eyes of any aspiring attorney," stemming from the 
January, 1993, slide, including suits filed by two of the property owners 
against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 By purchasing the approximately 28,000 square feet of land, the city would be 
freed of those lawsuits and the possibility of future legal action by the third 
property owner, the report said. The city may be able to recoup the $660,000 
once the land is stabilized and the lots are resold. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the conflicting testimony that often arises over geology, 
hydrology, grading and construction, lawsuits involving landslides can become 
problematic, City Atty. Philip D. Kohn said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Landslide cases are just so expensive to litigate," he said. "They become 
battles among experts." 
</P>
<P>
 The city will also now repair a storm drain and sewer pipes that were damaged 
in the landslide, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, we want to be able to rebuild this hillside," he said. "We 
will be doing work on property we own." 
</P>
<P>
 The city still has one hurdle to clear, however, since a geological firm 
involved in a related lawsuit filed an objection to the property settlement 
Thursday, said Katherine Jenson, another attorney for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Leonard Goldstein will be asked to review 
and approve the land sale today. Jenson said escrow will likely close by 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The landslide, which followed several days of intense rainfall, caused one 
Mystic Lane home to plunge down the hillside and burst into flames, another to 
slip from its foundation and a third to careen forward and collapse like an 
accordion. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by a city-hired geologist said the rain had reactivated an ancient 
landslide.  
</P>
<P>
 Thomas and Gayla Hitzel, whose $750,000 home buckled in the slide, sued the 
city in November, claiming leaks in underground water and sewage pipes weakened 
the earth beneath their home. They said insurance did not cover the loss.  
</P>
<P>
 The city was also sued by property owner Marjean Hanson. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to their lawsuits against the city, Jenson said Hanson and the 
Hitzels sued the Laguna Beach County Water District and Earth Research, a 
geotechnical firm; the city sued the geotechnical firm, and Hanson sued the 
Hitzels. There were also some "peripheral defendants," Jenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has denied fault in the landslide. 
</P>
<P>
 In his report to the council, Frank said there was "an excellent possibility" 
the city would have been cleared of any fault by the courts, but the legal 
defense would have been expensive. The land purchase seemed the most 
expeditious and inexpensive way to resolve the matter, Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted unanimously to pay $200,000 to the Hitzels for their 
land, $300,000 to Hanson and $150,000 to Vida Kucenas, the third property 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Kucenas had filed a claim against the city but had not yet filed a lawsuit, 
Jenson said. Another $10,000 was allocated for other costs related to the 
purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 The property owners could not be reached for comment.

HEALTH OFFICIALS INCREASE SCRUTINY OF COLA BOTTLING PLANT; INVESTIGATION: 
INSPECTIONS AT PEPSI FACILITY'S WAREHOUSE IN BUENA PARK HAVE YIELDED BIRDS, 
DEAD MOUSE. REPORT OF A RAT IN UNOPENED CAN FUELED CONCERN ABOUT SAFEGUARDS. 
</P>

 County health inspectors have increased scrutiny of a Pepsi-Cola bottling 
plant in Buena Park since learning of a woman's contention that she found a 
dead rat in a Pepsi can and since an inspection there Thursday turned up birds 
in the warehouse, a county health official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors from the Orange County Health Care Agency scheduled a follow-up 
inspection in two weeks after finding the birds, one of which was dead. In May, 
inspectors also found birds and one dead mouse in the same warehouse area, 
county health records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery Thursday "has enough significance that we've scheduled an early 
inspection, especially because we noted it in a prior report," said health 
agency Assistant Director James E. Huston. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials said, though, that most of the plant's violations over its 
20-year history have been minor. Overall, its quality control has been good. 
The plant has passed dozens of health inspections, including five in the past 
year by county, state and federal health inspectors, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd consider (their record) fairly typical," said inspector Tom Aherns. "It's 
a large facility, a large number of employees, a building that isn't brand new, 
so you will find violations." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepsi Public Affairs Manager Jeffrey Brown acknowledged that inspectors found 
a dead mouse in May and birds there in May and on Thursday, but said they were 
about 70 yards from the food processing area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives absolutely no credence to a theory that any rodent could get into 
our manufacturing process and beyond safety procedures," Brown said. "It is 
highly improbable that a rodent could compromise Pepsi's many safety 
procedures." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, 22-year-old Maria Del Consuelo Lazaro filed a lawsuit against Pepsi 
Cola Inc. and Albertson's grocery store chain. Lazaro, a schoolteacher from 
Jalisco, Mexico, alleges that she became sick in July after she drank from a 
Diet Pepsi can she had bought at an Albertson's. Staff at Anaheim General 
Hospital cut open the can and found the remains of a rat, according to the 
lawsuit. The hospital sent the can and its contents to the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration, which confirmed that the can contained a rat. 
</P>
<P>
 County health records also show that cans of Pepsi from the same plant were 
the subject of complaints about something that looked like a bone and a 
"cockroach-like object" in March, 1989, and October, 1992. Inspections turned 
up no serious health code violations. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, 1990, inspectors went to the plant because of a complaint that 
pallets from the plant's warehouse were "infested" with rats. Inspectors found 
neither rats nor rat droppings, but nevertheless recommended that that doors 
between the warehouse and the cola processing area be "rodent-proof." 
</P>
<P>
 In May of this year, inspectors told Pepsi managers to "exterminate the 
infestation of birds and rodents in the warehouse. Observed some birds and a 
dead mouse at the time of this inspection." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the use of the word "infestation" in the report was exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Infestation to them could mean the possibility of a rat in there," Brown 
said. "It doesn't mean there were scores of rats." He said the company has been 
working for months on humane ways to eliminate the birds.

 Al Mijares, superintendent of the Bakersfield City School District, is being 
courted by the Santa Ana Unified School District for its top job. 
</P>
<P>
 Mijares recently was interviewed by the Santa Ana school board, said schools 
spokeswoman Diane Thomas.The board is seeking a replacement for Rudy M. 
Castruita, who left in July to head the San Diego County Department of 
Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas emphasized that Mijares is not the only candidate being considered, but 
she declined give a number. She said she expects the trustees to make a 
decision within a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to move toward a good decision as soon as they can without rushing 
themselves," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Bakersfield school district trustee said he believes Mijares is Santa Ana's 
top pick, according to a report in the Bakersfield Californian. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas declined comment on Mijares' ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 Mijares, 41, took over the Bakersfield superintendency in January, 1993. He 
could not be reached for comment.

 Four devoutly religious women lived across the street from a bordello. They 
would watch the front door of the bordello and remark about everyone entering 
and leaving. As they looked one night, the first person to emerge was the

YOUR WHEELS: THE GOODS; COMPUTER'S CONFUSION CAN CAUSE HESITATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Question: I have a 1986 Chevrolet Celebrity with a four-cylinder engine. When 
I suddenly accelerate from either a stop or to pass another car, the engine 
hesitates a few seconds. I have changed the fuel filter and the transmission 
fluid and run a few cans of fuel injection cleaner through the gas tank, but 
nothing has corrected the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Please advise. 
</P>
<P>
 -- J.W.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: The remedies you have tried are inexpensive and simple, but miss the 
mark. The problem is not likely to be caused by a dirty filter or clogged fuel 
injectors, but rather by the complex computer system that operates the engine. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2.5-liter "Iron Duke" engine in your Celebrity has two sensors -- the 
throttle position sensor and the manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor -- 
that help the car's computer determine the correct amount of fuel to feed the 
engine. 
</P>
<P>
 In a fuel-injected engine, when you push down on the accelerator pedal, more 
air flows into the engine's intake manifold. A cable from the pedal opens up a 
valve that controls the amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The engine needs extra gas for additional air. So, the pedal is also connected 
to the throttle position sensor, which allows the computer to order the fuel 
injectors to squirt more gasoline into the manifold. 
</P>
<P>
 The throttle sensor, a rheostat, has copper wire wound around a core and a 
copper brush that moves along the wire. The wires can become corroded and the 
rheostat fails to operate reliably. 
</P>
<P>
 The second possible problem is the MAP sensor, which measures the vacuum 
inside the intake manifold where fuel and air are mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 When you depress the accelerator and the extra air rushes into the manifold, 
the vacuum level drops. The MAP sensor detects this and tells the computer the 
engine needs more fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 Each sensor provides a separate reading of how much power the driver wants. If 
one fails, the computer will need a few seconds to determine something is amiss 
and get information from the backup sensor to make a correction. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort by the computer to correct the discrepancy between sensors is 
probably the hesitation you are experiencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's one way you may be able to narrow down which sensor is failing. The MAP 
sensor also serves to tell the computer the outside barometric pressure, which 
is affected by weather and altitude. As the pressure drops, the computer 
supplies less gasoline to the engine. So, if you also have the problem on low 
pressure days or on trips in the high mountains, it is likely that the MAP 
sensor is the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, any mechanic with a diagnostic computer can quickly determine which 
sensor is failing.

BACK HOME AGAIN; AFTER 29 YEARS AWAY, THE GLENDALE SYMPHONY RETURNS TO THE 
COMMUNITY, TAKING UP RESIDENCE AT THE ALEX THEATRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

The Times.

<P>
 The Glendale Symphony Orchestra's concert tomorrow night at the Alex Theatre 
marks not only the launching of its 71st season, but a homecoming as well: For 
the first time since 1965, when it took up residence at the Music Center's 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the ensemble will be based in the community for 
which it is named. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no venue here to hold the orchestra as it grew," says Noel R. 
Veden, president of the Glendale Symphony Orchestra Assn. of the nearly 
three-decades stay in Downtown Los Angeles. As the years passed, concert 
scheduling proved less than satisfactory at the Music Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were right to the walls with production. (Music Center Operating Co. 
booking manager) Gordon Jenkins just could never give us the dates we needed -- 
we'd get Mother's Day, Super Bowl Sunday. We could never get Fridays or 
Saturdays," Veden says. 
</P>
<P>
 With the renovation of the Alex Theatre, talks began between Veden's 
predecessor and theater board members, which set the wheels in motion for a 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 First, however, the theater had to pass musical muster. Lalo Schifrin, the 
renowned composer who has been the orchestra's music director since 1989, 
brought a team of experts -- an architect, the orchestra's two librarians and 
Carmine Marinelli, the pavilion's veteran master of properties -- to judge the 
hall for its acoustics, stage space and other considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 The only change required was the addition of a new acoustic stage shell to 
eliminate the need for microphone amplification. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble's relocation was announced a year ago, two months before the 
theater reopened with a New Year's Eve concert featuring the orchestra and 
Robert Guillaume. The parting with the Music Center has been amicable -- the 
traditional Christmas concert on Dec. 13 will still take place at the pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we told Gordon we wouldn't be coming back, he said, 'Good for you,' " 
Veden says. 
</P>
<P>
 The change of venue has brought about some other changes. The season has been 
reduced from six concerts to five for this trial run, and the orchestra itself 
has been scaled back from 96 players to 70, the maximum the Alex stage can 
accommodate. Veden says he is unaware of any complaints from the musicians who 
lost their jobs. The group is contracted from the local pool of busy and 
well-paid film and television studio musicians who enjoy an occasional 
opportunity to play live classical music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schifrin, 62, the Argentine-born composer of serious music and such popular 
works as the television series theme "Mission: Impossible," sees the resulting 
season as a "rejuvenation. This is almost like starting all over again -- we're 
changing the programming to a classical-sized orchestra, with less woodwinds 
and strings and no percussion unless we call them in from the outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's concert, for instance, begins with the Ballet Suite from 
Stravinsky's "Pulcinella," which Schifrin calls "a joyous piece, very delicate, 
by a contemporary composer but paying tribute to the Baroque music of Italy." 
</P>
<P>
 Two symphony principals, flutist Sheridon Stokes and harpist Marcia Dickstein, 
will be featured next in Mozart's Concerto for Flute and Harp in C Major, and 
post-intermission, 12-year-old Jun Asai plays Beethoven's Piano Concerto No. 1 
in C Major. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of trying to open with big fireworks, mesmerize the audience and 
shake them up with a lot of pyrotechnics, this is going to be more seducing," 
Schifrin says of the program. "This is delicate, transparent. We hope we're 
going to be able to bring the most finesse, the brilliant but subtle nuances of 
dynamics. Now we won't be able to hide behind the cymbals and trombones. I 
think that will be very good for the orchestra, a good inspiration to do this 
music, which is refined." 
</P>
<P>
 Schifrin's penchant for innovative programming is evidenced in the Jan. 14 
concert, featuring three piano works, by Grieg, Rachmaninoff and Gershwin, 
played by Lincoln Mayorga, John Novacek and Mark Richman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took this idea from the three tenors," he says of the concerts in Italy and 
Los Angeles for which he composed and contributed arrangements. "As an encore, 
there will be a Scott Joplin rag, an arrangement for six hands." 
</P>
<P>
 The March 4 program features Roberto Cani in Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto as 
well as Ravel's "Le Tombeau de Couperin" and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. The 
April 22 season finale, "More . . . Jazz Meets the Symphony" is an encore of 
last year's well-received experiment in which the orchestra teamed up with 
noted jazz bassist Ray Brown, trumpeter Jon Faddis and drummer Grady Tate. This 
year, James Moody joins them on saxophone. 
</P>
<P>
 Schifrin is pleased with the Alex collaboration, but says the door remains 
open for a return to the Music Center if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The symphony will save $20,000 per concert in rental, parking and other fees 
despite a seating capacity of 1,450 compared to the pavilion's 3,200, Veden 
says. Nearly 1,000 subscriptions have been sold, compared to last year's tally 
of 1,100, accounting for about 66% of seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased revenue could allow them to present a Friday night series and 
more school concerts. Such figures, Veden says, "make it possible for us to 
dream bigger dreams." Where and When

SAX SINGS AUTUMN BLUES; JAZZ VETERAN CHARLES OWENS MAKES TENOR HIS 'BREAD AND 
BUTTER.' HE ALSO HAS A WEAK SPOT FOR LATIN SOUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra is holding forth on a recent Sunday at the 
Jazz Bakery in Cul ver City, and protean tenor saxophonist Charles Owens is 
featured on a slow, sultry blues number. The notes he plays are breathy and 
long, like gusts of warm autumn wind, and the feelings underpinning these tones 
swirl around you, warming you like a friend's arm wrapped over your shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Owens also focuses on soprano saxophone and flute, he calls tenor sax 
his "bread and butter horn." "That's where I get my best sound," says Owens, a 
young 55 and veteran of ensembles led by such name jazz folk as Buddy Rich, 
Mongo Santamaria and Mercer Ellington. "It's a deeper, richer, bigger sound, 
and I'm more emotional on that horn." 
</P>
<P>
 And while he's well-versed in the blues and other strictly jazz modes such as 
be-bop, Owens has long had a weak spot for Latin grooves. He discovered Latin 
music while stationed in Puerto Rico in the Air Force in the early 1960s and 
deepened his affection during his 1970-71 stint with Santamaria, one of Latin 
jazz's most influential conga drummers. Moving to Los Angeles in 1972, he has 
found work with many Latin greats, from Willie Bobo to Francisco Aquabella. 
</P>
<P>
 "That music did something to me," he says. "It had so much power. It took me 
to another musical environment. And I started to appreciate the history of the 
conga in Latin jazz."  
</P>
<P>
 The saxophonist plays tonight with a quartet at Chadney's. His bassist, 
Roberto Miranda, also will bring along his conga, and there's a good chance 
congero Ray Armando will sit in. Owens relishes the times he can work with just 
a conga, or regular trap, drummer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing without a pianist or bassist frees me up so I can play anything. At 
the same time, it leaves me more exposed," he says. "I listen to the drummer 
play a pattern, and I try to put a melody together right quick. Sometimes I 
just try to find sounds I haven't played before. Hopefully, that will never 
end." 
</P>
<P>
 Situations like these often make for optimum improvising. "The greatest solos 
are composed of those moments when you're not thinking, flying blind, where you 
play something that you hadn't thought of," he says. "That's when you're 
playing what you're supposed to play, when your natural essence comes out. And 
sometimes that's when you get the best reaction from people, just being open 
and honest, which is very satisfying." 
</P>
<P>
 Owens will be surrounded at Chadney's by familiar musicians -- drummer Roy 
McCurdy, bassist Miranda and pianist Kevin Toney -- who have never worked 
together as a foursome. "So we'll see what kind of magic they bring about," 
Owens says. 
</P>
<P>
 The saxophonist pays high compliments to all his partners, but singles out 
McCurdy, the veteran drum ace who has toured and recorded with such greats as 
Sonny Rollins, Cannonball Adderley and Nancy Wilson. "McCurdy plays the 
grooviest straight-down-the-line time you ever heard," he says. "You count the 
tune off at a certain tempo, and that's where it stays until the end. I 
remember hearing him with Sonny on one record, and I was so impressed by his 
exactness. It was almost like looking at a diamond. He never wastes any motion 
but nevertheless he's exciting and progressive. He's talking to you all the 
time. I get chills even thinking about the gig." 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Duke, who books Chadney's, says that Owens inspires similar feelings of 
regard from other musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I noticed the way his players looked at him the first time he played 
Chadney's," says Duke. "They seemed to love being around him. And not just 
those guys on the bandstand, but players in the audience too." 
</P>
<P>
 Owens, a native of Phoenix, grew up in San Diego in a musically rich 
environment. Before he was a teen-ager he knew he wanted to be a professional 
musician. He started playing saxophone at age 7, and by 10 he and his 
saxophone-toting friends were working on such die-hards of the jazz repertoire 
as Milt Jackson's "Bag's Groove." 
</P>
<P>
 "As young cats, we were hip, we were into it," he says with an infectious 
smile. And he was listening to the master of be-bop, Charlie Parker. "I 
couldn't imagine anybody that good," he says. "I didn't know what he was doing, 
but I was impressed by it." Where and When

PAINFUL FACTS OF LIFE; THE YOUNG CHARACTERS IN 'CARELESS LOVE' FACE GROWN-UP 
ISSUES WHEN THEY GRAPPLE WITH AN UNPLANNED PREGNANCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T.H. McCulloh writes regularly about 
theater for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's one of the oldest stories in the world, but young people keep playing it 
out as though it's brand-new. A good time is had by all, and then the bad time 
begins. She makes a phone call to announce that she's pregnant. He says he'll 
pay for the abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright John Olive calls it "Careless Love." Even though he wrote the play 
in 1984, his take on the problem is still pertinent today. 
</P>
<P>
 For director Richard Scelfo, whose production opens tonight at the Whitefire 
Theatre, the play recalls a similar experience. "There is a parallel in my life 
to this story," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always think, what would it have been like? How old would he or she be now. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We were actually both too young. The woman was not ready to be a mother, or a 
wife, for that matter. So we went ahead and had one of those terrible, in those 
days, back-alley abortions before the whole issue was addressed politically." 
</P>
<P>
 Now abortion is legal, which takes the characters in the play -- an actor 
named Jack, played by Patrick Tanzillo, and a dancer named Martha, played by 
the director's daughter, Leonora Scelfo -- in a different direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanzillo's character is immature, not ready to deal with the responsibilities 
of parenthood, but less marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanzillo said: "Jack makes the decision in the beginning that Martha should 
have the abortion. He hasn't had the time to grow up and realize what he's 
doing. And when he does grow up, it's too late. He's going to have to live with 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Martha feels that it is her body and her baby. She decides to have the 
baby and put it up for adoption, creating another problem for Jack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking at it from the male's point of view," Tanzillo explained. "There 
are lines that just really hit home. I've had a couple of very close friends 
this happened to. They decided to have the baby and get married. They have two 
or three kids now. There are others who had the abortion and now are thinking 
twice about it, having self-recrimination about it." 
</P>
<P>
 In an out-of-wedlock affair, director Scelfo said, men often feel like a 
second banana in terms of having a say in the decision-making. "There's a 
certain unfairness about that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonora Scelfo said her character takes full responsibility for the situation. 
"Ultimately, that's what women have to do. I don't care how far we've 
progressed. When it comes down to it, it's the woman's choice, whether it's a 
good thing or a bad thing. She takes the bull by the horn and makes a decision 
she can live with. And that's why I feel good about this character. She's 
strong; she's able to keep everything in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Martha's decision might make Olive's drama sound like a pro-life play. That 
isn't the way Tanzillo sees it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pro-everything," he said. "It's pro-life, it's pro-choice. The only 
thing it's not pro is father helping with the decision. In the play, Jack says: 
'It's my baby too. I have the right to decide what happens.' It's whatever she 
wants. And that's a tough thing for anybody to go through." 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone changes during the play, as someone must in any good drama, it's 
Jack, the selfish, career-oriented actor. Tanzillo thinks the character grows 
into the possibility of a better future at the end, but his director doesn't 
totally agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't really achieve transformations in life from one level to the next 
without these experiences, these experiences where we're really right up 
against it, where we've got to stand for something or not," director Scelfo 
said. "We come up to these tests. We learn from the degree of pain we 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter added: "You don't really learn from experience. You learn from 
reflection on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanzillo wants others to learn the lesson in the play. He hopes teen-age girls 
and those "young men who still don't want to use condoms" will view the play. 
"This is a great wake-up call before something like this can actually happen -- 
if they continue being stupid." Where and When

THEATER REVIEW; TWO OUT OF 'SIX' AREN'T BAD; ECLECTIC COMPANY HAS A PAIR OF 
STANDOUTS AMONG THE HALF-DOZEN COMEDY SKETCHES OFFERED IN 'QUICKIES' AT ITS NEW 
VALLEY THEATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T. H. McCulloh writes regularly about

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Eclectic Company, formerly Theatre 6470 in Hollywood, has inaugurated a 
new Valley space, the EC.CO Theatre, with a collection of short comedy pieces 
called "Six Quickies." 
</P>
<P>
 The group is a collective and has no artistic director. Pity. An artistic 
director might have persuaded the company to look further for some of its 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the pieces qualifies as an honest one-act. David Ives' "Seven 
Menus" came from New York's worthy Ensemble Studio Theatre and was first seen 
in Los Angeles at the Ensemble's Western branch several years ago. It opens as 
Paul, Hazel, Ruth and Jack are having dinner at a restaurant called Seven 
Menus. They are as matched and mismatched as most couples, except that Jack is 
awfully edgy, not a good omen for his relationship with Ruth. A bell brings a 
blackout, and when the lights go up, Barry has joined the table as Ruth's 
newest lover and fiance. Life, after all, does go on. Each time the bell 
sounds, the game of musical chairs and unmusical couples changes. Ives' comment 
on the vagaries of mating in the '80s is funny and character-rich. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other substantial sketch is Fredric Sirasky's "Power Video," in which 
two aging, rock-obsessed Valley Girl types (Janet Borrus, Jill Holden) in 
Madonna-like undress talk in MTV-speak until they are interrupted by a teen-age 
boy (Tyren Elwee) with a boom box playing Guy Lombardo-ish music. He calls rock 
"anachronistic" and tells them to grow up. After an illogical meeting with a 
former pal and her British rock star husband (Nancy Anne Baker, Brad Harrison) 
in their local mall, one of them does. After all, she says, "we're 35 years 
old." 
</P>
<P>
 In both these pieces, the performances are on the button and bring to life the 
logic in the former and the illogic in the latter. They don't have as much luck 
with the other numbers in their act. 
</P>
<P>
 Sirasky's "Tandem" has something obtuse to say about male fear of dominating 
females, but Frederick Stroppel's "A Chance Meeting" and "Package Deal" belong 
on "Saturday Night Live," not on a live stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening, which begins with "Seven Menus," slides slowly downward until it 
reaches the bottom, Nancy Beverly's "Attack of the Moral Fuzzies." Using a 
quiz-show format (ain't that original?), Beverly tries to comment on the 
confusion of making a choice about where to donate all your excess dollars, but 
the writing and the presentation are so trite that it becomes a great deal of 
ado about nothing of importance. Where and When 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Six Quickies."  
</P>
<P>
 Location: EC.CO Theatre, 5312 Laurel Canyon Blvd., North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 8 p.m. Thursday to Saturday. Ends Nov. 12.

GIVING CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE; LEAGUE'S AWARDS WILL PAY TRIBUTE TO INDIVIDUALS 
AND DRAW ATTENTION TO VALLEY'S HIGH-QUALITY STAGE WORK. 
</P>

<P>
 There are those who question the value of awards, from the Oscars and the 
Tonys on down. But awards have always exist ed, and they seem to proliferate 
yearly. 
</P>
<P>
 There are good reasons for this, according to the Valley Theatre League and 
the organizers of the first Artistic Director Achievement Awards, which will be 
presented Wednesday at the Academy Plaza Theatre in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards, which will honor San Fernando Valley theater productions staged 
the past two years, were created for a number of reasons, according to Edmund 
Gaynes, who along with Cynthia Baer helped organize this inaugural event. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 1 reason, Gaynes said, "is to recognize achievement, and to show our 
appreciation to all the people who work so hard for so little in our theaters. 
Another is definitely for morale and spirit. And also for visibility for the 
theaters in the Valley, which are getting the short end of the stick in 
coverage. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt there is a need to let people know that the theaters are here and 
they're high-quality professional theaters." 
</P>
<P>
 The initial presentation of the ADA Awards, celebrating the second anniversary 
of formation of the league, will be emceed by television and radio personality 
Tom Hatten. Presenters will include Kevin Dobson, Noel Harrison, Peter Mark 
Richman and Alley Mills, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 League President David Cox, artistic director of American Renegade Theatre, 
suggested the awards to the league, patterning them after similar ones he has 
started giving at his theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said it's important to pay tribute to small theaters and the people who 
produce their shows, largely on a volunteer basis, or for just "a pittance of 
pay. These people work very hard with little recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaynes, whose West End Playhouse was closed because of the January quake, and 
Baer, whose Richard Basehart Playhouse also recently closed, said the awards 
will honor nominees in 33 categories, ranging from direction, writing and 
acting to technical areas, including stage management, a job rarely given a 
nod. 
</P>
<P>
 Artistic directors at Valley theaters made the initial nominations, which were 
later narrowed down by a league committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaynes said the selection process is similar to the system used for the Tony 
Awards. "They have a committee of critics and other professionals who make 
judgments that have to be objective. We had to do the same thing. None of this 
is an exact science. We try to make objective judgments of what fit the 
categories most appropriately, measuring the subjective criteria you have as to 
your perception of the shows." 
</P>
<P>
 Baer added: "It's not as though we don't know each other's work. We really 
know each other very well." 
</P>
<P>
 The organizers believe that Valley theaters need more visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been an amazing amount of critically acclaimed shows out here in 
the Valley, and no one pays attention to them," Cox said. "It makes you think." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's also consciousness-raising," Baer added. "For some strange reason, 
people think once you cross the Santa Monica Mountains, you're into community 
theater. That's not true at all. The actors, directors and writers who work out 
here are the same actors, directors and writers who work over the hills. We 
want to make people understand that this is one city and they all live within 
this one city." 
</P>
<P>
 The thought that eludes most people, Cox added, "and should be brought out 
more and more, is that we are the embryonic stages of all the stuff that goes 
on. Broadway starts on a grass-roots level like this. So do the movies. Until 
people realize that these little theaters are where the creativity starts, and 
give them their just due, we're going to be fighting this battle." 
</P>
<P>
 The awards will also bring theater people together, Baer said. "It brings back 
a very wonderful experience that went on for months and months. That's the 
nurturing of theater people that's so necessary. It is a community. It's a 
heritage. It's very hard work for the love of it." Where and When

PARENTING; KEEPING THE PEACE AT HOLIDAY TIME; ADVANCE PLANNING WITH FAMILY 
MEMBERS CAN HEAD OFF POTENTIAL CONFLICTS ABOUT WHERE AND WITH WHOM TO SHARE THE 
FESTIVITIES.

<P>
 Whether it involves a heated debate or the "eenie, meenie, minie, moe" method, 
de ciding where and how to spend the holidays can be a complicated, even 
agonizing choice for many families. 
</P>
<P>
 Far-flung relatives, mixed religious traditions, children who don't fare well 
on airplanes -- these are all factors that can make the season far from jolly 
for well-intentioned moms and dads.  
</P>
<P>
 "Negotiating who's going where can be very difficult at times," acknowledges 
Melanie Allen, Ph.D., a Sherman Oaks clinical psychologist. Allen, who knows 
people who have eaten more than one turkey dinner in the same town on the same 
day, says most families in close proximity to loved ones still have less to 
grapple with than those with out-of-town travel obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever the situation, Allen believes that advance planning -- and 
sensitivity to the needs and wants of all involved -- can head off the worst of 
the season's potential conflicts.  
</P>
<P>
 Janet Orsi Shuman of Studio City is a firm believer in well-organized holidays 
that divide duties as hosts among family and friends, in more or less unvarying 
arrangements.  
</P>
<P>
 "My brother always handles Thanksgiving; my friend Debbie and I alternate the 
hosting of Christmas," says Shuman, a Roman Catholic whose husband, Phil, is 
Jewish. The couple spends the Jewish holidays with friends, whom Shuman calls 
her "extended" family.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the potentially charged issue of mixed religious backgrounds is often 
successfully addressed by couples who celebrate multiple holidays rather than 
choosing one over another. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheri Gilreath of Calabasas, who was raised Jewish, and her husband, Alan, a 
non-practicing Lutheran, have incorporated both of their traditions into their 
easygoing holiday rituals. The pair observes Christmas and Hanukkah in the 
company of their children, Dana, 16, and Greg, 12, along with Alan's parents, 
who live in West Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 Such rituals tend to be particularly important to small children, who are only 
beginning to discover the joy and meaning of the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Jodie Reff, who plans to host a family Hanukkah celebration this year at her 
Sherman Oaks home, will also, at the request of her 4-year-old daughter, 
Jessica, produce a children's Hanukkah party. Already Jodie expects the event 
to become a family tradition, and Jessica is bubbling with excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mommy is making potato pancakes," she reveals.  
</P>
<P>
 But what of families facing more complicated logistics: parents out of state, 
elderly uncles, the prospect of lugging kids and presents across country with 
only a couple of days in which to do it?  
</P>
<P>
 For those coming to grips with where and how to go, Allen suggests an 
effective problem-solving technique: contracting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say there are family members in New York and more still in Denver, and 
with one long weekend you can't see them both. Families should interact, make 
decisions and fill out a simple agreement on paper, informing all family 
members of the decisions while asking them to respect and honor them," she 
advises. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, she encourages families to make plans as early as possible -- up 
to three or four months in advance.  
</P>
<P>
 "When decisions like these are made at the last minute, it is much easier for 
pressure to be applied by one family member or another, when emotions may be 
running high during the holidays," Allen says. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, there are always those who remain cool by refusing to plan 
at all. Gilreath's family, for example, rarely determines very far in advance 
where they will spend a particular holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times, we just decide at the last minute," Gilreath says, fully 
aware that such a loose structure is probably incomprehensible to many. She is 
still unsure, she reports, where her clan will be come Hanukkah, yet none of 
them is the least bit stressed about it.  
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes to traditions in stone, I guess we really don't have any," 
Gilreath concedes. "But we always have a good time and that's what's 
important."

THE BODY ELECTRIC; ENERGY AND MOVEMENT LEAP FROM PATTI ALLEN-AKESSON'S CANVASES 
AND SCULPTURES. THE ARTIST DRAWS FROM HER LONG ASSOCIATION WITH DANCING IN HER 
DEPICTIONS OF THE HUMAN FORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Movement is at the soul of Patti Allen-Akesson's figures. A kinetic energy 
emanates from the drawings, paintings and larger-than-life wood sculptures on 
view in her solo show at the Orlando Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only natural for Allen-Akesson to engulf herself in motion. The 
48-year-old Los Angeles artist has been a dancer almost all of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm obsessed with this human form," Allen-Akesson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking about "Chorus Line," her series of acrylic paintings on paper, she 
said: "I work on form first with movement. Every position has to come from 
reality somewhere. Then, as I'm applying the paint, I'm thinking of the 
psychological or sensory way it would impact people. They are all very layered 
with tar, asphalt and texture paste from acrylic paint. I can't seem not to do 
a series. (The figures) are always moving in my head." 
</P>
<P>
 "Being an ex-dancer, I relate to her movement, her choreography," said Bob 
Gino, director of the Sherman Oaks gallery. "I feel her works are 
choreographed. Your eye just keeps undulating because she moves in and out of 
these forms. Because of that, the sensuality is tremendous. And color becomes 
an integral part of her work. It's an important factor in the way she expresses 
herself. She uses color that creates light, inner light. The body is always 
luminous. There's so much beauty in her works and it comes from within her. She 
has a comment to make that's very integral to herself and the art world." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen-Akesson begins all of her earthy figures from their center or "hara," 
the Japanese and Chinese word for the "center of your being," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even before I found the word hara , I started paintings from the center. 
Dancers are always told to find your center. Hara relates to the center where 
your spirit, your being resides. It's a psychological part of your being, and 
you need it to be in balance everywhere. It comes from within, and it feeds the 
soul and the mind. It changes all the time. It's elusive to paint it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From drawing and painting, Allen-Akesson moved into making large, 
three-dimensional wood figures. The intertwined figures of the sculptures "My 
Friends, All Graham Dancers" and "Caught in the Center" have all been carved 
into typical poses of Martha Graham dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt constricted in the flat format. I guess the energy got kind of big," 
she said. They "grow from the sensation of the wood." 
</P>
<P>
 "She makes the grain of the wood work as part of the body," Gino said. "You 
have to have an eye to see that. It doesn't come naturally." 
</P>
<P>
 Solid steel and screens made of steel wire form the haras of her most recent 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the strength of steel. It represents a solid inner core," 
Allen-Akesson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though she continues to create full-bodied female figures, glorifying womanly 
life with a natural sense of well-being, Allen-Akesson said she might start 
doing male nudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason I paint female is I can feel it easier," she said. "People 
paint what they know most. Your background is subconsciously always there, and 
then you interpret it. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her paintings is "Response," which depicts a couple of people who refuse 
to look and listen. It is the artists' response to "a feeling I get that 
sometimes people don't want to look at my work," she said. "Some of these 
figures frighten people. They're a little intimidated. (The figures) are 
energetic, strong, powerful; they're real. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope people get emotion from them. That is important, and any emotion is 
good. I do hope that they won't be afraid of them. I'd like people to look at 
the figure in a different way, or at the energy in one's self. Maybe they could 
bring that out." Where and When

 There are nearly 1,000 species of bats, which together account for almost a 
quarter of all mammal species. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tropical bats play key roles in rain-forest ecosystems, which rely on the 
bats to pollinate flowers and disperse seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bats are the slowest-reproducing mammals on Earth for their size; most 
produce only one offspring a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vampire bats adopt orphans and have been known to risk their lives to share 
food with less fortunate roost-mates.

ON THE PROWL FOR BATS; THE CREATURES' POPULARITY IS TAKING FLIGHT. FANS HANG 
WOODEN HOUSES TO LURE THEM CLOSE TO HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bats are our friends. Really. With Halloween on its way, this might not be the 
time of year to convince people of the value of these odd-looking mammals, but 
the truth is, bats have a role to play in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, more and more people are finding bats so fascinating that they are 
trying to attract them to their neighborhoods by hanging wooden bat houses on 
their property. Others are trying to locate the creatures by buying $250 
ultrasound bat detectors, while fellow enthusiasts support bat-based research 
by joining the 12,000-member Bat Conservation International Inc. (BCI), based 
in Austin, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 The flying mammals are particularly interesting to children, who are often 
attracted to bats because of their mysterious-looking bodies and nocturnal 
lifestyle, says Bill Kennerly, a BCI member from Winnetka.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents, however, might be put off by the time-honored association of bats 
with blood and disease. While prevailing fears are likely to be exaggerated, 
George Phipps, chief veterinarian for the city of Los Angeles, warns against 
picking up and handling any wild animal, especially bats, which may indeed 
carry rabies.  
</P>
<P>
 The thrill of danger does, of course, contribute to the allure of the small, 
winged creatures. Recalling his own childhood bat fixation, Kennerly says, "The 
fascination was more morbid because of their association with vampires and 
Dracula and all that." 
</P>
<P>
 For Kennerly, a graduate student in music at Cal State Northridge, the thrill 
never has worn off. Recently, he bought a book on how to build a bat house, a 
wooden, vented, mailbox-sized box designed to attract homeless bats and provide 
roosting chambers and places for nursery colonies. He plans to construct the 
house soon -- after he talks to his neighbors about the benefits of having bats 
on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 According to BCI, these benefits are considerable. Bats are the major 
predators of night-flying insects: A single brown bat can eat 600 mosquitoes an 
hour. Bats also pollinate flowers and disperse seeds. And BCI members say they 
are fun to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran bat watcher Suzanne McPhee first discovered this when a group of brown 
bat babies showed up under the eaves of an old stable where she used to ride. 
McPhee helped a friend care for the newborns and fell in love with them.  
</P>
<P>
 McPhee, who has just hung up a bat house at her Northridge condominium, 
believes that bats offer children a terrific opportunity to learn how to study 
the biological world and to understand something about ecosystems, migration, 
hibernation and endangered species.  
</P>
<P>
 According to McPhee, brown bats and Mexican free-tailed bats can be widely 
seen in the San Fernando and surrounding valleys, especially under street 
lights -- where they come to feed on insects -- under eaves and near ponds and 
lakes.  
</P>
<P>
 McPhee encourages families to learn more about bats so they can help protect 
them. BCI says bats are among the world's least appreciated and most endangered 
animals, and the primary cause of their decline is destruction by humans acting 
out of fear or ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bats are needless victims of human misunderstanding," says McPhee, who is a 
pilot with Med West Inc. in Canoga Park. "And they're fun." WHERE AND WHEN

CLUB SCENE; LOVE AND THE YOUNG INSOMNIAC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA L. OLIANDE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most people enjoy radio station KROQ-FM's call-in advice program "Loveline" 
from the privacy of their homes and cars. Others prefer a more active 
experience, listening along with fellow patrons at the Insomnia Cafe in Sherman 
Oaks, where the show is broadcast over the stereo system each Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 THE LOVE: Reaction was mixed among Insomniacs about having the problems of 
lovelorn radio callers piped into their evening. Some came just for the 
experience of listening to the myriad teen-ager and twentysomething problems in 
a room full of teen-agers and twentysomethings. Others either ignored the radio 
broadcast or were irritated by it. "It's too loud. We can't talk much over it," 
said one man. Still, the program was often drowned out by the din of lively 
conversation in the room. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SCENE: It's a coffeehouse in the true sense of the word -- cozy, smoky and 
full of people chatting, reading, playing cards and hanging out. The decor is a 
mix of older couches and chairs that look as though they're from an 
18th-Century parlor, along with booths, tables and chairs across the room. 
Outside, along Ventura Boulevard, people can sit in movie-theater seats and 
portable chairs and watch the world race by. On the menu are all types of 
coffees and teas, pastries, cold drinks and a few lunch items such as soups and 
sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CROWD: "It's a good age group, not too young and not too old. People come 
in and get along well," said 20-year-old Cynthia Schkliar of Van Nuys. Ages 
range from early teens to late 20s and the regulars are a tightknit bunch. The 
dress is casual, with jeans and T-shirts the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOOD: Most people come for coffee and conversation. A few said it's a nice 
atmosphere for artists and a place to rub elbows with entertainment-industry 
types. Alejandro Seri, 26, of North Hills was in the market for a new hangout 
when he came across Insomnia. "We come for our script meetings," said the 
independent filmmaker. "It's centrally located and it has a creative 
atmosphere. I like to sit here and watch all the different people too." 
</P>
<P>
 THE BAD: A few of the regulars -- and former regulars -- are turned off by the 
crowds that have shown up over the past year. Said Northridge resident Christy 
Marin, 24: "There used to be a variety of people here, but now it's mostly high 
school -- which is OK, because they can't go to places that serve alcohol. But 
I'm not in high school anymore." She added that Insomnia has a nice atmosphere, 
but is too popular for its own good. 
</P>
<P>
 THE WORD: One regular said that her group practically owns the place. But 
she's not against new people coming to her hangout. "If they're good-looking 
and interesting, sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Insomnia Cafe, 13718 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. Hours: 9 a.m. to 4 a.m. 
Fridays and Saturdays, 9 a.m. to 3 a.m. Sundays to Thursdays. (818) 990-9945. " 
Loveline " is broadcast on KROQ 106.7 - FM from 10 p.m. to midnight Sunday to 
Thursday. SYLVIA L. OLIANDE

PARENTING; COVER STORY; MEALS THAT APPEAL; EXPERTS URGE ADULTS TO CREATE 
HEALTHY EATING HABITS BY SETTING AN EXAMPLE. THEY SAY MODERATION IS THE KEY.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The family was seated around the table, hungry for dinner but even hungrier 
for a conversational breakthrough. Our 20-month-old son Christopher was on the 
verge of speaking his first complete sentence, and it seemed inevitable that he 
would utter it during the spirited confusion that is mealtime. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I . . ." he began, grabbing his plate of vegetables and potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "want . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Oh my God, he's going to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coke!" 
</P>
<P>
 What? 
</P>
<P>
 "I want chips," he added earnestly with a smile. "I want cookies." 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 After feeding our three children what we thought was a well-balanced diet with 
occasional snacks, our son's vocabulary sounded like a primer for a junk-food 
junkie. There was no denying it. We swore we never would, but we had become 
slaves to convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, we were not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that helping children cultivate good eating habits in today's 
fast-paced, fast-food world can be difficult for even the most conscientious 
mothers and fathers. But they stress that it's an achievable goal that can lay 
the groundwork for good health and a lifetime of knowledgeable food choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to provide a good foundation, to educate children early," said 
Amy Pearson, chief clinical dietitian at Granada Hills Community Hospital. 
"They may deviate from what they've been taught as they become teen-agers and 
get out on their own, but they usually fall back on what they knew as a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who practice good eating habits themselves are apt to see their 
children do the same. And it is never too early to set an example. "The most 
important thing a parent can do is sit down with their children so they can all 
eat a meal together," said Marla Dishman, an Encino-based dietitian. "That's 
probably more important than what food is being served. Because, in general, 
for kids to develop good eating habits, they need models." 
</P>
<P>
 They also need protein, vitamins and all the other good things that come from 
eating healthy foods. But as most parents know, what looks great on the 
nutritional chart doesn't always appear -- or taste -- as good to children when 
it's on their plate. 
</P>
<P>
 I once tried convincing my 4-year-old daughter Casey to sample some of the 
eggplant sandwich I was eating. "It's good for you," I insisted. "Just a bite. 
Just one bite." After a tearful half-hour she relented. One nibble and one 
murderous expression later she splattered my shirt with the tomato 
sauce-covered sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesson: Fighting kids over food is no fun. Neither is it productive. Respect a 
child's ability to choose. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to be very forceful and make them eat, they're either going to 
throw it up or sit there and cry for an hour," said Eileen Zelig of Chatsworth, 
who has three children. "You have to remember, it's their body and their mouth. 
If you don't let them make the little choices now, they are not going to be 
able to make bigger choices when they are teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts confirm this conclusion. Whether it's a very fussy eater, or simply a 
youngster exercising control in a normal phase of development, pediatricians 
and dietitians say parents should not coerce children to eat a particular food. 
</P>
<P>
 An overly restrictive approach can be as destructive in the long run as 
allowing children to eat anything they want, anytime they want it. And 
occasional, or even regular, trips to a fast-food restaurant will not spell 
doom. Moderation is the key.  
</P>
<P>
 "If my family can eat properly 80% of the time, I consider that success," said 
Linda Vickers, a dietitian and mother of three who teaches nutrition classes at 
Moorpark College. "If the other 20% is spent at McDonald's, Taco Bell or 
whatever, that's OK. This is reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers and others say unrealistic parental expectations can often lead to 
unhealthy turmoil at mealtime. Parents, of course, should introduce new foods 
to their children, but neither fret nor fly off the handle if the offering is 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Steven Nishibayashi, a Glendale pediatrician, agrees: "Just because they 
don't take it one time, doesn't mean they won't like it forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Dishman suggests that parents adopt a policy that allows children to try one 
bite of a new food. If they like it, great. If they don't, no problem. 
Reintroduce it another time. Also, take time to view food from a child's 
perspective. "Instead of canned, slimy fruit or vegetables, most kids prefer 
foods that are hard and crunchy," she said. "Something they can pick up, hold 
in their hands and carry around."  
</P>
<P>
 To that end, make good foods available and accessible during meals and as 
snacks. Keep bananas on the countertop, and grapes, sliced oranges, apples and 
other fresh fruit in the refrigerator. Snap peas, celery and carrot sticks are 
crunchy, ready-to-eat vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 And, don't be afraid to be creative. 
</P>
<P>
 "My children refused to eat broccoli the first time I cooked it," Zelig said. 
"But one time we ordered from a Chinese take-out and they were saying, 'Oh, 
look at the little green trees, the trees taste good, Mommy.' Now they like 
broccoli." 
</P>
<P>
 As in most matters related to raising children, different ages present 
different challenges. Children under 4, for example, go through several stages. 
"They will pick food they like and will stick with it, and then suddenly switch 
to something else," said dietitian Pearson. "It's a normal part of the 
developmental process." 
</P>
<P>
 The key is not to let the changes develop into a matter of conflict. Parents 
concerned about their child's eating habits should talk to other parents. The 
problem is most likely a common one. If a child is losing or gaining a lot of 
weight, professional advice should be sought. But generally, most situations 
can be handled with patience. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be times of good nutrition and times of not-so-good nutrition," 
Nishibayashi said. "It all gets back to parents setting good examples. That 
will be as effective as anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 With that thought in mind, I threw out the case of soda that filled our 
refrigerator, cut in half the stash of Oreos and swore off jumbo-size bags of 
chips. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last few months, producing smoothies has become an art form in our 
household. Lots of fruit is cut up and stored in the refrigerator. Each morning 
and afternoon, part of it is dropped into a blender with fruit juice and ice, 
creating a healthy, refreshing snack -- for everyone. The kids can't guzzle 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, if I can just find a way to work broccoli and cauliflower into the mix .

 Staffer Thaya du Bois has a mischievous smile on her face as she climbs into 
an electric tram at the Los Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some disgusting things in the can, and I thought we might try those 
with the tigers," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Du Bois, the zoo's assistant director of research, is a woman with a mission. 
She wants to enrich the lives of the zoo's captive animals by making their 
habitats more natural and filling up their senses with more sights, smells and 
tactile experiences. Given the city's bare-bones budget for the zoo, du Bois 
doesn't have much money to work with. But she does have a vivid imagination and 
several dozen dedicated volunteers. And, on this particular morning, she has a 
coffee can filled with vials of scent, including a particularly pungent eau de 
wolverine. 
</P>
<P>
 Du Bois hands the feral perfumes over to Bertie Foster, veteran keeper of big 
cats. Like du Bois, Foster is a firm believer in something called behavioral or 
environmental enrichment, a practice at more and more zoos worldwide that seeks 
to better the lives of animals in captivity by giving them more things to do, 
especially things they do in the wild. Du Bois instituted the zoo's behavioral 
enrichment program in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 As du Bois explains, animals in older zoos such as Los Angeles' often spend 
their days in stark, sterile environments, with concrete underneath and little 
to stimulate them. It's no wonder, given the poverty of their daily lives, that 
the caged beasts pace or doze away the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Los Angeles hopes to have a state-of-the-art zoo in which 
enrichment will be built into dynamic, naturalistic exhibits, including such 
amenities as a wave machine that will allow the polar bears to dive in the 
surf. 
</P>
<P>
 But, meanwhile, du Bois and her volunteers are practicing "remedial 
enrichment," trying to better the animals' experience now, by giving them 
things to play with, encouraging them to forage for at least some of their food 
and improvising other ways to keep them busy and engaged. As du Bois explains, 
her work is grounded in her scientific knowledge of animal behavior, but it 
also requires her to enter imaginatively into the minds of her charges. "I try 
to get into an animal's head," she says, "and see how it experiences the world, 
and we try to recreate that as much as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to the tigers and the perfumes. As du Bois and tiger keeper 
Foster know, wild tigers live surrounded by the scents of hundreds of other 
animals. So when du Bois arrives with her cache of smells, Foster picks a 
perfume she likes -- one that simulates the musk of a Siberian deer -- and dabs 
it at various spots on the pile of logs that lie in the center of the tiger 
pit. 
</P>
<P>
 The pile of logs is itself an example of behavioral enrichment. For years, the 
zoo's Siberian tigers -- a pair of 11-year-old sisters -- paced back and forth 
on an easy to clean but dull and forbidding expanse of concrete. But in 1993 
the exhibit was renovated. A waterfall was added -- with the wall behind it 
carefully pitched forward and built without paw-holds so the tigers couldn't 
use it to escape. Dirt was trucked in to soften the surface beneath the cats, 
then planted with grass, bamboo and other vegetation that the cats can rub 
against, hide behind, dig up, or gnaw on. 
</P>
<P>
 After Foster applies the musk scent to the woodpile, she hides a couple of 
dead rabbits under the logs. A few minutes later, she releases the cats from 
the behind-the-scenes cages where they have spent the night. The first thing 
they do is sniff the logs, rubbing the scent glands in their own cheeks against 
the new smells they have discovered. Foster explains that the two cats will 
often mark the area as well. "They back up and urinate on it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Foster, the presence of new scents in their habitat always seems 
to increase the interaction between the two animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sensory deprivation and lack of behavioral and social opportunities have been 
the basic deficits" for animals in older zoos, says Tim Desmond, an 
animal-behavior consultant based in Ventura. David Shepherdson, one of the 
founders of the behavioral enrichment movement and a research coordinator at 
the Metro Washington Park Zoo in Portland, Ore., agrees, arguing that smell and 
hearing are among the most neglected senses of zoo animals. Smell and hearing, 
he says, "tend to be ignored, because we know less about what those worlds mean 
to the animals." 
</P>
<P>
 The tigers catch the scent of the perfume before they smell the rabbits. In 
the wild, the cats would spend part of every day hunting for food. Although 
they were fed their carefully balanced conventional diet the night before, they 
sniff around until they find the hidden prey. A group of schoolchildren watches 
from above as Indira digs up a clump of grass and hides her find under it 
before she settles down to devour the rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the mesmerized children or their teachers complains about the presence 
of the dead rabbits in the pit. Many animals eat live prey in the wild, and 
many biologists and others who care for captive animals think they would be 
better off if fed live animals, if only in behind-the-scenes areas. But few 
zoos are willing to gross visitors out by tossing Bambi into the lion exhibit, 
and live food in most public areas of zoos is limited to crickets, meal worms 
and the occasional goldfish. As animal consultant Desmond observes, "You don't 
want your exhibit to be a snuff exhibit." 
</P>
<P>
 Piqued by the new attractions in their exhibit, the tigers put on a 
fascinating show for the humans watching them, at one point snarling menacingly 
at each other over one of the rabbits. Behavioral enrichment makes for better 
drama from a visitor's point of view, true, but it also has a positive impact 
on the animals themselves. Scientists have observed, for instance, that animals 
prefer to hunt for their food when given the option. 
</P>
<P>
 Given their belief in food as activity, zoo personnel are thrilled when the 
animals play with their food as the tigers do. Two mornings a week the polar 
bears are given giant fishsicles, which they bat around their pool even as they 
probe for the herring and other goodies frozen inside. As du Bois points out, 
polar bears seem to play in the wild, and they play in captivity as well. The 
fishsicle, says relief keeper Tami Goodson, "is just as much a toy as it is a 
treat." Volunteers also hide figs and celery among the rocks in the polar bear 
exhibit. Volunteers are always drilling holes into tree limbs and other exhibit 
"furniture" throughout the zoo to provide hiding places for yogurt and other 
concealable foods. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Among the least natural of the bears' playthings, but one they seem to love, 
is a beer keg. "Beer kegs are standard zoo toys everywhere because they are one 
of the few things that won't fall apart in five minutes," du Bois explains. The 
bears also pass their free time batting around a Boomer Ball, a commercial zoo 
toy whose selling points include being impervious to the attentions of 
elephants, gorillas and other animals of superhuman strength. At the L.A. Zoo 
everything from elands to meerkats, monkeys to rhinos, have Boomer Balls. Among 
their other virtues: They are hollow. You can drill holes in them, then fill 
them with crickets, raisins or other food that the animals must then figure out 
how to extract. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the great satisfactions of the behavioral enrichment program, 
participants say, is that even small, inexpensive changes can have a big 
payoff. For the last several weeks, keepers have been putting a few live 
goldfish in with the North American carnivores. According to keeper Molly 
Hogan, the fish have completely changed the routine of the zoo's raccoons. 
Before the advent of the live fish, the pair were usually asleep in the morning 
when Hogan first entered their exhibit. Now the raccoons are wide awake, and 
they remain active for hours after they catch and devour their few fish, 
apparently looking for more. 
</P>
<P>
 The behavioral enrichment movement has burgeoned in the 1990s, encouraged by a 
new breed of specialists such as du Bois and by keepers, who routinely write 
into The Shape of Enrichment, the field's quarterly newsletter, seeking 
practical advice on what to do for, say, a sluggish aardvark (Kitty Litter for 
it to dig in, peers advise). Keepers are in the trenches of this movement, and 
when they get into the spirit of behavioral enrichment, they tend to improvise 
much like first-time parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, Tami Goodson tried one thing after another to induce her penguins to get 
into a plastic kiddie pool of cool water. "Finally, I took off my shoes and got 
into the pool," she recalls. "It was the only way I could get them to come in." 
</P>
<P>
 The behavioral enrichment program couldn't function if it weren't for its 
volunteers, says du Bois. Earlier this month, 20 volunteers spent a weekend 
upgrading the exhibit that houses the zoo's jaguars. With a grant from Yuban, 
the coffee company whose logo is a jaguar, and expertise and plants donated by 
a local nursery, the exhibit was turned into a mini-rain forest, complete with 
bromeliads and an overhead sprinkler system to insure that the tropical 
greenery stays lush. 
</P>
<P>
 Behavioral enrichment is obviously easier with some animals than with others. 
So far, the L.A. Zoo hasn't done anything special to improve the quotidian 
routines of its snakes and lizards, but it has found ways to enhance the days 
of many of its animals. 
</P>
<P>
 After a volunteer observed the apparent pleasure a giant eland took in 
destroying a young pepper tree in its enclosure, the zoo's research staff 
decided to see if it could create an artificial eland plaything. With the help 
of a local fabricator of zoo exhibits and equipment, the research staff devised 
a bucket with a spring inside that could be filled with acacia branches and 
other foliage. The bouncing bush that resulted seems to fascinate the zoo's 
giant eland population, inducing it to spend twice as much time as it otherwise 
might in such characteristic eland behaviors as thrashing the simulated tree 
with twirled horns. 
</P>
<P>
 Du Bois emphasizes how important the 45 to 50 volunteers are to the zoo's 
behavioral enrichment program. Her assistant, Marjorie Fuchs, an attorney by 
training, is in charge of the volunteer program and keeps track of who is doing 
which chores, such as cutting branches on which many animals like to browse. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Volunteers include Jill Blacher, a psychotherapist with a Beverly Hills 
practice that specializes in helping the bereaved. Blacher spends at least one 
morning a week at the zoo, spraying the Sumatran rhino with a hose as it 
frolics in its mud wallow, and hanging organic cornstalks from her own garden 
around its enclosure. "It's very healing to come here and work with the 
animals," says Blacher, who also tosses apples and whole heads of romaine into 
the maws of the hippos during her shift. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Stern is another faithful volunteer. Every Wednesday night Stern's 
family gets its own dinner while the Encino woman cooks up a storm for her 
animal friends. Recently she prepared giant pine cones for the orangutans, 
stuffing them with slices of yam and cantaloupe, peanuts, non-frosted shredded 
mini-wheats and dollops of her own recipe for oatmeal paste, a concoction of 
oatmeal, nonfat dry milk, canned pineapple and other nutritious stuff. Peanut 
butter is a favorite food of almost all the animals, but the volunteers try to 
avoid it because too much fat isn't good for zoo creatures either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do it to get away from work," says Stern, who is a vice president at a 
local distribution company. She admits that it is sometimes difficult to keep 
her family from scarfing down the oatmeal paste, especially when she bakes it 
cookie-style. "Actually, my husband's the one who will eat anything," she says. 
"My daughter is a little more picky." 
</P>
<P>
 Some zoos take a high-tech approach to behavioral enrichment, utilizing 
cricket launchers and mechanized dispensers that spit out treats when animals 
push the right button. In part because of lack of resources, Los Angeles tends 
to be low-tech. On a recent morning, the orangutans were poking into cardboard 
cones that had formerly held knitting wool and that volunteer Stern had filled 
with a mixture of granola and mustard. Many animals like spicy foods, du Bois 
explains. The chimps have a thing for salsa, and a number of animals like 
garlic and notoriously odoriferous durian fruit.  
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers raise goodies for the zoo's great apes in a special Gorilla Garden 
in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area, and du Bois makes sure that the animals' 
exhibits are filled with such favorite playthings as ropes on swivels, some of 
which must be replaced weekly, and burlap sacks. It also seems that apes can't 
resist a cardboard box any more than children can. Du Bois is thrilled that zoo 
higher-ups encourage her efforts to engage the animals with whatever she thinks 
will grab them, even if it means filling their exhibits with what sometimes 
looks like trash. "There was a time I wouldn't have been allowed to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Behavioral enhancement is part art and part science, says du Bois. It reflects 
a view that animal needs are not so different from our own -- that we both need 
things to do, as well as food and a safe place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a lot of behavioral enrichment does is give the animal an increased 
degree of control over its destiny," says Shepherdson. The result is a zoo 
where happier animals behave in more natural ways that the public often can't 
take its eyes off.

PARENTING; A PLACE TO CALL HOME AFTER SCHOOL; MORNING AND AFTERNOON PROGRAMS

<P>
 Whoever decided that workdays should start around 8 a.m. and end after 5 p.m. 
obviously didn't have kids in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who hit the freeway before the sun rises have to find a way to ensure 
that their youngsters are securely in their classrooms when the 8 o'clock bell 
rings. Then when school is dismissed around 2 p.m. or so, moms and dads face 
the even more difficult predicament of keeping their children safe and happy 
until the workday ends. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, plenty of before- and after-school programs in the Valley offer 
youngsters companionship, help with homework and a chance to exuberantly let 
off steam or quietly unwind. Many care givers open their doors as early as 6 
a.m., transport the kids to school, pick them up in the afternoon, serve them a 
snack, and entertain them with free play, sports, games and arts and crafts 
until their parents take them home. 
</P>
<P>
 After-school care settings vary from a simple classroom to a family home to a 
commercial day-care center to a park. They may accommodate a mere handful of 
youngsters or several dozen. Costs vary from $30 or less to $80 or more weekly, 
with the average program running about $60 to $75. (Care for kindergarten 
students, who are dismissed from school around 11 a.m., is more expensive.) 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a sampling of what's available: CAMPUS LATCHKEY PROGRAMS 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of public elementary schools throughout the Valley offer "latchkey" 
programs, with before- and after-school care provided on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Many latchkey programs are sponsored by the 31st District PTA, others are run 
by the YMCA and a few are coordinated by the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. Costs vary from school to school, but generally range from about $8 a 
day to $260 a month, with subsidies and / or sliding-scale fees available for 
needy families. 
</P>
<P>
 Latchkey programs usually strive to tailor after-school activities to 
complement what the children learn in school, according to Ellen Pollock, 
coordinator with the 31st District PTA. "But our programs are not highly 
structured," she said. "Children have been in a structured environment all day, 
so we offer a flexible program -- with certain established guidelines." Simple 
snacks, arts and crafts, outdoor play, tutoring and / or assistance with 
homework are the typical latchkey fare. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, contact your child's elementary school, the nearest YMCA or 
the 31st District PTA at (818) 996-2668. AFTER-SCHOOL RECREATION PROGRAMS 
</P>
<P>
 Playgrounds at 127 elementary schools and 27 middle schools throughout the 
Valley remain open for several hours in the afternoon, providing kids 8 to 14 
the chance to participate in organized sports, games, tournaments and leagues 
-- all free of charge. However, the after-school recreation program is not a 
child-care service, emphasizes Donna Kimura, coordinator for L.A. Unified's 
Valley Youth Services office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We offer supervised recreation within the relatively safe boundaries of the 
schoolyard, but child care is not within our range," she said. According to 
Kimura, children may come and go at will, and those who wander off the 
playground -- whether to wave down an ice cream truck or sneak off to the mall 
-- will not be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Playground supervisors are generally college students with experience in 
education and / or working with children. Most playgrounds are open until 6 
p.m., but a few close at 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, contact your child's school or the Valley Youth Services 
office at (818) 904-2152. RECREATION CENTERS 
</P>
<P>
 Four Valley parks -- Northridge, Tarzana, North Hollywood's Victory-Vineland 
and Pacoima's Hubert Humphrey recreation centers -- offer complete licensed 
child-care programs, including transportation to and from nearby elementary and 
junior high schools, field trips, organized games and sports, snacks, and a 
variety of indoor and outdoor activities. Prices vary from park to park, 
usually starting at about $30 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call Northridge Park at (818) 349-0535, Tarzana Park at (818) 
343-4721, Victory-Vineland at (818) 908-2764 and Hubert Humphrey at (818) 
899-3445. 
</P>
<P>
 All L.A. city parks -- even those that do not have a full child-care program, 
schedule after-school seasonal sports and classes, such as arts and crafts, 
drama and dance. However, no transportation is provided, and children are not 
as closely monitored as they are in the child-care centers. Prices and 
offerings vary. For details, call the park nearest you. DAY-CARE CENTERS 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial day-care centers are likely to offer more resources, equipment and 
activities than programs sponsored by nonprofit and city agencies. A few 
centers, such as Kidsville USA in Northridge and Sunshine Day Camps in Santa 
Clarita, specialize in school-age children. Such private centers are likely to 
be run much like a summer day camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people feel that an after-school program means throwing a ball 
around on a playground," said Robert Hulton, owner of Kidsville USA, which 
serves children ages 5 to 16. "But our very structured recreation schedule 
includes crafts, music, drama and playground games. Kids are separated 
according to age, and activities are offered accordingly." 
</P>
<P>
 Fees at private day-care centers are often on the high side, from about $240 
to $285 a month. FAMILY CARE HOMES 
</P>
<P>
 Care-givers who work out of their homes usually can't offer the range of 
activities found in larger, better-equipped settings, but they do provide a 
homey environment and personal attention not possible in classrooms, parks or 
large day-care centers. Such providers, who may care for up to six school-age 
children (or 12 children, if the provider has an assistant) often drive 
children to and pick them up from one or more nearby schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids come in, they take their shoes off, they sprawl on the floor, they 
listen to music and dance," said Val Gray, who cares for 12 children in her 
Saugus home. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools provide referrals to family care providers, or for a list of 
facilities, contact Child Care Resource Center, (818) 762-0905.

PARENTING; CURBING THE CRAVINGS; SETTING REASONABLE RESTRICTIONS IS THE BEST 
WAY TO LIMIT THE INTAKE OF JUNK FOODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today's busy parents are at a definite disadvantage in the battle to get kids 
to eat right. Racks of junk snacks beckon in grocery stores, and 
labor-intensive, nutritious meals often take a back seat to what's cooking at 
the drive-thru. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone would like their kids to eat right," said one Canoga Park mother. 
"But for a lot of parents I know, the four basic food groups are Taco Bell, 
McDonald's, Burger King and Kentucky Fried Chicken." 
</P>
<P>
 If that sounds painfully familiar, the good news is that the junk-food habit 
can be headed off early, or at the very least kept under control. What's more, 
experts say, it doesn't take an iron-fisted approach to ensure success in 
curtailing children's intake of fried foods, sweets and empty calories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents should set reasonable restrictions," said Joan Levinthal, a Woodland 
Hills-based dietitian. "Kids do very well when you set limits because they know 
what to expect. And children should definitely have a say in some of the 
decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 That is a rule that Wendy Wester and her husband have followed with their 
2-year-old son, Steven. Wester, who owns a Van Nuys catering business, said the 
family makes a weekly trip to McDonald's or another establishment of little 
Steven's choice. Recently, Wester spoke of idealism and reality as she watched 
her son grab a Chicken McNugget between trips down the slide in the play area 
of a Burbank McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before my son was born, I thought I would never take him to a fast-food 
place," Wester said. "But he really enjoys himself when we come here, and I 
like the fact that he eats a full meal while interacting with other kids. If I 
were to tell him he could not come to places like this, it would probably 
become even more attractive to him." 
</P>
<P>
 The most foolproof method for making sure children do not eat junk food at 
home is to not have it available. If it's not there, they can't eat it. Of 
course, neither can parents. "You can't take the 'Don't do as I do, do as I 
say,' approach with kids," said Glendale pediatrician Dr. Steven Nishibayashi. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if certain foods are off-limits in the home, be advised that, sooner 
or later, children will be in school and other places where forbidden snacks 
are available. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to eat them on the outside if you don't have some of them at 
home," said dietitian Marla Dishman. "Kids are naturally drawn to sweets, so 
you're better off showing them how to handle things in moderation rather than 
restricting them completely."  
</P>
<P>
 Linda Vickers, a mother of three who teaches nutrition at Moorpark College, 
recommends buying snacks in kid-size servings to monitor how much of a 
particular food a child is eating. Vickers suggests that parents allow their 
youngsters, and themselves, some leeway in regard to healthy eating. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK to blow it one day a week if you're doing a good job the other six," 
she said. "As long as it's not an everyday thing, parents should not be too 
concerned."

PARENTING; GETTING INTO THE HABIT; HOMEWORK IS CRUCIAL TO LEARNING, EDUCATORS 
SAY, AND SHOULD BECOME PART OF A CHILD'S ROUTINE EARLY ON.

 Mention the word homework to any child who has spent a day in a stuffy 
classroom and you're bound to hear moaning and groaning. Mention the word to 
the child's parents and they're likely to join the chorus of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it. Most youngsters hate homework, and most parents hate having to 
make them do it. Yet homework is vital to education. It not only reinforces 
class lessons, it teaches independence and study habits and prepares the child 
for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the very process of doing homework -- setting aside time every night 
to complete a given set of assignments -- is almost as important as the lessons 
the child is studying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most teachers will tell you that homework is there to reinforce what they've 
already taught in the classroom," says Sue Wasserman, professor of elementary 
education at Cal State Northridge. "But it also allows teachers to find out 
what they need to reteach." 
</P>
<P>
 Given its overall importance in education, she adds, "You can't just start 
(homework) in junior high and high school. Some of these patterns and behaviors 
have to be established early." What's more, she believes, parents need to be 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Leb, a Studio City mother of 16-year-old Simonne and 11-year-old 
Trevor, learned this lesson long ago. "From the time they were in nursery 
school, I made sure my children did their homework," she says. At this point, 
she reports, "They know their homework is their responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 As important to good study habits as parental supervision are a daily routine 
and a quiet place to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The child should have a place with everything accessible at approximately the 
same time so homework is not done at the last minute," Wasserman says. "The 
parent and child should work out a schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Older children can be given greater responsibility in structuring homework 
time. "I suggest that parents make the child a partner in this," says Kathleen 
Rattay, principal of Granada Hills High School. "Tell the child: 'I understand 
you have an hour or two of homework. How are you going to budget your time?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rattay recommends keeping youngsters away from distractions while they're 
doing assignments: no phone, no radio, no TV. "I can't watch TV and study, but 
kids think they can," she says. "They can't either." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the needs of individual students at each grade level are different. 
Leb, for example, says her daughter is usually more agreeable than her son 
about doing homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trevor will come home from school and play for an hour," Leb says. "He just 
needs to get the energy out before he can start." 
</P>
<P>
 At the youngest ages, Wasserman says, homework assignments such as coloring, 
cutting and learning sounds allow parents to share in a child's schoolwork in a 
positive way. As children progress through school and their assignments become 
more complex and time consuming, Wasserman advises parents to stay involved in 
the process. While being careful not to do children's homework for them, 
Wasserman says, moms and dads can still help youngsters find and correct 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There can be over-involvement," she concedes. "Some parents have a 
domineering attitude with such high expectations that no child could ever meet 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 She counsels parents: "Take the middle road of being there and not doing it 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 There is also an age-old problem that arises when parents try to help with 
assignments they don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk to your child's teacher," advises James Cunningham, professor of 
education at Cal State Northridge. "There are teachers who will find books they 
can give to the interested parent so the parent can learn right along with 
their child." 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever a grown-up's mastery of a subject, Getting a youngster to do 
homework generally comes down to a series of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope that homework doesn't become a battlefield," Wasserman says. 
"The important thing is for the parent to be there, to praise and to enable."

PARENTING; EASING THE SEARCH FOR SAFE CHILD CARE; A STATE-FUNDED AGENCY 
PROVIDES PARENTS WITH NAMES OF PROVIDERS AND TIPS FOR FINDING THE BEST. ALL FOR 
FREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Few things incite more anxiety in parents than finding good child care. The 
task of finding a safe, loving haven for a child is espe cially daunting for 
new parents, who may not know where to look, how to choose a facility or what 
questions to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, parents have a partner to make their search easier. Since 1976, 
the Child Care Resource Center, a nonprofit agency headquartered in North 
Hollywood, has referred parents to licensed child-care providers in the San 
Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys and has provided tips and 
suggestions on making a selection. The service is free. 
</P>
<P>
 The most frequent -- and most panic-stricken -- callers are first-time mothers 
of infants, according to Barbara Hurlbut, a referral specialist at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "New mothers who are ready to go back to work often don't have the slightest 
clue of what to do," she said. "They have the idea that infant care is not 
going to be good and it is not going to be safe. We send them brochures and 
checklists, so they know the good places when they see them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Child Care Resource Center is primarily funded by the California 
Department of Education, and it also receives federal and county money and 
assistance from local businesses. In addition to referring parents to 
child-care providers, the center holds child-care workshops, offers advice to 
parents and providers on everything from discipline to toilet training, assists 
employers who want to offer child care to their workers and operates a free 
resource library of teaching materials, games, toys and books. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our focus is on enhancing quality of care," said Ron Garner, who administers 
the program. "We want parents to know how to choose the best care." But don't 
ask the center to recommend which of the almost 2,000 licensed facilities on 
their database is "best."  
</P>
<P>
 " 'Best' is a very subjective thing," Garner said. "Licensed care comes in all 
flavors -- and what one parent thinks is really good is not necessarily what 
another parent wants. That is why we make referrals -- not recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
 About 14,000 Valley parents call the center every year. Referral specialists, 
many of them former preschool teachers with degrees in early childhood 
education, talk to parents about their needs regarding location, hours and 
budget. Parents are then provided with the names and addresses of facilities 
that meet their criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Once armed with the list, parents are urged to spend time at the facilities 
observing children and chatting with directors, teachers and other parents.  
</P>
<P>
 "You always need to see the place when children are there," Hurlbut said. 
WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: The Child Care Resource Center.

<P>
 Hours: 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday.

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: A CRYSTAL BALL; THE WAREHOUSE OF ATHENA INTERNATIONAL IN 
VENICE OFFERS GLASS OBJETS D'ART THAT REPRESENT SOME, WELL, SMASHING BUYS.

<P>
 For the black-belt bargain shopper, there's nothing quite like a warehouse 
outlet of imported elegance at wholesale prices. Athena International ships its 
European crystal and glass objets d'art from a warehouse in Venice, a small 
corner of which has been transformed into a shimmering treasure trove of 
elegant crystal and blown glass, perfectly organized and beautifully priced. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny Blair and Touch of Glass are among the names represented in the Athena 
International inventory, and there are always some first-quality pieces 
available at near-wholesale prices. A handsome egg paperweight, an example of 
the considerable skill of artisan Christopher Lucas, is from the Touch of Glass 
Bouquet. It wholesales for $32.50; a retailer would probably ask double. A 
perfume bottle from the Confetti collection, its design a blend of pastel 
forms, is $36. 
</P>
<P>
 A six-inch-tall perfume bottle, frosted glass with hand-painted designs in 
glowing colors, is from Jenny Blair's Impressions collection and is $20. A 
two-inch bottle from the Precious Collection, inspired by Victorian decorative 
arts, is encased in silver- or gold-plated filigree and wholesales at $44 in 
the silver and $48.50 in gold. These are the prices to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 A die-hard shopper will be in hog heaven in the seconds area, and will be 
hard-pressed to discover flaws that bring these prices down to below wholesale. 
</P>
<P>
 Here you'll find a variety of glass pyramids from $4 to $12. One second Jenny 
Blair perfume bottle that wholesales for $70 was tagged $35. Others started at 
$3.50. Also in the seconds area were a variety of prisms, perfect as Christmas 
tree ornaments, priced at $1.50; buy a dozen and that price comes down to $1 
each. Seconds in Aurora Borealis tinted obelisks are $5, and some stunning 
glass shells imported from Austria are a buy at $15, when you consider that the 
wholesale price is $27.50. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are always a few of Athena's signature pieces -- frosted globes -- in 
various hues and designs. The top-of-the line globe on a brass caliper retails 
for $500 and sells here for $245. Others are priced wholesale and start at $20. 
</P>
<P>
 Unique jewelry pieces include the Millefiori pendants, earrings and pins. Made 
in Murano, Italy, small segments of multicolored glass rods are laid close to 
one another and fired in a kiln. After hand-polishing, the disks are set in 
sterling silver and plated with 24-karat gold. No two pieces are alike. Most of 
these pieces are wholesale. Pins are $10, earrings $22, and pendants range from 
$17 for the small size to $32 for a large one. Costume jewelry samples from 
Austria are incredibly priced at $5 for a necklace (retail $30), $3 for a 
bracelet (retail $20) and $2 for a pair of earrings (retail $15). 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, starting Wednesday, owner Barbara Levin is having a sale. "We have 
to get ready for the new season, so we're taking discontinued items from the 
'94 line and discounting them even more," Levin says. How good can it get?

RESTAURANT REVIEW; ACCENT ON THE HEAVY; HOPPE'S OLD HEIDELBERG IN VAN NUYS 
SERVES UP CLASSIC, MEATY DISHES WITH DECIDEDLY TEUTONIC TWISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoppe's Old Heidelberg is a venerable local institution. The menu boasts that 
it serves the finest German cuisine in Los Angeles, and I'd say the claim is 
reasonable. The quality of the cooking partly explains how Hoppe's has lasted 
36 years in a market where peasant-type, filling German food -- just about the 
polar opposite of California cuisine -- has never been an easy sell. 
</P>
<P>
 October is an appropriate time to come here, because it's the month of the 
German carnival known as Oktoberfest. Look for the restaurant to be in festive 
garb all month, with balloons and streamers hung from the ceiling, party-style. 
Last week, I saw a happy crowd staging their own bash at Hoppe's, downing 
steins of imported beers like Berliner Weisse and Clausthaler and digging into 
rustic German stuff like the two-pound pork shank. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoppe's specializes in that sort of meaty, heavy dish, punctuated by the scent 
of pickles and sauerkraut, stuffed down with quantities of dark bread and 
potatoes. It works for me, as long as there's a nip in the air. Sauerbraten and 
potato pancakes can be an ordeal on a hot day. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in summer, though, you don't have to be reminded of the outside world 
very much; faux stained glass windows filter out direct sunlight. Inside its 
massive doors, Hoppe's is cool, dark and clubby. The best tables, by the way, 
are at the red leather booths. 
</P>
<P>
 The style, needless to say, is emphatically German. One of the paneled walls 
is dominated by a corny animated cutout figure of a jagermeister (huntsman) 
complete with lederhosen. More Teutonic stuff shows up shortly after you sit 
down. The waitresses wear dirndls, just as they might in a Munich beer hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The bar menu has schnapps, such as caraway-flavored kummel , and German brandy 
to complement a fine beer list, but German table wines, just coming into their 
own on the world market, are unreasonably neglected. Wine drinkers should 
consider bringing their own. The house wines are white zinfandel, Liebfraumilch 
and Chablis, all dreadful. 
</P>
<P>
 At dinner, the first course is a Lazy Susan appetizer tray of the sort most 
L.A. restaurants used to have 40 years ago. The appetizers are practically a 
meal in themselves: dill pickles, vinegary marinated kidney beans, red and 
white sauerkraut, sliced beets and, in the center, a scoop of rich liver paste, 
ready to be spread on brown bread. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how hungry you are, you shouldn't eat here without trying the 
kartoffelpfannkuchen , the San Fernando Valley's best potato pancakes, with 
crisp edges (accounting for about 85% of each pancake) and a center of soft, 
fluffy shredded potato. They come four to an order, served with applesauce and 
sour cream. 
</P>
<P>
 The speisekarte (menu) reads like a short list of classic German dishes. 
Hasenpfeffer -- marinated rabbit baked in a delicious wine sauce -- is very 
tender. The combination plate includes pork, sauerbraten, red cabbage, tiny 
spaetzle dumplings and sauerkraut. Order the farmer's plate and you'll feast on 
a hunk of smoked pork loin ( kasseler rippchen ) and two sausages, puffy 
knockwurst and a link of off-white, mildly smoked bratwurst. With sausages, by 
the way, you'll get three types of pungent imported mustard, which almost make 
up for the blandness of the meat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans have adopted a few dishes from Hungary, and Hungarian goulash and 
chicken paprika might just be the best dishes here. The goulash is certainly 
the restaurant's best beef dish -- the sauerbraten isn't actually sour, and its 
beef flavor is masked by a thick, floury gravy. The goulash, by comparison, is 
just about perfect: soft chunks of beef, heady with the flavors of paprika and 
onion. 
</P>
<P>
 The chicken paprika is great too, the paprika sauce on the stewed chicken 
enriched with lots of sour cream. Both these dishes are particularly suited to 
mopping up with the kitchen's fine spaetzle -- golden brown squiggles of fried 
dough -- at least until you run out of steam. If you're like most people, you 
won't be able to finish either the goulash or the chicken, not if you've 
polished off the tossed salad and some of the soup, which are thrown in with 
each entree. 
</P>
<P>
 The soups, like the thick potato or the pudding-like cream of celery, are 
especially filling. Calculate in the occasional side dishes, such as German 
fried potatoes or potato dumplings, and at the end of the meal you may 
seriously not have room for any of the pastries. But at least I'll tell you 
what they are: a tasty but slightly flaccid apple strudel, a rich butter cream 
mocha torte and fluffy macaroons, which you can purchase at the cashier's 
counter for 55 cents apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The macaroons are the star dessert. I ate three on my way home, so I guess 
I've got the Oktoberfest spirit. Better make those lederhosen extra large, 
Fraulein. Where and When

PUBLIC DEFENDER TO FIGHT O.C. LAB'S DRUG MAKING; LAW ENFORCEMENT: HE VOWS 
CHALLENGE TO SECRET PRACTICE. MOST LOCAL OFFICIALS SURPRISED BUT SUPPORT POLICE 
EFFORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County public defender's office announced Thursday that it will 
mount a legal challenge to stop local authorities from continuing to 
manufacture rock cocaine for Santa Ana police use in undercover narcotics 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler said he was shocked to learn that the Orange 
County Crime Laboratory had been secretly converting powder cocaine to rock 
nuggets sold for $10 to $20 apiece on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm aware that the reverse stings have been upheld," Butler said. "But I 
think this raises the goofiness of that rule to a higher level. It's shocking, 
really." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler was not the only local official surprised by the police activities. But 
Santa Ana City Council members, local police chiefs and county officials 
generally offered support Thursday for the secret operation. So did the 
principal of the Santa Ana middle school just two blocks from one neighborhood 
where more than 100 people were arrested for buying county-made crack cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stand 100% behind the Police Department," said Mayor Daniel H. Young, who 
had been made aware of the investigation only Thursday. "I think they're 
approaching this thing innovatively, and they're taking a risk because 
society's at risk. We could certainly use the old and tired methods of fighting 
drug sales, but they have failed." 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office has represented hundreds of suspects in cases 
arising from the Santa Ana investigations, which have targeted addicts and 
small-time drug buyers during the past 18 months. Police used reverse stings, 
where undercover officers posed as drug dealers to arrest buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Butler said he did not know until this week that the drugs used in the 
Santa Ana cases were being processed at the crime laboratory run by the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department. And he said he only recently became aware of 
successful legal objections raised to a similar operation in Broward County, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, hundreds of convictions obtained from reverse sting operations 
were overturned when a Florida appeals court found that the Broward County 
sheriff acted illegally in manufacturing crack or rock cocaine for undercover 
drug investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said the business of using county-made crack could raise serious 
questions in the cases his attorneys are defending, and that his staff is 
drawing up legal papers to challenge the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I was not aware until this morning that we had cases in which the 
crack cocaine was produced by the county crime lab," Butler said Thursday. "I 
think it takes the sting operations to a new level that legally, I think, is 
going too far." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Sheriff Brad Gates was out of town Thursday and other department 
officials did not respond to repeated requests this week for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities familiar with county crime lab operations said the Orange County 
lab has a license from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to engage in 
the production of drugs for use in undercover probes. 
</P>
<P>
 And while such reverse sting operations are considered risky by some law 
enforcement agencies, Santa Ana police and Orange County prosecutors defended 
the tactic, contending that it is proving successful in ridding the streets of 
addicts and other drug users who travel to Santa Ana for the single purpose of 
buying drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know how good it feels to have people come up to officers on the 
street to say, 'Thank you for cleaning up the area,' " Santa Ana Police Capt. 
Bruce Carlson said. 
</P>
<P>
 No other Orange County police department is conducting similar operations or 
using the county crime lab to convert powder cocaine to rock, said Carl 
Armbrust, the county prosecutor in charge of the Narcotics Enforcement Team. 
</P>
<P>
 Armbrust said that processing crack from powder cocaine ensures that the 
resulting nuggets do not contain other harmful chemicals that can be present in 
untreated drugs seized from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said he would encourage other departments to conduct similar 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they abide by the guidelines and the district attorney would approve it, 
I'd say that's great. The more the better," he said. "I think that an effort 
like this is worthwhile and I believe it does help the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Santa Ana operation started, police have made about 350 arrests -- 
about 100 of them within several blocks of Willard Intermediate School, police 
said. Most of the others were arrested in a neighborhood targeted by the 
federally funded anti-crime program known as Weed and Seed. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, some city and county officials were taken aback by disclosures 
that the county lab was manufacturing drugs for police to sell on the street. 
But despite their initial shock, most of those interviewed by The Times, 
including four of the seven Santa Ana City Council members, said they supported 
the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's news to me," County Supervisor William G. Steiner said. "It's one of the 
more extreme lengths I've ever heard of in drug investigations. But if the 
bottom line is to get people off the street who are dealing or using drugs, I 
am supportive of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Young said he thought authorities were being careful and that the police 
tactics would withstand legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel bad about it at all," the mayor said. "We're taking drug sales 
seriously, and it ain't a game. This isn't 10 days in the county jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Councilman Ted R. Moreno: "I approve of it. Let's tell the (buyers) 
they're not welcome in Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
 Willard Principal Robert L. Butcher said he became aware of the police 
activities only recently but supported them without reservation, even though 
police have acknowledged making sales within two blocks of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll approve of whatever it takes to get users and dealers off the streets," 
Butcher said. "We need to clean up our area. I am not opposed to what they are 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Santa Ana police say they try to avoid selling drugs to juveniles, at 
least two youths have been busted in recent months, said Deputy Public Defender 
Dean Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials say that no one has ever been harmed in the busts. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Laureen Gray said one 16-year-old client netted in the 
sting and prosecuted within the past six months tried to swallow the rock 
cocaine he purchased from police and was bruised by officers in a scuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they went to arrest him, he panicked and tried to swallow it," Gray 
said. "They had to gag him and choke him to try to get him to spit it up."  
</P>
<P>
 Other agencies, including the Los Angeles and San Diego police departments, 
say they abstain from using such small amounts of drugs in reverse stings 
because of the potential liability in having buyers ingest the drug or make off 
with the rocks before they can be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, several police agencies said they had similar liability 
concerns or did not have the level of drug trafficking that warranted such 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 For at least a decade, the Orange County district attorney's office also had a 
policy requiring a five-kilogram minimum for use in reverse sting 
investigations. But they opted to approve Santa Ana's request on the condition 
that the department follow strict safety guidelines, Armbrust said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we got our guidelines established, we didn't consider it extreme," 
Armbrust said. "We hoped we had thrown up every roadblock to prevent anything 
from going wrong. And we haven't had anything go wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Those guidelines include selling drugs for cash only and not exchanging the 
drugs for property that might be stolen. The special rules also prohibit car 
chases and discourage sales to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Release of the drugs for street sales also required special court orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a different type of a program, so we made an exception to our major 
reverse sting program for the purpose of trying to clean up communities where 
street drug sales are prevalent," Armbrust said. Cocaine Conversion 
</P>
<P>
 Rock cocaine, or crack, is perhaps the most dangerous and addictive form of 
the illegal drug, medical experts say. Some facts about the product and the 
process:

EL TORO AIRPORT MEASURE VIEWED AS STILL A TOSSUP; ELECTION: CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN 
SURPRISINGLY QUIET, BUT BOTH SIDES PLEDGE STRONGER EFFORTS AS THE VOTING NEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With less than three weeks to go before the general election, opposing sides 
in the Measure A contest say the issue remains a tossup, but both promise to 
turn up the heat in a campaign they say has really yet to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, which would require the county to build a commercial airport 
at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station when the base closes in 1999, is 
perhaps the most controversial political race on the local ballot. Strangely, 
it has also been one of the quietest. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCI Orange County Annual Survey found in September that the initiative is 
favored by 51% of registered voters, with 33% opposing it. However, the poll 
also showed 16% of voters are undecided, and the pro vote is soft, pollsters 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this large, potential swing vote that both sides said they will try to 
convert in the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the election were held today, it would be closer than I would want it to 
be," admitted Garden Grove Councilman Mark Leyes, a key Measure A backer who 
has campaigned for the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are trying to tune in and make up their mind as we get closer to 
Election Day," said Jeff Adler, campaign consultant for Taxpayers for 
Responsible Planning, a group formed to defeat the initiative. "They're the 
people we have to target, because the more they focus, the more questions 
they're going to have." 
</P>
<P>
 Political observers are surprised that the campaign has been low key so far, 
given that the measure was sponsored by a group of millionaire businessmen with 
strong ties to the Orange County political establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative could have a major impact on the county's economic future. In 
addition, a civilian airport at El Toro is sure to affect the quality of life 
in solidly middle-class South County communities. However, to date neither side 
has done any mailings or purchased any political advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show that the race has divided Orange County along geographic lines. In 
the latest poll, 55% of South County voters said they would vote against 
Measure A, while 57% in north and central Orange County would vote in favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would've expected a lot more activity and discussion of the issues by now. 
After all, we're only three weeks away from Election Day," said pollster Mark 
Baldassare, who conducted UC Irvine's annual survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Ellis, a spokesman for airport proponents, said that political consultant 
Stewart Mollrich was hired recently to direct the campaign as Election Day 
nears. Ellis predicted that the hiring of Mollrich would invigorate the "yes" 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Mollrich -- of the Newport Beach-based Butcher, Forde and Mollrich political 
consulting group -- played key roles in Howard Jarvis' Proposition 13 campaign 
in 1978 and the successful 1986 campaign by conservatives to oust state Supreme 
Court Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 Mollrich declined to comment on his upcoming strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport proponents have raised $280,000 through two committees for their 
campaign, much of it in donations from business groups and business people, 
while opponents have raised $153,000. Both amounts run through Sept. 30, when 
the most recent reporting period ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Although airport supporters have raised $130,000 more then their opponents, 
the pro-Measure A campaign is also heavily in debt, reporting about $150,000 in 
outstanding bills. Measure A is supported by is two campaign committees, the 
Yes on Measure A group and the Committee for 21,000 New Jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler said that airport opponents recently stepped up their efforts. In the 
past three weekends, small groups of South County residents have walked 
precincts in North County, targeting Garden Grove, Santa Ana and Costa Mesa, 
where support for the initiative is strong.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to take our message to as many people in North County as possible 
and expose them to the many questions being asked about an airport at El Toro. 
The taxpayers are signing a blank check for wealthy developers who want to get 
wealthier from an airport at El Toro. Nobody knows what the tax burden will be 
on taxpayers and how much it's going to cost over the years. That's what we're 
telling voters," Adler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyes said the opponents' arguments are misleading, but he acknowledged that 
airport proponents still have their work cut out for them to persuade voters to 
support the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "This airport isn't going to be paid for any differently than other airports. 
It's going to be paid for with federal funds, bonds sold to private investors 
and ticket fees. We need to communicate this to voters and explain it to them 
in a very personal way. I know there's still some confusion about this," said 
Leyes. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Measure A supporters will attempt to deliver the message in the 
coming days through direct mailings to registered voters' homes, but declined 
to talk about other campaign strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Adler also declined to talk about airport opponents' campaign strategy in the 
coming days, but said he expects airport proponents to blitz the electorate 
with radio ads in the last week of the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldassare said that airport supporters may have been forced to run a low-key 
campaign because local voters "are dealing with information overload" during 
the statewide elections, which include hotly contested races for governor and 
U.S. senator and two controversial state propositions. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have the philosophy that local voters are going to pay 
attention to the issues at the top of the ballot," said Baldassare. "On local 
issues, campaigns will wait closer to the last minute and then make their pitch 
to the voters. I suspect this is what's happening in the Measure A campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldassare said this strategy is more likely to help opponents of the measure, 
because the longer that voters wait to make up their minds on an issue the more 
likely they are to vote no. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters decide an issue based on the comfort level of the information they 
have," he said. "And this takes time. Three weeks may not be enough time for 
some voters." 
</P>
<P>
 The voters' ambivalence on Measure A has not been lost on airport opponents, 
who hope the confusion over the initiative will continue through election day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County voters traditionally zoom in late on cost issues. When voters 
go to the polls, the last thing they want to do is vote yes on a measure they 
don't understand, particularly if it has the potential to raise their taxes," 
said Adler. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyes agreed that local voters are inclined to oppose a measure that they 
believe would raise their taxes. But he expressed confidence that Mollrich, who 
has perfected the political art of direct mailing, will persuade voters that a 
second airport is needed in the county and can be built without higher taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the potential to win because all of the arguments are in our favor. 
We're going to communicate with people on a very personal basis and explain to 
them what this airport will mean to them and their families," said Leyes.

STUDENTS AT 2 PACOIMA SCHOOLS PROTEST PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER and CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of middle school students walked out of classes Thursday to protest 
Proposition 187, the controversial ballot measure barring illegal immigrants 
from public schools and other social services. 
</P>
<P>
 The morning walkouts at Maclay and Pacoima Middle Schools were peaceful, 
police and school officials said. Carrying an anti-187 banner and a Mexican 
flag, about 300 Maclay students left their classrooms about 9:10 a.m., shortly 
after first period, according to school police. About 40 students did not 
return to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia Costas, principal at Maclay in Pacoima, said she found out about 
Thursday's walkout from parents who called the school. She said that the 
students and their parents misunderstand the schools' role in Proposition 187 
and that some students believe that they will be expelled Nov. 8 -- Election 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the kids are terribly misinformed," Costas said. "We have to do a lot 
more work in the community . . . to inform people." 
</P>
<P>
 Students from other campuses across the Los Angeles Unified School District 
have also protested Proposition 187 in recent weeks by leaving classes. Also 
Thursday, students attempted to leave the Bravo Medical Magnet near downtown, 
but school administrators and police locked the gates and kept the students on 
campus, said Richard Page, assistant chief of the Los Angeles school district 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, about 200 students marched the perimeter of El Camino Real High 
School in Woodland Hills, and last week, hundreds of students walked out of 
classes at Huntington Park, Bell, South Gate, Los Angeles and Fremont high 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect this to continue until Election Day," Page said. "I think they (the 
students) want to draw attention to the issue . . . but we're going to make 
efforts to keep them on campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the protests have been calm, police said that some students 
in South Gate last week became unruly, throwing rocks and bottles at a school 
police car, and that one student took a case of beer from a nearby liquor 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators and police plan to meet next week to discuss how to deal 
with potential problems if the ballot measure passes. Several high schools are 
holding meetings for students before the election to dispel rumors that the 
school system would be checking citizenship status. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the school board has hired outside counsel to deal with legal 
questions that would arise should the proposition pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure calls for schools to verify students' legal status and 
ultimately to report illegal students and their parents to authorities. The Los 
Angeles Board of Education has voted to oppose the measure and expects to join 
in legal challenges if it passes. 
</P>
<P>
 School district Police Chief Wes Mitchell said he does not expect students to 
becomeviolent but that school police must maintain order on campuses. "We don't 
really expect an outbreak of unrest or disobedience if it passes," he said. 
"The kids in this district . . . have become real educated and sophisticated in 
the art of civil demonstrations." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say that although they believe that an outside group is 
responsible for organizing the student walkouts, they are unsure which group. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bill Rivera, school district spokesman: "They're clearly being organized 
by (someone) outside the district." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Macdonald, spokesman for Taxpayers Against 187, said that his group does 
not support the protests and that the students are sending the wrong message to 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not believe this educates the voters about the problems of 187; we 
believe it distracts them," Macdonald said. "We encourage kids to stay in 
school -- that's one of the things this is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 At Maclay, 13-year-old Martha Lopez was accompanied to the impromptu protest 
by her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "People went back (to the school) because the cops took them back," Martha 
said. "Blacks, whites, everyone was with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Through an interpreter, her mother said she supported her daughter's protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the Maclay students marched to Pacoima Middle School to encourage 
students there to walk out, school administrators said. School police said 
about 100 Pacoima students walked out, but administrators said the number was 
lower. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maclay and Pacoima students disrupted classes for a time by bangingon 
classroom doors and chanting, said Maria Wale, Pacoima Middle School principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked with them about ways in which they can protest, but not when it 
disrupts the education program," Wale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although school district officials said they thought that the impetus for the 
walkouts at Maclay and Pacoima middle schools was to demonstrate against 
Proposition 187, they said they thought that many students left class to join 
friends and disrupt the school day. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 -- dubbed by supporters the Save Our State initiative -- would 
prevent undocumented immigrants from attending public schools and receiving 
non-emergency health care and other social services. The federal government has 
threatened to withhold funding from the state's school districts if the measure 
is approved. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials plan to release today a breakdown of how much money that 
could mean to individual schools, but previous estimates showed that the 
district could lose more than $450 million.

CITY DRAINS SOME RESERVE FUNDS TO PAY FOR ARTS PLAZA; THOUSAND OAKS: THE 
FINANCING PLAN RELIES HEAVILY ON DEBT. BUT LEADERS SAY THE $86-MILLION COMPLEX 
IS WORTH IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In their crusade to boost Thousand Oaks' stature by building a world-class 
stage and a monumental government center, city leaders have stripped money from 
an array of municipal accounts, emptying some reserves to pay for the 
$86-million Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Mayor Alex Fiore, council members have shoveled cash from at least a 
dozen city accounts into the towering complex. They have patched together a 
financing plan that relies heavily on debt: bonds and internal loans account 
for nearly 75% of the total Civic Arts Plaza budget. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the performance complex and new City Hall are worth the 
mammoth expense. The arts center, which officially opens tonight, will serve 
for decades as a building of note in Southern California -- and as a community 
rallying point. 
</P>
<P>
 By raiding reserve funds to pay for the project, however, officials have tied 
up money that otherwise could have been used to pave roads, run libraries, 
build trails and maintain countless other city services. And despite prior 
assurances, city officials now say several of those accounts may never be 
repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 To fund the Civic Arts Plaza, city officials have also sunk the downtown 
Redevelopment Agency heavily into debt and left little money for its broader 
task -- sprucing up the rest of Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redevelopment Agency has issued nearly $43 million in bonds to pay for the 
Civic Arts Plaza, and has borrowed another $18.5 million from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Thousand Oaks has been the Ventura County city most flush with 
reserves for future projects and emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But with so much money dedicated to the performing arts center, the 
Redevelopment Agency will have "very little margin" over the next few years, 
Finance Director Bob Biery said. "We have a few dollars for the boulevard, but 
nothing of major consequence." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the city's long-standing promise to use redevelopment bond money for an 
auditorium at Thousand Oaks High School and a stadium at Westlake High may be 
in jeopardy, city officials acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Biery still hopes to meet those commitments by refinancing existing debt and 
issuing new bonds in 1995. But both he and City Manager Grant Brimhall said 
funding for the school projects depends largely on issues out of Thousand Oaks' 
control, such as national interest rates and the state's financial health. 
</P>
<P>
 If the state grabs money from redevelopment agencies to balance its budget, as 
it has for the past several years, "we have a problem," Biery said. "I can't 
put it any more directly." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Brimhall and Biery repeated reassurances this week that Thousand Oaks 
remains on solid fiscal footing. They note that the city owns a half-dozen 
valuable parcels, which could be sold to raise tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who would really like to be fair and honest about this (project) would 
have to say, 'Yeah, it's all right,' " Brimhall said. "This is a good, strong, 
solid city." 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza, approved in 1990, was to have been paid for fully by a 
combination of redevelopment funds, the sale of two old city halls, and rent 
payments from the local park district for space in the new complex. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the economy soured, that plan collapsed. In a depressed real estate 
market, city officials could not unload their old city hall for a good price, 
so they postponed the sale of the property at 401 W. Hillcrest Drive -- leaving 
a huge gap in arts plaza funding. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the park district pulled out of plans to rent $2 million worth of 
space. And interest rates fell sharply, so money that city officials had 
invested earned lower-than-anticipated returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Biery and Brimhall had to overhaul the Civic Arts Plaza budget 
again and again, juggling city resources to find money to pay construction 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 With the council's approval, the city dipped first into a capital fund 
supported by developers' fees from the giant Shapell and Dos Vientos projects. 
The city then wiped out a $1-million account reserved for parks and trails. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the city borrowed $13 million from a variety of municipal funds, 
including those set aside to freshen up the city golf course, update city 
computers and build housing for low income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The council majority -- Fiore, Frank Schillo and Judy Lazar -- has 
consistently defended their decision to funnel cash from a dozen flush accounts 
into the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The money) is being used for a city purpose," Lazar said. "It's not like 
it's being expended for something that is of no use to the city. That, to me, 
is the bottom line." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Civic Arts Plaza's stunning purple-hued auditorium opens, Lazar and 
other city leaders will congratulate themselves on finally bringing 
star-studded culture -- and Hollywood glitz -- to Thousand Oaks. They have 
often declared that the Civic Arts Plaza represents the city's crowning 
achievement, the last project needed to transform Thousand Oaks into a 
self-sufficient, enviably endowed community. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the culmination of the dreams of a lot of people," Lazar said. "What we 
have is a stellar facility that's a credit to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 But critics see more debits than credits. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Elois Zeanah, who leads the Civic Arts Plaza opposition, said she 
fears Thousand Oaks' prized new "castle" will continue to pull money from 
worthy community projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a house of cards," Zeanah said flatly. "It's a shell game." 
</P>
<P>
 Clutching a folder stuffed with documents tracing the Civic Arts Plaza's 
tangled funding, Zeanah added: "(The council majority) wanted this project so 
much . . . that they were willing to put the city on the financial brink." 
</P>
<P>
 When selling the project to the public, the city stated that it had enough 
bonds, excess land and existing construction money "in the bank" to build the 
arts plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no use of General Fund tax or fee revenues . . . in the project, and 
thus no impact on city operations or normal Capital Improvement Program," Fiore 
and Schillo wrote in a 1990 memo to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 But just eight months later, the council agreed to pull more than $1.8 million 
from the general fund to buy land for the arts plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Billed as a loan, that sum is supposed to be repaid with interest. So far, 
however, the council has not replenished the general fund, an account that pays 
for a wide variety of basic city services such as police protection. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said he approved the use of general fund cash because the land 
purchase was an unexpected expense. Original sketches of the arts plaza had not 
indicated that the city would need to purchase that particular chunk of land, 
he said, so he considered it an "add-on" appropriate to fund with a loan from 
the general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his promise to refrain from using general fund tax and fee revenues, 
Schillo said that statement applied only to the project's construction costs, 
not the land prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Even that narrow interpretation, however, has been tested as city officials 
have struggled to pay arts plaza bills. The construction budget includes more 
than $3 million in general fund cash -- money that had been set aside to repair 
the old city hall on Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 With that fund stripped bare, the council will need to find fresh money to 
refurbish the dilapidated building, which has been vandalized so badly that 
officials have said they are embarrassed to show it to potential buyers. One 
local real estate broker has estimated that cost at $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza's budget also draws deeply on the city's capital fund, an 
account earmarked for construction projects ranging from storm drains to ball 
fields. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The capital fund, which once held as much as $20 million, has kicked in $6.1 
million in loans for the arts plaza land and construction budgets. Another 
$3.25 million from the capital fund was not designated as a loan, and thus will 
never be repaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the drawdown, city officials say the capital fund maintains an 
adequate reserve of $11 million. "This will not adversely affect our ability to 
deliver any services, now or in the future," City Manager Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Finance Director Biery said most of the remaining capital fund cushion has 
been reserved for traffic signals, tree plantings and road improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves few dollars for the kind of projects Zeanah covets: sound walls, 
bike paths, sidewalks and playing fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have drawn down all our reserves," Zeanah said. "That's no way for a rich 
city to behave." 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar defended the city's capital improvement program. Baseball diamonds and 
soccer fields, she said, should be the responsibility of the park district. As 
for residents' other needs, Lazar said she believes Thousand Oaks has juggled 
demands skillfully. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done a good job," she said. "We have looked at what our most pressing 
needs are, and we have tried to meet them." 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar and her colleagues have consistently promised to restore every depleted 
account, repaying every loan with interest. Yet Brimhall acknowledged this week 
that the city may never settle all of its debts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks has no obligation to repay $6.1 million in loans from the 
capital fund, or $4 million from an account set aside to upgrade city 
equipment, Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 A penny-pinched future council could write off those debts, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we can, we think we will," Brimhall said. "(But) there is no legal 
requirement that (the money) be paid back." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's ability to repay the capital fund depends primarily on future real 
estate transactions. Thousand Oaks officials are counting on raising millions 
from the sale of 401 W. Hillcrest Drive -- the bunker-like former city hall 
that juts out of a grassy, brush-studded slope overlooking The Oaks mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The last appraisal five years ago pegged the land value at up to $14 million. 
But that estimate was based on splitting the 35-acre parcel into three lots: 
one for 10 residential units, one for a restaurant site, and the third for 
commercial development. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the council has not yet considered rezoning the parcel, Zeanah has 
blasted the appraisal as unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And even Fiore has conceded that Thousand Oaks might have to sell off other 
surplus land to fully fund the Civic Arts Plaza if the 401 W. Hillcrest Drive 
property does not fetch top dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's most valuable asset is situated next door to the Civic Arts Plaza 
-- the 11 acres slated for private development at the east end of the former 
Jungleland wild animal park. Brimhall estimated the property's value at about 
$9 million, and said the city has been receiving "big, big nibbles" from 
interested developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other surplus city properties include two dozen residential lots off 
California 23, which Brimhall valued at about $2.5 million; the former Goebel 
Senior Center across Conejo School Road from the Civic Arts Plaza, and the old 
Fitzgerald House, a small residential property. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by these assets worth more than $20 million, Thousand Oaks will be able 
to meet its debts and repay its loans, Brimhall said. But he added that 
untangling the internal money transfers is not urgent. 
</P>
<P>
 "What needs to be straightened out?" he asked. "There's no life-and-death 
issues here." 
</P>
<P>
 The city accounts most severely depleted are the insurance reserve fund, the 
low- and moderate-income housing fund, and the fixed-asset replacement fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * The insurance reserve fund, designated to cover the city's liability in case 
the government loses a major court case, loaned more than $4 million to the 
project. The fund now contains just $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * The fund to support affordable housing lost half its reserves, plummeting to 
$500,000. Before approving the loan, council members stipulated that returning 
money to that account must be a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 * The fixed-asset fund, which is used to replace worn-down city equipment, 
loaned $4 million to the Civic Arts Plaza. That left just $800,000 in the 
account. Biery and Brimhall said they believe the cushion will be sufficient to 
meet the city's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * The park fund, fed by a $50-per-bedroom tax on residential development, was 
wiped out entirely to pay for the Civic Arts Plaza's seven-acre park. That $1 
million was not considered a loan, so it will not be repaid, Biery said. 
</P>
<P>
 From Zeanah's point of view, the raids on various city funds belie officials' 
repeated claims that the Civic Arts Plaza was completed on time and under 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, there's a revenue side of the budget and an expenses side of the 
budget," she said. "The revenue side was in trouble from the very beginning. We 
have never been on budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo, however, feels certain that the city's financial plan will be 
vindicated and the Civic Arts Plaza will become a smash success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen," he said, "we have had a history of years and years and years of 
doing the right thing after well-thought-out proposals are thoroughly 
discussed. We are doing that same thing here." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's grand-opening concert at the Civic Arts Plaza begins with a 
ribbon-cutting ceremony on stage at 8. Doors open at 7:15 p.m., and 
ticket-holders should arrive early. Garage parking is free, though valet 
service is available for $7. Overflow parking will be available in a lot off 
Conejo School Road. The show, featuring the Conejo Symphony Orchestra and 
Bernadette Peters, will last until about 11 p.m. Soft drinks, liquor and 
champagne will be sold during the 20-minute intermission. Civic Arts Plaza

THE SCENE / ORANGE COUNTY: NIGHTMARE ON BEACH BLVD.; TALK ABOUT A DATE FROM 
HELL. AT KNOTT'S SCARY FARM, CHILLS AND THRILLS GO WITH THE TERRORTORY. AND FOR 
THE PAST 22 YEARS IT HAS BEEN THE IN-PLACE FOR TEENS WHO HAVE OUTGROWN 
TRICK-OR-TREATING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Around first grade, we discover the secret identities of Santa, the Easter 
Bunny and the rest of those goody-two-shoes and reconsider our approach to the 
holidays. But we still hold on to the fright and dress-up of Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 It's usually about the first year of high school that we come to the stark 
realization: Tricks are for kids. You can pretend to be escorting your younger 
brother and his friends on Halloween, but your days of holding out an open 
pillowcase are over. 
</P>
<P>
 Someday, when your 18 or 21, it'll be cool again to dress up. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, the mature thing to do is hang up your rubber mask, retire the 
pumpkin-head flashlight and do what thousands of other teens in Southern 
California have done for the past 22 years: hit Knott's Scary Farm in Buena 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The amusement-turned-hell park has been a tradition for virtually anyone 
growing up within a 50-mile radius of Knott's. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the experience a cross between a horror movie and a slumber party -- 
minus the slumber. The screams, the chatter and the energy never seem to cease. 
Unlike fright flicks, where one civilian is attacked by an army of the living 
dead, at Knott's Scary Farm it takes only one park employee covered in ghoulish 
makeup and garb to invoke fearful thrills even among massive packs of teens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love being scared," says Larissa Rehder, a sophomore at Sunny Hills High in 
Fullerton. She had such a eerily good time last year that she decided to return 
last Friday with four of her good friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm supposed to be too old to trick or treat," she continues. "But I love 
Halloween, and I love getting scared. So what else is there to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hang out with Larissa around the park for a while and that "love" comes 
through loud and clear. Her shriek is deafening. And as the only girl in the 
group, the guys endlessly try to freak her out, only to tell her to shut up 
when she screams. She says only her best friend and classmate, Mike Moran, 16, 
protects her from her mischievous pals. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that these dudes are too tough to flinch when a zombie-like Dean Martin 
falls out of the machine-generated fog. Larissa's friend and fellow Sunny Hills 
sophomore Joon Lee admits that even horror aficionados are not immune. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't think you're going to get scared," the 15-year-old says. "Most guys 
say they don't get scared. Then we do," he admits, losing the eye contact.  
</P>
<P>
 Whether they're genuinely scared is not the point. Few try to act cool and 
unaffected when confronted with one of the 1,000 monsters the park has on hand 
for the monthlong event. At $28.50 a ticket, the night better finish with a 
sore throat. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the usual cast of characters such as vampires, werewolves, the grim 
reaper and disfigured mutants. Yet apparently there's an 
equal-opportunity-for-monsters clause that states all nightmare fodder serves 
as scary game: gargoyles, a scarecrow, a gnome, enemy space aliens, sadistic 
Vikings, hunchbacks with bubonic plague. 
</P>
<P>
 The creepiest, however, are those who seem almost human: the sunken eyes 
shadowed by dark makeup, the powdery white skin, the torn flannel shirt and 
crazed hair. Not unlike some of the grungy die-hards who paid to get in. 
</P>
<P>
 One chain-saw-toting guy -- who is on the payroll -- elicited some of the most 
delicious dread.  
</P>
<P>
 Pulling the cord on the saw (minus the blades), a loud, gas-fueled grind 
causes everyone around him to break into B-movie panic. The crowd pushes one 
way and another trying to distance itself from him. "C'mon baby," he cries, 
running after a half-dozen screaming teen-age girls. 
</P>
<P>
 A young guy, about 14 or 15, walks by and, over the roar, yells "Dude, you're 
cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping the madness for a moment, the tormented handyman throws out a 
"thanks" before running off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So it's no shock that guests walk cautiously, perpetually unnerved and 
recoiling at every shoulder tap. (Shoulder tapping, in fact, is a favorite 
pastime among guests who get caught up in the fright fever). 
</P>
<P>
 That's why they're here, notes Larissa, 15. "I just like the whole aura of it 
and that at every corner I'll get scared." 
</P>
<P>
 Pal Abel Penya, also a Sunny Hills sophomore, echoes others, however, when he 
confides that the event is a great opportunity to meet new friends -- 
especially of the potential mate variety. "You meet a lot of girls, get a 
couple of numbers. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, for these guys, the biggest nightmare is that there's "too many girls 
with guys," Joon says. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true "most teen-agers come here to meet girls or guys and get phone 
numbers," says Buena Park High sophomore Jeremy Garrett, a friend who met up 
with Joon, Abel, Larissa and Mike that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's pretty fun coming with a girlfriend, because she gets scared," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, yes, a chance to hold her even tighter as she cringes into his side. It's 
indeed one of the benefits of the visit, says the 16-year-old.  
</P>
<P>
 Sound effects alone keep them close. Amplified winds howl so loudly that 
subconsciously a chill can come over guests, Jeremy says. "I love the sound 
effects. I mean they really do make you feel cold."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fluctuating entourage of eight or 11 or somewhere about that number stops 
at the Calico Square stage. There, a variety show is featuring burlap-covered 
Druid types whose chanting breaks into Queen's "We Will Rock You." 
</P>
<P>
 That's followed by an eclectic parade of this generation's most hideous icons: 
TV personality look-alikes. There's the bumble bee from the Lemonhead's video, 
and there's Roseanne. The hangman condemns Rush Limbaugh for impersonating a 
journalist, among other things, and is ready to wrap his neck with rope when 
the "insanity" is stopped by hyper diet-queen Susan Powter. She's followed by 
Suzanne Sommers and her Thigh Master, psychic chum Dionne Warwick and the guy 
who covers bald spots with a miracle spray-can remedy, among a host of other 
cable hucksters. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the demons with the festering rubber facial warts. These are some of 
the more truly loathsome characters on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Next the high-schoolers head to one of the parks many legendary and killer 
mazes. There's Mother Noose's Scary Tales, Carnival of Death, Industrial Evil 
and House of Maniacs. Our group chooses Nightmares -- so named, it seems 
initially, because of the long line. Abel, 15, says the lines are a real 
problem because -- like the dead at this time of the year -- boredom can arise. 
</P>
<P>
 Abel also cautions second-timers to KSF to go with different friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time it was fun. The second was all right, but I promised myself I 
wouldn't come again. But this time I like it again. You have to go with 
different people, or the effect wears off. That's what happened last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The maze, to put it mildly, petrified even this KSF veteran (well, it has been 
12 years). Walking behind the Sunny Hills crew, I ended up a number of times 
crashing in reverse into the couple behind me. So maybe Jeremy had a point 
about coming with someone you can latch onto. 
</P>
<P>
 Once outside in the sprinkling night, everyone exchanges vigorous reactions to 
the maze. Larissa just stands stunned and spooked amid the guys, too wrapped up 
in the excitement to ask her what's up. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally Mike notices and breaks Larissa's spell. But taking five to relax is 
no way to get back in the mood, she says. So she hurries them off to the next 
maze. 
</P>

high-schoolers.

FIRST PERSON: AFTER A DEATH, A DISCOVERY OF THE MAN THE BOY BECAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CRAIG TOMASHOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'd always assumed that death was something the other guy had to deal with -- 
until the phone call came, and I became the other guy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a voice mail message at work, left by my dad in Seattle. "It's your 
brother, Conrad." There was an awkward pause, as if he was reading off cue 
cards for the first time. "They found him in his apartment. He's dead. We're 
going down there now." 
</P>
<P>
 I thought it was a joke. Or maybe a case of mistaken identity. Somebody else's 
brother Conrad had just died, and I had been given the message by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 The details came in slowly. Conrad had been last seen at an office party 
Thursday night. He hadn't shown up for work Friday, and nobody had seen him 
over the weekend. When he didn't show up for work on Monday, some co-workers 
let themselves into his condo and found him lying peacefully in his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 He had died of natural causes three weeks shy of his 30th birthday, leaving 
behind my parents, older brother Chris and his twin brother, Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'd had pets die. My grandparents had passed away years earlier after living 
full lives. A sudden death like this isn't supposed to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 I spent the next week at my parents' house trying to sort out my sadness, as 
well as theirs. The most overwhelming feeling I had, though, wasn't grief. It 
was emptiness. The initial numbness refused to wear off. Maybe I was just in 
denial, but the real source of this lack of emotion, perhaps, was that I wanted 
very much to keep Conrad's memory alive. I had very few memories. 
</P>
<P>
 We had never been particularly close growing up. I was five years older, a 
substantial gap. More importantly, we never had much in common. Even before he 
could add and subtract, it seemed, he was studying the financial pages; I still 
can't balance a checkbook. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite book was "Catcher in the Rye." He enjoyed Paul Harvey's 
autobiography. I once voted for Jesse Jackson. He believed Richard Nixon got a 
raw deal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'd made feeble efforts to stay in touch after I moved off to college, sending 
the requisite Christmas and birthday cards, but I never received any in return. 
Since he landed a job at a Seattle accounting firm nearly a decade ago, he and 
I probably hadn't talked more than a dozen times. And even those conversations 
weren't exactly illuminating. He'd just stand there, arms crossed tightly over 
his chest, and utter a sarcastic "yes" or "no" to every question I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 As I sat at his memorial service, I heard friends of his -- one after another 
-- stand up and tell these wonderful stories about what he was like. They 
talked about his sensitivity, his generosity, even his ability to make an 
awesome blueberry coffee cake. Listening to these tales should have made me 
feel better. Instead, guilt overwhelmed me. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt that perhaps I'd never made enough effort to get to know him. My 
birthday cards should have been birthday calls. Now his life was gone, but I 
wanted another chance to be a part of it, now that he couldn't resist. And the 
only way to do that was to listen to the friends who had become his surrogate 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks after Conrad's death, the back bedrooms in my parents' house began 
to look like some sort of warehouse. They'd moved all his belongings out of his 
condo and into their place, but had yet to decide what to do with it all. 
</P>
<P>
 There were boxes piled everywhere, with an odd collection of stuff inside. One 
was filled with his CDs, another with books and papers he'd collected over the 
years, including the program from my college graduation with my name circled.  
</P>
<P>
 One closet was bursting with his Brooks Brothers suits, London Fog raincoats 
and camel's hair overcoats. A stack of bills he'd never have to pay sat on one 
dresser. On another was the one box never to be unpacked. It held his ashes. 
</P>
<P>
 I tried picking up some clues about who Conrad was by sifting through his 
possessions, but the real truth had to come from his friends. At first I felt 
awkward. I've spent 17 years asking people questions for a living. This was the 
first time the answers affected me personally. 
</P>
<P>
 I learned that two of his favorite movies were "Metropolitan" and "Ferris 
Bueller's Day Off." His musical tastes ranged from the Pet Shop Boys to Frank 
Sinatra. Vodka was his liquor of choice, although he liked to experiment with 
beers from local microbreweries. Lately, he'd started looking for the perfect 
cigar. He liked African art and pickled vegetables. And there was a time when 
his favorite wallet was this ratty, promotional billfold with the Seattle 
Supersonics logo. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the sort of day-to-day details that really describe a person, and 
they gave me plenty of clues as to who Conrad had become. Because he was such a 
recluse as a kid, I'd never pictured him out in the world enjoying the same 
sorts of things I might enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 These small pieces of the Conrad puzzle may seem trivial, but to me they were 
enlightening clues to a personality I couldn't previously picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone told me what a compassionate, thoughtful friend he made. One woman 
even told me how he made sure to place a red rose on her desk every time he 
sensed she was having a bad day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very in tune with what you liked, what you were about," one friend 
told me. "He became a part of what you were doing." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was accepting, not a brick wall. He could listen," said another. "If I 
needed anything, he was there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As amazing as it was to hear this, there were other details about Conrad's 
adult life that were pretty much what I'd expected. He'd held on to plenty of 
the personality traits that were so different from mine, the ones that kept us 
apart. 
</P>
<P>
 He loved being a Suit, "building his reputation and his wealth," I was told. 
He was a guy who read the Wall Street Journal cover to cover every morning, and 
the frugal sort who would save a dollar-off coupon for Polident toothpaste even 
though his need for it was decades away. He liked to bring cans of soup to the 
office for his lunch, and if a co-worker forgot to bring food, he'd offer to 
sell one of his extra cans. He was the quintessential yuppie a few years too 
late, driven by the need for status and possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He definitely wanted a certain lifestyle, to be in the right place with the 
right people and the right drinks," a friend and co-worker explained. "I 
remember one night we were at a party on the 56th floor of our building and 
Conrad sighed and said, 'It's so nice to be away from all that down there.' He 
liked to think of himself as better than others sometimes. I used to joke with 
him about that and he'd say, 'You're right. One should not be so serious. Yes, 
I am pretentious. What am I trying to prove?' " 
</P>
<P>
 He was trying so hard to live his life like a character from some old Cary 
Grant movie, where manners and sophistication were valued commodities. Opening 
doors for women was a required habit. Everyone he worked with told the same 
stories of his politeness, his all-consuming need to make sure everything was 
OK for everybody else. No expense was too great if he found the perfect gift 
for a friend. "He was my genie," I was told. 
</P>
<P>
 He also yearned to be as cultured as possible. To that end, the few hours he 
wasn't at work were spent volunteering for such organizations as the Navy 
League, the Seattle Art Museum, the Young Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did all that to be a part of everything," a friend said. "He got involved 
to make connections. He liked to know people, and things about people." 
</P>
<P>
 His was a very old-fashioned notion of success. He wanted everyone to know his 
name, to be somebody who mattered. What's sad is that this tight, conservative 
attitude was slowly starting to change in the months before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe he wasn't exactly ready to run off in a VW microbus to follow the 
Grateful Dead, but nearly all his friends told me that they had sensed 
something different about him. He danced at a Four Tops concert. Going to the 
theater had become his greatest passion. He went sky diving. He even bought a 
pair of jeans, a motorcycle jacket and boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Life was going well. He had plenty of things to look forward to -- remodeling 
the kitchen of his new condominium and starting a T-shirt business with a few 
of his friends. There was even talk of a trip to Greece or a bike ride through 
France. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, one of his closest friends told me that pressures in his life -- his 
finances, his job -- were starting to weigh heavily on him. And he had 
developed what he thought was a painful pulled muscle near his left shoulder. 
The ache wouldn't go away. 
</P>
<P>
 The pain was most likely the precursor to his cause of death, which was 
coldly, clinically written off in the autopsy report as "probable acute cardiac 
dysrhythmia associated with left hypoplastic left circumflex artery."  
</P>
<P>
 It was ironic. I'd always pictured Conrad as someone who operated more from 
his head than from his heart, and it was the latter that finally killed him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I had two dreams during the couple of days I spent in Seattle learning about 
Conrad. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd been told by a friend of his that Conrad had a bad habit of piling his 
laundry in a single huge heap by his bed, and in the first dream, I discovered 
him in his room trapped under the mound. He asked for help, and I yanked him 
out. He thanked me and suddenly I was in my parents' kitchen, telling my mom 
what I'd just done. She looked concerned and told me he hadn't checked in with 
her in days. 
</P>
<P>
 The second dream came on my last night in Seattle. I was talking to Conrad on 
the phone about an unspecified death in the family. He was assuring me that he 
was OK with it, that it was tough for a while but he was feeling much better 
now. I felt good hearing that, and I called my mom in the dream. She told me 
how strange that was, since Conrad had died weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd worried about whether I was doing the appropriate thing, digging around in 
Conrad's life and then telling the world about him. The dreams left me feeling 
that this was indeed the right thing to do, for him and for me. When I think of 
him now, I don't see some quiet kid. I see a brother I can finally relate to. 
</P>
<P>
 Five months after his passing, it's almost too easy to just forget about it 
all. Even the memories I uncovered by talking to his friends start to fade, and 
I have to force myself to remember what I've learned. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why I've vowed to continue down the path Conrad started on, loosening 
up and appreciating life more -- although I think sky diving is still out of 
the question. Carrying on is all the living can do for the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish it hadn't taken his death for me to appreciate his life, but there's 
nothing I can do about any of this now. Except help him accomplish the one goal 
he was never able to achieve. He wanted to be somebody. He wanted to leave 
something behind so everyone would know his name. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what you're holding in your hand.

AROUND TOWN: A GIFT OF BEAUTY AND EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BEVERLY BEYETTE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marcel Proust is not on the reading list for Michael Javier's students. Dead 
French novelists don't figure into ESL classes at Evans Community Adult School. 
</P>
<P>
 But Proust could have been writing about them: "Only through art can we get 
outside of ourselves and know another's view of the universe." 
</P>
<P>
 Javier knows that. His dream -- of an art gallery at Evans -- has just come 
true. In a once-empty cafeteria foyer, student art hangs where students used to 
post notices for used cars and mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are first-time artists. Others once were artists in their homelands, but 
now are janitors or dishwashers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is people's art. Colorful papier-mache masks. Pastel T-shirts that bear 
legends of coming to America "with only the shirt on my back." 
</P>
<P>
 With immigrant-bashing rampant, Javier says, "People need to hear their 
stories, to learn what our students have gone through." 
</P>
<P>
 Javier, 33, an artist himself, is a can-do sort who in 1988 fled the relative 
complacency of Reseda High for Evans, on the fringe of Downtown. Here, at any 
given time, the 10,000 students may come from 60 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although rich in diversity, it is a poor school, with no money for art 
classes. Javier kept thinking about how important it is for these students to 
have beauty in their lives and how art spans cultural borders. 
</P>
<P>
 From time to time he'd have students do art in ESL classes and would tape 
their work up in what is now the gallery. Always, it would fall to the floor to 
be trampled. 
</P>
<P>
 On a campus where "they can't even afford custodians," he knew there was no 
way he was going to get start-up money for a proper gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to work. Cleaning out his closets, he found some old frames, which he 
sold to another teacher for $100. That would buy canvases and paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Other teachers brought in items for sale. A campus beautification fund yielded 
$100 for painting the gallery walls and student Cervantes Morales donated the 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
 Students gave nickels and dimes. At Pier 1, Javier bought 50 pairs of 98-cent 
earrings and sold them at a small profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's Mr. Creativity," says ESL teacher Al Atwood, whose heat transfer press 
turned out Evans T-shirts to benefit the fund. He wanted this gallery. In his 
class of so-called slow learners, he has one "who can draw like Michelangelo." 
</P>
<P>
 "We got it open with probably less than $600," Javier says. This month's 
unveiling was a celebration, complete with ice sculptures from the Evans 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 The enthusiasm appears contagious. When Javier's students are asked how they 
feel about their teacher, their gallery, the applause is spontaneous: 
"Excelente!" They speak of the camaraderie of learning about one another. 
</P>
<P>
 In one class, everyone made a mask. "I showed them some pictures, sort of 
Picassoesque, and just let them go," Javier says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lupita Enciso, from Mexico, says her mask is "kind of like a reflection of 
myself, two different personalities." In class, she is very serious. But "I 
like to sing. I like to dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhina Zepeda, a pretty young woman from El Salvador, giggles and says she 
painted her face: "It was almost like I was making up." 
</P>
<P>
 Another piece in the show is a big outline of the United States on which are 
superimposed students' recollections of their first day in America. They tell 
of feeling as helpless as children, unable to speak. They describe their awe at 
the creature comforts, the freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier can relate to strangers in a strange land. He was born in Los Angeles, 
but he has Portuguese, Filipino, Spanish and Chinese blood. At UCLA, where he 
majored in English literature, he always felt in cultural "limbo-land." 
</P>
<P>
 Art in ESL classes makes perfect sense to him -- a way to teach new words. 
Brush, glue, paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Art field trips have proved an eye-opener to him and his students. One told 
him: "I didn't know I could go here. I thought this area was only for white 
people." They were at the Museum of Contemporary Art, a 10-minute walk from 
Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrounging money, Javier plans ongoing workshops where students will create 
art for the gallery. Exhibits will change monthly, sometimes tying in to ethnic 
holidays. Guest artists will also be invited to exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans Principal Francis Marsala -- the son of Sicilian immigrants -- is a 
booster. He knows that good English means better jobs, but "the way to the soul 
is through the arts." At Evans, "all the cultures of the world are rubbing up 
against each other and there's peace and harmony. There's hope, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 To Mexican immigrant Felipe Malagon, one of the mask makers, art is one way in 
which "we can communicate who we are to the wider community, so they will treat 
us as people instead of objects." 
</P>
<P>
 Evans Adult School is at 717 N. Figueroa St. The gallery is open from 7:30 
a.m. to 9:15 p.m. Monday-Thursday, and from 7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Fridays. 
Triumph of the Spirit 
</P>
<P>
 It is a Friday evening and, in a Beverly Hills home, about 50 of the faithful 
have come to meet Olya. 
</P>
<P>
 They are Bahais, disciples of a faith with its roots in mid-19th-Century 
Persia. Olya Roohizadegan, 51, is one of their heroines -- sole survivor among 
11 Bahai women imprisoned in revolutionary Iran for refusing to denounce their 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
 She does not know why she was saved -- "a miracle," she says -- but she 
understands her mission: to tell the world about the persecution and hangings 
of the women martyrs known as the Shiraz 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Her book, "Olya's Story," is as much their story as hers. It is a tale of 
torture, mob violence, secret burials. 
</P>
<P>
 She has told it before the United Nations and the European Court of Human 
Rights. A movie is in the works. Now, in L.A. for the first time, she is 
telling it at this Bahai "fireside." 
</P>
<P>
 "I forgive them," she says of the executioners. "I don't feel any hate. I pray 
for them . . . but I cannot forget 10 innocent women." For two months starting 
in late 1982, she was their friend and cellmate. 
</P>
<P>
 She pulls out fuzzy photos of the women and holds them up one by one. "Who is 
Shirin?" "Who is Roya?" Ten people step forward, each taking a photo and 
holding it high. The room is very quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 In introducing Roohizadegan, Muhtadia Rice of the local Bahai community had 
promised, "You will leave here this evening with a great sense of joy." 
</P>
<P>
 That joy is in the slain women's triumph of the spirit after lifelong 
persecution in a Muslim nation for their beliefs: equality for all, the oneness 
of God, their own prophets as well as Mohammed, the Muslims' sacred messenger. 
</P>
<P>
 The women "are now free," Roohizadegan tells the audience, "but I'm not free" 
so long as there is anyone who does not know about religious persecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Roohizadegan describes her ordeal, her interrogation by guards: "They brought 
my 3-year-old son, put him in my lap and said, 'This is your last chance (to 
recant).' " 
</P>
<P>
 She could not. She asks, what if "my baby grew up and realized his mother is a 
liar?" 
</P>
<P>
 The price of getting out of prison was the family's worldly goods. Even then, 
she lived in fear of being jailed again. Each moment was precious. She visited 
prisoners, smuggled news of Bahais to the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, she escaped with her husband and son overland to Pakistan. They 
were later reunited with their two older sons in England, where they now live. 
</P>
<P>
 She cannot return to Iran: "I am still sentenced to death."

NATURAL WONDER; AT HEART, EDWARD WILSON'S AN ANT MAN. BUT IT'S HIS THEORIES ON 
HUMAN BEHAVIOR THAT STIR UP TROUBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH GETLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a boy in Alabama, Edward O. Wilson hated fistfights. But he never ran from 
a scrap. Beaten and bloody, he wore his scars with pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord knows he tried to ignore the bullies who taunted him. Yet the ritual of 
fighting to prove himself seemed to haunt him wherever he went. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perfect training for a scientist," quips Wilson. "It's especially good if you 
travel a lot in strange territories like I have. When you take on foreign 
tribes, there's trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the kid who came home black-and-blue is one of the world's premier 
biologists and a Pulitzer Prize-winning author. More comfortable in front of a 
microscope than a microphone, he's been drawn into one nasty controversy after 
another during a 43-year career at Harvard University, much of it spent on the 
cutting edge of scientific thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is the world's leading authority on ants, yet he's gained more 
attention for his work in sociobiology -- the genetic and evolutionary roots of 
animal behavior -- and for his support of biodiversity in tropical rain 
forests. A reluctant warrior in wingtip shoes, he's a hero to many but a 
perennial target for critics, who call him everything from a Nazi to a 
knee-jerk liberal. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the current debate over race, genetics and intelligence, Wilson 
sparked an uproar by suggesting that biology shapes human traits, ranging from 
the sexual division of labor and religion to love and aggression. While many of 
his conclusions are now mainstream, he's been blasted by colleagues, heckled by 
demonstrators and had water dumped on his head in a public forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Such loathing is hard to imagine when you first meet Wilson in his quiet 
campus laboratory. In one corner, a collection of Central American ants scurry 
back and forth, carrying leaves to a makeshift colony. Across the room, a wall 
of awards, photos and certificates reflect the man's achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's Wilson himself: A tall, retiring fellow whose long, bony 
fingers look like chromosomes. Dressed in an Oxford shirt, rumpled tweed sport 
coat and dark gray slacks, he's the scientist from Central Casting, hardly the 
kind to ignite controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet appearances are deceiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "This man is a landmark in science, a pioneer in the areas he's explored," 
says Paul Ehrlich, a population biologist at Stanford University. "Ed doesn't 
seek out conflicts, but he's paid a price for his courage." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson tells the story in "Naturalist" (Island Press), a newly published 
autobiography. It's an eye-opening memoir of intellectual growth, showing how 
he evolved from a reclusive boy hooked on bugs into a scientist who's duked it 
out on the world stage. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who shun science writing, Wilson's vivid prose can be a revelation. 
He's long had the knack of making complex biology seem relevant to a general 
audience, and students rate him one of Harvard's top lecturers. He displays the 
same skills in his latest book. Listen to him dissect an egotistical colleague: 
</P>
<P>
 "He was friendly indeed, but supremely self-possessed and theatrically 
condescending. On the few occasions we spoke, I could not escape the feeling 
that he was actually addressing an audience of hundreds seated behind me. At 
the height of the campus turmoil at Harvard and elsewhere (he) was the speaker 
of choice . . . the kind of elegant, unworldly intellectual who fires up the 
revolution and is the first to receive its executioner's bullet." 
</P>
<P>
 Academic warfare fills the book, and Wilson loves to filter it through a 
biological lens. Look for the roots of human behavior in the past, he says, 
whether you go back 50 years or 50 million years. His boyhood fights and 
faculty clashes may seem anecdotal, but aren't we really talking about 
Paleolithic man, male initiation rites and tribal warfare? 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't help but look at the world this way, because the past always repeats 
itself," Wilson says with a grin. "We all fight battles, but the roots are 
buried deep in our biological past . . . deep in our genetic makeup." 
</P>
<P>
 Think you understand sports and politics? Think again. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't have this deep biological drive to root on warring groups, we 
wouldn't have million-dollar baseball players," Wilson suggests. "Or 
multimillion-dollar Senate races where victory parties look like V-E day." 
</P>
<P>
 As for O.J. Simpson, Wilson says those who have rushed to prejudge the 
defendant are re-enacting an evolutionary drama much older than tabloid TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find here one of the most basic conflicts in (prehistoric) society, which 
is ownership of the female," he ventures. "There are truly dire conflicts when 
the female struggles to break away or is claimed by another male." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A vigorous 66, Wilson has spent decades studying ants, and he was one of the 
first to discover that the insects communicate with each other by secreting 
chemical trails. His path-breaking research has also shown evolutionary links 
between ant behavior and mammals, including human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 The pursuit of these links led Wilson to sociobiology and, with it, the 
controversy that has dogged him much of his career. He's also been attacked for 
his views on species extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on intensive research and mathematical projections, Wilson suggests that 
more than 20% of all species could become extinct by 2010 if mankind continues 
to destroy ecological systems in the rain forests and elsewhere. If the pace of 
destruction continues, he adds, the toll could rise to 50% within 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 That projection is accepted by many biologists, and Wilson has written widely 
on the subject. But lately a political backlash has developed against his call 
to arms. Where's the proof of such extinction? some critics ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is such a sweeping generalization," wrote journalist Stephen Budiansky in 
U.S. News and World Report last year. "Yet the political climate has made it 
difficult for scientists to challenge the more politically correct view of 
Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, some colleagues grumble at Wilson's ability to command media 
attention. But the spotlight isn't always flattering. In 1978, left-wing 
demonstrators opposed to his sociobiological theories shouted him down at a 
crowded Washington, D.C., forum. Then they dumped ice water on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most unpleasant, most disagreeable," says the biologist, sipping a cup of 
coffee in his office. "I never wanted any of this conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't cross him. Wilson can be courteous to a fault, but he rarely 
forgets an insult. In his book, he offers a crash course in the viciousness of 
Harvard politics, and lavishes strong but ironic praise on his enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 "My critics served me well," Wilson says. "They forced me to make myself 
intellectually tough and to make sure I had the facts to support my work." 
</P>
<P>
 Running his fingers through a thatch of thinning hair, Wilson leans forward 
and smiles. Always look to the past, he says. The playground bullies of his 
youth didn't wear lab coats or pin-stripe suits -- but they played the same 
role. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Birmingham, Wilson stood out from the other kids in one key respect: 
He never outgrew his bug phase. "Sonny," as he was called, loved the creatures 
that filled the forests and streams of sub-tropical Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, he chalks up his insect love to family upheaval. His parents 
divorced when he was 7, and Wilson's father moved from one job to another. 
Attending 16 schools during his first 12 years of public education, it was hard 
to make lasting friends, he recalls, but animals were always there. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson says he was shaped by three American institutions. Southern Baptism 
gave him an unflagging faith in good works. Military school, which he briefly 
attended, imbued him with an old-fashioned sense of manliness. And the Boy 
Scouts, which he adored, left him with respect for honor and courtesy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's see you do better in 54 words or less," he says, reciting the Boy Scout 
oath. "I drank in and accepted every word. Still do, as ridiculous as that may 
seem to my colleagues in the intellectual trade." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's love of insects grew, and mentors at the University of Tennessee 
steered him to Harvard, with its world-class ant collection. He was accepted in 
1951 and has been there since. Currently, he's Pelligrino University Professor 
and curator in entomology at the Museum of Comparative Zoology. 
</P>
<P>
 He married Irene Kelley, a poet, in 1955, and the couple had a daughter, 
Catherine, in 1963. Notoriously private, Wilson says little about his family 
life in "The Naturalist." But the book contains painful disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before Wilson began his doctoral studies, his alcoholic father committed 
suicide. Crushed with grief then, the author now sees it as a turning point. 
Suddenly, he was free to pursue his calling without family distractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are times when suicide liberates, and I'm sure that's happened to quite 
a few people, whether they admit it or not," Wilson says. "I guess you reach a 
certain point in life when you can admit that. For me, it's time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's early work focused on evolutionary biology, the study of how animals 
change over time. His first crisis erupted in the mid '50s, when James Watson 
-- an influential Harvard scientist who would later win the Nobel Prize for his 
role in discovering DNA -- accused Wilson and other faculty biologists of 
pursuing obsolete studies. At one point, it seemed they might lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he survived the scare, Wilson was challenged as never before. Now a 
tenured professor, he began exploring sociobiology during a 1956 trip to Puerto 
Rico. Observing rhesus monkeys, he wondered how ant and primate societies might 
be compared, as part of a larger theory of animal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Years of intense study led to a second crisis, with the 1975 publication of 
his "Sociobiology" (Harvard-Belknap). In the controversial book, Wilson probed 
the genetic roots of all animal behavior, including human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of its findings, dealing with lower forms of life, won praise. But Wilson 
set off alarms when he suggested that biology shapes human nature as well. 
Although he won a National Medal of Science in 1977, criticism was fierce and 
some faculty members shunned him. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, his opponents insisted that culture is more influential in determining 
human nature. In 1975, anthropology professor Stephen Jay Gould and 15 other 
colleagues wrote a blistering letter about Wilson to the New York Review of 
Books, saying he provided a "genetic justification of the status quo and of 
existing privileges for certain groups according to class, race or sex." These 
arguments, they said, led to the rise of Adolf Hitler. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no interest in ideology," Wilson says, "yet I had to fight back. I felt 
keenly betrayed, because my colleagues were politicizing science." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years later, many of Wilson's conclusions have been accepted as 
mainstream. He has since clarified his theories to argue that human behavior is 
a product of cultural and genetic evolution. The great challenge facing 
science, he says, is to probe the way those two influences interact. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he's received numerous honors, winning the 1979 Pulitzer Prize for 
"On Human Nature" (Harvard), a response to sociobiology critics, and the 1991 
Pulitzer Prize for "The Ants" (Harvard), a 700-page opus written with Bert 
Holldobler. Yet memories of his bitter conflicts have eased only slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The day he was doused with ice water "may be the only occasion in recent 
American history on which a scientist was physically attacked, however mildly, 
for the expression of an idea," he writes. "How could an entomologist with a 
penchant for solitude provoke a tumult of this proportion?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is politics. Once a scientist speaks out, Wilson suggests, the 
niceties of academic discourse and professional courtesy can quickly disappear. 
His experience with the biodiversity crisis is a good example. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson couldn't help but notice the inexorable destruction of tropical rain 
forests during research trips he took to Asia and Latin America as far back as 
1956. Urban sprawl, pesticides and overpopulation were wiping out the precious 
habitats, and it wasn't simply an aesthetic problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain forests contain more flora and fauna than any other part of the world, he 
notes. They're a gold mine of medicines, such as cyclosporin -- a valuable 
immune-suppressant that comes from a fungus -- and taxol, a drug from the 
Pacific yew that's used to treat cancer. More miracle drugs are waiting to be 
discovered, yet as the rain forests shrink, these resources are threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need is a citizens' wake-up call for the planet," he says. "It's a 
genuine emergency. Nothing should distract us from this task." 
</P>
<P>
 But politics intervene. Along with other biologists, Wilson testified before 
Congress, urging passage of an expanded Endangered Species Act to protect 
entire ecosystems, not just individual animals. He also pushed for 
congressional ratification of the 1992 Rio Pact on Biodiversity. 
</P>
<P>
 Both measures are currently blocked by Washington gridlock, however, and 
Wilson has been attacked for his efforts. The notion that he has exaggerated 
the rate of species extinction in shrinking rain forests exasperates him. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not smart criticisms," he says tartly. "They're absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Reciting what he calls an ironclad law of ecology, Wilson says the more you 
reduce the area in which a species lives, the more its numbers will decline. He 
cites evidence from studies in the Philippines, Madagascar, Brazil, Florida and 
the forests of the eastern United States to prove his point. 
</P>
<P>
 And then . . . weary of the debate, drained by the endless back and forth, 
Edward O. Wilson stretches his long legs and allows a smile to cross his face. 
It's late in the afternoon, and an autumn chill settles on the campus outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people may find it odd, but I never forgot the upbeat attitudes of the 
Southern Baptist experience," he says. "And that really comforts me. It's a 
rock, especially when you deal with all these conflicts."

<P>
 Has the ant-chasing biologist found God in his twilight years?  
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't phrase it that way," Wilson says. "But Southern Baptism is a 
good-news faith, and I always try to stress the positive in science. So sure, 
put me down as a good news secular humanist. Let the word go forth." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In a packed lecture hall, he spreads the word. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, biodiversity is more than an abstract concept. Dimming the lights, 
Wilson shows students a dramatic slide -- a nighttime photo of Earth taken by 
satellites -- and points out eerie flames stretching across the Equator, across 
Latin America and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 They're fires burning out of control in the rain forests on any given evening. 
It's a disturbing sight, yet Wilson says there is still time to save the 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
 On another morning, he compares human beings to ants. Consider man's 
selfishness and ambition versus the insects' drive to help their community. 
They'll sacrifice their lives for the common good, if need be. 
</P>
<P>
 Biology doesn't get more basic than this, and Wilson ends the lesson amid 
gales of laughter by raising the subject of Marxism. Why did it fail? 
</P>
<P>
 "Good ideology," he says dryly. "Wrong species."

OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; A PAGE FROM HISTORY; EXPERIENCE: FOR A SENIOR 
AT KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL IN LA PALMA, A SESSION WITH CONGRESS IN WASHINGTON, 
D.C., IS MORE THAN JUST A JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY FUNG, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES Abby Fung is a senior at Kennedy High School 
in La Palma. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I sit here, thinking about being a part of history and watching it unfold: 
witnessing historic peace accords, attending nationally televised press 
conferences and rubbing elbows with the country's foremost elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Just wishful thinking? 
</P>
<P>
 Nah. From July 11 to Aug. 12, I served as one of 12 Republican House pages 
among the 66 congressional pages chosen for a summer session on Capitol Hill. 
(There are two short summer sessions for pages, one long one for the school 
year.) 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after my red-eye flight from LAX to Washington Dulles, I checked 
into my dorm room at the O'Neill Office Building (named for former Speaker Tip 
O'Neill) and met the people with whom I would eat, live and hang out for the 
next five weeks.  
</P>
<P>
 On the first day, we traipsed to the Capitol for an orientation tour led by 
Doorkeeper Donald K. Anderson, who described in detail the objects, paintings, 
statues and rooms that had previously been familiar to me only through 
textbooks and guidebooks. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-block walk from my dorm to the Capitol was one that would eventually 
become commonplace. Yet I never ceased to be amazed at what I could encounter 
in the short distance -- everything from press conferences on health care 
reform, the crime bill or campaign spending limits to protests on the same 
topics or other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 My excitement for Washington far outweighed the initial hesitation I had at 
reporting for work each morning in a regulation tie, white button-down shirt, 
gray skirt or pants and navy blazer.  
</P>
<P>
 Because our duties consisted mainly of delivering packages from one 
congressional building to another, I quickly learned to navigate the labyrinth 
of tunnels and subways beneath the House and Senate floors. Packages typically 
contained documents and written correspondence, but I delivered everything from 
a five-pound cantaloupe to a senator's tennis racket. Even though working hours 
were officially 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., the pages typically stayed until House 
adjournment, sometimes as late as midnight or 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides getting used to my job, I had to adjust to new friends, a new 
environment and living on my own for the first time. Being forced to buy my own 
food (only dinner was provided at the Capitol coffee shop), wash my own clothes 
and fend for myself definitely made me more self-reliant. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, the pages had preconceptions about one another based upon 
geographic regions -- Californians were thought to be obsessed with beaches, 
movie stars and health food. But as we got to know one another, we became fast 
friends. On weekends, we went to movies at Union Station, dinner at Hard Rock 
or Planet Hollywood and shopping in Georgetown; or, for more educational fare, 
we toured museums and monuments. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the greatest thing about working at the Capitol was the opportunity to 
meet the officials you usually only see on TV or in the newspaper. The frequent 
chance meetings allowed me to see those leaders as human beings rather than 
cultivated images. It was not unusual to overhear House Majority Leader Richard 
Gephardt (D-Mo.) talking health care in an elevator, to run into Atty. Gen. 
Janet Reno or Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) on the Capitol steps or to 
breakfast with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). 
</P>
<P>
 One event I'll never forget was the historic peace conference July 26 between 
King Hussein of Jordan and Prime Minister Yatzik Rabin of Israel. The warmth 
and goodwill generated by the two men's earnest plea for "lasting peace in the 
Middle East" brought the House Visitors' Gallery, the Press Gallery and the 
senators, congressmen, Supreme Court justices and Cabinet members to their feet 
with thunderous applause.  
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, several other pages and I got to meet Vice President Al Gore and 
shake his hand. Others I met were Oliver North (a candidate for the Senate from 
Virginia), Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, Speaker of the House Thomas Foley 
and, of course, my sponsor, Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton). I continue to see 
Royce at monthly dinner meetings of the Asian Pacific Congressional Advisory 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnessing debates on controversial topics such as the crime bill and health 
care reform, attending the Whitewater hearings and seeing daily press 
conferences and briefings unfold all added to the experience. Other things that 
I'll never forget: schlepping through the Smithsonian museums, seeing the 
serene beauty of the Lincoln Memorial at night, listening to the Air Force band 
from the Capitol steps and mastering that tricky Metro subway system. 
</P>
<P>
 Those five weeks on Capitol Hill taught me more about politics and government 
than any textbook could. They also honed my skills in leadership, diplomacy and 
public relations and forced me to take care of myself.  
</P>
<P>
 And now, when I switch on C-Span, I can reel off the names and states of those 
lawmakers on the screen. It is a skill I cherish -- and know I share with all 
the other pages out there. How to Get to Washington Without Winning Election 
</P>
<P>
 Interested in becoming a Congressional Page? 
</P>
<P>
 First, decide if you'd like to participate in one of two summer sessions or 
attend for an entire school year. School-year pages go to morning classes at 
the Page School to keep up with their high school studies and perform page 
duties in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 You must be at least 16 years old at the time your appointment begins, be just 
entering or just completing your junior year and have a cumulative grade-point 
average of B or better in all major courses. 
</P>
<P>
 If you fit those requirements, request an application from your local 
congressman. (Addresses are in the phone book.) Because Orange County doesn't 
have a Democratic member of Congress, you would have to go outside of Orange 
County for a Democratic sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 Completed applications for both summer or fall service must be returned in 
early spring (usually around April 1). Notification should arrive in early May.

THE GOODS; THE WISH LIST; IT LOOKS LIKE THE FUN AND GAMES THIS HOLIDAY SEASON 
WILL COME VIA TELEVISION AND MOVIE CHARACTERS. SO GO GET THOSE POWER RANGERS 
AND HUNT DOWN THAT LION KING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ho, ho, ho, parents. Only 64 shopping days left until Christmas. Do you know 
what the kids want? 
</P>
<P>
 The New Jersey-based Toys R Us puts the answer quite simply on its Hot 
Items-Christmas 1994 list: "All Power Ranger Products." 
</P>
<P>
 Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and Lion King stuff head the pack for the 
upcoming holidays according to trackers of toy sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything Power Ranger is still popular. It's like a feeding frenzy the demand 
is so great," says Chris Byrne, toy consultant and editor of the new Market 
Focus: Toys magazine set to debut December 1.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can slap a Power Ranger license on almost everything and the parents will 
buy it. They say to the kids, 'See, I got you something Power Ranger. So please 
don't hate me.' "  
</P>
<P>
 But, if you will need one or more of the five Mighty Morphin Power Ranger 
figures (or additional accessories), head straight to the nearest toy store. 
NOW.  
</P>
<P>
 Because the TV show is still tops with children, expect the newest Power 
Ranger accessories -- five new battle machines called Thunderzords, others 
called Thunder Powerzords, and a host of Evil Space Aliens -- to be especially 
hot by the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for mania over a new Power Ranger, the White Tiger, who commands the 
White Tigerzord, which "morphs" from a "ferocious tiger mode to a battle-ready 
warrior" complete with electronic light and sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Nipping at the heels of the Power Rangers is the Lion King, in plush toys, 
games and puzzles. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the release of "The Lion King" in June, Disney has licensed "well over 
50 Lion King products, from aprons to xylophones," says Chuck Champlin Jr., 
director of communications for Disney. Mattel in El Segundo is the major 
licensee and is just now shipping out its newest plush line, "Talking Simba," 
"Roaring Simba" and "Purring Simba." Bet on Talking Simba to be a favorite. The 
charming big-eyed creature talks, giggles and tries to roar. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't rule out other company's toys, such as Milton Bradley's four new Lion 
King games and its Power Ranger game and puzzles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although it is obvious the Power Rangers and Lion King are still big 
favorites, there are no real new blockbuster-type hits this year," says Frank 
Reysen, editor of Playthings, a toy industry trade magazine. "Big this year are 
movie tie-ins." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, this year's Duracell Toy Industry Forecast, which is predicting a 2% 
to 4% gain in toy revenue, says toys based on popular entertainment characters 
from movies and TV will make up at least half of all toys sold. (Last year, 
total overall toy revenue was $17.5 billion). 
</P>
<P>
 Expect toy characters from "The Flintstones" movie to be still selling for the 
holidays, as well as X-Men, Spider-man, Ninja Turtles and even Batman. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember that a TV show that comes into the house once or twice a 
day is a powerful persuader with a child," Byrne says. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Reysen and Byrne see another industry trend emerging during the past two 
to three years, that of the multicultural dolls and toys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toy companies are doing multicultural toys in a more sensitive way," Reysen 
says. "There are not just black dolls, but American Indian, Asian, Hispanic 
ones. The companies are attempting to reflect the cultures involved, and trying 
to do it right. They're not just putting a black face on what is basically a 
white doll." 
</P>
<P>
 Reysen says toy manufacturers now use various colored skin tones and 
ethnically correct facial sculpturing and hair to define their multicultural 
dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 "This trend toward authentic multicultural toys and dolls began with the small 
minority toy firms and has mainstreamed," Byrne says. 
</P>
<P>
 Cultural Toys in Minneapolis is one of those minority-owned firms that has 
influenced the multicultural toy market. Launched in 1992 by Jacob Miles, a 
black engineer with 21 years experience in the toy business, the firm is the 
country's leading producer of multicultural dolls, infant and preschool 
products, board games, puzzles, and music and video cassettes. Next year, Miles 
plans to add CD-ROM products.  
</P>
<P>
 His 1994 line of dolls, called Dinkytown Daycare Kids, debuted at Target 
stores earlier this year and is expected to be a top seller. 
</P>
<P>
 Cultural Toys' eight Dinkytown Daycare Kids represent children of a variety of 
backgrounds, including African American, Asian American, Latino, Native 
American and white. New this year is a doll wheelchair.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question we've created a new category of toys in doing what we're 
doing," Miles says. "And the big guys are now getting involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Several large manufacturers of talking toys and dolls now include Spanish as 
well as English-speaking versions. Mattel produces its 35-year-old Barbie in a 
Dolls of the World Collection. This year's entrants are Dutch Barbie, Chinese 
Barbie and Kenyan Barbie. There is also a new Mattel line called "Children 
Together," so far featuring collectible dolls representing England, Mexico and 
Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro's Playschool division is expanding its Kids of Color line, which was 
quite popular last year, and Tyco has added a little sister, Kiana, this year 
for its successful Kenya, an ethnically authentic hair-styling doll introduced 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 This year Tyco has also introduced a beautiful new Latina doll, Ana, La 
Quinceanera , inspired by the Latina 15th birthday coming of age ritual. Hot 
Toys for 1994 * All Power Ranger products, ranging from action figures ($7) to 
large play sets ($150), from Bandai. The new White Tigerzord and White Ranger 
combo ($50) should top the charts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lion King plush toys from Mattel, particularly Talking Simba ($34). 
</P>
<P>
 * Dr. Dreadful Food Lab and Dr. Dreadful Drink Lab ($25 each) from Tyco. Kids 
can mix up Monster Warts and Putrid Potions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Barbie. New from Mattel are Bedtime Barbie ($13) with a soft fabric body; 
Dr. Barbie ($17); Gymnast Barbie ($12), and 35th Anniversary Barbie ($27), a 
reproduction of the 1959 original. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crack the Case ($20), a detective game from Milton Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dinkytown Daycare Kids ($15 each), from Cultural Toys, is a new line of 
multicultural dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vac-Man ($25), from Cap Toys, a 15-inch figure -- the arch-enemy of Stretch 
Armstrong -- that shrinks with a vacuum pump, stretches to many shapes, then 
pops back its original form. 
</P>
<P>
 * Floam ($4) from Mattel is a new bright-colored play compound that molds, 
stretches and bounces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ready Set Go pickup ($50) from Buddy L. is for preschoolers. It responds to 
64 commands and can even do wheelies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maniac Mouse ($16) from Milton Brady. A game in which players attempt to 
steal the cheese from the mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Secret Talk Betsy ($30) from Tyco is a soft doll that talks baby talk when 
her tummy is pressed, then explains what she means in grown-up talk when her 
wrist is pressed. English or Spanish speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 * Micro-Bake Cake Set ($20) from JusToys, is a coated pan that lets kids bake 
cakes in a microwave. It uses any packaged cake mix and has a safety chamber 
with a lock that doesn't open until the pan is cool. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ana, La Quinceanera, 15-inch doll ($24) from Tyco celebrates girls' 15th 
birthdays, a Latina rite of passage.  
</P>

MY TURN: OC HIGH: STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; A TELLING WAY TO KEEP GRAMPA'S LEGACY 
ALIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COURTNEY KNAPP, Courtney Knapp is a senior at Westminster High School. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not everyone in the family agreed about my grandfather's stories. 
</P>
<P>
 An older relative and I disagreed on how often we wanted to hear those 
stories. They were about serving on an aircraft carrier in World War II, being 
a safety inspector for the fire department and performing as a grand master for 
the Masonic lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 We both thought the world of Grampa -- a loving, thoughtful, funny and 
sensitive man. 
</P>
<P>
 But whereas my relative prefers to hear a story once and then move on to 
another subject, I could sit and listen to Grampa's stories over and over.  
</P>
<P>
 He did tend to rattle on about things, but I'd always thought that was part of 
his charm. Some thought that senility was sinking in, but I didn't say 
anything. I just silently wished my relative had more patience for Grampa. 
</P>
<P>
 A simple story of Grampa's would always make me feel good. People who lived 
decades ago have seen more than the average child or teen. Besides showing love 
for me, Grampa shared his life with me, one of the most precious things a human 
can give another. Stories shared by older relatives can have amazing influence 
on a young person's life and character. 
</P>
<P>
 Grampa died June 24 in his sleep, 76 years young. 
</P>
<P>
 Stabs of shock and pain immediately shook his family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 With him gone, we'd never hear him tell again about his plane crash in the 
battle of Leyte Gulf and of how he came home in a body cast. Or how he used to 
buy ice cream and a maple bar for lunch in high school for only 10 cents. I'd 
never hear him sing "School Days" to me on the first day of school, or come out 
into the workshop and see him covered in sawdust, with a big grin on his face.  
</P>
<P>
 But Grampa's stories won't go unheard. My family and I will continue to 
lovingly talk of him and of the stories that were about his life. He won't be 
forgotten.

INK: A TIME SO RIGHT FOR GOSSIPMEISTER WALTER WINCHELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL D. COLFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; He is a columnist for Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Was there ever a season when so many gossipy, sordid and celebrity-driven 
books were vying for attention? Five new titles about Charles and Di . . . two 
about Marlon Brando . . . one about Michael Jackson . . . Roseanne's sister 
tells all . . . Nicole Simpson's pal looks back . . . Burt Reynolds gives his 
side . . . and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Winchell (1897-1972) would have been in his glory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the '30s and '40s, the legendary and ruthless gossipmeister reached as many 
as 50 million people -- two-thirds of the adult population -- with his radio 
program and widely syndicated column in New York's Daily Mirror. His radio 
broadcasts ("Good evening, Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships at sea") drew 
an incredible 60% of all listeners tuned to their sets. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a life freshly chronicled -- appropriately in this season of personality 
ink -- in "Winchell" by Neal Gabler (Knopf). Although the author is amused to 
find himself making some of the same promotional stops as Burt Reynolds, the 
difference between "Winchell" and the other celeb stories in the fall logjam 
could not be wider. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gabler's 681-page book offers sweeping social history in addition to 
biography. It's subtitled "Gossip, Power and the Culture of Celebrity" because 
the trajectory of Winchell's career -- from third-rate vaudevillian to tabloid 
tattler to multimedia giant to embittered has-been -- allowed the author to 
illustrate rich themes: the evolution of American media, the decline in 
journalistic standards and the corrosive power of fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Were Winchell alive today, I think he would have been tremendously frustrated 
that he couldn't monopolize this kind of information," Gabler said at lunch the 
other day.  
</P>
<P>
 "Now, thanks largely to Walter Winchell, there are a thousand outlets. There's 
People magazine, Vanity Fair, 'Hard Copy,' Star magazine. This process began 
while he was alive. It's one of the factors that contributed to his demise." 
</P>
<P>
 Gabler, 44, spent more than five years researching Winchell's life and times. 
Before Winchell became a newspaperman, he wrote, celebrity puffery was 
published by mainstream dailies while gossip was reported only by marginal 
sheets. It was Winchell's seminal achievement to buck publishers' fears of 
libel suits and cross the line -- placing gossip about births, show biz and 
romantic liaisons in the center of the press's agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Winchell invented the form of the gossip column," Gabler said. "The whole 
notion of the way the gossip was presented, the means of expression, 
dot-dot-dot (the use of ellipses), and everything pared down to subject and 
predicate, and running nearly four dozen items in a single column -- he 
invented that." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Winchell's radio broadcasts, Gabler wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "They heard Walter's voice, the timbre high and clipped like verbal tap shoes, 
racing at nearly two hundred words a minute . . . It all seemed mildly but 
excitingly illicit -- this world Winchell hurled each Sunday night into the 
teeth of Depression America . . . It was a world where romance was a euphemism 
for sex and where each listener was a voyeur, vicariously enjoying the 
suggestion of perpetual sexual availability of these stars, celebrities and 
socialites who changed lovers, husbands and wives like clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Winchell was "the king of the media in the thirties," when he presided 
over cafe society from his listening post at the Stork Club in Manhattan, a 
mention in his column or on his broadcast "meant that one was among the exalted 
. . . It meant that one's life was validated, albeit validated by fame rather 
than accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is it much different today? 
</P>
<P>
 "Walter Winchell's life was dedicated to the proposition that anonymity is 
death," Gabler said. "At the same time, he realized that if he wasn't driving 
himself that way, somebody else would take his place. The world of celebrity 
was an ephemeral one. Winchell understood this better than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 When the column was dropped by the World Journal Tribune in 1967, ending 
Winchell's 38-year association with the Hearst organization, the loss set him 
adrift. As detailed in many pages by Gabler, Winchell's physical and spiritual 
demise over the next five years wasn't pretty. His son committed suicide, and 
Winchell, all but forgotten, died from cancer in Los Angeles. He was buried, 
incongruously for the bard of Broadway, in the Arizona desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Scorsese has bought the film rights to "Winchell" and Steve Zaillian, 
an Oscar winner for "Schindler's List," is writing the screenplay. Gabler sees 
Dustin Hoffman donning a gray fedora and summoning his best nasal accent to 
play the man himself. 
</P>
<P>
 There, too, is another irony. Gabler, whose previous book was "An Empire of 
Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood," pointed out that Winchell cast 
himself apart from the luminaries of the film world. "Here is a man who said, 
'I don't want to enter that power center. I want to destroy it. I hate those 
people. Those people are the antithesis of what I want to be . . . How can I 
gain attention at their expense?' "

COMPANY OF WOMEN; PHILANTHROPY: SPURRED ON BY A RESEARCH PAPER, 11 WOMEN FORMED 
A FOUNDATION THAT HAS RAISED $1 MILLION FOR AGENCIES THAT SERVE WOMEN AND 
GIRLS.

<P>
 More than a decade ago, a University of Redlands graduate student was doing 
her master's thesis on creating a foundation dedicated to women. Liz Bremner's 
research revealed that less than 3% of corporate and foundation dollars were 
directed to agencies that served primarily women and girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of Bremner's work reached the Women's Foundation in San Francisco -- the 
first of its kind on the West Coast -- and spread back to Los Angeles. 
Eventually, 11 women of diverse backgrounds spurred by Bremner's research met 
and decided they wouldn't simply wait for more money to trickle down. 
</P>
<P>
 They created the Los Angeles Women's Foundation to elevate the status of women 
and girls through what one official called "responsive philanthropy," and 
Bremner became its first director. This past summer, the organization surpassed 
$1 million in total grants awarded to agencies that serve women and girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made up our minds early on that if we wanted to help women and girls 
overcome prejudice we had to form an organization which lived the ideal, and 
we've accomplished that," said Belinda Smith Walker, its founding president and 
a Harvard Law School graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started we had zero dollars in the bank, no major donors and we had 
to learn how to ask for money and how to give our own. Now, over a million 
dollars later, we've accomplished that." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker eventually passed the volleyball -- no gavels for this group -- to the 
next president, Cristina Fuentes. Fuentes, a financial planner for American 
Express Co., remembered that it wasn't enough to give time and ask others to 
give money. They had to tap their own bank accounts too. 
</P>
<P>
 "One hundred dollars was easy but $1,000 was a lot. I paid it in installments. 
Women do impossible things -- we don't stop to think about it, because if we 
did, nothing would get done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the foundation commissioned a report to assess the economic status 
of women in L.A. County based on their access to jobs, income and education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women will play a vital role in the economic recovery of Los Angeles, so we 
had to examine the 'sticky floors' as well as the 'glass ceilings' in the 
workplace," Jean Conger, the foundation's executive director, said at its 
Miracle Mile headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, called "How Are Women Doing in LA? Looking to the Future," found 
that between 1980 and 1990, the number of people living below the poverty line 
increased 50% -- the majority of them women and children. Further, it noted, 
working women have a median annual income of just $16,843 -- $10,000 less than 
working men. 
</P>
<P>
 The report is the first stage of the foundation's Economic Justice Initiative, 
a long-term effort to link foundations and corporations and steer large amounts 
of money to areas where it is most urgently needed. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after the Northridge earthquake, the Peter Norton Family Foundation 
wanted to find an efficient means to disburse $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a history with the Los Angeles Women's Foundation of giving them 
money which is very well spent," said Anne Etheridge, executive director of the 
Norton foundation. "So when they streamlined the application process . . . and 
involved me in the awarding process, we never hesitated. Every foundation in 
town should be giving money to LAWF." 
</P>
<P>
 When the O.J. Simpson case opened the subject of domestic violence to a wider 
audience, the LAWF received scores of calls on the issue from the agencies they 
already fund. "They were being firestormed with calls from battered women and 
the media. Many media requests were insensitive, like the one for a 'woman with 
bruises -- and quickly.' The reporter said, 'We're on deadline,' " Conger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a week of the first Simpson headline, Conger staged a retreat and 45 
agencies attended to pool resources and learn about media relations. "We're not 
a rich-ladies organization. We're interested in relationships with the people 
in the trenches and sometimes they need opportunities more than money," Conger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception, LAWF has given away $1.1 million, raising more than half 
that amount in just the past two years. Grants have risen steadily from $26,000 
in 1987 to $312,000 in 1994 fiscal year. What is not given away is spent on 
LAWF programs such as the economic justice initiative, the management 
assistance partnership program -- which matches volunteers to agencies that 
need specific kinds of help -- and a workshop series. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating costs for the 1993-94 fiscal year were 17%, well below the 39% 
allowed under standards set by the National Charities Information Bureau. That 
included the salaries of five LAWF employees. 
</P>
<P>
 A program has been established in which employees of several public agencies 
-- including the city and county of Los Angeles, the Department of Water and 
Power and the city of Santa Monica -- can check off a certain amount each 
payday to be donated to LAWF. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, grants up to $10,000 were awarded to 40 agencies. The Mother's Club 
Community Center in Pasadena, which received $5,000, typifies the aims of the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under one roof, it provides services from language and parenting classes to 
child care. The center, which is staffed by the mothers as well as some paid 
employees who started out as volunteers, has a $175,000 annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-four years ago, Susan Kujawa was one of the mothers who brought her son 
to play. She said she was in a bad marriage -- unhappy, shy and convinced that 
she couldn't do very much. "It was about friendship then and it's still about 
friendship," said Kujawa, now the center's director.  
</P>
<P>
 In the decade since Belinda Smith Walker picked up the ball, the amount of all 
corporate and grant dollars for women has climbed nearly two percentage points. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Business ownership among women in Los Angeles accounts for half of all new 
business starts. More women entered the realm of professional workers but they 
still make up two-thirds of all minimum-wage earners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to change anything in the organization. We just want to reach 
more women with more dollars," said Debra Nakatomi, a corporate and nonprofit 
marketing consultant who recently began a two-year term as president. 
</P>
<P>
 LAWF officials want to establish an endowment and attract large contributions, 
but development director Mary Rapoport sees other potential donors -- 
individual women. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are women of all ages out there who have never given before and have no 
history or role model for giving. We want to reach those women. There are women 
who have benefited from programs and are on their feet. We want their dollars. 
And finally, there are women who have a history of giving and we need to make a 
case for them to invest in other women and change lives," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want them all to become philanthropists and a force for the economic 
development of our community."

BEHIND THE SCENES: STROKES OF SUBTLETY AT MOSSIMO/GQ OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Say "golf" and visions of plaid polyester trousers colored like Easter eggs, 
chalky white shoes and hats and frumpy knit sweaters spring to mind. 
</P>
<P>
 But guests and participants at Wednesday's Mossimo/GQ Open at Pelican Hill 
Golf Club in Newport Coast will have to reconsider that moldy perception. 
Understated basics ruled the green among the 144 mostly 
twenty-to-thirtysomething linksmen. They played to raise $10,000 for homeless 
children aided by Planet Hope, a charity headed by Kelly Stone, whose sister, 
actress Sharon Stone, chairs its honorary board. 
</P>
<P>
 Khaki pleated trousers or shorts and black or cream golf shirts dominated the 
scene. Only a few got into the spirit, such as actor Chad Lowe from ABC's "Life 
Goes On," who sported an argyle vest over his khaki polo shirt. Menswear 
designer Michael Lew, who took the coveted Marty Rising Star award this year 
for his label, Imaginary Concepts, played 18 holes in his signature polo shirt. 
In olive with a mini pattern, it resembles the more sedate looks that are part 
of golf. 
</P>
<P>
 KROQ's Loveline host Riki Rachtman stood out from the mostly svelte, GQ-ish 
pack -- his Mossimo shirt and calf-length shorts notwithstanding. Rachtman, who 
also hosts MTV's Headbanger's Ball, sported a bleached spiky 'do (roots 
included), and tattoos covered his calves. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real dingers were the cellular phones and cigars. Once off the green, 
everybody seemed to have a tiny, black flip phone attached to his ear. Couldn't 
they have at least put them down during the tasty feast provided by the Four 
Seasons? And the youngest of the pups present found the moment fit for an old 
stogie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Golf isn't just an old man deal," said designer Mossimo Giannulli, who hopes 
to turn the tournament into an annual charity event. Giannulli is a member at 
Pelican Hill, which was developed by his father, Gene Giannulli, who also 
played that day. 
</P>
<P>
 So will Mossimo signature golf cleats appear in a future collection?  
</P>
<P>
 "No way. This is cool playing," says the Irvine-based designer. "But I don't 
want to jump into the golf clothing thing." ROSE APODACA JONES

Q&A: KIX BROOKS; 'IT'S FALLEN INTO PLACE REAL NATURAL' FOR COUNTRY DUO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As half of the record-breaking country duo Brooks & Dunn, Kix Brooks has many 
blessings to count. The 39-year-old singer-songwriter-guitarist spent years 
laboring in the obscurity of beer-soaked honky-tonks, only to find himself the 
toast of the country music world at an age where many less successful artists 
find themselves choking on the dust of unrealized dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, that's exactly what Brooks was experiencing not so long 
before Brooks & Dunn hit triple platinum with their 1991 debut album, "Brand 
New Man" album. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was a successful songwriter who had penned hits for such artists 
as John Conlee and the Dirt Band, Brooks was feeling like his aspirations to 
stardom in his own right were passing him by. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brand New Man" changed all that. The album, which included the No. 1 hit 
"Boot Scootin' Boogie," was the biggest-selling debut ever for a country group 
or duo. 
</P>
<P>
 It was followed last year with the double platinum "Hard Workin' Man." Their 
new "Waiting On Sundown" album debuted last week at No. 1 on Billboard's 
country chart. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Brooks & Dunn have logged seven No. 1 country singles, a Grammy 
Award and roomful of others from the Country Music Assn., the Academy of 
Country Music, the Nashville Network and Playboy magazine, among others -- all 
in a career that's just three years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Touring in support of their new album, Brooks and partner Ronnie Dunn, 41, 
play tonight at Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks spoke about the new album and the tour by phone from his home in 
Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've got a reputation as the rowdy half of Brooks & Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Oh, no. Totally untrue (laughs). I just keep my foot in my mouth all the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You followed in the footsteps of Johnny Horton to some degree early in your 
career? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, I grew up real close to him, near his family and stuff. He was one of 
my first real influences. "The Battle of New Orleans" and "Sink the Bismark" 
were the songs I really learned to play guitar on. I think (Horton) and Hank 
(Williams) Sr., when I was young, those are the guys I learned how to play 
from. . . . Then when I was about 13, all the rock stuff started influencing me 
as well. My first bands were schizophrenic. We played everything from "Hey Good 
Lookin' " to "Gloria." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Before hitting it big with Brooks & Dunn, you were a successful songwriter. 
How did you hook into that? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: I got sent to military school when I was 15, and my roommate, Jody 
Williams, ended up working for Charlie Daniels' publishing company. So I was on 
my way to New Orleans passing through Nashville, and I gave him a call. 
</P>
<P>
 He told me all about the publishing business, and it all sounded real cool, 
and I played him some of my songs and he said, "Man, you need to be here, 
writing." I just didn't think that much of it. I went down to New Orleans and 
beat myself up in the bars for a while, and started thinking, "Well, maybe 
writing songs isn't such as bad idea after all." (He laughs.) 
</P>
<P>
 I think if you play enough bars, you either play bars for the rest of your 
life, or you start thinking about your future. Getting a hundred bucks at the 
end of the night isn't going to make for much of a retirement. It's really 
weird, because I came to town to be an artist, and to sing and everything, and 
when that didn't happen . . . much to my surprise, I couldn't believe people 
didn't just hand me record contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 When that didn't happen and I was writing songs to make a living, I looked at 
all the guys driving big cars, and they were all hit songwriters. I thought it 
was real cool, all these country boys socking this money away. . . . So I dug 
into (songwriting) and for about 10 years, that's what I did. And whenever this 
all ends, I'm sure that's what I'll go back to doing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Now that you're one of the biggest things in country music these days, how 
do you feel when you look back on the hard times? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: It seemed like everybody I knew eventually ended up hitting a lick except 
me. I can remember lying in bed at night, going, "Well, I guess it's just not 
gonna happen for me." I convinced myself I'd have to be content as a 
songwriter, and let the other dream go. And yeah, it's weird. One day, it just 
kind of all came together and took off. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is success everything you expected it would be? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah (He laughs again.) It is. The coolest thing for me is to be able to 
afford to do any kind of show I want to do. That's the biggest thing for me. As 
far as lights and stage and the people that are working with me, it's all the 
best stuff. To be able to go out there on a level of grandeur that I always 
dreamed about. I was a security guard for three years, and I went to every rock 
show and country show that came to Nashville. I took it all in and went, "God I 
know it'll never happen, but wouldn't it be cool to do all that stuff and put 
in a show like that!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Tim DuBois, head of Arista Records' Nashville division, hooked you up with 
Ronnie Dunn. How did that come about? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Ronnie and I were both pitching solo deals at Tim. I'd had a solo deal at 
Capitol, and after I went through the rat race of being on a major label with a 
lot of acts, I wasn't interested in doing that again. But I knew there would be 
a commitment there if I could just get on his label, that they'd be behind me. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, "I've got this guy, man, your songs and his songs really jibe 
together. I want you to meet this guy." I said, "Fine, whatever." I still 
wanted to work my deal. Anyway, I got together with Ronnie, we wrote a few good 
songs and pitched them back at Tim. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, "Look guys. I'm gonna offer you a deal, but I'm not gonna offer you 
the deal you want. I want both of you, and I want you together. I think this is 
an act. You'll be a smash if you do this. I don't really hear either one of you 
by yourselves, but for some reason, I think together this deal could fly." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Ronnie and I were both thinking this isn't what we really want to do, 
but it's the only deal on the table. Who knows, something might come out of it. 
At the very least, we might write some hit songs together. It's uncanny how 
it's all fallen into place. 
</P>
<P>
 People give us a hard time for making a contrived deal or a record person 
putting us together or whatever, but the point is, it works. It's fallen into 
place real natural. We've never had a fight or anything like that. The funniest 
thing was when we started performing. We sit down after a couple of shows, and 
Ronnie goes, "Man -- you're crazy. You really need to settle down out there."  
</P>
<P>
 And I'm like, "Man -- you're standing out there like a stiff. Why don't you do 
something? Where I come from, we raise hell and jump out on the tables and kick 
beer all over and all that stuff. That's where I come from, that's how I've 
always performed. I'm not gonna change now." And Ronnie said, "I'm not either." 
</P>
<P>
 So it was like, "Well, let's just see what happens." We'd both been doing our 
own deals for 20 years. We're both hard-headed enough that we kept doing what 
we were doing, and for some weird reason, it works. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are your personalities as different as your stage demeanors? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Ronnie shoots from the hip. He's much more likely, on the business end of 
things, to just say what he's thinking. I'm more likely to ponder things. . . . 
That seems to work in its own way, too. But we're not that much different. Our 
backgrounds are similar. Our dads are both pipeliners, we come from pretty 
matter-of-fact, redneck backgrounds. We can communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: With all the success you've had, is there ever a sense of "Where do I go 
from here?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, you always want to try and progress. At the same time, we're really 
not going to change what we do. I think show-wise, you always want to try to 
bring something different to the table. Our show for next year is gonna be 
different than the show was this year. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as trying to top yourself, I think that's just asking for frustration. 
We just want to maintain, you know? Keep doing what we're doing. The way I've 
always looked at music is you just write the best songs you can, and put on the 
best show you can. 
</P>

A PLACE TO CALL HIS OWN IN STORYVILLE; MUSIC: MALFORD MILLIGAN, THE FRONT MAN 
WITH THE TEXAS BLUES-AND-SOUL-ROCK BAND, TAKES GREAT JOY IN PERFORMING ONSTAGE 
WITH HIS COHORTS, WHO ARE ALL SEASONED PROS.; FORMING STORYVILLE 'WAS A GRADUAL 
PROCESS. CHRIS AND TOMMY AND I TALKED ABOUT PUTTING A BAND TOGETHER, AND IT 
SCARED THE HELL OUT OF ME, FRANKLY. HERE I'VE GOT THESE INCREDIBLE PEOPLE -- 
PEOPLE WHO ARE LEGENDS -- PLAYING ON MY RECORD, AND THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW, 
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A BAND. I WAS KIND OF IN AWE, BUT I WAS ALSO LIKE, "DAMN, I 
REALLY WANT TO DO THIS." 'MALFORD MILLIGAN, STORYVILLE LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BUDDY SEIGAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Old-school soul singing is not dead -- not if Malford Milligan has anything to 
do with it. The front man with blues-and-soul-rock band Storyville, Milligan 
brings a passion to his singing style rarely heard since the heyday of Otis 
Redding and Sam Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest import from the talent-rich Austin, Tex., music scene, Storyville 
performs Saturday at the Coach House. Milligan's cohorts are Lone Star State 
heavies Tommy Shannon (bass), Chris Layton (drums) and guitarists David Grissom 
and David Holt. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them, these musicians have worked with Stevie Ray Vaughan, John 
Mellencamp, Johnny Winter, Joe Ely, Carlene Carter, the Mavericks and more. 
Seasoned pros all -- except Milligan, who despite his 35 years is a relative 
neophyte in show business.  
</P>
<P>
 He's also quite possibly unique as the leader of a Texas roots band. An 
albino, African American Buddhist, Milligan conveys his perspective on life in 
his songwriting, with personal, sometimes painful lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Bluest Eyes," the title tune of Storyville's debut album that Milligan 
adapted from a Toni Morrison novel, he writes: 
</P>
<P>
 "Born of self-hatred  
</P>
<P>
 Born of self-contempt  
</P>
<P>
 Pull the flesh from the bone . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But if I had the bluest eyes  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe she'd love me  
</P>
<P>
 And if I had the bluest eyes  
</P>
<P>
 Life would be kind to me."  
</P>
<P>
 "Immediately after I finished that book at 4 in the morning, I started writing 
that tune," Milligan said in a recent phone interview from a Los Angeles motel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely felt pieces of my life in that book. I'm an albino whose first 
school experiences were in all-black schools. But from my experience with 
people, they've all been through similar things to what I went through, so I 
don't think I'm the exception to the rule. I feel like I went through the 
normal childhood (bull) that everyone else goes through. I just happened to be 
an albino, but my cultural experience is black as a mug." 
</P>
<P>
 His educational experience included sociology studies at the University of 
Texas, where he also began his career in music in the '80s. Of his late start, 
he explained: "I grew up in a working-class family. Making a living doing music 
didn't seem like something that was an option." 
</P>
<P>
 That option became a reality for Milligan when he started playing weekend gigs 
with a group called Stick People. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were doing wild stuff in odd time signatures, and I got to experiment with 
a lot of different singing styles," he said. "Music seemed like a hobby at the 
time. But more and more, I felt like it was something I wanted to do, I wanted 
to be, it was my place. I felt incredible on that stage." 
</P>

 Milligan, who was fast becoming the talk of Austin, signed as a solo act with 
November Records out of New York City last year. As he gathered the cream of 
Austin's music scene to record his debut album, something clicked beyond the 
average singer-backup musician relationship. Storyville was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a gradual process," he said. "Chris and Tommy and I talked about 
putting a band together, and it scared the hell out of me, frankly. Here I've 
got these incredible people -- people who are legends -- playing on my record, 
and the next thing you know, we're talking about a band. I was kind of in awe, 
but I was also like, 'Damn, I really want to do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He did, and the group has been touring steadily since to promote the album, 
which was released late last year to good reviews. Milligan was particularly 
excited about performing his first series of shows in Southern California, 
savoring the sheer joy he receives from being on stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not even a love anymore," he said. "It's something that I have to do. If 
I don't sing, I go nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 * Storyville and the Chris Duarte Group perform Saturday at the Coach House, 
33157 Camino Capistrano in San Juan Capistrano. 8 p.m. $10. (714) 496-8930.

THEATER BEAT: TWELVE LITTLE STEPS CLOSER TO THE BIG TIME; A STUDY IN THE SMALL 
SCALE, OCC REPERTORY TAKES ON '24 HOURS A.M.,' 10-MINUTE PLAYLETS FOR 12 
STUDENT DIRECTORS TO EXERCISE WALKING BEFORE THEY RUN.

 An old axiom says a novel is easier to write than a short story. It follows 
then that a three-act play would be easier to write than a one-acter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Take the exercise one step further. Limit a one-act to 10 minutes, and you 
provide the playwright with great problems. Within that brief time he has to 
present a complete story, beginning, middle and end, and make it all 
dramatically and theatrically effective. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the assignment in playwright Oliver Hailey's Playwrights Lab at Van 
Nuys' Back Alley Theatre in 1981. The result was "24 Hours A.M." and "24 Hours 
P.M.," two evenings of plays that not only fit into the length and dramatic 
strictures placed on the writers, but each play had to deal with a specific 
time of day. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Orange Coast College's student-directed Repertory presented 
"24 Hours P.M." Beginning tonight, the troupe completes the journey around the 
clock with its presentation of "24 Hours A.M.," 12 playlets with 12 
playwrights' visions of what happens between midnight and noon. 
</P>
<P>
 OCC teacher Alex Golson, who heads the Repertory season, said the project is 
very good for his students for several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get away from one student directing one main-stage play," 
Golson said, "because not enough students were getting opportunities to direct. 
We've decided that each semester we're going to do one of this type of show." 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of plays that fit into the category of a group of playlets 
under an umbrella theme, including "The Bar off Melrose" and the many plays 
that have been produced in the Actors Theatre of Louisville's 10-minute play 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Such brevity is sometimes daunting, even for experienced playwrights. Before 
assigning the "24 Hours" project to his professional workshop, Hailey had set 
the writers on their heels with the assignment to write the first five minutes 
of a full-length play. When the writers balked and asked why, Hailey explained 
that if you don't have your audience's attention in the first five minutes, 
you'll never get it. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge rolls over onto the shoulders of the directors, who must make a 
viable theatrical entity out of a small piece of dramatic cloth. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the student directors in Golson's project, he said, "They all want 
to do these big epics, but I tell them to start with these. Where you really 
learn your craft is with a two-character play that deals with relationships. Do 
that first, then we'll deal with 'The Royal Hunt of the Sun.' . . . They need 
to get back to the basics, instead of worrying about all this costuming and 
everything else. You need to learn to walk before you can run." 
</P>
<P>
 There's another strong practical reason behind the project. In today's 
professional-theater world, young directors usually find themselves working in 
small off-off-Broadway theaters and the many small theaters in Los Angeles, 
doing plays with six characters or less. Usually two or three. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Golson tries to instill these restrictions even with the members of OCC's 
playwriting class. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're writing plays today," Golson said, "if you're interested in 
getting them sold, you've got to write for theaters that can produce them. 
They'll look for how many sets there are, how many people they'll have to hire 
and all that." 
</P>
<P>
 As enthusiastic as the directors have gotten since getting involved with the 
short plays, the playwrights found it equally inspiring. When offered a choice 
of projects, they opted for a further stretching of the idea behind "24 Hours": 
12 plays, each 10 minutes long, each describing one month during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 That project will require the same inventiveness called for by the spare 
ingredients of "24 Hours A.M." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a bed, a table and chairs," Golson said. "And a black wall. I like 
minimalist theater: the actor and the audience. We get too preoccupied with 
sets, lights and costumes. You don't always get that. This is the best kind of 
training, because they're going to go to these little theaters that have no 
budgets and nothing to draw from. They're going to have to become 
self-reliant." 
</P>
<P>
 * "24 Hours A.M." opens tonight in the Drama Lab Studio, Orange Coast College, 
2701 Fairview Road, Costa Mesa. Performances Friday-Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 3 
p.m. Ends Oct. 30. $5. (714) 432-5932.

CUSTOMIZED COMPOSITIONS FOR CHAMBER; MUSIC: STEPHEN MOSKO'S 'PSYCHOTROPICS' IS 
SPECIFICALLY WRITTEN FOR THE SOUTHWEST MUSIC SOCIETY, WHICH WILL PREMIERE THE 
PIECE IN COSTA MESA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Composer Stephen Mosko has gone back to a time-honored practice: writing music 
for people he knows. Haydn did the same for his happy band at Esterhaza Palace 
in Hungary. Mozart wouldn't compose a note for an aria until he had met and 
heard the singer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mosko has written "Psychotropics" for five members of the Southwest Chamber 
Music Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun to write for people you know," Mosko said in a recent phone 
interview from his home in the Santa Clarita Valley. "It's not so abstract that 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 "In fact, I chose the people more than the instruments, then figured out -- 
given what they played -- how to make the piece work." 
</P>
<P>
 He even tried to get some of the personal and social relationships into the 
work. Horn player Jeff von der Schmidt and violist Jan Karlin, for instance, 
are husband and wife. "So they have lots of duets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flutist Dorothy Stone -- Mosko's wife -- has been a friend of oboist Stuart 
Horn "forever and ever. So they have lots of duets, too." 
</P>
<P>
 The society, which gives the premiere of "Psychotropics" on Saturday as part 
of the Orange County Performing Arts Center's chamber series, has played other 
works by Mosko: "For Morton Feldman" at Chapman University in 1992. Another 
piece -- "Indigenous Music II for Solo Flute" -- is scheduled to be played at 
the Armory Center for the Arts in Pasadena in November. But this is his first 
commission from the group. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls it "a companion piece" to "Psychotropes," which he wrote a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 " Psycho means mind, spirit or soul, and trope means to turn ," said Mosko, 
long a prominent figure on the local contemporary music scene who has taught 
for 25 years at Cal Arts in Santa Clarita. "So the title means 'to change your 
mind, spirit or soul,' which I think music always does." 
</P>
<P>
 The title of the new piece came up when he and his wife were thinking about 
taking a vacation to Hawaii, "which is the tropics, which is the same word as 
'tropes.' It's where the Earth turns." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of turning actually has figured into his composing practices over the 
last several years, he said. "A certain idea keeps turning back on itself, like 
a trope turning. As it goes backward, it changes itself, always modulating a 
little bit. So it's sort of self-generating." 
</P>
<P>
 The instrumental raw materials for "Psychotropics" are flute, oboe, French 
horn, viola and piano. "Once you get a combination like that -- that very 
strange tenor range, weird and murky -- it defined what I could do," he said. 
"So I mostly use the lower range. But it changes all the time. A lot of it is 
about color and changes of color in the ensemble." 
</P>
<P>
 Those changes all occur within the work's 12-minute length, which took Mosko 
about a year to write. "I got interrupted a lot," he said. "I do so much 
conducting during the fall and spring. I started a year ago last summer, worked 
for six weeks, then off and on all year, but it was not solid time." 
</P>
<P>
 He put in a solid 3 1/2 months from May until August, working from an initial 
outline he likens to "a road map so I know where I am, and then I hardly ever 
revise. That way, in the morning, I can get up and accomplish what I have to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a certain way, my music is very much being in the moment, not thinking 
about where you were or where you're going. Revising is thinking about where 
you were." 
</P>
<P>
 * Members of the Southwest Chamber Music Society will play the premiere of 
Stephen Mosko's "Psychotropics" on Saturday in Founders Hall at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. The program 
also includes Messiaen's "La Merle Noire" and "Piece" and Bruckner's String 
Quintet in F. 8 p.m. $20 , general; $8, students. (714) 556-2787.

LANCASTER: VITAL BLEND OF STAR PAST, PRESENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR EMERITUS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To the end of his days, Burt Lancaster was tough, outspoken, liberal, private, 
a working actor and, not least, a man who knew he was a superstar and accepted 
it without needing to declare it. 
</P>
<P>
 He was, in fact, one of that fast-diminishing population of movie stars who 
are links to a sharply different Hollywood, when the studios were still major 
and television only a storm cloud on a very distant horizon, and the great 
stars had the status of lesser gods and the riches of royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not only that, as Gloria Swanson says in "Sunset Boulevard," "We had 
faces then" -- although Lancaster's face and his flashing teeth were 
identifiable, uncaptioned, in the farthest corners of the world -- it was that 
the stars of an earlier era, or the stars who became superstars, like 
Lancaster, carried a special aura. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an aura they had earned by mastering the most difficult of all the 
Hollywood arts, survival. Lancaster and the relatively few others in the 
pantheon with him had acquired their status by long-term and frequent exposure 
in films that were good more often than bad, and by many personal appearances, 
many columns and fan magazine profiles and stacks of news items about their 
slightest doings. 
</P>
<P>
 In a much-used but relevant phrase, Lancaster paid his dues, commencing as a 
vaudeville acrobat. He once recalled that he had been the bottom man in the 
pyramid on a vaudeville bill in a Buffalo theater -- a bill headlined by Harry 
James' orchestra and his new singer, Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Jimmy Cagney, who once thanked "that touch of the gutter" without which 
his career would not have been possible, Lancaster grew up tough in the Bronx. 
He seemed always to carry himself with something of the cocky swagger of a kid 
who had held his own on mean streets and was not about to concede anything to 
anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the same kid acquired a love of opera because the neighborhood was full of 
Italians and there was always Caruso on the night air (competing with John 
McCormack, whose tenor soared from the Victrolas in the Irish apartments). One 
of Lancaster's last major appearances was as the Phantom's father, a role 
created for a television version of "Phantom of the Opera." It was filmed in 
Paris and gave Lancaster a chance to hear plenty of glorious singing, a 
principal love of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All of the places Lancaster had been, so to speak, came together in "Elmer 
Gantry," the film and the role for which he will likely be longest remembered. 
Gantry had Lancaster's charismatic showmanship, and the street smarts and the 
swagger, the Irish tongue of the Lancaster clan, and a sudden tenderness that 
could be read as part of the legacy of the kid who liked opera and saved money 
to attend the Met. 
</P>
<P>
 There was another side of the private Lancaster -- sensitive, intellectually 
curious, widely read, concerned about social issues. It was the Lancaster seen 
in "Judgment at Nuremberg," "Birdman of Alcatraz" and Luchino Visconti's "The 
Leopard" -- the film and performance of which he was always proudest. 
</P>
<P>
 He died Thursday night at the age of 80 in the Century City high-rise 
condominium that he'd had decorated in the Mexican style, with wonderful tile 
floors, fine pieces of furniture and art that reflected not a decorator's taste 
but the loving eye of a discerning collector. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of the fine actors who, in a sense, live to act quite as much as 
they act to live well, Lancaster never really thought of retirement as a viable 
idea. He was bitterly disappointed to lose the title role in "The Old Gringo" 
for health reasons, not least because his involvement had gone so far as 
costume fittings. The film was a failure, which was scant consolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster managed the star actor's most difficult trick -- being immediately 
identifiable as the star he was and yet cloak himself so thoroughly in a 
characterization that for the duration of a film he became that character: the 
cowboy, the lifer taming birds, the Army major in the earliest stages of the 
U.S. presence in Vietnam in the excellent but little-seen "Go Tell the 
Spartans." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no shortage of gifted actors in the industry. But the concatenation 
of circumstances that produced Burt Lancaster no longer really exist in the 
society or in Hollywood. Few actors have done so much good work over so wide a 
range for so long. Few actors, it seems quite possible to say, will ever have 
the chance to do as much again. 
</P>
<P>
 So the melancholy farewells are to the fine actor, to the exemplary private 
man and to the symbol of a nearly vanished time.

WILL A 'SUMMIT' HELP SOAPS GIVE UP SEX?; TELEVISION: ADVOCACY GROUP MEETS IN 
SANTA MONICA TO URGE DAYTIME DRAMAS TO BE A FORCE FOR SOCIAL CHANGE IN AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL HOWARD CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Surgeon General, Jane Fonda, Miss Universe from India and a host of 
governmental and health-care authorities have assembled in Santa Monica this 
weekend to confront what they perceive to be a powerful social force for change 
in America: soap operas. 
</P>
<P>
 Writers, producers and network executives behind all 10 network daytime dramas 
are hearing a parade of experts lobby them to incorporate story lines that 
"will affect U.S. attitudes toward reproductive behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Population Communications International, the advocacy group behind what has 
been billed as the first "Soap Summit," teaches Third World countries how to 
produce soap operas as a means to promote population control and empower teens 
and women, the primary consumers of soaps. Follow-up studies in such countries 
as India, Egypt, Mexico and the Philippines have shown the group's 
effectiveness in changing attitudes toward child bearing and in reducing birth 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, PCI has brought its mission to America. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonny Fox, chairman of Population Communications International, believes that 
there is a bountiful "supply" of services available to prevent unwanted 
pregnancy -- prophylactics, health clinics, hot lines -- but that there is not 
enough "demand" for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why aren't these supplies being used more often by women and men?" Fox said. 
"Usually for religious, cultural, sociological and, in many cases, sexist 
reasons. What we want to do is deal with those attitudes and those motivations 
that will make people want to reach out and avail themselves of these 
services." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Surgeon General Jocelyn Elders was scheduled to kick off the affair 
Friday night. In her speech, an advance copy of which was made available, she 
implored the daytime drama people to help reduce teen pregnancy by educating 
girls and young women -- teaching them how to say no to sexual advances and 
portraying the potentially negative consequences of early sex, such as an 
unwanted or ill-advised pregnancy or sexually transmitted diseases such as 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Closed-door lectures were planned for today by a host of other concerned 
authorities, including Eloise Anderson, director of the California Department 
of Social Services, and Dr. Allan Rosenfield, dean of Columbia University's 
School of Public Health and United Nations adviser at the International 
Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have come to feel that if we don't solve the population growth problems, we 
will not be able to solve any other problems that face this country -- from 
poverty to migration to environmental destruction to improving women's health," 
said Fonda, who is scheduled to close the "Soap Summit" at the Loews Santa 
Monica Beach Hotel tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 PCI uses soap operas as a vehicle to deliver its message because viewers tend 
to get emotionally involved in the characters, whose lives are played out over 
years. Another reason they are important: "Their audience is at home during the 
day," Fonda said. "They're not at school. They're not working. They are women 
and girls. This is the target audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Soaps have never been a model of sexual restraint, and a new study released 
Friday in conjunction with the weekend event indicates that there are fewer 
inhibitions in daytime television than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 The Michigan State University study, commissioned by the Kaiser Family 
Foundation, found an average of 6.6 sexual incidents per hourlong episode of 
five popular soap operas examined in August and September. "Days of Our Lives" 
led the list with 11.4 incidents per hour of sexual activity, which is defined 
as everything from long kisses to heavy petting, married and unmarried 
intercourse, rape and portrayals of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is blaming anything on (soap opera producers)," Fox said. "We're not 
saying they're terrible people. We're saying: You are very important people, 
you have an immense audience, and we need your help." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone has given a stamp of approval to the "Soap Summit," however. 
</P>
<P>
 "A soap opera promoting population control is an oxymoron," said Sandra 
Crawford, an editor at the Media Research Center, a conservative group that 
seeks to bring balance to what it sees as the liberal biases of Hollywood 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 "As conservatives," she said, "we would like to see that the best way of 
avoiding sexually transmitted disease and unwanted pregnancy is not to engage 
in premarital sex. Now, is a soap opera about to do that? I don't think so. 
When a story line calls for premarital sex, and it's sweeps week, and you've 
got to get the ratings up there, you bet you're going to see a lot of condoms 
being used, but I have doubts you'll see characters abstaining from sex, which 
is definitely the most effective means of fighting unwanted pregnancy and 
AIDS."

COVER STORY; ENRICHING THE GAME PLAN; THE L.A. ZOO'S STAFF AND VOLUNTEERS ARE 
TOYING WITH STARK ENVIRONMENTS IN AN ATTEMPT TO RECREATE THE ANIMALS' 
EXPERIENCES IN THE WILDS.

 Staffer Thaya du Bois has a mischievous smile on her face as she climbs into 
an electric tram at the Los Angeles Zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some disgusting things in the can, and I thought we might try those 
with the tigers," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Du Bois, the zoo's assistant director of research, is a woman with a mission. 
She wants to enrich the lives of the zoo's captive animals by making their 
habitats more natural and filling up their senses with more sights, smells and 
tactile experiences. Given the city's bare-bones budget for the zoo, du Bois 
doesn't have much money to work with. But she does have a vivid imagination and 
several dozen dedicated volunteers. And, on this particular morning, she has a 
coffee can filled with vials of scent, including a particularly pungent eau de 
wolverine. 
</P>
<P>
 Du Bois hands the feral perfumes over to Bertie Foster, veteran keeper of big 
cats. Like du Bois, Foster is a firm believer in something called behavioral or 
environmental enrichment, a practice at more and more zoos worldwide that seeks 
to better the lives of animals in captivity by giving them more things to do, 
especially things they do in the wild. Du Bois instituted the zoo's behavioral 
enrichment program in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 As du Bois explains, animals in older zoos such as Los Angeles' often spend 
their days in stark, sterile environments, with concrete underneath and little 
to stimulate them. It's no wonder, given the poverty of their daily lives, that 
the caged beasts pace or doze away the day. 
</P>

 Eventually, Los Angeles hopes to have a state-of-the-art zoo in which 
enrichment will be built into dynamic, naturalistic exhibits, including such 
amenities as a wave machine that will allow the polar bears to dive in the 
surf. 
</P>
<P>
 But, meanwhile, du Bois and her volunteers are practicing "remedial 
enrichment," trying to better the animals' experience now, by giving them 
things to play with, encouraging them to forage for at least some of their food 
and improvising other ways to keep them busy and engaged. As du Bois explains, 
her work is grounded in her scientific knowledge of animal behavior, but it 
also requires her to enter imaginatively into the minds of her charges. "I try 
to get into an animal's head," she says, 'and see how it experiences the world, 
and we try to recreate that as much as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to the tigers and the perfumes. As du Bois and tiger keeper 
Foster know, wild tigers live surrounded by the scents of hundreds of other 
animals. So when du Bois arrives with her cache of smells, Foster picks a 
perfume she likes--one that simulates the musk of a Siberian deer--and dabs it 
at various spots on the pile of logs that lie in the center of the tiger pit. 
</P>
<P>
 The pile of logs is itself an example of behavioral enrichment. For years, the 
zoo's Siberian tigers--a pair of 11-year-old sisters--paced back and forth on 
an easy to clean but dull and forbidding expanse of concrete. But in 1993 the 
exhibit was renovated. A waterfall was added--with the wall behind it carefully 
pitched forward and built without paw-holds so the tigers couldn't use it to 
escape. Dirt was trucked in to soften the surface beneath the cats, then 
planted with grass, bamboo and other vegetation that the cats can rub against, 
hide behind, dig up, or gnaw on. 
</P>
<P>
 After Foster applies the musk scent to the woodpile, she hides a couple of 
dead rabbits under the logs. A few minutes later, she releases the cats from 
the behind-the-scenes cages where they have spent the night. The first thing 
they do is sniff the logs, rubbing the scent glands in their own cheeks against 
the new smells they have discovered. Foster explains that the two cats will 
often mark the area as well. "They back up and urinate on it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Foster, the presence of new scents in their habitat always seems 
to increase the interaction between the two animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sensory deprivation and lack of behavioral and social opportunities have been 
the basic deficits" for animals in older zoos, says Tim Desmond, an 
animal-behavior consultant based in Ventura. David Shepherdson, one of the 
founders of the behavioral enrichment movement and a research coordinator at 
the Metro Washington Park Zoo in Portland, Ore., agrees, arguing that smell and 
hearing are among the most neglected senses of zoo animals. Smell and hearing, 
he says, "tend to be ignored, because we know less about what those worlds mean 
to the animals." 
</P>
<P>
 The tigers catch the scent of the perfume before they smell the rabbits. In 
the wild, the cats would spend part of every day hunting for food. Although 
they were fed their carefully balanced conventional diet the night before, they 
sniff around until they find the hidden prey. A group of schoolchildren watches 
from above as Indira digs up a clump of grass and hides her find under it 
before she settles down to devour the rabbit. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the mesmerized children or their teachers complains about the presence 
of the dead rabbits in the pit. Many animals eat live prey in the wild, and 
many biologists and others who care for captive animals think they would be 
better off if fed live animals, if only in behind-the-scenes areas. But few 
zoos are willing to gross visitors out by tossing Bambi into the lion exhibit, 
and live food in most public areas of zoos is limited to crickets, meal worms 
and the occasional goldfish. As animal consultant Desmond observes, "You don't 
want your exhibit to be a snuff exhibit." 
</P>
<P>
 Piqued by the new attractions in their exhibit, the tigers put on a 
fascinating show for the humans watching them, at one point snarling menacingly 
at each other over one of the rabbits. Behavioral enrichment makes for better 
drama from a visitor's point of view, true, but it also has a positive impact 
on the animals themselves. Scientists have observed, for instance, that animals 
prefer to hunt for their food when given the option. 
</P>
<P>
 Given their belief in food as activity, zoo personnel are thrilled when the 
animals play with their food as the tigers do. Two mornings a week the polar 
bears are given giant fishsicles, which they bat around their pool even as they 
probe for the herring and other goodies frozen inside. As du Bois points out, 
polar bears seem to play in the wild, and they play in captivity as well. The 
fishsicle, says relief keeper Tami Goodson, "is just as much a toy as it is a 
treat." Volunteers also hide figs and celery among the rocks in the polar bear 
exhibit. Volunteers are always drilling holes into tree limbs and other exhibit 
"furniture" throughout the zoo to provide hiding places for yogurt and other 
concealable foods. 
</P>

 Among the least natural of the bears' playthings, but one they seem to love, 
is a beer keg. "Beer kegs are standard zoo toys everywhere because they are one 
of the few things that won't fall apart in five minutes," du Bois explains. The 
bears also pass their free time batting around a Boomer Ball, a commercial zoo 
toy whose selling points include being impervious to the attentions of 
elephants, gorillas and other animals of superhuman strength. At the L.A. Zoo 
everything from elands to meerkats, monkeys to rhinos, have Boomer Balls. Among 
their other virtues: They are hollow. You can drill holes in them, then fill 
them with crickets, raisins or other food that the animals must then figure out 
how to extract. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the great satisfactions of the behavioral enrichment program, 
participants say, is that even small, inexpensive changes can have a big 
payoff. For the last several weeks, keepers have been putting a few live 
goldfish in with the North American carnivores. According to keeper Molly 
Hogan, the fish have completely changed the routine of the zoo's raccoons. 
Before the advent of the live fish, the pair were usually asleep in the morning 
when Hogan first entered their exhibit. Now the raccoons are wide awake, and 
they remain active for hours after they catch and devour their few fish, 
apparently looking for more. 
</P>
<P>
 The behavioral enrichment movement has burgeoned in the 1990s, encouraged by a 
new breed of specialists such as du Bois and by keepers, who routinely write 
into The Shape of Enrichment, the field's quarterly newsletter, seeking 
practical advice on what to do for, say, a sluggish aardvark (Kitty Litter for 
it to dig in, peers advise). Keepers are in the trenches of this movement, and 
when they get into the spirit of behavioral enrichment, they tend to improvise 
much like first-time parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, Tami Goodson tried one thing after another to induce her penguins to get 
into a plastic kiddie pool of cool water. "Finally, I took off my shoes and got 
into the pool," she recalls. "It was the only way I could get them to come in." 
</P>
<P>
 The behavioral enrichment program couldn't function if it weren't for its 
volunteers, says du Bois. Earlier this month, 20 volunteers spent a weekend 
upgrading the exhibit that houses the zoo's jaguars. With a grant from Yuban, 
the coffee company whose logo is a jaguar, and expertise and plants donated by 
a local nursery, the exhibit was turned into a mini-rain forest, complete with 
bromeliads and an overhead sprinkler system to insure that the tropical 
greenery stays lush. 
</P>
<P>
 Behavioral enrichment is obviously easier with some animals than with others. 
So far, the L.A. Zoo hasn't done anything special to improve the quotidian 
routines of its snakes and lizards, but it has found ways to enhance the days 
of many of its animals. 
</P>
<P>
 After a volunteer observed the apparent pleasure a giant eland took in 
destroying a young pepper tree in its enclosure, the zoo's research staff 
decided to see if it could create an artificial eland plaything. With the help 
of a local fabricator of zoo exhibits and equipment, the research staff devised 
a bucket with a spring inside that could be filled with acacia branches and 
other foliage. The bouncing bush that resulted seems to fascinate the zoo's 
giant eland population, inducing it to spend twice as much time as it otherwise 
might in such characteristic eland behaviors as thrashing the simulated tree 
with twirled horns. 
</P>
<P>
 Du Bois emphasizes how important the 45 to 50 volunteers are to the zoo's 
behavioral enrichment program. Her assistant, Marjorie Fuchs, an attorney by 
training, is in charge of the volunteer program and keeps track of who is doing 
which chores, such as cutting branches on which many animals like to browse.

 Volunteers include Jill Blacher, a psychotherapist with a Beverly Hills 
practice that specializes in helping the bereaved. Blacher spends at least one 
morning a week at the zoo, spraying the Sumatran rhino with a hose as it 
frolics in its mud wallow, and hanging organic cornstalks from her own garden 
around its enclosure. "It's very healing to come here and work with the 
animals," says Blacher, who also tosses apples and whole heads of romaine into 
the maws of the hippos during her shift. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Stern is another faithful volunteer. Every Wednesday night Stern's 
family gets its own dinner while the Encino woman cooks up a storm for her 
animal friends. Recently she prepared giant pine cones for the orangutans, 
stuffing them with slices of yam and cantaloupe, peanuts, non-frosted shredded 
mini-wheats and dollops of her own recipe for oatmeal paste, a concoction of 
oatmeal, nonfat dry milk, canned pineapple and other nutritious stuff. Peanut 
butter is a favorite food of almost all the animals, but the volunteers try to 
avoid it because too much fat isn't good for zoo creatures either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do it to get away from work," says Stern, who is a vice president at a 
local distribution company. She admits that it is sometimes difficult to keep 
her family from scarfing down the oatmeal paste, especially when she bakes it 
cookie-style. "Actually, my husband's the one who will eat anything," she says. 
"My daughter is a little more picky." 
</P>
<P>
 Some zoos take a high-tech approach to behavioral enrichment, utilizing 
cricket launchers and mechanized dispensers that spit out treats when animals 
push the right button. In part because of lack of resources, Los Angeles tends 
to be low-tech. On a recent morning, the orangutans were poking into cardboard 
cones that had formerly held knitting wool and that volunteer Stern had filled 
with a mixture of granola and mustard. Many animals like spicy foods, du Bois 
explains. The chimps have a thing for salsa, and a number of animals like 
garlic and notoriously odoriferous durian fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers raise goodies for the zoo's great apes in a special Gorilla Garden 
in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area, and du Bois makes sure that the animals' 
exhibits are filled with such favorite playthings as ropes on swivels, some of 
which must be replaced weekly, and burlap sacks. It also seems that apes can't 
resist a cardboard box any more than children can. Du Bois is thrilled that zoo 
higher-ups encourage her efforts to engage the animals with whatever she thinks 
will grab them, even if it means filling their exhibits with what sometimes 
looks like trash. "There was a time I wouldn't have been allowed to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Behavioral enhancement is part art and part science, says du Bois. It reflects 
a view that animal needs are not so different from our own--that we both need 
things to do, as well as food and a safe place to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a lot of behavioral enrichment does is give the animal an increased 
degree of control over its destiny," says Shepherdson. The result is a zoo 
where happier animals behave in more natural ways that the public often can't 
take its eyes off.
