 FAST LANE: Bicyclists are about to become a more common sight on Ventura 
County freeways (B5). . . . Bike lanes already exist on the Ventura Freeway 
near the Santa Barbara County line. Now Caltrans is set to open new lanes along 
a two-mile stretch of the Moorpark Freeway between Moorpark and Thousand Oaks. 
But some cyclists question the rationale of putting pedalers alongside 
motorists. Said Simi Valley resident Larry Hainline: "I would not consider it 
safe at all." 
</P>
<P>
 TOUGH CHOICE: Would it be better to save money or the city's Police 
Department? That is the question the Port Hueneme City Council will wrestle 
with at its meeting tonight (B5). . . . Voters in June narrowly rejected a 
parcel tax needed to keep the city's Police Department open. Now the council 
must decide whether to adopt a utility tax to close a $500,000 police funding 
gap or contract with the Sheriff's Department. Resident Valorie Morrison said 
the city should hold onto its own police force at all costs. "Once the Police 
Department is gone, they are gone," she said. "We can't get them back."

 SPLASHDOWN: What had 3 1/2 miles of thread, 2 miles of suspension lines, 2,400 
yards of nylon and was compressed into a space about the size of a bushel 
basket? It was Ventura County's contribution to the nation's early space shots. 
The now-idle Northrop plant in Newbury Park developed and assembled the 
parachutes that brought the space capsules from orbit to a gentle ocean 
landing. One tricky part: deploying the series of chutes gradually so they 
weren't ripped apart during re-entry. 
</P>
<P>
 SAFE FOOD: As if those artery-clogging tacos and enchiladas weren't bad 
enough. . . . Another consumer watchdog group wants people to know about the 
hazards of chemically tainted foods. The Ventura chapter of Mothers and Others 
for Safe Food will hold a members meeting on Saturday to discuss how to choose 
the healthiest, chemical-free foods. The organization promotes the use of 
organic foods, grown without pesticides or chemical fertilizers. Information:

 No Repercussions: CBS News President Eric Ober gave a vote of confidence 
Tuesday to the news department at KCBS-TV Channel 2, which admitted last Friday 
that it had erred during coverage of the O.J. Simpson murder case. Ober said 
that the station's mistake in reporting that Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark 
had arrived at the Simpson estate before a search warrant was issued would not 
result in any repercussions from the network for Harvey Levin, who reported the 
story, or for KCBS management. "Harvey is a good reporter and he's also an 
attorney," Ober said in an interview. "They made a mistake and they admitted 
it, and I think viewers will accept that and move on. The station has done a 
very good job of covering the Simpson case, and I don't see anything happening 
in terms of fallout."

 Strengthening Gay Voice: Look for a reconfigured "strong, unified voice" to 
monitor the representation of gay and lesbian lives in the media and 
entertainment industries. The Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, 
which has been at the forefront of discussions of such controversies as the gay 
kisses on TV's "Roseanne" and "Melrose Place," will announce today the 
establishment of a new national organization formally merging its powerful Los 
Angeles and New York chapters and encompassing all other existing local 
chapters. The watchdog group will also launch an aggressive expansion, and 
hopes to form 18 to 24 additional local chapters within the next year. MOVIES

 'Wheelies' Alarm for 'Lassie': Stressing safety worries, Yamaha Motor Corp. 
has asked Paramount Pictures to stop promoting its new movie "Lassie," with a 
scene showing a young actor doing a "wheelie" on a Yamaha ATV. In addition, the 
company has asked Paramount to issue disclaimers in the film discouraging stunt 
or trick operation of the vehicles. "Taking these steps will send an important 
message to the public that ATVs must be operated safely, and help to ensure 
that children and others who view the film are not encouraged to engage in 
dangerous . . . riding," said Yamaha Vice President Russell D. Jura. "ATVs are 
not toys; they are serious machines that must be operated safely." A Paramount 
spokesman said Tuesday that the studio was looking into the Yamaha matter. 
"Lassie" opens in theaters on Friday. CLASSICAL MUSIC

 Three Tenors Watch: Faster than a high-C, a new recording from the Three 
Tenors is out. No, Atlantic Records wasn't able to get a recording from 
Saturday night's concert at Dodger Stadium out yet -- that CD and a video are 
due Aug. 29. The label did, however, record Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo 
and Jose Carreras when the three sang at Prince Rainier's benefit concert in 
Monte Carlo on June 9. That promotional single and video, containing the trio's 
rendition of "Brindisi" (drinking song) from Verdi's "La Traviata" and "La 
donna e mobile" from Verdi's "Rigoletto," were sent to American classical 
stations on Monday. Both songs also were performed during the encores at 
Saturday night's show. . . . In other tenors news, Oklahoma fans watching the 
trio's Dodger Stadium concert on TV in Tulsa, Okla., got a huge culture shock 
when the concert's transmission was interrupted by a power failure. The signal 
on public-TV station KOED automatically switched to cable's E! Entertainment 
Television, which was airing the raunchy "Howard Stern Show." "Evidently, some 
very distasteful material aired . . . maybe even vulgar from the phone calls we 
received," a KOED spokesman said. "It had something to do with Howard Stern and 
people taking their pants off."

 Cliburn Keeps It Short: The cross-country tour by American pianist Van Cliburn 
and the Moscow Philharmonic continues to be plagued by changes. Following 
recent appearances in San Diego and Los Angeles, Cliburn and the orchestra 
played in Dallas on Friday night and in St. Louis on Monday. At both tour 
stops, the 60-year-old pianist shortened his promised two-concerto program -- 
Tchaikovsky's First and Rachmaninoff's Third -- in favor of playing solo pieces 
before intermission and the Tchaikovsky work after. At last week's show at the 
Hollywood Bowl, the pianist complained of "lightheadedness" and played solo 
pieces instead of the Rachmaninoff concerto. In Dallas and St. Louis, no 
explanation was given to the audience. The next two scheduled stops are Denver 
on Saturday and Salt Lake City on Sunday. QUICK TAKES

canceled shows this week at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. . . . Tom Hanks, Rob 
Reiner, Mac Davis, Sidney Poitier, Anthony Geary and Karl Malden were among 
those "schlepping" (Barbra Streisand's word) to Anaheim on Monday for the 
rescheduled opening of her four-night stand at the Pond of Anaheim. . . . 
Country singer Joe Diffie ("Prop Me Up Beside the Jukebox," "John Deere Green") 
is the honorary host of today's celebrations at Space Center Houston 
commemorating the 25th anniversary of the Apollo space mission. Among his 
duties: to help unveil a postage stamp commemorating man's walk on the moon.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'REMEDIES': A POIGNANT HIGH-CAMP ROMANCE; AN IMPERIOUS COLONIAL 
WOMAN IS ON THE RISE IN A REMOTE PART OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE. GAMES OF SEX AND 
POWER ARE HER TOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With their delirious "Desperate Remedies," which premiered at the recent Los 
Angeles International Gay & Lesbian Film & Video Festival, New Zealand 
filmmakers Stewart Main and Peter Wells have written a heady, operatic 
Victorian romance and played it on the screen absolutely straight. The result 
is high-camp pathos, alternately hilarious and poignant, in which the most 
elaborate artifice evokes a surprising, ever-increasing degree of genuine 
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Artistically, this is risky business indeed, like walking a high wire: a 
single misstep in tone and control and the entire fragile enterprise collapses. 
Happily, Wells and Main never stumble, and their film emerges as a glittery 
triumph, as amusing as an especially fanciful wedding cake or Rose Parade 
float. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a distant point of empire . . . in a town called Hope" -- with those words 
the filmmakers take us into their stylized universe as the regal, imperious 
Dorothea Brook (Jennifer Ward-Lealand), dressed in blood red, proceeds swiftly 
by horse and buggy to meet a boat loaded with immigrants. She aims to spot a 
likely man to marry her younger sister (Kiri Mills), who has fallen into the 
clutches of her half-caste, onetime lover (Cliff Curtis), who keeps the sister, 
pregnant with his child, doped up on opium. 
</P>
<P>
 She locks gazes with a sexy, handsome, hairy-chested stud (Kevin Smith), 
seeking his fortune in the fictional New Britannia. Their mutual attraction is 
instant -- never mind that Dorothea's current lover is her beautiful companion 
(Lisa Chappell), her assistant at her ritzy dress and hat shop. Meanwhile, an 
impoverished, ambitious local politico (Michael Hurst) is eager to marry 
Dorothea, promising in return a contract for 4,000 army uniforms needed for a 
land war that's under way. 
</P>
<P>
 In short order Main and Wells have turned loose a screen full of passionate, 
ruthless people quickly caught up in a series of power plays, with sex and the 
promise of riches as key weapons, that bring to mind the more sophisticated 
manipulators of "Les Liaisons Dangereuses." The appearance-is-everything 
dictates of Victorian propriety merely intensify the games these people play, 
giving them an extra kick. Yet each maneuver brings the relentlessly practical 
Dorothea to a moment of truth requiring her to make the choice she has so 
relentlessly avoided: whether to follow the dictates of her heart or her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Main and Wells stir up unbridled passion in a world of deliberate artifice -- 
primarily in the elegant black-and-red drawing room of Dorothea's mansion and 
Hope's seedy, rowdy waterfront saloon-bordello -- and even an exotic opium den. 
Cinematographer Leon Narby, production designer David Coulson and costume 
designer Glenis Foster -- some of her creations are notably naughty -- have 
collaborated with Main and Wells to create a triumph of visual bravura, 
accompanied by Peter Scholes' suitably stormy score, which incorporates 
passages from Verdi's "La Forza del Destino," a key inspiration for the entire 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast never falters in sustaining the extravagantly dramatic roles. 
Ultimately, through near-surreal means, Main and Wells elicit in "Desperate 
Remedies" a sense of psychological validity in regard to the entire rapacious 
colonial experience that rings truer than in more straightforward conventional 
depictions.

TV REVIEW; REPORT FALLS BEHIND 'THE TRAIL OF GANGS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The spread of Los Angeles-based gangs to other Western U.S. cities perversely 
symbolizes L.A.'s dominance of the entire region. In a kind of reversal of 
American history, the drug-driven Diaspora of Crips and Bloods is an eastward 
expansion of street imperialism. Denver, Portland and Las Vegas are nothing but 
fresh territories for gangs to increase the profit margin of their drug 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 This is old news (a Denver acquaintance told me of Crips in that city in 
1985), and yet KCET's superficial report, "On the Trail of Gangs," treats it as 
if it's breaking stuff. The concern remains how smaller Western cities can put 
a lid on the gang warfare that has long plagued L.A. In that regard, this 
report on "Life & Times" should be broadcast in the vulnerable burgs, not the 
one already overwhelmed by the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In Las Vegas, a rise in drive-by shootings has been the precursor for the 
development of home-grown gangs inspired by L.A. veterans. The city's heavy 
cash turnover makes it a ripe target for the drug entrepreneurs, who have 
recently begun to stage shootouts in casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Portland's gang problems appear slight, although this report's 
only notable moments come when a nighttime camera tracks the violent escapades 
of the Tortilla Flats gang -- mostly aimless kids whose parents moved to the 
Northwest to get away from . . . gang warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Gang culture, Denver-style, is as entrenched as in any big city. With a poor 
inner-city core as old as Denver's, it seems unlikely that the current turf 
battles -- as the report suggests -- are strictly an L.A. import. The culture 
has spread to the white suburbs, but a real examination of gang style as a 
fashion statement goes begging here. The cops on camera sound resigned to the 
worst, since budget cuts have sliced into the kind of interagency coordination 
that may have nipped the West's gang war in the bud. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Life & Times' " "On the Trail of Gangs" airs at 7:30 tonight on KCET-TV 
Channel 28.

TV RATINGS; ALL-STAR GAME SCORES DESPITE THREAT OF STRIKE

 Despite the prospect of a players strike hovering like a storm cloud, 
baseball's annual All-Star Game last week delivered an almost identical rating 
to last year's contest, figures from the A.C. Nielsen Co. showed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's game on NBC, which the National League won, 8-7, in 10 innings on 
a double by Moises Alou, got a 15.7 rating--meaning it was seen in nearly 14.8 
million homes.The 1993 game on CBS got a 15.6.  
</P>
<P>
 Both were an improvement over the 14.9 in 1992, but they still rank among the 
lowest-rated All-Star games of the past three decades. The highest rated was 
the 1970 game, which got a 28.5. 
</P>
<P>
 And whatever baseball fever there was for the All-Star Game quickly 
dissipated. ABC's first regular-game coverage on Saturday under the much-touted 
"Baseball Network" banner attracted only 15% of the available audience and 
ranked 58th among the week's 87 prime-time network programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The All-Star telecast gave NBC a boost to a first-place tie with CBS, among 
the networks. Southland Ratings

ABUSED FOSTER CHILDREN TO GET $1.95 MILLION; SOCIAL SERVICES: COUNTY AGREES TO 
COMPENSATE TWO BOYS WHO WERE BEATEN AND MOLESTED, AND THEIR HALF SISTER, WHO 
WITNESSED THE MALTREATMENT AT A COMPTON HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Attempting to measure the value of the broken bones, bruises, sexual abuse and 
constant hunger suffered by two young boys in a foster home licensed by Los 
Angeles County, the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday agreed without comment to 
settle their lawsuit for $1.95 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report recommending that award, attorneys for the county said a jury 
might decide that the 14 months of abuse endured by the two boys, now 8 and 9, 
while living at a foster home in Compton warranted far more compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, county social workers were not aware that the home's 
operator, Lillie Hinton, was caring for several more children than the six for 
which she was licensed and that some of them were sleeping in a garage. 
</P>
<P>
 The county also acknowledged that it left the two boys there several months 
after being made aware that some of the other children were being abused. 
</P>
<P>
 Although foster homes are privately operated, they are licensed by the 
government and it can be held financially liable for failing to monitor or 
correct dangerous living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, citing similar cases in which the county failed to remove foster 
children from such situations, the state Department of Social Services took 
over the licensing and monitoring of foster homes. At the time, the county's 
caseload per social worker exceeded state standards and the county often failed 
to report to the state cases in which children were beaten, scalded, raped or 
even killed until months later. 
</P>
<P>
 The two boys were taken from their mother soon after they were born addicted 
to the drugs in her system. In October, 1988, they went to live with Hinton, 
joining a half sister, who is now 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The county became aware of the conditions at the Hinton home in the summer of 
1989 and launched an investigation that resulted in six of the children being 
taken away. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two boys granted the award Tuesday were left behind. They were being 
sexually abused by Hinton's son, according to the county's report. When they 
were bathed it was with a garden hose and cold water and, if they squirmed, 
they were hit on the head with the metal end, blows that left permanent scars. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, after more reports of abuse were made to the county, the children 
were taken in December, 1989, to another foster home. Doctors then discovered 
the extent of their injuries. They had suffered fractures of the skull and 
broken arms, legs and feet; their ribs, backs and buttocks were bruised. They 
were malnourished, their stomachs bloated from lack of food. 
</P>
<P>
 No criminal charges were ever filed against Hinton and her son, although her 
foster care license was revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 In the report to the supervisors recommending the payment, Principal Deputy 
County Counsel Robert B. Reagan and Clayton Averbuck, a private attorney who 
worked on the case, said a jury would be "inflamed" by the details of abuse in 
the case and might be "sympathetic to the plaintiffs' ordeal." 
</P>
<P>
 The two boys will split $1.26 million to compensate them for their suffering 
and for the loss of earnings resulting from their injuries as well as for the 
cost of the psychological care they will need. A smaller share will go to the 
half sister because she witnessed the mistreatment. About a third of the money 
will go to the attorney who represented the children. 
</P>
<P>
 All three children are now living with other foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Averbuck said the settlement was "at the higher end" of such awards but is not 
the largest amount paid to children mistreated in foster homes. In 1989, the 
county agreed to pay $7 million to a child who had been raped repeatedly as a 
toddler. In 1990, the county agreed to pay $5.5 million to a boy who had been 
abused physically and sexually and reduced to a quadriplegic when he nearly 
drowned at a foster home. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Department of Children's Services agreed with Tuesday's award. 
</P>
<P>
 Schuyler Sprowles, a department spokesman, said the agency, which has an 
annual budget of $800 million, has improved greatly since 1991, when Peter 
Digre became executive director. Sprowles said the department had brought 
caseloads into compliance with state standards and had made safety for the 
60,000 dependent children it is responsible for its top priority.

REPUBLICANS AND WORKING WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to Linda Hirshman's "Out of the GOP Big Tent, Back to the 
Kitchen" (Column Left, July 12): I agree with her contention that the GOP is 
undermining itself by failing to support its working women. However, Hirshman 
fails to illustrate that Mary Matalin and other working Republican women are 
part of the problem because they do not confront their own party politicos, 
fearing that they will be perceived as antagonistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, I do not see a problem, if the GOP wants to self-destruct, let it. 
Why should the public be concerned with saving the Republican Party, if the 
party itself is not concerned? Further, it's amusing when the party reveals its 
own Murphy Browns.

survival of the Republican Party of late, I feel it my duty to reassure them 
all that our party plans to remain viable for a very long time! I wish to begin 
by first correcting the scurrilous statements made by Prof. Hirshman, who in 
her newfound role as the designated "drive-by shooter" for the radical fringe 
of the women's movement, bemoaned the fact that Republican women are being 
denied equal rights by the so-called "radical right" movement dominating the 
GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 After reading the blatantly distorted and out-of-context statements and 
quotations, which she attributed to Marilyn Quayle, Phyllis Schlafly, Peggy 
Noonan, et al., one would have to be an idiot to subscribe to such an ideology. 
I can assure Hirshman that I am not an idiot! I am, however, a conservative, 
Republican professional woman who strives for a safe society, fiscal 
constraint, the teaching of the basics in our public schools, a non-socialistic 
country and true equality for all God's people regardless of one's gender, 
religious, racial or ethnic backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, the Democratic Party will muster the courage to rein in the radical 
elements of their party that women of Hirshman's ilk inflict on the mainstream.

 * Oh, Pete, I was ready to vote to reelect you, even though I didn't agree 
with some things you stand for. I wanted a Republican in office. Why am I not 
voting for you now? Simple: 1) you are a closet liberal, 2) you are a religious 
left extremist, 3) you want to throw out the abortion issue from the Republican 
Party platform, 4) you have no regard for human life (July 13)! No, I am not a 
religious right extremist. I am someone who has high morals with regard to 
human life. You, Gov. Wilson, care more about your own comfort than the life of 
the unborn. You say the value of human life has no place in the Republican 
Party! That is why I am a Republican. They put a high value on human life. 
</P>
<P>
 If the party officially takes the abortion issue out of the platform I will be 
turning in my card, and I know others will follow.

 * As a "born-again" Christian, it embarrasses me being associated in any way 
with the likes of Pat Robertson or Jerry Falwell. These men give the impression 
that the Gospel message is one of hatred, anger and judgment, rather than one 
of love, acceptance and forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 The religious right crucified Jesus Christ. As long as these modern-day 
Pharisees exert such influence on the Republican Party, you can count on this 
Christian voter voting for the Democrats.

MORMON WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a Mormon woman, I was very interested to read Maxine Hanks' commentary, "A 
Struggle to Reclaim Authority" (July 10). I respect her opinions regarding 
women in our church, though my experience and perspective are very different 
from hers. 
</P>
<P>
 Power struggles are not of much interest to me. I prefer to leave that to the 
secular world. The opportunity to serve others, to prod me to become a better 
person and to develop my faith help me find fulfillment in my religious 
association. This month I am one of several adult volunteers taking 30 teen-age 
girls of various ethnic and economic backgrounds to a camp in the mountains. 
The experience provides great joy in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 The male leaders of my church, all volunteers (no paid clergy), who work at 
full-time jobs and have families, have served me with kindness and goodness 
over the years, wherever I've lived (East Coast, West Coast, in between). I've 
never perceived them as authoritarian or power-hungry. I have been amazed at 
the generous way they share their time with the members of their congregations, 
given the many other responsibilities they juggle. 
</P>
<P>
 I am pro-women's rights, and am at peace in my faith. Each of us has our 
struggles in life. I am glad that my religious association helps me deal with 
mine. I wish Hanks well in her journey.

STATE JUDICIAL COMMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prof. Ruth Rosen charges the Commission on Judicial Performance with "gross 
corruption and misconduct" (Commentary, June 30). Those charges are unfounded 
and irresponsible. As commission members who represent the public and attorney 
sectors, we have not participated in or observed any misconduct or corruption 
within this body. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen apparently infers "corruption" from a recent decline in removals. She 
neglects, however, to mention the recent increase in judges who have resigned 
or retired while under commission investigation or with commission charges 
pending: 23 over the last six years, and seven in 1993 alone. Such departures 
are tantamount to removals. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, in any event, cannot itself remove or censure a judge. It can 
only petition the Supreme Court to do so. That process is expensive and 
time-consuming. For the commission to routinely pursue removal or censure, 
after judges have removed themselves, would seem an unwise use of scarce 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen also neglects to mention recent public discipline. In 1988, California 
voters authorized "public reprovals." That option requires the judge's consent. 
Nevertheless, 13 reprovals have been issued. Judges would not be consenting to 
reprovals -- or resigning with charges pending -- if the commission were not 
rigorously holding them to account. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen suggests that commission effectiveness be gauged by the so-called 
"national average" for removals. States' disciplinary systems vary 
significantly, however. Actions of other states are pertinent from a 
substantive viewpoint, but hardly from a statistical one. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen implies that the commission opposes legislation that would enhance 
openness, create a majority of non-judge members, and give the commission 
rule-making power. In fact, the commission supports both these changes and 
others, including provisions to release confidential information in the 
judicial appointment process and increase diversity among commission members. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, contrary to Rosen's implications, does not favor secrecy. 
Since 1988, the Constitution has authorized open hearings in limited 
circumstances. The commission has ordered an open hearing every time those 
circumstances existed. Respondent judges, however, have challenged those orders 
in court, thus blocking open hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Current laws mandate confidentiality in most cases. The commission must obey 
that law, not to protect judges charged with misconduct, but to prevent the 
exclusion of evidence or dismissal of a case based on breach of 
confidentiality. 
</P>
<P>
 We agreed to serve as public and attorney members (an annual commitment of 
some 20 days and substantial preparation time, without pay) because we believe 
our legal system requires public confidence in an honest and impartial 
judiciary.

 Re "Property Owners Have Rights, Too," Column Right, July 3: Three cheers for 
the Supreme Court decision in the case of Dolan vs. City of Tigard.Although, as 
Michael Berger points out, the case involved land in Oregon, this decision, 
coupled with the decision in the Lucas case last year, should send a strong 
message to local California regulators. The Fifth Amendment right, "nor shall 
private property be taken for public use, without just compensation," should be 
considered a guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope every planning commissioner, mayor and supervisor in the state reads 
Berger's article. Perhaps they will think twice before extorting land as the 
price of a permit to improve property that they do not own.

POLICE WATCH; MORE FOR MEMORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The memory of few Los Angeles police officers are preserved as well as that of 
Clarence Wayne Dean. Too often, it's tough to get a decent plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean plummeted from a freeway interchange to his death in January while trying 
to head to work moments after the Northridge quake. That interchange has now 
been named after him. Officer Christy Lynne Hamilton was shot to death a month 
later while responding to a domestic violence call in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 City law provides money for a plaque with the deceased officer's badge. That's 
pretty paltry. The money for anything more than that -- perhaps for a plaque 
that might include the officer's weapon, medals, stripes, pins, patches -- has 
to come from family, friends and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 That fact was outrageous to LAPD Officer Angela Hougen, who works in the unit 
that provides counseling and other services to slain officers. Moreover, when 
she passed the hat for one of those better plaques for Hamilton, many were 
willing, but few could donate after the quake and other recent disasters had 
decimated their resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Councilman Joel Wachs would change all that with an ordinance that 
would eliminate such Scrooge-like restrictions on police memorial plaques. 
Under his proposal the spending limit would be lifted. Rather than having no 
limit at all, we suggest that it be raised to $500, the amount Wachs estimates 
it would cost for the more elaborate plaques. That minor sum that would have 
more suitably honored the 22 LAPD officers killed in the line of duty since 
1984.

THE BIG PAYBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When 71-year-old John Gonsalves won $5.1 million in the Massachusetts lottery, 
his ex-wife came knocking. She wants child support. She deserves retroactive 
payment, plus plenty of interest. No matter that it was almost 50 years ago. A 
debt is a debt. 
</P>
<P>
 After Gonsalves walked away from his family in 1946, his wife Marie was left 
to raise their three boys, then ages 2, 4 and 6, by herself. Like millions of 
women in the same situation, life got harder. She moved in with her mother, 
according to news reports, cleaned houses for $7 a week, went on welfare and 
worked in a cafeteria. Even by 1940s standards, that was a mere pittance on 
which to raise three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonsalves, who worked as a longshoreman, garbage man and janitor, admits he 
didn't do much for his children. But, according to his lawyer, he claims he 
visited them at their grandmother's house. That's not quite the same as paying 
the bills, though, is it? 
</P>
<P>
 After he won the lottery -- which guarantees him $170,000 a year for 20 years 
-- he gave $5,000 to each of his children, who are now adults. That works out 
to about one-tenth of 1% of his winnings. After his ex-wife, now Marie Hynes, 
made her claim, he offered her $10,000. That works out to barely $500 for each 
year that someone else put food on the table and a roof over the heads of his 
three sons. She sued. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of men are fathers in name only. These deadbeat dads, and a few moms 
who are also missing in action, often become invisible when it's time to 
provide for their children. The Clinton Administration estimates that $34 
billion goes unpaid every year; In California, $3 billion goes uncollected.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the Children's Defense Fund, absent parents are more likely to 
pay for their cars than pay for their kids. What a shameful fact.  
</P>
<P>
 A family court will decide if Gonsalves has to pay anything to settle a 
decades-old debt to his children and their mother. Marie Hynes has a lot of 
people rooting for her.  
</P>
<P>
 Here's one case from which every mother who's had to raise children without a 
father's help can get vicarious satisfaction. Here's one deadbeat dad who's now 
on the hook to finally pay, and pay big. Better late than never.

WITHOUT VISION, PEOPLE PERISH; MANKIND'S MANIFEST DESTINY IN SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Crackling by radio across a quarter of a million miles of space came the 
electrifying message: "The Eagle has landed." With that, two Americans stepped 
out onto the crusty arid surface of the moon, bringing an exhilarating climax 
to a quest that was as much an adventure of the human spirit as a technological 
feat. The Apollo 11 mission seemed like the discovery of another New World, a 
world of exploration of outer space and inner planets. 
</P>
<P>
 Today marks the 25th anniversary of that warm summer day on Earth when Neil 
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin pranced through frigid lunar dust. But for those who 
expected a dawning of a new space age, there is little to celebrate. The 
original heady talk of bases on the moon, huge manned space stations orbiting 
earth with 100 inhabitants and human exploration of Mars has proved nothing 
more than talk. No human has visited the moon since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironies abound. Twenty-five years after men strode on the moon, Daniel S. 
Goldin, administrator of NASA, recently told Congress: "The Congress of the 
United States and the President have to decide whether we want a space 
program." NASA's budget is shrinking and space-science projects are struggling 
to survive with scaled-back cheap missions. 
</P>
<P>
 The deepest irony of all is that NASA is collaborating with scientists and 
engineers from the former Soviet Union -- whose Cold War threat was the 
motivation for the moon landing -- in new projects to monitor Earth's vital 
signs, to plan for joint Martian exploration and to loft an international 
manned space station that is intended to serve as a forward window into outer 
space to test future space-faring possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly this has to do with keeping the Russian experts out of mischief, partly 
with keeping American space workers employed. The potential scientific rewards 
are uncertain. But we must look beyond this horizon. It took a century after 
Columbus landed for Europeans to start large-scale colonization of the 
Americas. We are in a pause, distracted by earthly problems that are all too 
apparent here in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet we are inherently adventuresome and curious creatures, fascinated with the 
awesome powers and mystery of the universe. Witness the public interest this 
week in the spectacular explosions on the planet Jupiter caused by collisions 
with a comet. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the ultimate mystery of all is the possibility that we are not alone 
in this universe, that life exists in other solar systems. That possibility is 
both exciting and frightening. A fundamental biological reality is that life 
spreads as far as it can. That is perhaps our manifest destiny in space. And it 
is what keeps us looking skyward.

MINORITY REPRESENTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Majority rules" is an abstract mathematical goal cherished by those who find 
truth in numbers, but it has nothing whatsoever to do with justice ("Is the 
Court Becoming the Politburo?" by Paul Craig Roberts, Column Right, July 12). A 
poor black candidate running against a wealthy white one has almost no chance 
of getting elected.Check the demographics of the U.S. Senate for confirmation 
of this fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, arguing against the use of the 
Voting Rights Act for setting racial and ethnic quotas, fail to understand that 
the philosophy of majority rule without a financially level playing field has 
often been used and continues to be used to keep minorities out of the power 
structure. It is almost incomprehensible that Justice Thomas, himself a 
descendant of slaves, and the beneficiary of being appointed to positions of 
power, is so out of touch with the extraordinary challenges facing politically 
ambitious blacks and other minorities.

THE L.A. OF THE FUTURE NEEDS RAIL; TRAINS: STOPPING THE RED LINE WOULDN'T SOLVE 
THE MTA'S FISCAL DISTRESS; THE MODEST FARE INCREASE WAS NECESSARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY ZARIAN, Larry Zarian is first vice chairman of the Los Angeles County 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority and a member of the Glendale City 
Council. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There has been a loud and sometimes acrimonious debate lately over the 
expenditure of public funds for a rail system in the Los Angeles Basin. Some 
critics have charged that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's 
commitment to rail construction has placed its bus operation in financial 
peril. 
</P>
<P>
 Responsible public officials have two distinct and yet critical missions. They 
must look to the future and plan the programs and projects that will allow the 
generations who follow us to have secure lives and economic opportunity. They 
must also, on a daily basis, manage complex governmental enterprises in a 
cost-effective way so that services are provided efficiently and effectively. 
These are not choices; they are imperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The dual mission of the MTA is to construct a quality regional rail system 
while operating the very best possible regional bus system. The Red Line is a 
critical part of Los Angeles' future. Twice in the past 14 years, voters have 
supported local tax measures to construct a rail system. In partnership with 
the state and federal governments, the Red Line is well under way. Los Angeles 
soon will have a modern, clean and efficient transportation system that will 
serve our citizens well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA bus operation is in fiscal distress. Ridership has declined and costs 
have escalated. Contributing factors include generous labor contracts 
negotiated when times were better; reductions in federal and state subsidies, 
and fares that have only recently been changed for the first time in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the top 10 U.S. transit operators with both bus and rail operations, the 
MTA is the only one dealing with a $126-million operating shortfall. Other 
operators have increased fares to $1.25 and higher in cities with a lower cost 
of living. They have renegotiated labor contracts and restructured service to 
improve quality and reduce costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles does not need to choose between a well-run bus system and the 
creation of a balanced transportation system, which includes rail in heavy 
urban corridors and high-occupancy-vehicle lanes for mobility countywide. With 
prudent fiscal management and responsible decision-making, Los Angeles can have 
the transportation system that voters have demanded. Elected and appointed 
officials on the MTA board last week made the hard choice: It was time to raise 
the fares on MTA buses and trains in keeping with fare changes in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare increase provides for a discounted token of 90 cents, 45 cents less 
than the cash fare of $1.35. People unable to afford the current $42 monthly 
single-zone pass have been paying the cash fare. Raising the cash fare to $1.35 
and offering a discounted token eliminates the unfair subsidy: Cash payers have 
been providing 59% of MTA revenue while taking 39% of the trips; monthly pass 
users have paid an effective fare of only 43 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes voted by the MTA board include premium fares for premium service 
on rail lines and express buses. By increasing the basic fare to $1.35 and 
eliminating the $42 monthly pass, bus riders will contribute 42% of costs, the 
percentage they were paying in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics say we should discontinue the Metrolink rail program, truncate 
the Red Line at its current four miles and maintain bus fares at $1.10 or even 
lower. But sacrificing the future to mismanage the present is irresponsible. If 
this region is to both grow and prosper, the movement of people and goods must 
be efficient, convenient and contribute to better air quality. We already have 
several corridors where the congestion is so severe that it's simply impossible 
to add more buses or to increase capacity. We must plan for the future and 
invest wisely, while rationally managing our current operation so that we 
continue to have the necessary dollars to match state and federal grants to 
complete our rail system as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost containment, staffing reductions, fare increases and service 
restructuring are all necessary for the MTA to put bus operations on a firm 
financial foundation. Failing to do so will cost Los Angeles dearly.

 The directors of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority have stated their 
intention to vote today to spend $123 million to continue the boondoggle 
Pasadena Blue Line rail project, whose biggest supporters include Mayor Richard 
Riordan, L.A. City Council member Richard Alatorre and L.A. County Supervisors 
Mike Antonovich and Gloria Molina (all board members). Just last week the board 
voted to raise bus fares to $1.35 and eliminate working people's bus passes. 
This action ensures a tougher life for poor and working people -- the 1.3 
million daily bus riders -- and a windfall for the well-to-do, since Metro Rail 
subsidies are $9.86 a ride ($38 including capital costs) and rail-contractor 
cost overruns average 313%. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, for one, benefits from from his investments in the rail engineering 
firm Tetra Tech, Inc. and his cultivation of every Tutor and Saliba in town 
(contractor Tutor-Saliba gave Riordan's 1993 campaign $5,000. Cleo Saliba gave 
$1,000, Naseeb Saliba $1,000, Albert Tutor $1,000 and Ronald Tutor, $1,000). 
Meanwhile, the MTA has rapidly degenerated: bad transit policy has turned into 
political scandal, prompting public outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, I wrote in these pages that the MTA was robbing the bus system to 
pay for ill-conceived rail projects. Riordan, Alatorre, Molina and County 
Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke assured us they shared our concerns, then 
voted with board members Michael Antonovich and Deane Dana to spend $60 million 
for the Pasadena Blue Line with funds we knew they didn't have. We testified, 
accurately but to no avail, that this would assure their return in 1994, 
claiming a funding shortage, to propose cuts in bus service and fare increases. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few months of public hearings, several thousand poor, disabled, 
elderly and working people and high school students begged the MTA board not to 
raise bus fares. Riordan, Antonovich and friends joked among themselves and 
didn't even pretend to listen, then voted to raise fares and eliminate monthly 
passes. Imagine a working woman who, along with 500,000 other Angelenos who 
labor for less than $10,000 a year, makes four bus trips each working day, (one 
round trip to work and another for child care, shopping or visiting a friend) 
and one round trip each weekend day. Even with Molina's token plan to preserve 
the 90-cent bus token, the working woman's monthly cost without a bus pass 
would increase from $42 to $90, a leap of more than 100%. 
</P>
<P>
 This will drive the poor who can afford it to buy an old gas-guzzling car 
(which they'll probably have to drive uninsured) or walk or lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 With the poor and working people out of the way, the MTA board can move on to 
what it does best, using its $3-billion annual budget -- the only significant 
pot of money in fiscally depleted Los Angeles -- to build monuments to 
themselves. Riordan, who controls the city's four seats on the MTA board, is 
most responsible for this malfeasance, followed by Alatorre, Molina and Burke, 
who claim to represent districts whose residents will suffer most from this 
Great Train Robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to mobilize the "masses" in the mass transit system, working 
peoples' activists from the Labor/Community Strategy Center have been 
organizing on the buses for six months. They report that sentiment has rapidly 
moved from "How can we protect our fares and service?" to "How do we get rid of 
the entire MTA board?" Even as the MTA squanders public money buying ads 
slandering its union employees, and implements its "let them eat tokens" 
policy, it is helping us organize another union, the Bus Riders Union, modeled 
on New York's highly effective Straphangers organization. This new union plans 
demonstrations and other direct action aimed at discrediting and removing 
specific MTA board members. Our aim is a moratorium on rail projects until the 
bus system is given top priority, based on the revolutionary idea that the MTA 
should spend public funds to serve the majority of transit riders, develop 
attractive alternatives to smog-producing autos and help a racially and 
class-polarized city reduce rather than exacerbate those antagonisms.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE APOLLO ANNIVERSARY; WAGONS HO! THE PEOPLE'S SPACE FRONTIER

SOUND OFF-PLANET TRAVEL AND EXPLORATION.

 Twenty-five years after Lewis and Clark returned from exploring western 
America, the Conestoga wagons were rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years after the Wright brothers flew their tiny flying machine, 
Americans were buying airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years after Armstrong and Aldrin walked on the moon, we sit at 
home watching old astronauts reminisce on talk shows.  
</P>
<P>
 To a 25-year-old American, the "greatest moment in human history" is ancient 
history. So is it any wonder polls find pessimism about the future among the 
younger generation? Listening to Neil Armstrong as he put his foot upon the 
lunar surface, that 25-year-old American, having been told to expect a future 
less prosperous than his parents', has the right to ask a few tough questions: 
A giant leap to where? For what? 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to the grand frontier of NASA rhetoric? If NASA is our Lewis and 
Clark, when do the wagons roll? If space is supposed to be a frontier, when do 
the people get to go?  
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years after Apollo (and more than 35 years after the space program 
started), it costs more, not less, to put a human in space. Meanwhile, we are 
fed lie after lie about a fantastic space station that has nothing at all to do 
with you and me, and the participation of the taxpayers who fund it all is 
reduced to listening to the astronauts' wake-up music on CNN.  
</P>
<P>
 To top it all off, the head of NASA then dares to decry the lack of vision 
among the American people when they hesitate to pay for this mediocrity. What 
nerve. We have vision, lots of vision; NASA has simply failed to deliver a 
product that Americans want. 
</P>
<P>
 In polls, when Americans are asked if they'd like to go into space themselves, 
almost 50% say yes, if only for a brief visit. Unfortunately, at several 
million dollars a ticket, they can't. 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom is that space is so expensive, only governments can afford 
it. Wrong! Space is expensive precisely because it has been almost totally 
government domain. (Remember who bought us the million-dollar toilet?) If the 
current space agency had been in charge of the American frontier, all that 
would lie west of the Mississippi today would be a luxury condo for four 
government employees somewhere in Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
 If space is a real frontier, we must treat it as such. We must decide that 
opening the frontier is the goal by which we measure all of our human space 
activities, not just science-settlement. This is a major distinction demanding 
a whole different national discussion. The debate is no longer humans versus 
robots. Human activities are the goal. Thus the new debate must be over the 
best and lowest-cost way to open space to permanent human habitation. (This 
will often mean we send robots first because they're cheaper.) We need our 
government to enable us to get to space and start the work of pioneering, not 
to do space for us while we watch on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first frontier priority must be to develop cheap, reliable and clean 
transportation to space. We must begin to phase out the old space shuttle, with 
its $1-billion-a-flight cost and its ozone-layer-destroying motors. Instead, 
the single-stage-to-orbit rocket project, with its rapid turnaround, clean 
motors and low cost should be made a national priority before the bureaucrats 
kill it. 
</P>
<P>
 We must cancel the ridiculously overpriced space station and let credible 
private firms bid for the job. This includes Russian firms and U.S. companies 
that want to recycle the space shuttle's external tanks, turning these 
$500-million structures into useful facilities, instead of having them dumped 
over the Pacific.  
</P>
<P>
 And we must return to the moon, this time to stay. This doesn't mean an 
Antarctica-style camp but new enterprises in joint government and private 
ventures. For example, the Japanese are already developing systems to build 
solar power plants in space from lunar soil, using American designs. Lunar 
habitats have been designed and redesigned. We can do this. Why aren't we? 
</P>
<P>
 To survive as a nation, we need the space frontier, a new national challenge 
that is exciting and involves the maximum number of us possible. It is not 
America's destiny to survive as the bureaucratic overlord of a gradually dying 
planet, crammed full with a divided humanity fighting over scraps and choking 
on its own wastes. Let us turn outward before we turn on ourselves. The 
frontier is calling, and this time we need not take it from anyone else.  
</P>
<P>
 Imagine a kid desperate for a dream 25 years from now, sitting in a home 
powered by sunlight captured in space, who can look to the moon or planets and 
know that there are people just like her out there. Imagine the power to 
motivate our children to succeed on this limitless frontier as humanity climbs 
out of its Earth-bound cradle. 
</P>
<P>
 On this Apollo anniversary, it's right to honor the real heroes who took the 
first "small steps," but we must keep our eyes on the future and what we -- you 
and me and that person over there -- can achieve. We all have the right stuff. 
We are Americans. We are a frontier people. Give us our frontier and let us 
prove it.

NO CHOICE FOR HOSPITALS; MEDICAL SCHOOLS -- EVEN THOSE OPPOSED ON RELIGIOUS 
GROUNDS -- MAY SOON BE FORCED TO TEACH ABORTION TECHNOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHERINE DOWLING, Katherine Dowling is a family physician at the USC School 
ofMedicine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A while back, I overheard a conversation between two young physicians in 
residency training. One was an enthusiastic feminist fresh from medical school, 
eager to begin practicing her pro-choice beliefs. The other, a war-weary 
veteran, said that she would not be doing any more abortions. "I support a 
woman's right to choose," she said. "But yesterday I aborted a baby, and it 
tore me up. You could see his little fingers and toes. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 There is real concern in the pro-choice community that doctors will not be 
available to meet the future demand for abortions. Though most physicians 
support choice in theory, many are turned off by the abortion procedure itself. 
Some nurse-practitioners have proposed that they or others be permitted to do 
first-trimester abortions to take up the slack. But there's a problem with 
this. According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, statistics from 1988, the 
latest year available, indicate that 167,680, or more than 20% of abortions in 
this country are done after the first trimester. Second- and third-trimester 
abortions require considerable surgical training and expertise: In the third 
trimester, for example, one technique involves evacuating the brain contents 
from the skull in utero and compressing the emptied skull to facilitate vaginal 
delivery. (Termination of the third-trimester child must be carried out in 
utero, as termination after live delivery is against the law.) 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the expanded need for abortions, the Residency Review Committee for 
Obstetrics and Gynecology, which accredits training programs for obstetrics and 
gynecology specialization, has proposed that residency-training programs in 
ob/gyn must provide broad training in abortion technology. But what if the 
training institution's religious or ethical beliefs forbid the taking of a 
human life, in or out of the womb? Although individual residents can forgo 
abortion training for ethical reasons, there is no such "conscience clause" for 
the training hospital or institution. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 protest letters have been received by the residency review 
committee since the proposal was announced last October. A spokesperson says 
these objections will be taken into consideration when its subcommittee meets 
this week in Laguna Niguel. A compromise has been proposed by the committee 
wherein training institutions with moral objections to teaching abortion skills 
can refer trainees to other institutions that don't object. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, on a moral plane, this won't work either. It would be tantamount to 
refusing to turn in a Jewish family to the Gestapo, while making sure someone 
else with a less tender conscience did so. The family would still be killed, 
and the first person morally culpable. 
</P>
<P>
 When we talk about physician-training institutions that object to abortion, 
we're talking mainly, but not exclusively, about Catholic hospitals. There are 
about 600 of these hospitals, often in underserved areas. Fifty of them have 
training programs in obstetrics/gynecology. Three medical schools also are 
Catholic institutions. None of these will participate in the active taking of a 
life, at any stage. Should they be forced to do so to qualify for 
accreditation, they will most likely close down their ob/gyn programs.  
</P>
<P>
 Obstetrics and gynecology has been defined as an important primary-care 
specialty. The loss of 50 programs would adversely affect medical care for many 
of the more than 50 million people Catholic hospitals serve each year. Without 
obstetric and gynecologic training for their students, medical schools cannot 
be accredited, and most clinical training of medical students is done through 
affiliated residency programs. How would the mighty AMA feel about three 
medical schools biting the dust? 
</P>
<P>
 And it may not stop there. Will Catholic institutions in the future be forced 
to provide "euthanasia training" to be accredited? Will family medicine and 
surgery residency-accreditation committees also require mandatory abortion 
training? And if institutions that still believe life is a good thing are 
forced out of the field of medical education, how can medical students or their 
teachers have a "choice" that meets their own moral expectations? Remember, the 
student who wishes to learn abortion techniques can easily choose to train at 
one of the many hospitals that have such programs in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Catholic institutions aren't politically correct these days, freedom of 
religion is still a national value. The proposed requirements for training, 
inasmuch as they are under the aegis of an institution with broad public 
responsibilities, are a clear affront to this freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving religion aside, there is still this in the Hippocratic oath, to which 
we doctors have sworn for two millenia before it was abridged in 1957: "I will 
give no deadly medicine to anyone if asked, nor suggest any such counsel; 
furthermore, I will not give to a woman an instrument to produce abortion."

RSVP / INTO THE NIGHT: WHEN EASTSIDE STORY MEETS BRENTWOOD

 The Scene: Monday's benefit premiere at the Cinerama Dome of Sony Pictures 
Classics and HBO Showcase's "Mi Vida Loca My Crazy Life." A party/rap concert 
followed at the Palladium. The story of Echo Park's Latina gang members was 
described as firme -- the right thing to be -- by the gang kids present. 
Quentin Tarantino, who won this year's Palme d'Or at Cannes, called the film, 
"the best movie about gang girls since 'Switchblade Sisters.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The film's writer-director, Allison Anders, and stars Seidy 
Lopez, Angel Aviles and Jacob Vargas. Among the 1,100 guests who "had the 
pleasure of kickin' it" with the 200 invited gang members were Rosanna 
Arquette, Debi Mazar, El Vez, Lara Flynn Boyle, Esai Morales, Paula Poundstone, 
Ione Skye, Colin Callender, Keri Puttnam and Sofia Coppola. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Facial Expression: On the 50ish matron who was asked to open her Chanel 
purse for a weapons check. "What!? You want what!? You want my purse!!?" It was 
a learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Dress Mode: Brentwood meets the Eastside. From Echo Park came women in teased 
hair and serious eyeliner; men with baggy pants, beepers, shaved heads and neck 
tattoos. From the Westside came the ubiquitous little black dresses, Hermes 
scarves and cell phones. Sunglasses were the one accessory both groups embraced 
as a cultural necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion Statement: Lopez made an eye-popping arrival in a floor-length, 
embroidered silver gown from which she burst forth. "Sleek, sexy and 
exuberant," is the way one woman described the dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambience: Guests had the pleasure of having high-decibel obscenities screamed 
at them by performing rappers while they waited on a 200-foot buffet line for 
stuffed grape leaves and egg rolls. "Swifty would not have approved," said 
writer-musician David Was. 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: "I'm telling you, there are people who would love this," said one 
woman to a disbelieving middle-aged man experiencing his first rap concert. 
</P>
<P>
 Money Matters: More than $45,000 was raised for the Independent Feature 
Project/West's Project Involve and El Centro del Pueblo's scholarship fund.

THEATER REVIEW; CLEAR VIEW OF DENIAL IS RIVETING IN 'SIGHT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jonathan Waxman may be having a breakdown. A successful painter with his first 
European retrospective, he fears he's already passe. To his great annoyance, 
people keep insisting that his painting of a black man and white woman having 
sex in a desecrated Jewish graveyard depicts a rape and, as a work of art, is a 
vulgar sham. Among those people: Patricia (Elizabeth Norment), the college 
girlfriend and muse that he abandoned and now, in his mid-life crisis, seeks 
out; and Grete (Celia Shuman), a German journalist who smiles and shows 
cleavage while grilling him mercilessly just at the moment he is falling apart. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Sight Unseen," Donald Margulies' riveting 1991 play, centers on Jonathan's 
denial of his looming breakdown and the mistakes that led him there. The title 
refers to the practice of patrons who pre-buy the works of a famous artist 
before they've been painted. Call it commodities trading or a refusal to 
distinguish between profit and actual achievement -- Margulies finds his main 
character knee-deep in the art-world hype and all that goes with it. The story 
goes back and forward in time to let us see just how Jonathan (Stephen Rowe) 
let his values slide, how he started to become the phony that we increasingly 
suspect he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Fascinating, half-buried problems bubble to the surface for each of the other 
three characters in "Sight Unseen" as well. Patricia now lives in a remote, 
cold corner of England that suits her emotional exile. She hasn't yet let go of 
her love for the brilliant young painter who dismissed her, ostensibly because 
she wasn't Jewish. But Margulies digs up evidence to show that the young 
Patricia's way of plunging into life simply scared Jonathan. So Patricia no 
longer plunges, but spends her time digging up ruins with her husband and 
fellow archeologist, Nick. Intelligent but socially inept, Nick (Bruce 
Burkhartsmeier) has spent his married life emasculated by the shadow of 
Jonathan, cast partially by the artist's first painting of Patricia, displayed 
in their home. The lives of all three characters hang, in one way or another, 
on what Jonathan decides to do with that painting.  
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan's grilling by Grete, the play's most mysterious character, provides 
two smart, tense scenes that swirl with innuendo, ideas and clues. As they 
argue about the Holocaust and the meaning of art, the interview grows more and 
more dangerous. The artist, it begins to seem, has been using his Jewish 
identity -- i.e. paranoia -- to disengage from the world ever since his 
break-up with Patricia. As for Grete -- is she a good and ruthless student of 
art or a Nazi? Both are revealed as dissemblers masquerading as truth-tellers. 
In fact, both have good points to make.  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Bloom first directed the play for South Coast Repertory, which 
commissioned it, and then for Off Broadway the next year. This production lacks 
some of the crackle of the New York version. Scenes wind down when they should 
end with an emotional wallop.  
</P>
<P>
 Rowe, who originated the role at South Coast Rep, should be the engine that 
drives the play. His Jonathan, though, lacks the arrogance, or even the surface 
confidence, that an international success would instill. More Long Island than 
Brooklyn, his accent is prissy, and he seems to shuffle when he walks. In 
short, he's missing the stature one associates with an art-world star. He needs 
to sparkle next to the bumpkin Nick, but the balance is off here. Nick, with 
his eccentric opinions on art, is the one you'd most like to book on a talk 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Another missing piece of the puzzle is Norment's young Patricia in the 
flashback scenes. Where she needs to be truly carefree or light she seems 
forced, already desperate not to lose Jonathan, as if she knew it would take up 
20 years of her life to get over him (and this raises the question: Is the 
playwright exaggerating the extent of a woman's heartbreak?) .  
</P>
<P>
 Burkhartsmeier's Nick is funny and interesting, whether monosyllabic or in a 
drunken, rambling, hostile mood. Shuman's Grete keeps you guessing as to the 
extent of the journalist's malevolence. 
</P>
<P>
 Set designer Matt Flynn provides Patricia and Nick's no-amenities country 
kitchen with a painterly background to reinforce Jonathan's presence in their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some tentative pacing in this production, "Sight Unseen" remains a 
play of ideas and emotional complexity. It examines things that are full of 
ambivalence, but with vision both clear and direct.

ART REVIEW; A 'GRAPHIC ODYSSEY' REVEALS AN INNOVATIVE SPIRIT OF HOPE; LACMA'S 
ROMARE BEARDEN EXHIBITION IS A TELLING SHOWCASE OF MORE THAN 100 LITHOGRAPHS, 
MONOPRINTS, COLLAGRAPHS, SCREENPRINTS AND ETCHINGS.

<P>
 Romare Bearden is certainly the most renowned African American artist of his 
generation and that's wrong. Wrong because there are not more of them, worse 
because no artist's gifts should be confined or promoted within a category of 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Bearden was one of the best artists of his generation, period. Further 
evidence of this comes with the L.A. County Museum of Art's newly opened 
exhibition, "A Graphic Odyssey: Romare Bearden as Printmaker." 
</P>
<P>
 Consisting of more than 100 lithographs, monoprints, collagraphs, screenprints 
and etchings, it is the most comprehensive show of his graphic work to date. It 
was organized and circulated by the Council for Creative Projects, New York, 
and coordinated here by LACMA curator Bruce Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 The show proves the artist a graphic innovator possessed of a thoughtful, 
cultivated humanistic sensibility. He studied at Boston University, Columbia 
and the Sorbonne. He started in math, went on to cartooning and got hooked on 
modernism in Paris, where he met Brancusi and Braque, among others. One of his 
influential teachers was the satirical German Expressionist master George 
Grosz. Bearden shared his realism but not his bile. 
</P>
<P>
 His work makes him look like a contemporary of such artists as Ben Shahn and 
Stuart Davis, combining the social conscience of the one with the jazzy 
modernism of the other. Davis was a friend and mentor who, rather 
paradoxically, furthered Bearden's love of jazz by urging him to listen to "the 
silences between the notes," a poetic concept that nudged Bearden further along 
toward an interest in Zen. Actually Bearden was younger, outliving both of them 
by nearly two decades. He was 76 when he died in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer in age to the Abstract Expressionists, Bearden first exhibited 
alongside Robert Motherwell and Adolph Gottlieb. He admired their work but was 
determined to make art that mirrored the experience of black Americans. That 
put him out of mainstream fashion and slowed his recognition. Significantly, 
during the lean years he made ends meet as a social worker. 
</P>
<P>
 His trademark images came to be collages of unsettling expressive power. 
Photographic heads and other details give meaning to shapes in cut and torn 
paper that would appear purely decorative and abstract out of context. If 
anything his prints improve on this technique by unifying the inevitable 
scrappiness of pure paste-up. 
</P>
<P>
 His range was remarkable. Many of these images are based on childhood memories 
of his birthplace in North Carolina, where black people then lived in cabins by 
the railroad tracks. Trains haunt his work with poignant implications. They 
symbolize the power to take a man away from his home or bring him to a promised 
land. The pain of separation resonates in a scene of lovers parting at dawn in 
"Before the First Whistle." Bearden's tendency to rumination reflects in "The 
Trains." Some 10 color variations on heads of women in front of a locomotive 
confirm his power as master of moody orchestration of hue.  
</P>
<P>
 His reverie is haunted by women dressed in long colorful skirts and heads tied 
in bandannas. Bravery is bespoken by the contrast between ramshackle 
surroundings and cheerful dress. The "Girl in the Garden" wears watermelon-pink 
gingham. "Pepper Jelly Lady" contrasts its own sonorous palette with a 
beautiful monochrome hand-drawn frame. A monumental female figure takes back 
some of the power of indigenous African art appropriated by Picasso. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the great Catalan, Bearden extended his range to classic myth. He made 
Odysseus a black hero and equated his wanderings with the Diaspora of Africans 
taken by the slave trade. He was good at this, but his thoughts ever came home 
to Manhattan where he mainly lived. He participated in the pan-artistic Harlem 
Renaissance. The superiority of his own poetry and prose put him at ease with 
writers. His understanding of abstract orchestration opened friendships with 
great jazz musicians like Duke Ellington and Earl (Fatha) Hines. 
</P>
<P>
 His jazz-inspired imagery, unlike Davis' terse abstraction, never lost sight 
of the guys playing the music. Occasionally he'd do a witty stylization like 
the Cuboid "Alto Saxophone," but usually he stayed funky. In "Jazz II" a 
pianist leers merrily at the crowd with a big cigarette stuck in the corner of 
his smile. Reminds you of Stuart Davis' story about jazz clubs so tough they 
had to put barbed wire around the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Bearden was never barbed. His art knew the pain of the blues, but, he said, 
"Even though you go through these terrible experiences, you come out feeling 
good. That's what the blues say and that's what I believe -- life will 
prevail."

MUSIC REVIEW; PROBLEMATIC OUTING BY THE COLORADO QUARTET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A certain inconsistency marked the three-part program by the Colorado Quartet 
on Monday at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps some of the effects intended by violinists Julie Rosenfeld and Deborah 
Redding, violist Francesca Martin Silos and cellist Diane Chaplin simply 
evaporated into the open air and the white noise of the nearby freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the eerie introduction to Beethoven's Third "Razumovsky" Quartet 
(Opus 59, No. 3) unfolded in a way only half-heard from about a third of the 
way back from the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 But that wasn't the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The playing in Haydn's Quartet in G, Opus 54, No. 1, which had opened the 
program, had been sufficiently robust, sunny and lively enough to carry. It 
also had been infused with a youthful vigor that didn't prevent precise, 
intelligent ensemble values. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance of Smetana's Quartet No. 1 ("From My Life"), which closed the 
program, projected clear, sympathetic programmatic intentions, even if it 
didn't plumb the depths and did include a woozy trio that was a bit overdone. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the problem with the Beethoven was conceptual. 
</P>
<P>
 The interpretation shifted between the impetuous and the unassertive, the 
strongly articulated and the pressureless. The players found a new energy and 
drama in the fugal final movement, but until then the overall shape and 
structure had remained amorphous. The playing was fine. The ideas didn't jell.

DODGER BULLPEN GETS NO RESCUE THIS TIME, 7-4; BASEBALL: AFTER GETTING OFF THE 
HOOK MONDAY NIGHT, L.A. LOSES TO THE METS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no need to wonder what was going through Manager Tom Lasorda's mind 
Tuesday night as he watched his bullpen blow another lead. Nineteen times this 
season he has endured it, and it is clear the frustration is reaching epic 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, ahead by 4-2, gave up five runs in the eighth inning and lost, 
7-4, to the New York Mets, who blew through three relievers on their way to 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost in the loss was another solid performance by Tim Wallach, who went four 
for five, increasing his batting average to .452 during his eight-game hitting 
streak. Also overshadowed was a two-run home run by Delino DeShields, his first 
as a Dodger. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only thing the Dodgers didn't lose was any of their three-game lead 
in the National League West. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys are playing hard, guys are trying, but the only way you get out of this 
is by fighting and scratching and doing anything you can to get a win, not 
pointing out what guys are doing wrong," said Wallach, who beat out three 
infield hits. "If you give up, you might as well go home." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda went home, leaving the clubhouse about as early as anyone can 
remember, but not because he has given up. There simply isn't much he can do. 
His bullpen has blown 19 save opportunities, saving only 17 games -- the fewest 
in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 After Monday night's debacle, when Todd Worrell blew a three-run lead in the 
ninth inning but the Dodgers came back to win in the 10th, Lasorda was upset. 
Nobody said as much, but it was clear that Jim Gott, who recently returned from 
the disabled list, had suddenly become the leading candidate to take Worrell's 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gott (5-3) relieved started Kevin Gross to pitch the eighth inning 
Tuesday night, the stakes were clear -- do well, and you might become the 
closer. But Gott faltered, giving up three runs, then Omar Daal and Roger 
McDowell each gave up another one.  
</P>
<P>
 "So much has been made of the the failure of the conglomerate group of the six 
or seven ofus that are down there, we are aware of it," McDowell said. "The 
only way you can come outof it is to go out and be successful. It seems like, 
up to this point, things haven't gone to the successful side on the whole. 
That's something you want to stop somewhere, somehow." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Dodgers' horrendous trip in early June, when the bullpen blew three 
games, its fortunes appeared to be turning around. Worrell had five consecutive 
saves, and the addition of Ismael Valdes was also successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "The turnaround was basically using the one guy, which was Todd," said 
McDowell, who has made three appearances this month. "What we have to do is 
collectively turn it around. . . . Sometimes it makes it difficult to be 
effective (when you don't pitch often), but it really doesn't matter. If you 
take advantage of the opportunity and are successful, then you get more 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have people down there who have had success in the past and can be 
successful again." 
</P>
<P>
 That former success is what Dodger executive Fred Claire has been counting on, 
and beforeTuesday's game, he made it clear that he still believes in the 
bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't that many pitchers who have much better stuff than a Jim Gott or 
a Todd Worrell," Claire said. 
</P>
<P>
 Claire once again denied trade rumors, saying that trading for a premium 
closer, such as the Chicago Cubs' Randy Myers, would mean giving up a couple of 
top prospects. Division race or not, he said he refuses to budge with young 
premium players. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he would feel about Gott becoming the closer, he declined to give 
Worrell a vote of confidence, instead deferring to Lasorda and pitching coach 
Ron Perranoski, saying they determine the roles, he simply gives them the 11 
pitchers to work with. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody has to remind Lasorda of that.

ADDED INTRIGUE; AFTER ALBERT BELLE IS CAUGHT WITH CORKED BAT, INDIANS POSE 
QUESTION: HOW DID THE WHITE SOX KNOW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having confessed to a clumsy break-in at the umpires' dressing room in 
Chicago, the Cleveland Indians are wondering whether the White Sox might have 
been poking around where they didn't belong too. 
</P>
<P>
 The American League, at the insistence of White Sox manager Gene Lamont, 
caught Cleveland slugger Albert Belle using a corked bat during a weekend 
series at Comiskey Park, and some members of the Indians now are curious: 
</P>
<P>
 How did the White Sox know? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the White Sox were trespassing in our locker room," Cleveland pitcher 
Dennis Martinez said. "Since it's their home park, there's nothing to stop them 
when we're not there. It just seemed too obvious." 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox on Friday night demanded that umpire Dave Phillips inspect the 
bat used by Belle, who one night earlier had hit a long home run. By rule, a 
manager may request an examination of one opponent's bat per game. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Phillips initially saw nothing improper about the bat, it was 
confiscated and locked n the umpires' dressing room for later examination. But 
someone broke in during the game, dropping down through the ceiling tiles, and 
switched the bat with another. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians eventually returned the original bat and blamed the switch on an 
overzealous member of their organization, who has not been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 When the American League finally examined the bat Monday, using X-rays and 
then sawing it open, cork was found inside. Corking, which is not permitted, 
can make a bat lighter, easier to swing and more resilient. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle was suspended for 10 days but has appealed the ruling. He will remain in 
Cleveland's lineup until AL president Bobby Brown hears the appeal July 29 in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamont was a bit vague about why he decided to have the bat inspected, saying 
that he had "heard some things" and that the White Sox staff had noticed that 
Belle was hitting a lot of balls hard to right field. 
</P>
<P>
 Indians manager Mike Hargrove did not accuse the White Sox of snooping but 
hinted he might have some questions about how they found out. Chicago and 
Cleveland are battling for first place in the AL Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little curious, yeah," Hargrove said. "Beyond that, I don't want to 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gene was just doing his job. Put in the same situation, if we had suspicions, 
we'd do the same thing. We did it with (Chicago pitcher) Dennis Cook. We 
suspected him of putting pine tar on the ball to give himself a better grip. We 
had it checked, and it turned out that he didn't. There was no vindictiveness 
in it, no revenge in it. It was just part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Hargrove would not speculate on how widespread the use of corked bats might be 
in baseball. He said he did not know Belle used a corked bat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could sit here and throw out accusations, and that's all they'd be," 
Hargrove said. "I don't have any facts to back anything up." 
</P>
<P>
 The last player disciplined for using a corked bat was Houston's Billy 
Hatcher, suspended for 10 days in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle has denied using a corked bat, and his agent, Arn Tellem, issued a 
statement saying the accusation was "no more than a well-timed charge concocted 
by the White Sox in the heatof a pennant race with Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident did nothing to diminish Cleveland fans' appreciation for Belle, 
who has hit 26 home runs and driven in 78 runs. They applauded loudly, many of 
them standing, when he came to bat at Cleveland's Jacobs Field on Monday night 
for the first time since the infamous bat was discovered.

ANALYSIS; IN THESE DOG DAYS FOR METS, MEMORIES OF 1969 ARE FLOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the time, the civic monument was not an empty domed stadium but the world's 
largest drug store. That was entirely appropriate to the age of the population, 
which interrupted its schedule of shuffleboard games to attend spring training 
games. Long after he retired as New York Mets manager, Casey Stengel remained a 
matinee idol in St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a bench outside the one-story clubhouse at Huggins-Stengel Field 
where the Old Man would take the sun and talk baseball with anyone who happened 
to say hello. At the end of the day's activities, he would be at the bar in the 
team's hospitality suite at the Colonial Inn, a two-story motel. It was March, 
1969, the best spring of my working life. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it would have been the same with any major-league team. After all, 
this was my first beat, my first full-time assignment for this newspaper. It 
was exciting even if the Mets didn't look like much, a ninth-place team with 
the nucleus of a solid rotation and little else. But what they appeared to lack 
in talent, they compensated with personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Tug McGraw introduced himself during an intra-squad game on that picturesque 
field, with a pond out beyond the center-field fence. He jogged off the mound 
one day, built up a head of steam and let out a blood-curdling scream as he 
leapfrogged a bench on which were seated members of the press corps. Surveying 
the scene of scattered reporters, notebooks and pens, he said, "Hi, guys," or 
words to that effect. 
</P>
<P>
 In such an informal setting, even tight-lipped manager Gil Hodges was relaxed. 
He enjoyed hitting fungoes to the outfielders and every once in a while would 
pop one into the palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Mets stayed on the beach, especially in the community of 
Pass-A-Grille where Nolan Ryan recruited writers to hit with his wife, Ruth, on 
the municipal tennis court. She had been a high-school doubles champion in 
Texas. The promising but erratic right-hander didn't dare challenge her for 
fear of hurting his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges walked in the mornings that spring to strengthen his heart, and several 
of the players met in the evenings to fish. But there was no sense of what was 
to come, the great drama that was to unfold. There were several trade rumors, 
one of them involving Richie Allen, but nothing came of them. The team started 
the season, its eighth, without a legitimate cleanup hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years after the '69 Mets became a metaphor for hope, they gathered 
for a reunion at Shea Stadium Sunday. Not only were they the first champions in 
the history of the franchise but they were the most surprising and the most 
beloved. "They are our 'Boys of Summer,' " announcer Bob Murphy said privately 
before introducing members of the team over the public-address system. 
</P>
<P>
 As ever, McGraw was the most ebullient. Not only did he throw hard for an 
inning and rap his glove on his thigh as he walked across the foul line but he 
proclaimed that team a national treasure. "If the Cubs had won," he decided, 
"it would have been good for Chicago. If the Braves had won, it would have been 
good for Atlanta. If the Orioles had won, it would have been good for 
Baltimore. But when we won, it was good for the country." 
</P>
<P>
 America's Team? Well, the Mets' rise to .500, a division title, a National 
League pennant and a world championship in one season was an indication that 
anything was possible. Or at least, as Ron Swoboda noted, that nothing was 
impossible. Still, he said, it was a humbling experience to reach the moon at 
the age of 25, or thereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seaver went on (to the Hall of Fame),"he said. "Ryan went on (to compile a 
Hall of Fame record). McGraw went on (to a championship in Philadelphia). But 
for most of us, that was our defining moment." 
</P>
<P>
 One worthy of a celebration a quarter-century after the fact. Seaver did not 
attend yesterday's old-timers game between the Mets and a team of former 
opponents, sponsored by the Upper Deck card company, but there were plenty of 
familiar faces and a very familiar ending. 
</P>
<P>
 The final score Sunday was 1-0 in favor of the home team. The Mets played 14 
games that ended 1-0 during the 1969 season, winning nine. Two occured on a 
Friday evening in Pittsburgh in what may have been the most remarkable 
development of the season. The starting pitcher drove in the winning run in 
each game of the twinight doubleheader at Forbes Field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to," said Don Cardwell, who won the second game with help from McGraw 
after Jerry Koosman posted a shutout in the opener. Indeed, they did. Cleon 
Jones was injured and Art Shamsky was observing Yom Kippur. The Mets' lineup 
was a patchwork affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardwell took pride in his hitting. Koosman was less formidable. But the sweep 
almost was denied in the bottom of the ninth when Agee ventured far into 
darkened centerfield (the Pirates having given up replacing burned-out bulbs at 
a ballpark ready for demolition) to catch a Willie Stargell blast. "About 440 
feet," Koosman estimated yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 Agee noted that night that when he turned toward the dugout with the ball, all 
the players looked very small. "I should give him meal money," McGraw decided, 
"because I sent him on a road trip." 
</P>
<P>
 They had so much fun winning. Newsday didn't have a Sunday edition at the 
time, but I attended the Saturday afternoon game just the same because the Mets 
were so entertaining. Sure enough, Swoboda hit a grand-slam home run off Chuck 
Hartenstein, rallying the club to a 5-2 victory. Two nights later, in St. 
Louis, he drove in all four Mets runs with a pair of homers against Steve 
Carlton, who struck out 19 en route to a 4-3 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We clinched all three (championships) here -- the division, the pennant and 
the World Series," Swoboda recalled. "The first time we sprayed all the good 
imported champagne around the clubhouse and we had nothing left to drink beside 
the New York State stuff. By the World Series, we were reading the labels." 
</P>
<P>
 Who says baseball isn't educational? The Mets recorded a champagne-impaired 
album that did not earn a Grammy. Some of them got up the nerve to follow with 
live performances on "Ed Sullivan" and in Las Vegas. Swoboda fulfilled a 
commitment to the USO and joined a group headed to Vietnam. He said he still 
hears from soldiers he met there, people who say the visit by a member of the 
'69 Mets meant a lot to them. "That's worth something," he said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a very good year. It still is.

CLEMENS CAN'T HANDLE THE ANGELS' CURTIS; BASEBALL: CENTER FIELDER HAS ANOTHER 
BIG GAME TO HELP TEAM DEFEAT BOSTON RED SOX, 6-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chad Curtis never has cared much for the glare of the spotlight, which is 
good, because it never has cared much for Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 He was first overlooked when he couldn't get a college scholarship. Then he 
was overlooked when major league baseball made him a 45th-round draft choice. 
And he was overlooked in discussions about the top center fielders in the 
American League. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, guess who's talking now? 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis, shrugging off a bitterly disappointing first half, suddenly has taken 
the Angels and is carrying them, leading them to a 6-4 victory Tuesday night 
over the Boston Red Sox before 20,335 fans at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the fact that they were facing Roger Clemens, who has punished the 
Angels like no other team, defeating them 20 times in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis treated him as if he were simply a hard-throwing batting practice 
pitcher, hitting a two-run home run in the fifth inning, a run-scoring single 
in the seventh, and drawing two walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis, who ended the first half batting .249 with seven homers and 34 RBIs, 
has become the Red Sox's worst enemy. He has reached base eight consecutive 
times, going six for six with four runs, a double, three homers, six runs 
batted in, and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't try to explain it," Curtis said. "I just want it continue. I know I 
can play a lot better than I did in the first half, and I hope to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of time left, and by no means are we out of this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (41-54), who have defeated the Red Sox four consecutive games for 
the first time since 1991, moved to within five games of the division-leading 
Texas Rangers in the American League West. Perhaps most important, they finally 
proved to themselves that they can beat Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens (8-5) has dominated the Angels. He was 2-0 with a 0.60 earned-run 
average against them this season, and was 4-1 with a 1.38 ERA against the 
Angels in his last six starts at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 This night was different. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in their four matchups, Angel starter Mark Langston was the 
dominant pitcher. Langston yielded four hits and three earned runs in seven 
innings, defeating Clemens for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels produced seven hits and five runs (four earned) in 6 2/3 innings 
off Clemens. It was the most runs the Angels have scored off Clemens since May 
26, 1989, but the victory was preserved in the eighth inning by rookie right 
fielder Jim Edmonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 5-3, in the eighth, the Red Sox came back with a leadoff homer by 
Andre Dawson against reliever Mark Leiter. Tom Brunansky struck out. But Wes 
Chamberlain, who homered in the second inning to extend the Angels' club-record 
streak of 12 games in which they have yielded a home run, followed with a 
double into the right field corner. 
</P>
<P>
 When Red Sox Manager Butch Hobson went to his bench to summon left-handed 
pinch-hitter Scott Cooper, Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann countered with 
left-hander Bob Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson struck out Cooper for the second out, and with right-handed catcher 
Damon Berryhill coming to the plate, Lachemann decided to leave Patterson in 
the game rather than summon closer Joe Grahe. After all, Berryhill had a career 
.167 batting average against Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, much to Lachemann's chagrin, he watched Berryhill slap a hard single to 
right field. Pinch-runner Lee Tinsley was waved around third, and Edmonds came 
up throwing. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't even close. Edmonds' throw to catcher Greg Myers was perfect, and 
Myers stood waiting with the ball and tagged Tinsley out at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, making sure Grahe's job would be easier, picked up another run in 
the eighth off reliever Steve Farr. Rex Hudler led off with a walk, was 
sacrificed to second by Myers, and scored on J.T. Snow's single to right. 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his 13th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Chili Davis, who has struck out more times against Clemens than anyone in 
baseball, was the first to make his teammates believers that Clemens is a mere 
mortal. 
</P>
<P>
 He took a 3-and-1 fastball and sent it over the center field fence for a 
two-run homer in the fourth inning, giving the Angels a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Putting us ahead was the key," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis, who came into the game with a career .192 batting average against 
Clemens, took notice and followed suit, hitting a two-run homer in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like that, the Angels had scored more runs off Clemens in five innings 
than they had in any game in five years.

 For the last six weeks, baseball legend Ted Williams and his 8-year-old 
Dalmatian, Slugger, have been spending their time battling for one another's 
health in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I've become somewhat disabled, Slugger has been more protective," said 
Williams, who uses a cane to get around since suffering a stroke in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 76, has been tending to Slugger, who has been undergoing treatments 
for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is I hope I die before he does," Williams said.

RAIDERS SIGN FREDRICKSON, CUT TOWNSEND; PRO FOOTBALL: VETERAN DEFENSIVE END IS 
RELEASED TO MAKE ROOM UNDER SALARY CAP FOR TOP DRAFT PICK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders signed first-round draft choice Rob Fredrickson on Tuesday and the 
linebacker went right to the practice field. 
</P>
<P>
 To make room for Fredrickson under the NFL salary cap, the Raiders released 
defensive end Greg Townsend, an 11-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson, the 22nd pick in the draft, was the last of the Raiders' six 
draft picks to come to terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Terms were not disclosed, but Fredrickson said he signed for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson played outside linebacker at Michigan State, but will work at 
middle linebacker with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been chomping at the bit waiting to get here," said Fredrickson, who sat 
out eight days of training camp while his contract was settled. "It's great to 
finally make it in. I'm glad things did not drag out any longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson spent the last week at the Redondo Beach home of his agent, Bruce 
Allen, while the contract was negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating because all football players want to do is play football," 
he said. "I didn't want to get too involved in the negotiations, other than to 
stay involved with where we were at." 
</P>
<P>
 Raider Coach Art Shell said he expected Fredrickson to immediately work toward 
having an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you take a guy in the first round, you hope that some time in his first 
year, he can make a contribution," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for moving to middle linebacker, Frederickson shouldn't have a problem, 
Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very intelligent and he's a good athlete and he started working at that 
position in the mini-camps (in May)," Shell said. "We know he can run and he 
can cover backs and tight ends." 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson will line up behind second-year man Greg Biekert, who inherited 
the starting middle linebacker spot when Joe Kelly left as a free agent and 
signed with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 The release of Townsend, 33, came as no surprise since the Raiders asked him 
not to report to training camp with the other veterans last Friday. The team 
attempted to trade Townsend and his $1.5-million salary before deciding they 
needed to release him to get Fredrickson into camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was time for Greg to move on and time for us to move on," Shell said. 
"Greg had a great career here and he was one of the best pass rushers I've ever 
seen." 
</P>
<P>
 The signing of Fredrickson and the release of Townsend means the Raiders have 
all of their players under contract and in training camp.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here it is July already and there isn't a single quarterback controversy in 
L.A.. . . . Amazing. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hostetler seems capable of leading the Raiders to the Super Bowl, Chris 
Miller should give the Rams a new and improved look, Rob Johnson of USC is an 
All-American candidate and Wayne Cook of UCLA is expected to get the ball into 
J.J. Stokes' hands 80 or 90 times this season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Misfortune continues to plague the Super Bowl IV champion Kansas City Chiefs. 
Jerry Mays and Buck Buchanan died of cancer -- Mays on Sunday -- and Jim Tyrer 
committed suicide. . . . How big are the Cowboys in Dallas? A television 
station interrupted programming to report that Emmitt Smith had been injured 
when the cart in which he was a passenger ran into unofficial mascot "Crazy 
Ray" Jones. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to Johnnie Morton, the Detroit Lion rookie wide receiver who will 
make donations to inner-city youth programs in L.A. and Detroit and the 
Pediatric AIDS Foundation, and endow a scholarship at USC. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA Committee on Competitive Safeguards and Medical Aspects of Sports has 
recommended that spring football practice be eliminated or reduced drastically. 
A study showed that injuries are more prevalent during spring than season 
practices. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers would be in position to deal a future first-round pick for a 
relief pitcher. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When "The Mickey Mantle Story" is made, Dennis Quaid has got to play the lead. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Only in boxing: Dan Goossen, who is vice president of Bob Arum's Top Rank 
Inc., attended a news conference conducted by Don King on Tuesday. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Goossen also happens to manage Gabriel Ruelas, who will challenge World Boxing 
Council super-featherweight champion James Leija on a King-promoted card Sept. 
17 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas-Leija and Felix Trinidad-Yory Boy Campas figure to be a lot better 
fights than the main event, the rematch between fading Julio Cesar Chavez and 
washed-up Meldrick Taylor. . . . Betting on pregnant horses this meeting at 
Hollywood Park would have been profitable.Nine mares in foal have won five 
races and finished second once. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pat Valenzuela, who ended his slump with seven victories last week, is being 
more careful about his weight. Reportedly, he had ballooned to 122. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It's funny how Mike Keenan found work in St. Louis so quickly after bolting 
the New York Rangers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tay Brown, who died Saturday at 82, was the best junior college football coach 
at a time when JC football was very popular in Southern California. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In 1948, his Compton College team, led by future Hall of Fame running back 
Hugh McElhenny, beat Pasadena before a large crowd at the Rose Bowl. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Fastest woman in the world is probably Irina Privalova of Russia, who is 
unbeaten in the sprints this year and recently defeated Gwen Torrence in the 
100 and 200 meters. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pole vaulter Scott Slover and discus throwers Scott McPherren and Suzy Powell, 
incoming UCLA freshmen, and high jumper Amy Acuff and 400-meter runner Cicely 
Scott, both sophomores, will compete in the world junior track and field 
championships starting today in Lisbon. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Major League Soccer has a chance to succeed only if ticket prices are 
realistic. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Promoters should try to attract families that can't afford to attend NFL, NHL 
or NBA games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Baggio is getting a bad rap. Remember, Italy was trailing Brazil in 
the penalty kick shootout before he missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State's trade with Seattle should improve the Warriors. They got a 
player for the present, Ricky Pierce, and another for the future, Carlos 
Rogers, and Sarunas Marciulionis was expendable. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the John R. Wooden Classic that pairs UCLA-Kentucky and 
Kansas-Massachusetts Dec. 3 at Anaheim Arena go on sale Saturday and are the 
most expensive ever for a single-day college basketball event in Southern 
California -- $75, $49, $35 and $22. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A great success story is that of Mitchell Butler, an outstanding young man 
from UCLA who just signed a $2.2-million, four-year contract with the 
Washington Bullets a year after going undrafted by the NBA.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: THE TUNA ARE THERE, BUT THEY ARE PLAYING HARD TO 
GET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are so many tuna swimming around south of the border that San Diego 
skippers are scratching their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, the skippers are more confused than amazed. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite ideal conditions all the way up the Baja California coast, the fish 
have chosen to remain in two primary areas, between 180 and 330 miles southwest 
of Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the dozens of boats that rely on overnight fishing trips -- with a 
maximum range of about 100 miles -- are stuck at the docks with no customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller fleet of multi-day boats has had no trouble finding schools of 
yellowfin and the larger bluefin. But the bluefin have, for the most part, been 
doing a lot of teasing and little biting, breezing beneath the boats but not 
taking any bait. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have never in my life seen as many fish as I have in the last week that do 
not want to bite," said Frank LoPreste, 50, of LoPreste-Dunn Sportfishing.  
</P>
<P>
 There have been some exceptions. On the Vagabond, 25 passengers combined for 
13 bluefin -- 12 of which weighed more than 100 pounds -- on a trip that ended 
Sunday. The Polaris Supreme reported 12 bluefin on Monday on a trip still in 
progress.  
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that the yellowfin have begun to bite in a big way. Included 
in the Polaris Supreme's Monday count were 360 yellowfin averaging about 15 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The best news for landing operators, however, would be if the fish moved north 
about 100 miles. Last year at this time, the overnight fleet was knee-deep in 
tuna. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's lots and lots of bait and blue water," LoPreste said. "The table is 
set and we're just waiting for the company to show." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The yellowtail bite at San Clemente Island remains the best bet for exotics 
locally. The popular jacks are biting for anyone who has squid and access to 
San Clemente Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blackjack had one of the better bites of the week on Tuesday. Skipper Gary 
Norby radioed Redondo Sportfishing at 11 a.m. after his 14 anglers had boated 
50 fish averaging 12 to 15 pounds. They finished with 78 yellowtail and four 
white sea bass. 
</P>
<P>
 Squid are reportedly in good supply at Santa Barbara Island, so the Channel 
Islands figure to be a busy place for a while. 
</P>

<P>
 Marine biologists call it "the Stingray Surf Shuffle." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not as much a dance as it is a prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 An unusually high number of stingrays have moved into the shallows this 
summer, and the rays are not partial to being stepped on. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you step on one, it will get you," says Chuck Valle, a DFG biologist based 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The stingray shuffle, basically plowing the sand with both feet while wading, 
is the best way to avoid being stung, Valle says. It might seem ridiculous, but 
it beats being drilled in the ankle by a poisonous barb and suffering for a 
couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds have already been stung, including 20 in one day this month at Seal 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Valle says stingrays enter warm, shallow water to mate. Of four species found 
on the Southern California coast, the most common is the round stingray, 
measuring only about 20 inches across but with a serrated barb up to two inches 
in length. 
</P>
<P>
 The fish cover themselves with sand and aren't aggressive, feeding on shrimp, 
crabs and clams, using their barbed tail only as a means of defense. "These 
fish aren't purposely swimming through the water trying to find people to 
sting," Valle says.  
</P>
<P>
 Briefly 
</P>
<P>
 BAJA FISHING -- Cabo San Lucas, San Jose del Cabo and the East Cape are 
reporting excellent fishing. Striped marlin remain the prevalent catch off 
Cabo, but the first two black marlins of the season, one a 330-pounder, were 
caught in the last week. Blue marlin are showing at the scales at an average of 
three or four a day and sailfish are abundant. Two boats in the Gaviota fleet 
reported three species of billfish in one day. Dorado and tuna to 50 pounds are 
there in good numbers. Wahoo are showing in better numbers at the scales at San 
Jose beaches, but dorado are the main offshore taker, along with striped marlin 
and an occasional blue. Inshore, huge cabrilla, amberjack and roosterfish have 
been challenging the light-tackle anglers.  
</P>
<P>
 At the East Cape, panga fishermen are catching mostly dorado. Cruiser 
fishermen are traveling north and finding stripers, blues and sailfish. The 
fishing is hot at times. The weather is hot, too, averaging 100 degrees during 
the day. Farther north, off Loreto, the dorado fishing is so good that 
fisheries officials are paying regular visits to enforce the three-fish limit. 
</P>

FISHING REPORT: FROLICKING BY BITE OF THE MOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A warm summer night on a boat under a full moon might be romantic for some.But 
those planning trips to three Orange County lakes on Saturday have their hearts 
set on a date with ugly fish with whiskers.  
</P>
<P>
 It's catfish season and Irvine, Corona and Santa Ana River lakes will 
celebrate the full moon by re-opening from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. Late nights are 
prime time for catfish. 
</P>
<P>
 Limits of channel catfish at all three lakes are common, with Irvine having 
the biggest fish. Alvin Kinberg of Bellflower pulled in the biggest of the 
week, a 43-pound 1-ounce lunker that he weighed and released.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; PALACIOS' ONE-HITTER SILENCES ASTROS, 10-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vicente Palacios pitched a one-hitter, giving up only a single in the third 
inning by Andujar Cedeno, and the St. Louis Cardinals routed the Houston 
Astros, 10-0, Tuesday night at Houston for their first victory since the 
All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals, who tied a National League record by blowing an 11-run lead in 
a 15-12 loss Monday night, had no trouble holding off Houston this time. St. 
Louis had lost five in a row and eight of 10 games, and was the only team not 
to win since the All-Star game last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios (2-7) retired the final 21 after Cedeno's leadoff single in the 
third. He tied a career-high with eight strikeouts and walked one in his second 
career shutout. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two runners reached base against Palacios, pitching on his 31st birthday. 
He won for the first time in his last nine starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Whiten had three hits, including a homer and a double, drove in three 
runs and scored three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Kile (6-5) pitched 4 1/3 innings, giving up eight runs on eight hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 6, Colorado 1 -- Rookie Steve Trachsel remained unbeaten on the road 
this season, pitching the Cubs past the Rockies, 6-1, in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Trachsel (9-6) is 8-0 away from Wrigley Field, including two victories at Mile 
High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave up one run in eight innings, striking out five and walking one. 
</P>
<P>
 Sammy Sosa singled home a run in the first inning, then led off the fourth 
with a 428-foot homer against David Nied (9-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 13, Atlanta 10 -- The Pirates blew a five-run lead, then rallied 
for a five-run seventh inning keyed by Jay Bell's three-run double to beat the 
Braves at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Atlanta errors led to three runs and the Braves' bullpen was roughed up 
for seven runs in four innings for their eighth loss to Pittsburgh in 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Midre Cummings was three for five with two doubles and two runs batted in and 
Lance Parrish homered and doubled as Pittsburgh ended a three-game losing 
streak and Atlanta's four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-hitter Bill Pecota's two-run pinch-double capped Atlanta's six-run sixth 
inning against starter Jon Lieber and three relievers, but the Braves' bullpen 
couldn't hold the 9-8 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 13, Florida 5 -- Ed Taubensee's bases-loaded single keyed a six-run 
first inning against Mark Gardner that led the Reds over the slumping Marlins 
at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Division leaders had 18 hits as they climbed to a season-best 19 
games over .500 (56-37). John Smiley (10-9) gave up seven hits in 6 1/3 
innings, including Gary Sheffield's 20th homer, to send the Marlins to their 
fifth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner (3-3) has beaten every National League team except the Reds, who 
batted around in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 5, San Francisco 2 -- Danny Jackson pitched eight strong innings 
and the Phillies ended the Giants' nine-game winning streak, at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants had been 9-0 since Darryl Strawberry joined them. But Strawberry, 
who left Monday night's game in the second inning because of a sore left 
hamstring, went hitless in four at-bats and struck out twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Incaviglia hit a three-run homer in the sixth for a 4-2 lead, pinning the 
loss on Bud Black. Incaviglia also hit a three-run homer Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 4, San Diego 3 -- The Expos beat the Padres for the 11th time without 
a loss this season, taking advantage of four errors to win at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Luis Lopez made a wild throw that set up two unearned runs. The 
Padres, who lead the majors with 90 errors, made three errors Monday night in a 
9-2 loss at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Expos scored three unearned runs against Andy Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the Padres won at Olympic Stadium was July 19, 1992.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BELLE, INDIANS UNCORK AGAINST THE RANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe there's more to Albert Belle than cork after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a 10-day suspension for using a corked bat, Belle hit one of the 
Indians' five home runs and also tripled Tuesday night as Cleveland defeated 
the Texas Rangers, 12-3, at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Sorrento homered twice and drove in a career-high five runs, and Jim 
Thome and Wayne Kirby also homered for Cleveland, which is 25-5 over its last 
30 games at Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The extra-base hits ended Belle's three-for-18 slump, which began Friday night 
when his bat was seized during a game against the Chicago White Sox. The bat 
was later determined to be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to see Albert hit the ball hard," Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove 
said. "Albert's pretty strong mentally. When he gets to the ballpark, he 
focuses on what he has to do. He is really able to have tunnel vision and not 
have outside things bother him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it bothered him in Chicago, but I think he's been able to get through 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians received a couple of scares in the game. Second baseman Carlos 
Baerga twisted his right ankle on a pickoff attempt in the third inning, and 
starter Charles Nagy fell to the ground in pain after Rusty Greer lined a ball 
off his left knee in the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle's fifth-inning home run, his 27th, was his first since the illegal-bat 
incident. The confiscated bat was removed from the umpires' locked dressing 
room at Comiskey Park during Friday's game but later turned over by the Indians 
to the American League, which determined it had been corked. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 6, New York 2 -- Mark McGwire's three-run homer in the fifth inning 
led the Athletics at Oakland, ending the Yankees' five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The A's, who had dropped four of their previous five games, scored four runs 
in the fifth against Jim Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Hemond hit a leadoff single to left, but second baseman Pat Kelly threw 
the relay wildly back to first base for a two-base error, sending Hemond to 
third. With two outs, Geronimo Berroa hit a run-scoring single for a 4-0 lead, 
and Ruben Sierra walked. 
</P>
<P>
 Yankee pitching coach Billy Connors visited the mound to talk to Abbott as 
McGwire stepped to the plate. The A's slugger hit the first pitch deep into the 
left field bleachers for his eighth homer. 
</P>
<P>
 McGwire had only one hit -- a game-winning homer on July 10 -- in his previous 
21 at-bats. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott has only one victory in his past 10 starts. He will take a 7-7 record 
and 4.32 ERA into his next game and will have to rally to bring helpful numbers 
to the bargaining table when he is a free agent next winter. In his past six 
outings, he is 1-5 with a 5.96 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 10, Detroit 5 -- Julio Franco went four for five and drove in three 
runs, and Alex Fernandez struck out 11 in seven innings to lead the White Sox 
at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The White Sox, who won for the 21st time in 26 games, pounded out 17 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez (9-7) walked four and scattered five hits for his fourth consecutive 
victory. The 11 strikeouts were one shy of his career high. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 4, Kansas City 3 -- Jeff Cirillo hit his second major league home 
run in the 12th inning and scored the winning run on Kevin Seitzer's 
bases-loaded single in the 14th inning to lift the Brewers at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Cirillo was hit by a pitch from Hipolito Pichardo leading off the 14th inning, 
advanced to second on a wild pitch and to third on a sacrifice. 
</P>
<P>
 After consecutive walks to Jose Valentin and Bill Spiers, Seitzer bounced a 
single up the middle off second baseman Jose Lind's glove and into center. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 4, Minnesota 2 -- Paul Molitor tripled in the go-ahead run in the 
eighth inning at Toronto as the Blue Jays handed the Twins their ninth road 
loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Alomar reached on a one-out walk and Molitor knocked out Kevin Tapani 
with a line drive to right-center that scored Alomar and helped the Blue Jays 
to their third consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Carter, who drove in four runs Monday, followed with a run-scoring single 
to right against Carl Willis for his second run batted in of the game and a 4-2 
lead.

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; MONDESI SUFFERS STRAINED RIGHT KNEE

 Raul Mondesi suffered a strained right knee when he jumped to try and catch an 
eventual run-scoring triple by Kevin McReynolds in Tuesday night's game. He 
left the game and said he will rest it for a couple of days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to jump and came down and twisted it," Mondesi said. "I had surgery 
on this knee two years ago. Both knees. I think it would be a good idea to rest 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Orel Hershiser, who has been sidelined since Saturday because of a muscle 
strain in his left side, threw on the side Tuesday for the first time and said 
he was encouraged. "It felt fine, no stiffness," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 He will throw again today before trainers determine when he can throw from the 
mound. If all goes well, the Dodgers hope Hershiser will be able to pitch 
during the San Francisco series, which begins Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the progress I am making right now, I see no reason to think about the 
disabled list," Hershiser said.  
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Martinez, pitching on three days' rest, will face Bret Saberhagen in the 
final game of the series today. Pedro Astacio will pitch Friday's opener in 
Montreal, followed by Tom Candiotti, pitching for the third time in eight days. 
Kevin Gross will pitch Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, test results on Delino DeShields' upper left leg indicated there was 
nothing abnormal. He returned to the starting lineup Tuesday and went one for 
two, scored two runs and had a two-run home run. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first things Ismael Valdes did after Monday night's game was call 
his family in Victoria, Mexico. Valdes, who made his first major league start, 
came out of the game in the second inning because of two blisters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disappointed because I wanted to pitch yesterday to help my teammates 
get one more day of rest," Valdes said. "I called my family because I knew they 
had heard on the radio about me leaving the game and would want to know what 
happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Valdes believes he developed the blisters on his middle finger because he had 
cut his fingernail too short about four days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you cut them too short, the soft tissue can get aggravated in the nail 
area," trainer Charlie Strasser said. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; DECLINE IN ATTENDANCE EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel executives look around Anaheim Stadium each night, wince at the vast 
amount of empty seats, and have now become quite worried. 
</P>
<P>
 They drew only 20,335 fans Tuesday night against the Boston Red Sox, despite 
the pitching matchup of Roger Clemens vs. Mark Langston. They have now gone 
seven consecutive home games without drawing 25,000, and with a total home 
attendance of 1,158,007 this season, they now believe it will be nearly 
impossible to attract 2 million fans this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if everything goes well, and there is no strike, they still project a 
total attendance of only 1.9 million this season, their smallest in a 
non-strike season since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very disappointing," Angel President Richard Brown said. "I think the 
in-park environment and atmosphere is the best we've had here. It's a more 
pleasant ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 "But yet, attendance has dwindled. The only reason I can give is because the 
team is not performing like we hoped, and the fans are not coming out because 
of our record. This team could very well win the division, but it may be that 
no one realizes we won the division. The pending strike is also hurting us. 
Whenever you talk about a pending strike, people almost have a tendency to give 
up on the season. It's like they're thinking, 'Why support the team? What 
difference does it make, there won't be a season anyway.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of the Angels' attendance could be quite painful. The Angels, who 
have the major leagues' fourth-smallest player payroll at $23 million, now are 
anticipating they will lose money, after making a profit last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you make money," Brown said, "you're going to have more money to improve 
the ballclub. But if you lose money -- as it looks like we will -- you're going 
to have less discretionary money to put into the team. It will have to be money 
that comes from the owners' pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong, we're going to do everything humanely possible to improve 
this ballclub, but only under financial parameters that make sense." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to alleviate layoffs during a strike, Brown will inform 
employees to begin taking paid vacations. "We're going to require many of our 
employees to take vacations," Brown said, "and the whole idea is that when 
everybody is done with their vacations, maybe the strike will be over. That's 
our plan, to try to make is as painless as possible." 
</P>
<P>

 Angel designated hitter Chili Davis began Tuesday batting .341, an increase of 
.103 over a year ago. It's the largest increase of anyone in baseball who had 
more than 300 at-bats a year ago. . . . Angel right fielder Tim Salmon sat out 
his second consecutive game because of an aggravated right hip, but was able to 
take batting practice. . . . Angel catcher Andy Allanson had three pins 
inserted in his broken finger during surgery that will sideline him for the 
season. BOB NIGHTENGALE

BOWLING; GOEBEL WINS SECOND PBA TITLE OF YEAR

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bryan Goebel won his second PBA title of the year and the fourth of his career 
Tuesday night when he defeated Steve Hoskins, 247-201, in the championship game 
of the $100,000 Active West Open in Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 Goebel, who entered the finals as the tournament leader for the first time in 
his career, threw the high game of the stepladder in the championship match.He 
earned $14,000 for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was aggressive from the start of this tournament right through the last 
match," Goebel said. "I knew a solid, clean game had a good chance to win and I 
also had a little room for error out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoskins was the one to error early in the title match, missing the 2-pin on a 
spare attempt in the second frame and opening again in the third frame after a 
2-4-10 split. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping to put some pressure on him early in the match, but it turned 
out he put pressure on himself with the two open frames," Goebel said.

<P>
 A Brazilian soccer fan was murdered by his brother-in-law because he praised 
the Italian team during the World Cup final, news agency Estado reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose de Oliveira Lima, 44, was stabbed to death by Raimundo Leadro in a bar in 
the remote Amazon city of Rio Branco after Lima said Italy was playing well by 
denying Brazil a goal, Estado reported Monday.The game ended 0-0 and was won by 
Brazil on penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 In another incident, two students in Rio Branco suffered injuries when they 
were shot as they watched the match in another bar. The women, supporting 
Italy, were shot at by an infuriated boyfriend. In Campinas, a 51-year-old 
woman suffered a heart attack when the match went into extra time and she died 
before reaching hospital.

<P>
 This spring and summer, we have witnessed another trickle of our friends 
plunge into the great, roiling sea of matrimony. 
</P>
<P>
 I love weddings. Almost as much as I dread them. 
</P>
<P>
 Or more precisely: I love attending weddings almost as much as I dread being 
in them. 
</P>
<P>
 I love the way we check our cynicism at the door, the way we believe the 
marriage license is signed in indelible ink, the way that hope and promise -- 
such vaporous concepts -- are distilled into potent, intoxicating kisses at 
ceremony's end. 
</P>
<P>
 But stick me in a wedding as a bridesmaid and I wilt faster than a cut tulip 
in a dry vase under heat lights. I can't take it. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot say why; I can only say when. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, my friend Susan married a tall, handsome and, as it would turn out, 
hugely incompatible guy. As maid of honor, I wore a pale coral dress of silk 
crepe that Susan had found in an antique store and mailed to me balled up in a 
ripped manila envelope. Ah, to be young and carefree. 
</P>
<P>
 And have a waistline. Boy, does that dress look tiny today. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan's parents had offered her an option -- a down payment on a house or a 
wedding fit for a princess. Well, who can begrudge the high cost of plighting 
an especially fervent troth? 
</P>

 Naturally, they took the wedding and spoke their vows in a fancy ceremony at 
the Claremont Hotel in the Berkeley hills. Halfway through, the groom looked at 
me and widened his eyes. "Nervous?" he seemed to be saying. "You'd better 
believe it, sister." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, I began to channel his anxiety. My peripheral vision went hazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking fast -- or what passes for fast when you're dizzy -- I delicately sat 
down on the edge of the riser. Guests looked on, some horrified, some curious, 
some believing they were witnessing a sudden religious conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just me, trying valiantly not to pass out. 
</P>
<P>
 The reception line was a nightmare. People filed past murmuring: 
"Congratulations." "Congratulations." " Are you OK? " 
</P>
<P>
 Or: "Congratulations." "Congratulations." "You find Jesus up there or 
something?"  
</P>
<P>
 Susan was inhumanly gracious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you," she said. "You made my wedding memorable." 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, I was able to provide my brother the same exact memory at his 
wedding. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, my husband and I returned to the site of our wedding. We had 
taken our vows in the yard of a historic Ventura County adobe, under the gaze 
of an owl sitting in a bountiful eucalyptus tree. 
</P>
<P>
 I was moved to tears wandering the premises, recalling the sunny, breezy day 
in which we promised to . . . well, I am not exactly sure what we promised to 
do since we seem to have misplaced our copy of the wedding vows. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband looked rather emotional, too, and I remember thinking how lovely it 
was that he was so touched to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't it amazing," I started to say, before he looked at me with an almost 
pained expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow," I thought, "this guy is a sentimental fool." 
</P>
<P>
 "Man!" he said. "I gotta take a leak!" 
</P>
<P>
 You talk about your great roiling sea of matrimony. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In a season stained by stories about the horrible ways in which spouses 
inflict pain upon each other, it's tempting to see marriage as a new car, a 
thing that starts out shiny and perfect and inevitably rusts right through 
(although the decay often hides under a well-polished exterior). 
</P>
<P>
 My husband and I, soldered together for nearly a dozen years now, always get 
squishy at weddings. Often, we ice our good vibes with a big fight on the way 
home. The cake of love, my friends, is a many-layered thing. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the benefits of being married for a while is the ever-expanding view 
you get of the emotional landscape. Maybe the passion cools a bit (or maybe it 
doesn't) and maybe after a while the fights are less cataclysmic too. But what 
you learn with the passing of every still-married year is that each peak is 
followed by a valley, and every valley gives way to a higher place. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching a couple marry can do wonders to counteract the prevailing ill winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Weddings can renew your faith, and remind you -- as you sit with your own 
spouse, if you have one -- that marriage is not a shiny car waiting to be 
assaulted by the elements.  
</P>
<P>
 It is a fine and demanding instrument that needs constant burnishing and 
tuning, and which -- the occasional broken string notwithstanding -- rewards 
with incomparable music. 
</P>
<P>
 My friend Susan married again this spring, living proof you can learn from 
your mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 To this union, she brought a certain maturity, a certain understanding of the 
complexities of marriage and -- need I spell it out? -- a new maid of honor.

HOUSE REJECTS BID TO DECLASSIFY U.S. SPYING BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The House rejected an attempt Tuesday to make the government disclose how much 
it spends on spying. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 221-194 vote, the House defeated an amendment to the 1995 intelligence 
spending bill that would declassify the aggregate budget figure, but not 
amounts spent on specific programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people understand there are things that have to be kept secret," said 
Rep. Larry Combest of Texas, the ranking Republican on the House Select 
Committee on Intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the amendment argued that disclosure of the budgets for the CIA, 
Defense Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and related agencies 
would aid America's enemies and contribute to what Combest called a "dangerous 
slope" toward revealing spending on specific programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the amendment's co-sponsor, Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.), said continuing to 
classify the figure -- widely reported to be about $28 billion -- "only deepens 
the suspicion that secrecy is necessary to protect a budget that otherwise 
cannot be defended."

DANA PARSONS: BOTHERED BY TOUCHY-FEELY CARDS? WE'RE THERE FOR YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 While browsing a greeting card shop the other day, I saw headings like "Your 
Diet Is Going Well" and "You've Quit Smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 These cards were in the "Congratulations" section reserved once upon a time 
for such mundane acts as having a baby or being promoted. Obviously, some 
sharp-eyed greeting-card executive who's seen a lot of Oprah shows realized 
those achievements only begin to tap the potential in the self-actualization 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Before talk shows expanded our consciousness, life's milestones were somewhat 
limited: a birthday, high school graduation, getting married, having a baby. 
Maybe it's more accurate to say that was the only stuff we knew about. Remember 
when people actually kept other personal endeavors to themselves? 
</P>
<P>
 No longer. "Mind your own business" has been replaced by "May I share?" as the 
operative expression of the day. We've convinced ourselves we can't be truly 
evolved unless we inform someone else of our achievements. It only follows 
that, once informed, our friends will want to acknowledge these great moments 
in our lives by sending a card. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of nurturing each other. Hallmark must be loving it, because in 
this new era, the greeting-card possibilities are endless: 
</P>
<P>
 "You Secured a Point-Free Loan." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your Lawn Looks Marvelous." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're Saying Fewer Stupid Things Lately." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're Down to a Six-Pack a Day." 
</P>
<P>
 "That Casserole You Served Was Exquisite." 
</P>
<P>
 "You Finally Got That Wart Removed From Your Big Toe." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your Progress on the Tuba Is Exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 "You Found Your Keys." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your Tummy Tuck Has Made a Difference." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hallmark, the custom of exchanging greeting cards was spurred by 
three developments: the rise of literacy in the 1800s, low postal rates and 
modern ways to print color. Printed valentines became widely popular only after 
1840, followed by Christmas cards a decade later and then Easter and everyday 
cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Lois Hunt, editorial manager for Hallmark Crown cards at company headquarters 
in Kansas City, Mo., said consumer research led to the proliferation of 
"all-occasion" card-sending. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked her why people want to branch out and send more personal cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a lot going on in the world that's changing right now," she 
said. "People have more blended families, they're moving around more so they're 
not staying in as close touch with their families, and friends are becoming 
more important because of that." 
</P>
<P>
 The troubled economy of recent years also has caused shared problems and, in 
general, people are more aware of other people's personal struggles, Hunt said. 
One thing Hallmark writers and editors try to develop are "universal specific" 
cards that can be construed by anyone as a response to their particular 
situation. An example, Hunt said, is the card reading, "I'm There For You." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be interesting to see how far the greeting-card industry can go. Keep 
in mind that card-sending includes more than congratulatory messages. What 
about sympathy cards? They once were limited to deaths, but the new openness 
also makes the condolence field ripe for expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 For example: 
</P>
<P>
 "Word Has It You've Been Ruined Financially." 
</P>
<P>
 "We Just Learned Your Son Was Expelled Again." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Article on Your Arrest Was Overplayed." 
</P>
<P>
 "No One Expected Him to Fleece You." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sorry to Hear About Your Parrot and the Lawn Mower." 
</P>
<P>
 "We Heard You Singing." 
</P>
<P>
 And then, there are the cards that don't fit a specific category. They're 
neither congratulatory nor consoling. That's probably where Hallmark puts their 
most talented writers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Thinking of You," expresses a fine sentiment, but there's lots of room 
for messages with a more personal touch: 
</P>
<P>
 "Incessant Chatter Can Grow Tiresome." 
</P>
<P>
 "You Seem Shorter." 
</P>
<P>
 "In Some Countries, Peeping Tomism Is Nothing to Be Ashamed Of." 
</P>
<P>
 "You Burst Into Tears for Reasons I Can't Fathom." 
</P>
<P>
 "Your Column Strikes Me as an Odd Waste of Time."

ABUSED FOSTER CHILDREN TO GET $1.95 MILLION; SOCIAL SERVICES: COUNTY AGREES TO 
COMPENSATE TWO BOYS WHO WERE BEATEN AND MOLESTED, AND THEIR HALF SISTER, WHO 
WITNESSED THE MALTREATMENT AT A COMPTON HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Attempting to measure the value of the broken bones, bruises, sexual abuse and 
constant hunger suffered by two young boys in a foster home licensed by Los 
Angeles County, the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday agreed without comment to 
settle their lawsuit for $1.95 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report recommending that award, attorneys for the county said a jury 
might decide that the 14 months of abuse endured by the two boys, now 8 and 9, 
while living at a foster home in Compton warranted far more compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, county social workers were not aware that the home's 
operator, Lillie Hinton, was caring for several more children than the six for 
which she was licensed and that some of them were sleeping in a garage. 
</P>
<P>
 The county also acknowledged that it left the two boys there several months 
after being made aware that some of the other children were being abused. 
</P>
<P>
 Although foster homes are privately operated, they are licensed by the 
government and it can be held financially liable for failing to monitor or 
correct dangerous living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, citing similar cases in which the county failed to remove foster 
children from such situations, the state Department of Social Services took 
over the licensing and monitoring of foster homes. At the time, the county's 
caseload per social worker exceeded state standards and the county often failed 
to report to the state cases in which children were beaten, scalded, raped or 
even killed until months later. 
</P>
<P>
 The two boys were taken from their mother soon after they were born addicted 
to the drugs in her system. In October, 1988, they went to live with Hinton, 
joining a half sister, who is now 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The county became aware of the conditions at the Hinton home in the summer of 
1989 and launched an investigation that resulted in six of the children being 
taken away. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two boys granted the award Tuesday were left behind. They were being 
sexually abused by Hinton's son, according to the county's report. When they 
were bathed it was with a garden hose and cold water and, if they squirmed, 
they were hit on the head with the metal end, blows that left permanent scars. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, after more reports of abuse were made to the county, the children 
were taken in December, 1989, to another foster home. Doctors then discovered 
the extent of their injuries. They had suffered fractures of the skull and 
broken arms, legs and feet; their ribs, backs and buttocks were bruised. They 
were malnourished, their stomachs bloated from lack of food. 
</P>
<P>
 No criminal charges were ever filed against Hinton and her son, although her 
foster care license was revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 In the report to the supervisors recommending the payment, Principal Deputy 
County Counsel Robert B. Reagan and Clayton Averbuck, a private attorney who 
worked on the case, said a jury would be "inflamed" by the details of abuse in 
the case and might be "sympathetic to the plaintiffs' ordeal." 
</P>
<P>
 The two boys will split $1.26 million to compensate them for their suffering 
and for the loss of earnings resulting from their injuries as well as for the 
cost of the psychological care they will need. A smaller share will go to the 
half sister because she witnessed the mistreatment. About a third of the money 
will go to the attorney who represented the children. 
</P>
<P>
 All three children are now living with other foster parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Averbuck said the settlement was "at the higher end" of such awards but is not 
the largest amount paid to children mistreated in foster homes. In 1989, the 
county agreed to pay $7 million to a child who had been raped repeatedly as a 
toddler. In 1990, the county agreed to pay $5.5 million to a boy who had been 
abused physically and sexually and reduced to a quadriplegic when he nearly 
drowned at a foster home. 
</P>
<P>
 The county Department of Children's Services agreed with Tuesday's award.

PRODUCER-DIRECTOR GOTTFRIED REINHARDT DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gottfried Reinhardt, producer of several well-known films, biographer of his 
internationally celebrated father, Max, and himself the parent of a 
distinguished jurist, died Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A family spokeswoman said Reinhardt was 81 and died at his Brentwood home of 
pancreatic cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Known to movie fans as the producer of several films, among them "Two-Faced 
Woman," Greta Garbo's last movie, and "Situation Hopeless -- but Not Serious," 
Robert Redford's first, Reinhardt was a legend among industry insiders as one 
of Hollywood's pioneering and most successful hyphenates: 
writer-producer-director. 
</P>
<P>
 His reign in pictures saw the rise and dominance of Louis B. Mayer at 
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where Reinhardt labored throughout the 1930s, and the 
demise of the handful of moguls who, like Mayer, held stars, writers and 
directors with often unrewarding but tightly written contracts and threats of 
banishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in an interview for the Lillian Ross book "Picture," a widely heralded 
1952 account of the making of one of Reinhardt's epics, "The Red Badge of 
Courage," he seemed to lament the passing of the efficacy of the old regime: 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in Hollywood wants to be something he is not. . . . The writers 
want to be directors. The producers want to be writers. The actors want to be 
producers. . . . Everybody is frustrated. Nobody is happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Reinhardt evolved from being a screenwriter of the 1935 film "I Live My Life," 
learning how to direct and produce from such giants as Ernst Lubitsch and 
Walter Wanger, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 He was raised in his father's shadow -- Max Reinhardt was considered Germany's 
most important stage producer and director during the first three decades of 
the century -- and said in a 1982 Times interview that his relocation to the 
United States was "a fluke." 
</P>
<P>
 He had heard about the ascendancy of Adolf Hitler while riding the subway in 
New York on a 1931 vacation. "I never went home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His Jewish father had also emigrated, first to Austria and then to the United 
States, but both men found Broadway mired in the Depression so both eventually 
came to Hollywood. (Gottfried Reinhardt later wrote several Broadway plays, 
among them "Rosalinda" and "Helen Goes to Troy.") 
</P>
<P>
 Max Reinhardt made a film of his famed "A Midsummer Night's Dream" and 
produced a spectacular version of the drama at the Hollywood Bowl while his 
son, who spoke excellent English, found work with Lubitsch. Gottfried Reinhardt 
also helped arrange visas for Thomas Mann and Bertolt Brecht, fellow Germans 
who had been forced to flee Hitler. But cultural differences prevented the two 
writing giants from assimilating into the film community, while Reinhardt 
adapted more easily and found regular work at MGM. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, he served in the U.S. Army Signal Corps making 
documentaries. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1950, when he began work on "Red Badge," Reinhardt had produced "Comrade 
X," "Rage in Heaven" and "Command Decision." Actors in his films included Clark 
Gable, Lana Turner, Alec Guinness, Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 It was on the "Red Badge" set that Reinhardt saw Mayer undermined and 
overruled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Founding Father of MGM had refused to let Reinhardt make the relatively 
high-budget Civil War drama, but Dore Schary went to New York executives and 
had the picture reinstated. Reinhardt recalled the incident as a turning point 
in the decline of Mayer's influence. 
</P>
<P>
 After that Reinhardt left MGM and went to Europe, where he made several German 
and French pictures before returning for Redford's 1965 debut in films. He 
directed at the Salzburg Festival, which was founded by his father, and wrote a 
loving tribute to his father: "The Genius: A Memoir of Max Reinhardt" in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 He also wrote a book published in Germany about German refugees in Hollywood, 
many of whom he had assisted. 
</P>
<P>
 His friendships crossed national boundaries: the British writer and emigre 
Christopher Isherwood; Irving Thalberg, the boy genius of MGM; Chaim Weizmann, 
founding president of Israel; Arturo Toscanini, Albert Einstein and Adlai 
Stevenson. 
</P>
<P>
 And he lived to see his son, Judge Stephen Reinhardt, become one of the most 
outspoken members on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. A major figure in 
Los Angeles Democratic politics for three decades, Stephen Reinhardt became 
known for controversial rulings that often put him at odds with the 
conservative wing of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Reinhardt remembered his father as "one of the very last of a remarkable 
breed (who) combined the best of old European culture with an American spirit 
of freedom and opportunity at a time when Hitler and his fellow Nazis sought to 
eliminate both." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Gottfried Reinhardt's final honors came on his 80th birthday in March, 
1993, when Mayor Tom Bradley presented him with a city proclamation honoring 
his films, his diverse talents and his humanitarianism. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinhardt is also survived by his wife, Silvia, three grandchildren and two 
great-grandchildren. His daughter-in-law is Ramona Ripston, executive director 
of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral services are scheduled for 11 a.m. Thursday at Hillside Memorial Park.

APPOINTMENTS SIGNAL SHAKE-UP BY RIORDAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to jump-start his fledgling Administration, Mayor Richard Riordan 
announced a host of new appointments to city commissions Tuesday in what 
amounted to a significant staffing shake-up. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the new commissioners were named to fill terms that automatically 
expired July 1, but Riordan also juggled the members of some panels that have 
strayed from his philosophies. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Riordan aides downplayed the importance of the shifts -- Riordan adviser 
William Wardlaw called the changes "fine-tuning" -- but others close to the 
mayor said Riordan has been displeased with the decisions of some of the 
volunteer boards and the slow pace that some have taken in implementing his 
business-oriented agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's giving the Administration a new life," said one Riordan confidante. 
"He's looking at people's strengths and weaknesses and making adjustments." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the transfers: Steven J. Silberman is being moved from the Recreation 
and Parks Commission to the lesser-known Board of Pension Commissioners. Frank 
Cardenas, a World Cup executive, will go from the Community Redevelopment 
Agency to a full-time position with the Board of Public Works, replacing Percy 
Duran. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor Commissioner Steven L. Soboroff, president of Big Brothers of Greater 
Los Angeles, will move to the Recreation and Parks Commission. Transportation 
Commission President Sherri Franklin was transferred to the Rent Adjustment 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The only newcomers Riordan announced Tuesday were investment banker Jonathan 
Y. Thomas and health plan administrator Leland Wong, who were both named to the 
Harbor Commission. Riordan reappointed about two dozen commissioners to their 
current posts -- a diverse group that includes a female rabbi, a rocket 
scientist, a librarian and a former military adviser to President George Bush. 
The mayor expects to announce more appointments in the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mayor has had a year now to articulate his goals," said Riordan spokesman 
David Novak. "The commissioners are an important part of that. The mayor is 
fortunate there is such a diverse pool of people to choose from." 
</P>
<P>
 Like all Los Angeles mayors, Riordan derives much of his power from the 
appointments of the part-time commissioners. There are close to 50 commissions 
in all and they oversee everything from police policies to the firing of city 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners wield considerable clout and can set the tone of a mayoral 
administration. In the mid-1980s, when former Mayor Tom Bradley wanted to 
change course, he asked all his commissioners to resign and appointed new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's commission appointments carry with them political implications on 
the 15-member City Council, which must confirm the appointments before they 
become final. 
</P>
<P>
 With such selections, there are inevitably questions about ethnic and racial 
diversity and council members typically push for commissioners who reside in 
their districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment of Wong to the Harbor Commission came after Riordan heard 
criticism that the commission, which deals with many Pacific Rim countries, 
lacked any Asian American members. 
</P>
<P>
 But the appointment irritated Councilman Rudy Svorinich, who supported Wong's 
predecessor, Wilmington neighborhood activist Gertrude Schwab. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are disappointed that the mayor has reneged on his commitment to appoint 
community people from Wilmington and San Pedro to the Harbor Commission," said 
Tom Kruesopon, Svorinich's spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 In making his original commission appointments, a process that stretched on 
for months, Riordan sought to bring in business-minded outsiders who would 
question many of the fundamental assumptions of City Hall. But at the same 
time, he did not want commissioners to take over the jobs of the full-time 
department managers by delving into the nitty-gritty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civil Service Commission, which reviews disciplinary cases, is one body 
that has been accused of micro-managing. It caused concern among Riordan aides 
this spring when it voted to reinstate a gardener who had been fired for doing 
private gardening work during the workday. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan supported the general manager's dismissal of the worker and said he 
intended to speak to commissioners about their proper role in disciplinary 
cases. The commission's decision was set aside by the council. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the commissioners who voted to overrule the firing, attorney Nancy 
Zamora, has been told she will be transferred to another position, although the 
post has not been announced. Although she has not been given a reason, she 
considers the move a step up. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are moving people based on their skills," Zamora said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last year has seen a number of staffing changes in Riordan's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor Jadine Nielsen, who managed Riordan's campaign, resigned early 
on, and Deputy Mayor Al Villalobos followed when questions were raised about 
his private business dealings. A handful of other top staffers, many of them 
holdovers from Riordan's campaign, have also left for new positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The structure of the mayor's office is like the city itself -- dynamic," said 
Deputy Mayor Robin Kramer. "This is natural growth."

NEWS ANALYSIS; WILL RIORDAN HELP OR HINDER TRANSIT NEGOTIATIONS?; AFTER THE DWP 
AND POLICE CONTRACT SETTLEMENTS, SOME FIGURE HE IS A SOFT TOUCH FOR THE BUS 
DRIVERS UNION. BUT OTHERS ARE COUNTING ON THE MAYOR'S DEAL-MAKING SAVVY.

 On one side are angry Metropolitan Transportation Authority bus drivers trying 
to preserve what they've got. On the other side is Los Angeles Mayor Richard 
Riordan, portraying the unionized transit workers as greedy people who earn 
"two to three times" more than the average bus rider. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in a nutshell, is the MTA labor dispute in which a strike was narrowly 
averted over the weekend but may occur Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 The biggest question is whether Riordan is going to strengthen management's 
hand with his shoot-from-the-hip style or weaken it by cutting a creative but 
unfavorable deal with the unions. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan, who as mayor controls four of 13 seats on the MTA board that governs 
Los Angeles County's transit system, helped stop a strike by insinuating 
himself into the dispute last week. However, some MTA board members eye 
Riordan's participation with apprehension. They fear that he will acquiesce to 
union demands if it comes down to the unsavory prospect of a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Riordan brokered a pay raise for unionized Department of Water and 
Power workers that he later said he regretted. That pay hike served as the 
basis for Los Angeles Police Department salary demands that ended only after 
months of acrimony and saber-rattling by bitter officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unions have figured out after the DWP and police negotiations that 
Riordan is a soft touch," said one board member, who, like most associated with 
the transit talks, spoke only on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The labor dispute is the result of an effort by the MTA to take away benefits 
that bus and train drivers earned over the years when their unions and the 
county's old transit agencies, which operated the Pacific Electric railway 
lines, were powerful forces. In more recent decades, that relationship was 
cemented by the friendship of Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past several years, public employee unions have come under 
increased pressure as once-plentiful government coffers dried up because of 
Proposition 13, a pounding recession and changing political priorities. And 
union-friendly Democrat Bradley has been replaced by Riordan, a Republican who 
was elected on a platform of promoting privatization of government services -- 
an anathema to unions.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the MTA and its unions, whose contracts expired June 30, are 
close to an agreement on wages, but disagree over proposed changes in work 
rules and subcontracting. The agency wants to turn over some bus lines to 
private operators in a cost-cutting effort, cut back on drivers' overtime and 
reduce the MTA's contribution to workers' health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Union members insist that contracting out will turn some of their jobs into 
less well-paying private-sector positions. They say their wages, which for the 
most senior bus drivers is $18.45 an hour, are not excessive for the long hours 
and dangers they face, including harassment as well as violence from 
passengers.  
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials say MTA bus drivers are among the highest-paid in the 
nation, but that difference is minimal: In New York, drivers earn up to $17.71 
an hour, but negotiations are under way on a new contract. In Chicago, bus 
drivers earn up to $17.60, but their top hourly wage will rise to $18.65 by the 
end of next year.  
</P>
<P>
 The MTA labor dispute, involving 6,400 drivers, mechanics and clerks and 
potentially affecting more than 1 million passengers, is being played out on an 
increasingly shrill battleground. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, which last week cut bus service and raised fares in an effort to 
erase a $126-million budget deficit, has set aside $35,000 to pay two 
consultants to advise the MTA's public relations staff on how to sell 
management's side. It has also hired a $290-an-hour private labor attorney, 
Gordon Krischer, as the agency's chief negotiator. It has spent $180,000 for 
ads that claim, among other things, that most bus drivers earn more than 
$50,000 a year and $18,000 worth of benefits. Drivers call the ad misleading 
because it does not include the fact that they are often required to work 
10-hour days or longer, leading to heavy overtime pay. 
</P>
<P>
 In this tense environment, Riordan has become a central figure in the 
negotiations.  
</P>
<P>
 "He is the 100-pound gorilla," one political consultant said. "He's a very 
savvy negotiator. He is sometimes a cocktail napkin deal maker, but . . . his 
approach is sometimes far and away better than any methodical, well-organized, 
plotted-out strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 Friction has already arisen between Riordan, who is more accustomed to 
striking deals in corporate boardrooms, and the MTA's chairman, county 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, a low-key, cautious mediator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Riordan wants to be loved. If there's a strike, the public will point a 
finger at us -- we will be the bums," one board member said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan agreed to meet union leaders in an unusual session tentatively set for 
today. Workers were scheduled to walk off their job two days ago, but a union 
leader approached Riordan in the hallway Friday and proposed the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually everything in dispute involves benefits awarded years ago that the 
MTA now wants to take away.  
</P>
<P>
 These include the automatic cost-of-living increases awarded quarterly on top 
of annual pay raises; work rules that allow drivers to collect time and a half, 
even if they do not work a 40-hour week and an employer health benefit 
contribution that is higher for union members than for non-union MTA employees. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Riordan laughed when told that some consider him a soft touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had people criticize me for being too tough," he said. He said he had 
lobbied Gov. Pete Wilson last week not to call a 60-day cooling off period -- a 
move that would have forbidden a strike for two months. If a strike were 
delayed until September, he reasoned, unions would have more leverage because 
the walkout would occur when students return to school.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CITY 
SETTLES SUIT IN ALLEGED POLICE BEATINGS AT PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved a payment of $556,160 to 30 
people who alleged that police beat them while responding to complaints about a 
loud party.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said a brawl erupted when they arrived in Arleta on April 1, 1989.The 
plaintiffs claimed that officers formed a gantlet and hit them with batons as 
party-goers walked out of the house. Officers said they drew their batons and 
flashlights but denied striking anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs will split $355,241. Their attorney will collect $200,918 in 
fees, costs and interest. A report from the city attorney's office stated that 
officers acted within department guidelines. No disciplinary action was taken.  
</P>
<P>
 The council's Budget and Finance Committee also recommended payment of 
$181,777 to settle lawsuits brought by two children who said a park employee 
molested them between September, 1987, and October, 1988.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CLAREMONT; MISSING 
WOMAN FOUND UNCONSCIOUS IN CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old Upland woman who had been missing for about 30 hours was in 
critical condition Tuesday after her car ran off the road and into a Claremont 
flood control channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Jan Pillow, who had just completed her freshman year at Cal Poly 
Pomona, was found unconscious in her 1993 Toyota Tercel.She was being treated 
at County-USC Medical Center, where she was on a respirator Tuesday. Doctors 
will test her for head injuries, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Upland police reported Pillow missing Sunday afternoon after she failed to 
return from a party at her brother's fraternity house in Pomona, Upland Police 
Detective Mike McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pillow apparently ran her car off an embankment of a dead-end road at Garey 
Avenue about 4 a.m. Sunday, Claremont Police Officer Larry Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her car apparently went airborne and struck the concrete side of the flood 
control channel, then dropped 40 feet, Horowitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents near the Live Oak Canyon Flood Control Channel near College Way and 
Garey Avenue heard a loud crash about 4 a.m. Several residents came out of 
their houses to look around, but could not see anything. The police station 
received no calls, Horowitz said. About 6:50 p.m. Monday, a couple taking a 
stroll spotted Pillow's car and called police.

 The Apollo 11 earthwalk? That's what Charles Johnson of Lancaster calls it. 
He's the proprietor of the 22-year-old Flat Earth Society, which has more than 
3,000 dues-paying members stretching out to (but not peeking over) the four 
corners of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The moonwalk was the greatest scientific hoax yet but the (25th) anniversary 
has been great for our society," he said. "The scientific community's claims 
have been so outrageous that a lot of turned-off people have joined us." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who publishes the Flat Earth News (subscription price: $25 per year), 
says the moonwalk was actually filmed around Meteor Crater in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 But if, as he says, the Earth is truly flat, are people in danger of falling 
off? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the question I'm always asked," Johnson said with a chuckle. The 
answer, he said, is that no one has reached the edges. "We don't know the 
dimensions of the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And up there in the skies? "We have little twinkling lights above us," he 
said. "Who knows what they are?" 
</P>
<P>
 That's one story the Flat Earth News doesn't seem interested in.

 Someone is watching over us: As we've mentioned, rumors have been circulating 
for months of back-seat angels panicking drivers with warnings of an impending

seraphs that conceptual artist Jill D'Agnencia has been setting out around the 
city for our protection. The little character in this photo took a seat on 
Balboa Boulevard just after the Jan. 17 quake.

 A power failure broke the transmission for public TV station KOED, causing the 
signal to switch automatically to cable's E! Entertainment channel. And Placido 
Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jose Carreras gave way to Howard Stern.

 The concert viewers were subjected to about six minutes of the shock jock's 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evidently, some very distasteful material aired . . . maybe even vulgar from 
the phone calls we received," said Bob Allen, the head of KOED. "It had 
something to do with Howard Stern and people taking their pants off."

the Sierra Madre News:

 Flat-Foot Floogie Society: Regarding our item on the record album of 1940s 
lyrics, Esther Tarn of Culver City can't understand how the publishers forgot

<P>
 Such an omission is unforgivable. But we think they made up for it by 
including "Across the Alley From the Alamo," "I've Got a Lovely Bunch of 
Coconuts" and "Cement Mixer (Put-Ti, Put-Ti)." miscelLAny:

 "Capricorn One," which starred Elliot Gould, James Brolin and O.J. Simpson, 
was a 1978 movie about a moonwalk that was faked by the government. It's a 
favorite of the Flat Earth Society.

<P>
 Three welders remained hospitalized Tuesday, a day after a blast at a subway 
construction site beneath Vermont Avenue and 6th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Gibson, 37, who underwent surgery for a fractured knee Monday night, was 
in very critical condition at Torrance Memorial Hospital Burn Center with 
third-degree burns over 90% of his body.Andy Gutierrez, 52, who suffered smoke 
inhalation and second- and third-degree burns over 35% of his body, was in 
serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Welder Michael Willis, who was treated for smoke inhalation, was in stable 
condition at Queen of Angels/Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said the three men were injured when a chunk of metal fell from 
a conveyor belt and punctured an acetylene tank, setting off a blast that was 
doused quickly by employees of the contractor, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny. 
</P>
<P>
 Work was shut down Tuesday at the accident site, 50 feet below street level, 
as the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Cal/OSHA continued separate

 One of the most horrific images of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake was the 
double-whammy that hit a stretch of Balboa Boulevard in Granada Hills. The 
moment the earth violently shook, two water mains broke, causing an explosion 
that propelled a 300-pound chunk of asphalt through the roof of the home of 
Joseph and Zetella Partlow and creating a river that ran south to Rinaldi 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour later, the turn of the ignition key of a stalled pickup truck at 
Balboa and Rinaldi ignited a broken gas line that exploded, creating a 
10-foot-deep crater and spewing flames 100 feet high. Five homes in the 11600 
block of Balboa Boulevard burned to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, President Clinton paid a brief visit to the site, listening to 
stories of homes destroyed, lives rescued and families disrupted. In a speech 
he gave later about providing aid, he said, "We have a national responsibility. 
This is something we intend to stay with until the job is over." 
</P>

 Six months later, the rebuilding continues. The water and gas lines have been 
repaired and a patch of new asphalt on the street marks the spot where the 
craters once were.

 An hour after the quake, Jimmy Menzi, a Simi Valley mechanic, was headed to 
check on his mother in Santa Clarita. His pickup truck stalled in the flooded 
intersection of Balboa and Rinaldi and with a turn of the key, the broken gas 
line exploded in flames. Menzi's pickup truck was immediately engulfed in 
flames. Though Menzi survived, his truck and his tools were lost to the fire. 
He was hospitalized for two weeks with burns to 30% of his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later, his burns are still healing. A friend loaned him a truck 
until he was able to buy a new one in March. Some tools were replaced through 
donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Menzi had his two dogs with him when his truck was caught in the flames. One 
dog died in the fire, but Bimbo, the other dog, escaped and was eventually 
found by passersby who took the dog to a pet hospital. Bimbo's $50,000 surgery 
made her a minor celebrity before she succumbed to her injuries. Menzi has 
since adopted a new dog from the animal shelter and appropriately named it 
Quake.

1 KILLED, 2 INJURED AS PIPES FALL ONTO FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI and CHIP JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Iron pipes 30 feet long and weighing up to a ton each rained down on the 
Golden State Freeway from an overhead transition ramp in Sylmar on Tuesday 
afternoon, one of them skewering a car and killing the driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people were injured in the freak accident in the northern San Fernando 
Valley where the Golden State and Foothill and Antelope Valley freeways come 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipes broke loose from a flatbed truck on a transition ramp from the 
westbound Foothill to the southbound Golden State. As the truck continued to 
travel, eight to 10 pipes plunged about 45 feet onto the Golden State Freeway 
and truck lanes of the Antelope Valley Freeway, knocking concrete chunks off a 
ramp as they fell. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could hear was pipes and concrete all around me," said Gary Payne, 43, 
of Valencia, who was driving on the ramp. "I don't know how I made it through." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the pipes, which authorities said were about 18 to 20 inches in 
diameter and weighed about 1,500 to 2,000 pounds apiece, slammed into a white 
Oldsmobile Bravada, knocking off the car's roof, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pipe just sheared it off and opened it like a can of sardines," said Jack 
Gastil of Canyon Country, who was driving his van behind the victim's vehicle 
on the northbound Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 The car bounced off the concrete center divider of the freeway before coming 
to a rest on its side in the right-hand lanes. The driver's head was crushed, 
Gastil said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man's identity was not made public pending notification of his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 4:15 p.m., said Officer John Manduca of the 
California Highway Patrol, when straps or chains holding a load of about 20 
pipes broke and many rolled or bounced over the side of the transition ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 "The driver is usually responsible for tying down his own load," said Manduca, 
noting that the accident was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver could not immediately halt his truck as the pipes began rolling 
off, Manduca said, and that was why they were dropped over such an extensive 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Several vehicles on a ramp were hit by debris, although only two people were 
treated for injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials closed the northbound Golden State and the transition from the 
westbound Foothill to the southbound Golden State while the accident was 
investigated and cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 Northbound rush hour traffic backed up beyond the Simi Valley Freeway, five 
miles to the south, and freeways and surface roads throughout the area had 
similar backups. 
</P>
<P>
 The death and injury toll could have been much worse given the traffic and 
number of pipes, said Milton Vrquilla of the Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "For something like this at this time of the day and for the size of these 
pipes, we're lucky we didn't have more damage than we do now," he said.

NEW PROPERTY TAXES PROPOSED TO HELP FUND LIBRARY SYSTEM; GOVERNMENT: COUNTY 
SUPERVISORS TENTATIVELY ENDORSE PLAN TO RAISE $30 MILLION A YEAR. MONEY WOULD 
HELP RESTORE CUTBACKS IN JOBS AND SERVICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Giving up on hope that the state Legislature would help with the problem, the 
Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday set out to resuscitate the foundering 
county library system by creating a way to impose new property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 3-1 vote, with Supervisor Mike Antonovich opposing, the supervisors 
tentatively endorsed a proposal to raise $30 million annually by charging 
property owners in areas covered by the county library district a maximum fee 
of $30 per parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 The library district, which serves 3.3 million people in 52 cities and 
unincorporated areas with 87 branch libraries, would use the revenue to restore 
more than $30 million a year in state cutbacks that have forced the county to 
close 10 branches, lay off nearly 300 employees and cut dozens of libraries 
back to only two or three days of operation a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors acted after the failure of a two-year effort to pass state 
legislation to raise the county's library revenues. Those efforts are 
continuing, but even if successful, the money would be received too late to 
help the libraries this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay in state legislation means the county's tax increase is "the only 
viable option for the libraries," said Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county has the authority to create a special district and impose 
the tax in unincorporated areas, the tax can be collected in incorporated 
cities only if local governments agree to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, so-called Mello-Roos districts can be created by local 
governments to levy special tax assessments on property, with the money often 
financing public improvements such as streets and sewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities that refuse to join the tax district would continue to experience 
reductions in library hours and services, Librarian Sandra Reuben said. But 
their refusal could also create headaches for the county in cases where 
residents of a recalcitrant city continued to use a nearby library in the 
unincorporated area without paying for the restoration of services.  
</P>
<P>
 To win support for the proposal, library officials plan an intensive lobbying 
effort, including a series of public meetings in communities from Agoura Hills 
to Lakewood. The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to hold a public hearing on 
the issue Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only eight cents a day," Reuben told the board Tuesday. "We think that's 
a lot of value for that amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
 But Antonovich, whose district includes the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys 
and part of the San Fernando Valley, said residents of the library district 
should be given a chance to register their opinions on the tax in an advisory 
referendum in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Ed Edelman, Gloria Molina and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke declined to 
support such a referendum. Supervisor Deane Dana was absent.  
</P>
<P>
 County officials had long pinned their hopes on several proposals in the state 
Legislature, including a measure -- vetoed last year by Gov. Pete Wilson -- 
that would have allowed the county to tax all residents of the library 
district, including those in the 52 cities.

BILL BOYARSKY: LATINO VOTERS COULD EXERCISE SIZABLE CLOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever since I moved to Los Angeles in 1970, I've anticipated the Latino 
political revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptical academics, pollsters, campaign consultants and political writing 
colleagues assured me it would never happen. They obviously thought the 
question of Latino power had been settled when Mexico lost the war with the 
United States and signed the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in 1848. 
</P>
<P>
 Their analysis made superficial sense. Latino voting turnout was small. 
Statewide registration drives didn't live up to their promise. No Latinos hold 
statewide office. A Times poll of voters leaving the polling booths after the 
1992 presidential election found that just 7% were Latino. The figure was 6% in 
a Times poll post-election survey of June, 1994, primary voters. The numbers 
are especially small considering that California's population is 28% Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more to the story than these numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I've noticed that in the San Gabriel Valley, a vast stretch of suburbia and 
manufacturing towns reaching from East Los Angeles to San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 To a lot of people, the future of L.A. is described in the urban nightmare of 
a movie called "Blade Runner." But to me, the San Gabriel Valley is a much 
better illustration of where we've been and where we're going. 
</P>
<P>
 Settled by the Gabrielino Indians more than 1,000 years ago, the valley was 
taken over first by Spain, then Mexico and finally the United States. Its 
population has again changed dramatically in the last 40 years. From a 
predominantly white, middle-class enclave, the valley has become a rich and 
complex mixture of whites, Latinos, Asians and African Americans. Their life, 
to a great extent, is suburban. The single-family home remains an attainable 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
 When I stop in San Gabriel Valley city halls and school district headquarters, 
I've seen that that a large number, often a majority, of the council and school 
board members are Latinos. If Latinos weren't voting, I wondered, how did all 
these people get elected? 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Latinos were increasing their representation in the L.A. 
County legislative delegation in Sacramento, as well as on the Los Angeles City 
Council and, for the first time, on the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers are part of a statewide phenomenon. Francisco Dominguez of the 
National Assn. of Latino Elected Officials told me that from 1984 to 1993, the 
number of Latino elected officials in California increased from 460 to 797. 
</P>
<P>
 It's this growing number of Latinos elected to local office that has 
encouraged Latino political activists to predict a larger vote this year. "I 
think all the pieces are in place for a dynamite turnout of Latinos in a 
governor's race," said Antonio Gonzalez, director of the Southwest Voter 
Research Institute, a leading Latino voter education and registration 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, Gonzalez cites the growing number of Latino local officials, a 
sign of political activity in the Latino grass-roots. If people worry about 
school board members, his theory goes, then they'll turn out when it comes to 
governor and U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that Latino turnout should be pushed up by the presence on the 
ballot of the SOS -- Save Our State -- initiative, which cuts off public 
education and non-emergency medical care to illegal immigrants. Opponents of 
the measure call it racist and anti-Latino. Significantly, a Times poll in May 
showed that not all Latinos agree. Although 57% opposed it, a substantial 
number, 35%, said they would vote yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a Latino, Democratic state Sen. Art Torres of Los Angeles, is running 
for insurance commissioner. The prospect of a Latino in statewide office may 
increase the vote in Latino communities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A substantial Latino vote could be an important factor in determining the 
November elections, especially for the Democrats. The majority of Latinos are 
registered Democrats and Treasurer Kathleen Brown, the candidate for governor, 
and U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein will need almost all of them to win. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, the last time Democrats elected a governor, Democratic registration 
was 57% of the electorate. This year, it's down to 49%. "Electing a Democratic 
governor today is much more challenging in terms of the numbers," said John 
Whitehurst, a Brown spokesman. "Thus this (Latino) effort is critical. We must 
maximize votes in any place we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Republican candidates usually get about 30% of the Latino vote, although 
Ronald Reagan received more. Anything Gov. Pete Wilson and GOP Senate candidate 
Rep. Michael Huffington get above the 30% mark is a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, the size of the turnout is more important than party 
allegiance. Election Day's cold, hard figures will determine whether Latinos 
will have a stronger voice in education, immigration, health care and other 
issues that shape life in their community, no matter which party wins.

INSPECTION PLAN ON STEEL FRAME BUILDINGS EASED; SAFETY: COUNCIL PANEL CALLS FOR 
30-DAY STUDY TO REDUCE COST OF CHECKING FOR QUAKE-INDUCED CRACKS IN 400 
STRUCTURES. A FURTHER REVIEW OF QUESTIONABLE REPAIR METHODS ALSO IS ORDERED BY 
COMMITTEE. 
</P>

<P>
 Conceding that the problem of quake-damaged steel frame buildings may be more 
intractable than expected, a city panel Tuesday backed away from a proposal for 
costly, mandatory inspections of 400 buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the City Council's Ad Hoc Committee on Earthquake Recovery asked 
for a 30-day study to attempt to reduce the cost after learning that inspection 
charges could range from $10,000 to $60,000 per building. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also asked that building and safety officials continue to study the 
repair methods recommended in the plan, saying questions remain about whether 
they could withstand another major quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the city to ask someone to spend a million dollars for repairs and tell 
them that they may have the same damage if we have the same size quake doesn't 
make sense," Councilman Richard Alarcon told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also asked that housing officials consider devising a plan to help 
relocate residents of steel frame mid- and high-rise buildings whose evacuation 
might be needed if asbestos is found during repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, chairman of the panel, said he is reluctant to require 
repairs when it is not clear how effective they would be in a quake comparable 
to that on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests conducted at the University of Texas at Austin have found that the 
welding techniques recommended by the city failed when subjected to a simulated 
earthquake of magnitude 7.0. Recent tests have been more promising but are 
still under review. 
</P>
<P>
 Widespread reports of cracks in welded joints on commercial and government 
steel frame buildings shocked many engineers because steel frames are designed 
to bend without breaking in the enormous force of a quake. No steel frame 
buildings collapsed in the Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, owners of steel frame buildings in the hardest hit areas 
of the city would be required to inspect at least 10% of the main joints of the 
buildings. The inspections would be required within three months of 
notification by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost could be high because high-rise steel frame buildings can have as 
many as 300 main joints, each of which can cost as much as $2,000 to inspect, 
building officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inspections are completed and reports are filed with the city, repairs 
would have to be completed within one year. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspection program would concentrate on 400 steel frame buildings, 
including about 25 residential buildings, in the San Fernando Valley and on the 
Westside, where quake damage was most severe. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the results of the inspections, the city may consider ordering 
inspections of 1,000 more buildings citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson and Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky questioned the need to inspect 10% of 
the joints in each building, saying the cost to some owners may be prohibitive. 
They suggested that building and safety officials find a less expensive way of 
assessing damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you need to reduce as much as practical the amount of expense it 
takes," Yaroslavsky told building officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, the City Council gave the head of the Building and 
Safety Department the power to impose tougher construction standards than those 
on the books. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, adopted unanimously, is intended to incorporate proposed upgrades 
into the repair and reconstruction work that is taking place citywide.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; SEARCHING NO MORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Countless commuters had lived with her likeness. It was brought to mind daily 
by a sign that hung on the side of a building, easily visible on trips up the 
Corona Del Mar Freeway.It was a striking statement of the question that Orange 
County had lived with since June of 1991: Had anybody seen Denise A. Huber? 
</P>
<P>
 The question has been answered tragically with the discovery in Arizona of the 
young Newport Beach woman's body, found in a freezer at a suspect's house. 
Commuters who passed the sign Monday morning still saw it, but it had been 
taken down by evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Life requires us to mark its passages in ways ceremonial and otherwise. As the 
Huber family and friends prepared to observe the end of their long period of 
terrible uncertainty with memorial services in Newport Beach and South Dakota, 
the removal of the sign in some small way signaled the end of a larger 
community's shared participation in the search for a missing member. 
</P>
<P>
 In such a manner, the Huber case has raised the involvement of citizens in the 
work of law-enforcement agencies in Orange County and beyond. It has made us 
aware of a shared stake in resolutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The search for Denise Huber enlisted posters and bumper stickers, and more. In 
some way, the case has bound us together, not as members of any particular 
town, as in the early days of Orange County, but as members of a larger 
"village." It was part of an important national trend toward involving 
community volunteers in trying to solve child abduction and missing persons 
cases.

TENDING THE ORCHARD FOR FOSTER KIDS; DESPITE SOME FAILURES IN THE SYSTEM, MANY 
CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD SUCCESSES IN REARING NEGLECTED AND ABUSED CHILDREN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA J. LABITZKE, Barbara J. Labitzke is executive director of SAFE, a 
public/private partnership in Orange serving eight Southern California 
counties.

<P>
 Recently, I found myself gazing at the tapestry of an orchard that led me to 
reflect on the fruits of our labors. Social work is a field full of pain and 
poverty, of violence and victims. In my own position, I find daily satisfaction 
in recognizing foster parents for their admirable work. I urge them to tell 
everyone about the lasting rewards of foster parenting. What was different 
about the feeling I had that day? What kept me from remembering that 45% of the 
youths who graduate from foster care become homeless within 18 months? What 
kept me from focusing on the two-thirds of the prison inmates who were once in 
foster care? Instead, my emotions kept drawing me to the orchard scene. 
</P>
<P>
 SAFE, Southern Area Fostercare Effort, was honoring successful former foster 
youths at a luncheon at an elegant hotel where tapestries line the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 In a stately dining room, the rich food and opulence stood in striking 
contrast to the meager meals and drab motel rooms the young honorees had known 
as children. Occasionally a tear spilled on damask linens as it was related how 
they overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 Here was Patti, who had lived with her drug-addicted mom and a parade of 
abusive father figures. At 15, Patti gave birth to a four-pound medically 
fragile baby. Two weeks later, Patti's mom died of a drug overdose. In foster 
care Patti completed high school and medical assistant training in two years. 
She had another baby and tried to preserve a family for her children but 
finally found the courage to leave an abusive situation. Supporting herself and 
her children, Patti has never been unemployed or sought welfare assistance. 
Consistently giving her children the nurturing she never knew as a child, Patti 
refused to repeat the pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Abused, abandoned, neglected, molested, exploited and tortured -- any one of 
these conditions is sufficient to bring a child into the foster care system -- 
Melissa suffered all of them. Melissa had little schooling and turned to drugs 
and gangs. Concerned foster parents guided Melissa from passively watching cop 
shows on TV to actively volunteering in the Explorer program for youths 
interested in law enforcement careers. The only female to complete the 
training, Melissa rose to the second-highest rank of lieutenant. Melissa is 
pursuing college studies to become a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Supervisor William G. Steiner presented an award to a 
middle-aged stockbroker who accepted it for his foster son, Michael. Mike 
declined to be present because he was busy working as a counselor for 
disadvantaged children at a camp in the Sierra where he turned his own life 
around. When Mike was a baby, his birth father left. His mother tried to numb 
her pain with alcohol and neglected her son. Living with her in dingy 
warehouses, at times with only raw spaghetti to eat and dirty clothes to wear, 
Mike shuttled in and out of foster care. His mom died when Mike was 14, leaving 
him alone in the world. Back in foster care, Mike fell into a spiral of 
lethargy and truancy that tested the patience of his foster dad, a foster 
father who refused to give up on Mike, Attending college to become a 
psychologist for children, Mike now leads a peer counseling program for foster 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, these young achievers richly deserved the accolades, the money, the 
congratulations from the governor, the baskets heaped with gifts. But my 
reaction was not to any one personal achievement but rather an awareness of a 
cooperative, cumulative achievement that created its own vivid, woven scene. 
</P>
<P>
 I had heard inspiring stories about foster care before, but this time I saw a 
tapestry woven around many figures, who all played a part tending this orchard. 
I wanted everyone who becomes disheartened by the failures of the system to see 
this weaving that was so real you could almost smell the blossoms.

IRVINE'S BALANCING ACT WITH CFCS; ENVIRONMENT: CITY CHOSE PARTNERSHIP AND NOT 
CONFLICT WITH BUSINESS WHEN IT WENT TO WAR AGAINST CHLOROFLUOROCARBONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL S. BROWN, Michael S. Brown was the head of Irvine's environmental 
affairs program and is now a corporate environmental assessment director in 
Ventura. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every once in a while, government does something right. Despite years of 
rhetoric about the bad business climate fostered by government regulation, 
sometimes regulation, properly created and administered, works to the advantage 
of both the public and business. 
</P>
<P>
 One example is Irvine's ordinance restricting the use of chlorofluorocarbons 
(CFCs.) Lauded by environmentalists as a landmark initiative when it was 
adopted in 1989, it was decried by some businesses as an unworkable experiment 
in local regulation of a global issue that would lead to a mass exodus of 
industrial companies from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine chose to administer the ordinance by allowing companies that couldn't 
find an easy alternative to continue using CFCs. At the same time, the city set 
up an aggressive technical assistance program that was designed to achieve 
substantially greater reductions. This approach rested on the belief that most 
firms had little access to information about alternatives to CFCs and, if use 
of the chemicals was denied in Irvine, there were few barriers to moving out of 
the city and continuing to use ozone-depleting substances. 
</P>
<P>
 Workshops, visits to factories, phone calls, and a newsletter were the means 
for providing help to companies. And rather than waiting for companies to call, 
city staff called them to ask if they had tried available alternatives and if 
the city could help do some research for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Was this approach the right one? By several measures, yes. Use of 
ozone-depleting chemicals, measured by both reports to the city and to the 
federal government, declined radically. From 1988 to 1992, federal data shows 
an 80% reduction in the release of CFCs and methyl chloroform. Although about a 
dozen companies that had used CFCs left the city -- some went out of business, 
some consolidated with other locations, and some moved to cheaper locales -- 
about an equal number moved in with the knowledge and a commitment that they 
had to eliminate their use of these chemicals. Irvine companies that acted 
quickly were not caught in the scramble when other government entities (the Air 
Quality Management District and the Congress in amending the Clean Air Act) 
sought to eliminate ozone-depleting chemicals. In business, you rarely want to 
be the last one to change. 
</P>
<P>
 The city didn't limit its efforts to just CFCs. The technical assistance 
program was broadened to include reducing the use of all hazardous chemicals in 
the city and was integrated with an economic development program that targeted 
companies interested in moving to Irvine. Inquiries to the city would generate 
help not only with the city's permitting processes, but technical assistance on 
pollution prevention. Working with businesses to solve environmental problems 
became the watchword. city staff genuinely wanted to help, and businesses 
became convinced that pollution prevention benefited the public and their own 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't idle talk. Those same statistics that showed a reduction in CFCs 
also showed that businesses in Irvine reduced their emissions of hazardous air 
pollutants by 77% from 1988 to 1992. This compares with a 40% reduction by all 
California businesses and just a 33% reduction in all of Orange County. And 
surprisingly, business licenses for manufacturers actually increased between 
1990 and 1992 by about 13% in Irvine.  
</P>
<P>
 The old adversarial models, usually predicated on government mandating 
environmental compliance by businesses in mind-numbing detail, appear less 
effective than setting performance goals combined with high-quality technical 
assistance. Perhaps another difference is that Irvine's "bureaucrats" cared. 
They cared not only about protecting the environment, but they were committed 
to maintaining a viable industrial community within the city.  
</P>
<P>
 We'll always need tough enforcement for those rogue companies that want to get 
away with environmental crimes.  
</P>
<P>
 But the lesson taught by Irvine is that we actually speed up getting to our 
common goal of protecting public health and the environment through partnership 
rather than conflict.

CLEMENS IS NO MATCH FOR ANGELS' CURTIS; BASEBALL: CENTER FIELDER HAS ANOTHER 
BIG GAME TO HELP TEAM DEFEAT BOSTON RED SOX, 6-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel center fielder Chad Curtis never has cared much for the glare of the 
spotlight, which is good, because it never has cared much for Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't get a college scholarship and wasn't drafted until the 45th round. 
And his name wasn't brought up whenever the topic was the top center fielders 
in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, guess who's talking now? 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis, shrugging off a bitterly disappointing first half, suddenly is the 
talk of the town, leading the Angels to a 6-4 victory over the Boston Red Sox 
in front of 20,335 Tuesday night at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget that they were facing Roger Clemens, who has punished the Angels like 
no other team. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis treated him as if he were a hard-throwing batting practice pitcher, 
hitting a two-run homer in the fifth inning, a run-scoring single in the 
seventh and drawing two walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis, subtly reminded by Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann earlier in the day 
that the Autrys don't care for facial hair -- and must soon shave his goatee -- 
has become the Red Sox's worst enemy. He has reached base eight consecutive 
times, going six for six with four runs, a double, three homers, six runs 
batted in and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't try to explain it," said Curtis, who's batting a season-high .262 
with 10 home runs, which ties his career best. "Maybe it's the hair, I don't 
know. I just want it continue. I know I can play a lot better than I did in the 
first half, and I hope to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of time left, and by no means are we out of this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels (41-54), who have beaten the Red Sox in four consecutive games for 
the first time since 1991, moved to within five games of the AL West-leading 
Texas Rangers. Perhaps most important, they finally proved they could beat 
Clemens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roger is one of the premier pitchers in the game," Angel Manager Marcel 
Lachemann said, "and any time you can beat him you'd done a pretty good job. 
You know it's going to take a total team effort to defeat him." 
</P>
<P>
 Clemens (8-5) has dominated the Angels throughout his career, defeating them 
more times (20) than any other active pitcher. He was 2-0 with a 0.60 
earned-run average against the Angels this season, and was 4-1 with a 1.38 ERA 
against the Angels in his last six starts at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 This night was different. 
</P>
<P>
 This night, for the first time in their four career matchups against one 
another, Angel starter Mark Langston was the dominant pitcher. Langston (6-6) 
yielded four hits and three earned runs in seven innings, defeating Clemens for 
the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels produced seven hits and five runs (four earned) in 6 2/3 innings 
off Clemens. It was the most runs the Angels have scored off Clemens since May 
26, 1989, but the victory was preserved in the eighth inning by rookie right 
fielder Jim Edmonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 5-3 in the eighth, the Red Sox came back with a leadoff homer by 
Andre Dawson off reliever Mark Leiter. Tom Brunansky struck out. But Wes 
Chamberlain -- who had homered in the second inning to extend the Angels' 
club-record streak of 12 games in which they have yielded a homer -- followed 
with a double into the right-field corner. 
</P>
<P>
 When Red Sox Manager Butch Hobson summoned left-handed pinch-hitter Scott 
Cooper, Lachemann countered with left-hander Bob Patterson. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson struck out Cooper for the second out, and with right-handed catcher 
Damon Berryhill coming to the plate, Lachemann left Patterson in. Much to 
Lachemann's chagrin, Berryhill slapped a hard single to right field. 
Pinch-runner Lee Tinsley was waved around third, and Edmonds came up throwing. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't even close. Edmonds' throw to catcher Greg Myers was perfect, and 
Myers was waiting to tag Tinsley.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've had some problems swinging the bat," Edmonds said, "but when everybody 
else is getting hits, I've got to do something on the defensive end." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, ensuring that Joe Grahe's job would be easier, picked up another 
run in the eighth on first baseman J.T. Snow's run-scoring single. Grahe then 
pitched a 1-2-3 ninth for his 13th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Chili Davis was the first to make his teammates believers that Clemens was 
mere mortal. He took a 3-and-1 fastball and sent it over the center-field fence 
for a two-run homer in the fourth, giving the Angels a 2-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it was Curtis who made the loudest noise. He came into the game with a 
career .192 batting average off Clemens, and finished believing he can homer 
off anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Curtis is hot," Hobson said. "We just keep throwing him balls to hit out of 
the ballpark."

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Redell, former quarterback for Crespi High, has signed a free-agent 
contract with the Indianapolis Colts as a defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
 Redell, who graduated from Crespi in 1988 and played defensive back at 
Stanford before graduating last year, did not play last fall.After working for 
a San Francisco bank, Redell was granted a tryout with Indianapolis last 
weekend after he played in an all-star game in Japan earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Redell is one of three members of the 1987 Crespi backfield in camp with NFL 
teams. Tailback Russell White, who attended Cal, is with the Rams. Fullback 
J.J. Lasley (Stanford) is with the Vikings. In 1987, Crespi reached the 
Southern Section semifinals, losing to Fontana. The Celts were coached by 
Redell's father, Bill, now coach at St. Francis High.

TWO DUKES REDEEM THEMSELVES IN EASY VICTORY; TENNIS: GROSSMAN AND 
WHITLINGER-JONES RELAX, ALLOWING THEM TO HANDLE THE TWIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Embarrassed by their performance Sunday night in Idaho, the Newport Beach 
Dukes' Tami Whitlinger-Jones and Ann Grossman decided to embarrass someone else 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlinger-Jones and Grossman had victories in only three games in women's 
doubles and singles Sunday, but Tuesday they won 12 of 17 in the Dukes' 30-16 
victory over the Florida Twist at the John Wayne Tennis Club before about 500 
fans. The Dukes raised their record to 8-0; Florida fell to 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were fired up," Duke Coach Angel Lopez said. "They wanted to redeem 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman hadn't played World TeamTennis for two years before Sunday and 
Whitlinger-Jones was the Dukes' alternate. But both were playing before a 
feisty Idaho crowd on Sunday because regulars Zina Garrison Jackson and Larisa 
Neiland were in Germany playing in the Federation Cup. Neither player handled 
the situation well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came out a little nervous because we were 6-0," Grossman said. "Those were 
tough conditions. The crowd was obnoxious and I wasn't used to it. I was 
relaxed being here in Newport. The crowd is so mellow. They need to liven up a 
bit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach spectators might have been more mellow than usual perhaps, 
because they never had a match to get enthused about. Grossman and Trevor 
Kronemann got the Dukes off and running with a 6-3 mixed doubles victory over 
Nicole Arendt and Greg Van Emburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitlinger-Jones then routed an erratic Arendt, 6-2. Whitlinger-Jones was 
winning points by simply keeping the ball in play for more than one volley. 
Arendt, who once was ranked as high as 65 in the world, didn't play any better 
in doubles with partner Laxmi Poruri. Whitlinger and Grossman beat the Twist 
tandem 6-3 to give the Dukes an 18-8 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were both a lot more relaxed than in Idaho," Whitlinger-Jones said. "We 
just decided to have some fun. We jumped out on them early and I think they got 
a little down." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Jones, Whitlinger-Jones' husband, kept the Twist down with a 6-2 singles 
victory over a lethargic Andres Gomez, who won the French Open four years ago 
and once was ranked No. 4 in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Emburgh and Gomez salvaged some respectability by taking the last set, 
6-5, over Kronemann and Jones. But Kronemann and Jones held serve in the first 
game of overtime to end the match. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dukes' next match is Saturday in Sacramento (5-2) against the second-place 
Capitals, who trail Newport Beach by 2 1/2 games in the West Division. Neiland 
should be back for the Sacramento match, but Duke owner Fred Lieberman said 
Garrison Jackson might miss Saturday's match and Sunday's against WTT champion 
Wichita.

SPLASH WINS ROUGH BATTLE WITH THE WARTHOGS; SOCCER: CROWD OF 4,368 WATCH TV 
ACTOR SHUE GET IN, TAKE A FEW KICKS IN ANAHEIM'S 6-3 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Those who played with Andrew Shue previously said he was scrappy, that he 
wasn't afraid to mix it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue himself said he was an emotional player. 
</P>
<P>
 And Shue, the "Melrose Place" star playing the first of two games for the 
Splash, was in the middle of a scrap Tuesday night in a 6-3 victory over the 
Washington Warthogs in front of 4,368 at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's Troy Snyder kicked Shue in the chest after the two had tumbled to 
the turf. Tempers flared on both sides as teammates rushed in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit the guy good when I went up for the header," said Shue, who played at 
Dartmouth. "I think I fouled him on the play and he responded a little hard and 
it was a little scuffle. It was no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Denis Hamlett was the first at Shue's side and helped prevent Shue from 
getting any more involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Goran Hunjak, the Warthogs' leading scorer, drew a red card and Washington 
Coach Jim Gabarra and both benches drew yellow cards. Shue found himself in the 
penalty box. 
</P>
<P>
 With each team a man down, the Splash scored with one second left on the 
penalty, making it 5-1 with 3 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after, Shue was tackled hard by Eric Eichmann, who had served the 
Warthog penalty, when Shue was on the receiving end of a breakaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez said it appeared the Warthogs were taking their shots at the 
celebrity midfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were picking on him," Fernandez said. "They were saying, 'We've got a 
big star here' and it was getting to the point where somebody was going to try 
to do him. They were getting kind of physical with him." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Shue was the most notable newcomer, it was the play of Juan Carlos 
Sanchez that was more instrumental. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez filled in for forward Rod Castro (30 points), who announced after 
Tuesday's morning practice that he would be unable to play because of the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 "The substitutes have to step up because you don't know what someone is going 
to give you," said defender Ralph Black. "These are the games we have to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Ervine, Doug Neely and Raffaele Ruotolo each had a goal and two assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, Shane Hickson and Armando Valdivia also scored as the Splash tallied 
five consecutive goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim plays host to Arizona on Thursday.

GOLF / STEVE ELLING; AT 64, DUKE STILL PLAYING ACES ON ACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donna Duke started a second volume. No problem. Just bought another album for 
her score cards and certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 Her commemorative trophy keeps growing too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so heavy I can hardly lift it," Duke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Who says one is the loneliest number? Not Duke, a 64-year-old who lives in 
Camarillo and collects holes in one by the bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 She has 40 aces, which is almost a whole deck. It's a singular distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Most golfers go a lifetime without making a hole in one. One publication 
estimated the chances of recording an ace at 400,000 to one. Duke racked up 12 
in 1985 alone, a national record. Let the computer digest those numbers for a 
week or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke has so many ones it's onerous. Adding to the trophy -- on which each of 
the 40 lucky balls is mounted -- is becoming pricey. A friend who handled the 
trophy mounting free of charge isn't around anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the next couple, I may have to stop adding to it," Duke said. "I can't 
afford to keep adding to that thing." 
</P>
<P>
 One has to like her confidence. Not a matter of if, but when. Duke is the John 
Wayne of aces. Swaggers into town, shoots up the place, then leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke keeps track of each ace in a scrapbook, which was quickly filled. She 
started another to handle the overflow. Truth be told, the second hasn't seen 
much use lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke's most recent ace came last November, which means she's in the midst of 
an eight-month dry spell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seems like two years since I played," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't so much a slump as it is a lack of opportunity. Duke lives in a 
2,336-home retirement community in Camarillo and last month became president of 
its board of directors. If she's lucky, Duke plays once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Next July, her term expires, whereupon full-throttle golf will resume. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it'll take long to get back into it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It being the hole, of course. It has happened so often over the past 14 years 
people have grown skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke has answered the best way she knows. In 1988, a sportscaster from an area 
television station read of Duke's exploits and arranged for her to meet a 
camera crew on the 14th hole at River Ridge Golf Course in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke stepped to the tee of the 122-yard par-three hole. She was given three 
balls. 
</P>
<P>
 The first wound up on the fringe of the green. The second rolled to within 
three feet of the flag. The third, well, let's say the sportscaster left a true 
believer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It rolled right over the darned hole and stopped about a foot past it," Duke 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, there are those who continue to ask questions, even though each 
of her aces has been witnessed by playing partners and certified by the club 
pro. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf Digest, a magazine that gives certificates for attested holes in one, 
long has given Duke the evil eye. The magazine continues to certify her feats 
but has raised a few questions along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke, who didn't record her first ace until 1981, briefly considered suing the 
magazine to restore her credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have this thing about (players) actually seeing the ball go in the 
hole," she said. "That's not always possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I don't carry a rabbit with me. . . . I tell everyone I have a trained 
gopher." 
</P>
<P>
 That Duke has become an accomplished player -- she carries an eight handicap 
-- isn't particularly surprising. Before she took up golf in earnest in 1981 
she was a bowler with a 182 average, but a bad back forced her to give it up. 
She played competitive softball for years before that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I quit when it took a home run to make it to first base," Duke cracked. 
</P>
<P>
 She's still hitting solo shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke has been asked the secret to her success almost every day. It's simple, 
really. At least, the way she explains it. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it stick-to-itiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I aim for the stick," she said. "Since I don't put backspin on the ball, I 
let it land short and roll to the pin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, I just aim at the flag every time and let it roll on up there." 
</P>
<P>
 It tends to roll on in there too. 
</P>

 Kid stuff: There was a time when Julius Boros looked at John Palumbo with wide 
eyes and unabashed envy. Palumbo viewed Boros as a diamond in the rough. 
Actually, in 1934, Boros was still a chunk of coal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty years ago, Palumbo won the men's city championship in Bridgeport, Conn. 
Boros was a 13-year-old golf wanna-be from the same neighborhood, a caddie who 
couldn't get enough of the game. Palumbo was 18, which to Boros, made him a 
grizzled veteran worth emulating. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought I was something special," Palumbo said, laughing. "Heck, he was 
just a kid then." 
</P>
<P>
 The two shared a bond that spanned seven decades. Palumbo, a retired 
schoolteacher who moved to Los Angeles in 1954 and lives in Van Nuys, stayed in 
touch with his boyhood friend. And while Palumbo continued to play the game for 
fun, Boros carved a niche as one of the sport's legends. 
</P>
<P>
 Boros, who died at his home in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., earlier this summer at 
age 74, counted four majors -- a pair of U.S. Open and PGA championships -- 
among his numerous pro titles. Yet when he started playing the game as a kid in 
Connecticut, he had a few holes in his game. 
</P>
<P>
 Boros had a slice that nagged him briefly, but his swing eventually developed 
into one of the smoothest the pro tour has known. Boros played golf as though 
he was sauntering along the beach, as if he didn't have a care in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Boros often said: "Swing softly, hit hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Palmer swings a club like he had a badger in his shorts. Gary Player 
almost falls during his follow-through. By comparison, Boros' swing was fluid, 
almost effortless, and he had the temperament to match. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, the last time Palumbo saw Boros, the latter was playing in a 
Senior PGA Tour event on the West Coast. Boros asked Palumbo, now 78, what his 
handicap was. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aw, about a 14," Palumbo said, half-embarrassed to admit it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't feel too bad," Boros said with a grin. "I'm about an eight." 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Tregnan of the L.A. Municipal Golf Assn. likes to tell his golf pals 
that Palumbo, a former president of the Sepulveda Men's Golf Club, was Boros' 
mentor. Palumbo downplays the assertion, yet during an interview in the 1950s, 
Boros called Palumbo his "idol." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a two-way street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a whole scrapbook filled with stuff (about Boros)," Palumbo said. "He 
was a wonderful guy. I'll miss him." 
</P>

 Fast fact: The Southern California Golf Assn. Championship, which runs Friday 
through Sunday at Hacienda Golf Club in La Habra Heights, has been conducted 
annually since 1900, making it the second-oldest continually contested amateur 
event in the nation. It isn't second by much, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah staged its first championship in 1899. The U.S. Open and U.S. Amateur are 
older but were suspended during war years. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous SCGA champions include Al Geiberger, Barry Jaeckel, Mark Pfeil and 
Tony Sills, all former PGA Tour standouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those on the tour who failed to win the always competitive tournament 
are Craig Stadler, Scott Simpson, Corey Pavin, Steve Pate and Mark O'Meara.

 Pac-Men: Three of the top four finishers in last weekend's Ventura City 
Championship play at Pacific 10 Conference schools and all three are from the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Wi of North Hills and California fired a two-under 70 Sunday at Olivas 
Park Golf Course to finish at 143, edging Chad Wright of Ventura (USC) by one 
shot. Jason Gore of Valencia (Arizona), who has won the Pac-10 title the last 
two years, was fourth at 146. 
</P>
<P>
 Wi, a fifth-year senior, birdied the 544-yard 18th hole to break a tie with 
Wright. Using a driver, Wi hit a pair of booming shots into a breeze, the 
second clearing a small lake fronting the green to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just went for it," Wi said. "I was only one under for the day. I didn't 
come there to finish second." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, Wright missed a 12-foot birdie attempt on No. 18 that would 
have forced a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 All three players are entered in the SCGA Championship this weekend. Wi and 
Gore have accepted invitations to play in the Western Amateur, one of the 
nation's premier events, next month in Benton Harbor, Mich.

AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; WISDOM OF SOLOMON INCREASES AFTER DAY 
WITH MARINERS' SCOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wonder why baseball scouts look at bodies and radar guns more than they look 
at stats? 
</P>
<P>
 See Solomon, Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon, a Newhall-Santa Clarita right-hander, is 6-foot-6 and 210 pounds, and 
his fastball has been clocked at close to 90 m.p.h. range. But his senior 
season at Canyon High was less than spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a sore arm and a 2-3 record. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle Mariners drafted him in the 62nd round. Then Mariner scout Bill 
Sizemore straightened out his mechanics. Suddenly, Solomon has no more arm 
problems and he is 6-0 with a 3.19 earned-run average in American Legion play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sizemore worked with him one day and showed him what he was doing wrong," 
Newhall-Santa Clarita Coach Pat Eggleston said. "Now he's throwing really 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon, who will continue to work with Sizemore next spring at Cerro Coso 
College in Ridgecrest, also attributes the improvement to the team behind him. 
Newhall-Santa Clarita includes not only players from Canyon, which finished 
last in the Foothill League, but Hart, which finished first. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a rough year (at Canyon)," Solomon said. "(The pitchers) just had a 
hard time getting any support. In Legion, I've got some good defense and good 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
 And good mechanics. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 They're in: Van Nuys West beat Mission Hills, 7-6, in a makeup game Monday at 
Birmingham High to slip into the 10-team District 20 playoffs. The 
double-elimination tournament to determine the district's representative in the 
Area 6 playoffs began Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was necessary because the umpires did not show the first time the 
teams were scheduled to play, Van Nuys West Coach Mike Challgren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys West was the last team to qualify for the playoffs, but it is seeded 
No. 9, ahead of Valley North, because Van Nuys West defeated Valley North 
during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 The seedings: 1. Antelope Valley South (18-3), 2. Newhall-Santa Clarita 
(17-4), 3. Quartz Hill (16-5), 4. Encino (16-5), 5. Van Nuys East (15-5-1), 6. 
Sun Valley (15-5-1), 7. Verdugo Hills (15-6), 8. Woodland Hills West (14-7), 9. 
Van Nuys West (13-8), 10. Valley North (13-8). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They're in too: Two teams from District 16 have qualified for the six-team, 
double-elimination Area 6 playoffs next week at UCLA's Jackie Robinson Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal has clinched the district title and Rio Mesa, which draws 
players from Rio Mesa and Camarillo highs, has clinched second place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 High scoring: Antelope Valley South finished with the best regular-season 
record in District 20, largely because of an explosive offense led by Nos. 3 
and 4 hitters Chris Tapia and Eric Cole. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are the best 1-2 punch I've ever had," said Coach Mike Eberhardt, who 
has been coaching Legion since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole, a freshman at Antelope Valley College last spring, is hitting .549 with 
five triples, four home runs and 44 runs batted in. He was drafted last month 
in the late rounds by the Kansas City Royals. Tapia, a 1994 graduate of 
Antelope Valley High who plans to play at Antelope Valley College, is hitting 
.500 with three home runs and 31 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the offense, Eberhardt is apprehensive about his team's playoff 
chances because the format -- at least one game a day -- is tough for a team 
without deep pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have relied on our batting most of the season," Eberhardt said. "That's 
what's going to make it real tough in the playoffs because pitching is what you 
need." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the spotlight: When Pepperdine-bound pitcher Randy Wolf chose not to play 
for Woodland Hills West, it gave some unheralded players from El Camino Real 
High a chance for attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Burnette finished the Legion regular season hitting .520 with four home 
runs and 54 RBIs, including 15 in four games last week. Burnette hit grand 
slams on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's had an opportunity to shine and he's come through," Coach Bob 
Marks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnette is not alone, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Balser (.571), Mike Glendenning (.555) and John Novak (.507) also are 
hitting over .500 for Woodland Hills West. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some bullpen: It's an unusual sight if you're not used to it. Westlake-Royal 
assistant Ed Aguilar trots to the mound to talk to his pitcher. On the way, he 
winds up and fires a baseball out to center fielder Scott Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 Left fielder Bryan Fernandez runs toward Morris and squats about 60 feet away. 
Morris starts warming up in a makeshift bullpen -- no mound necessary -- for as 
long as the umpire will allow Aguilar to kill time on the mound. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a necessity when Morris, the closer for Westlake-Royal, is playing center 
field. Morris is 1-0 with five saves and a 1.24 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually I don't have that much time," Morris said. "When he does toss me out 
the ball, I just have to warm up as quickly as I can. So far it's working 
pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 Morris, a recent Westlake graduate, has signed to play at Texas Tech, where he 
also will play center field and pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Legion lines: Van Nuys West's Donny Wingo was taken to the hospital Sunday 
after he was hit in the head by a pitch from Studio City's Carlos Velazco. A 
CAT scan was negative, but Wingo will miss the rest of the season, said 
Challgren, Van Nuys West's Coach. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Two items jump off the final Sepulveda statistic sheet. First, pitcher Joe 
Cohen allowed 40 runs, but only eight were earned. Also Ethan Parker had 26 
stolen bases, but only 19 hits. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Littlerock finished 0-21 for the second consecutive season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Las Virgenes players kept a lizard in the dugout for good luck last season and 
the team streaked into the playoffs. This season, Las Virgenes (12-9) had no 
lizard. No playoffs. "I looked all over for one," said Jinny Hoover, the team's 
statistician.

DIGEST: REDFERN TAKES POST AS MASTER'S PITCHING COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete Redfern, pitching coach for Chatsworth High and head coach of the Valley 
North American Legion baseball team, has accepted a position as pitching coach 
at The Master's College. 
</P>
<P>
 Redfern, 40, the City Section player of the year at Sylmar High in 1972, 
pitched seven years for the Minnesota Twins before a diving accident in 
October, 1983, left him paralyzed from the neck down. Redfern compiled a 43-48 
record in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 Redfern attended USC from 1972-75 on a baseball scholarship and played on two 
national championship teams. He has spent the past four years coaching at 
Chatsworth and the past five years as American Legion coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has so much knowledge of the game with all the years of pitching he's had, 
you just can't put a value on that," Master's Coach Jack Mutz said. "He'll add 
a lot of stability to our program." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Former Glendale College shortstop Randy Vickers signed with the Seattle 
Mariners and has been assigned to the club's rookie-level affiliate in Peoria, 
Ariz., where he will play third base. 
</P>
<P>
 Vickers, who batted .374 with 13 home runs and 45 runs batted in for the 
Vaqueros, turned down an offer to play at Cal State Fullerton.

YOUR MONEY; FINANCIAL MARKETS; YIELDS FALL; DOLLAR RISES DESPITE REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long-term bond yields fell for a second consecutive session Tuesday, as market 
optimism intensified ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's 
congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the dollar rose despite news that the U.S. trade deficit 
widened in May. Stocks fell in lethargic trading. 
</P>
<P>
 In the credit markets, the Treasury's key 30-year bond fell to 7.46% from 
7.50%, while its price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 13/32 
point, or $4.06 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan was to appear before a Senate panel today and Friday with updates on 
Fed economic and monetary policy, and bond traders planned to monitor his words 
closely for hints of interest rate moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent reports suggesting that the economy slowed in the first half of this 
year have convinced many bond traders that the Fed will not raise short-term 
interest rates before late August. 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment recently has given a boost to prices of fixed-income 
securities. Bond market players previously feared the Fed would raise rates 
soon. Higher rates on new securities erode the value of already-sold bonds and 
other securities that pay a fixed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tone of the market has turned constructive. The market is now assuming 
that the next tightening, at the earliest, would come probably in August or 
early September," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp. in 
Minneapolis 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term Treasury securities rose 1/8 point to 5/32 point and intermediate 
maturities rose 7/32 point to 13/32 point, the Telerate Inc. financial 
information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the currency market, rumors of unrest in North Korea provided a 
reason for technically motivated traders to exchange Japanese yen for dollars, 
currency dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rumors started the ball rolling, but people were already looking to buy 
dollars for technical reasons," said Zlatko Glamuzina, chief dealer for the New 
York branch of Banco di Sicilia. 
</P>
<P>
 Currency dealers described the dollar's performance as a temporary lull in a 
lengthy decline. Reports circulating in the markets that tensions in North 
Korea had escalated triggered heavy sales of yen, causing the dollar to rise in 
relation to its Japanese counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Commerce Department reported a widening of America's overall 
trade deficit in May -- to $9.17 billion from $8.5 billion in April -- the U.S. 
deficit with Japan narrowed nearly 20%, to $4.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts were doubtful, however, that the deficit figure represented a turning 
point in America's long-standing trade imbalance with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, currency dealers cheered the trade report, pushing up the dollar in New 
York to 99.25 Japanese yen from 98.35 yen late Monday. The dollar also gained 
against the German mark. It ended at 1.568 marks, up from 1.547 marks late 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, stocks retreated amid a flood of quarterly corporate earnings 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Banking and technology shares were hurt by concerns about profit reports from 
those industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue-chip Dow Jones average fell 7.12 to 3,748.31 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where volume was 251.54 million shares, up from 226.46 million shares 
traded Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, retreating issues outnumbered advancing ones 9 to 8 on 
the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks traded in a narrow range throughout the day as investors reacted to 
earnings reports from some of the largest companies. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE Corp, General Electric, Sprint and Amgen were among those posting 
better-than-expected earnings, and their stock prices rose accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earnings are coming in just about right, and there have been some nice 
positive surprises," said Bill Allyn, managing director at Jefferies & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was enough concern about earnings in certain sectors that 
investors ignored the drop in interest rates. Investors often bid stock prices 
higher when rates fall because that means corporations have to pay less for 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many companies showed good earnings, some reports contained nasty 
surprises that pushed down share prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel, for example, announced numbers late Monday that were in line with 
expectations but said profit margins shrank. Its stock fell 1 5/8 to 57 in 
Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 And at Citicorp, although earnings were strong, trading profits were 
significantly lower than in last year's second quarter. Most banks reporting 
have shown lower trading revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Intel and Citicorp profit reports weighed on the whole industry, and it 
didn't help that other companies, such as Signet Banking, Merrill Lynch and 
Lotus Development, also posted sour results. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, trading was lethargic. Analysts said many investors resisted dipping 
into stocks before Greenspan's testimony Wednesday before the Senate Banking 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Chase Manhattan slipped 2 3/8 to 36 3/8; Citicorp dropped 1 1/4 to 40 3/4; 
Signet Banking Corp. fell 4 3/8 to 36 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Biotechnology company Amgen Inc. rose 2 1/8 to 48 7/8 after its strong 
earnings prompted several Wall Street brokerages to upgrade their ratings on 
the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lotus Development shrank 5 5/8 to 33 1/8. The software company said product 
delays and pricing pressure hurt its second-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
 * Compaq, which is scheduled to announce earnings today, fell 1 1/4 to 33 1/4 
in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merrill Lynch retreated 7/8 to 36 1/4 after reporting second-quarter 
earnings of $1.18 a share, compared to $1.52 in the equivalent three months of 
last year. That was below market expectations of $1.36 a share for the period. 
</P>
<P>
 * PepsiCo was unchanged at 30 1/2. The company said second-quarter profit rose 
5%, a sub-par performance that reflected lagging profits from the company's 
restaurants and beverage business abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks rose abroad. Frankfurt share prices rose sharply in the last few 
minutes of trading, as players covered short positions. The market mood was 
buoyed by hope for a Bundesbank rate cut on Thursday. The 30-share DAX average 
closed 30.60 points higher at 2,128.79. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average ended 57.52 points higher, at 20,775.16; 
London's Financial Times 100-share average rose 9.3 points to 3,091.3. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexico City, the Bolsa index finished 18.96 points lower at 2,255.30. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq index, which is heavily weighted with technology shares, was hit 
hardest among the market's best-known barometers. It fell 3.30 to 719.32. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other major market indicators, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks 
fell 1.36 to 453.86, while the NYSE's composite index lost 0.55 to 250.89. At 
the American Stock Exchange, the market value index gained 1.31 to 433.90.

THE LATEST HOLLYWOOD FILM TREND: TROUBLE; MOVIES: MAJOR PROJECTS OFTEN HAVE 
PROBLEMS, BUT BALLOONING BUDGETS AND SKITTISH STARS APPEAR TO BE TEARING SOME 
HIGH-PROFILE PRODUCTIONS APART.

<P>
 Like comet fragments plunging into Jupiter, some big-budget movie projects are 
crashing all around Hollywood these days, some disappearing altogether, while 
others continue to tumble toward an unknown future. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest big-budget project in turmoil is the Warner Bros. action film 
"Under Siege II," which is tentatively set to begin filming in early August. 
The studio this week was denying reports that producer Jon Peters was leaving 
the project. Some of those involved in the film said otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the project say Peters doesn't feel he can make the movie 
with Steven Seagal, who starred in the original "Under Siege" blockbuster. Both 
men are said to like to be in control. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, another Peters-produced film at Columbia Pictures, "Money Train," 
starring Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson, is scheduled to go before cameras 
in October but has yet to hire a director. Sources say the two stars still 
aren't in agreement over who should direct the $40-million movie about two cops 
who decide to rob a subway train carrying a large amount of cash. Joseph Ruben 
("Sleeping With the Enemy") has had discussions with both actors but is not yet 
locked in. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not unusual for problems to surface in major projects, but now a number 
of high-profile movies seem to be coming apart at the last minute. Ballooning 
budgets have doomed some projects, but industry insiders say big stars are 
getting skittish about projects with unpolished scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 These actors command large sums because their names are often enough to open 
movies, but a number of this summer's star-driven films haven't done well at 
the box office. Kevin Costner in "Wyatt Earp" has earned only $21.6 million to 
date. "I Love Trouble" with Julia Roberts and Nick Nolte has made $23.1 
million, "Getting Even with Dad" starring Macaulay Culkin and Ted Danson has 
brought in $15.6 million, "Beverly Hills Cop III" with Eddie Murphy has earned 
$41 million and "City Slickers II" starring Billy Crystal has grossed $38.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many sour movies could lower a star's earning power because all the 
studios have to do is point to recent disappointing results. Therefore, the 
stars are paying particular attention to the written word and how their 
characters are portrayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's simply not enough to pay them a lot of money anymore," said 
entertainment attorney Peter Dekom. "A bad movie could hurt their earning 
capacity in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, several major box-office stars have dropped out of projects: 
</P>
<P>
 * Arnold Schwarzenegger found himself out of Carolco Pictures' 11th-Century 
action film, "Crusade," after Carolco and its foreign investors became alarmed 
at the prospects of the budget soaring over $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * Michael Douglas departed Carolco's "Cutthroat Island" two months before its 
start date. The official line was that Douglas was exhausted after shooting the 
Warner Bros. film "Disclosure." But sources said the real reason Douglas bailed 
was because co-star Geena Davis kept insisting that "Cutthroat" have a stronger 
female role, which would have upstaged Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jodie Foster stunned 20th Century Fox with her last-minute departure from 
the virus film "Crisis in the Hot Zone" because she was unhappy with the 
script, in which she felt the characters were not developed enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Redford, who is supposed to star in "Hot Zone," has given the writers 
and director Ridley Scott a date -- sometime this week -- to pull together the 
completed script. If they can't pull it off, he's out. Studio sources and those 
close to the star say if Redford bails out, it could sink the project 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is only distributing the picture and apparently has little, if any 
exposure. It is Scott's company that is producing and basically putting up the 
money. So, without major stars, he is expected to abandon the project. The only 
lead actress who keeps popping up as Foster's replacement is Robin Wright 
("Forrest Gump"). 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, which is in a high-stakes race with Warner Bros. to be the first out with 
a virus movie, faces a start date next Monday. Warner Bros. starts "Outbreak" 
with Dustin Hoffman, Morgan Freeman and Rene Russo the day before. Both are 
$40-million movies. 
</P>
<P>
 One Fox source said that "Hot Zone" has been plagued by "too many cooks in the 
kitchen" resulting in constantly changing scripts and direction. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hoberman, who heads production at Walt Disney Studios, said unpolished 
scripts often cause projects to stumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these movies are being wished for before the scripts are ready," 
Hoberman said. "It's possible that in their desire and frenzy for big movies, 
people may be gambling more than they should that it will all work out." 
</P>
<P>
 On the pirate movie "Cutthroat Island," the public relations line was that 
Douglas gave up the purported $12-million role because he was exhausted after 
completing the Warner Bros. film "Disclosure," where he worked 11 six-day 
weeks. He only had two weeks to rest and learn how to fence before he would 
begin the four-month "Cutthroat" shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 But those close to Douglas say his exit had more to do with who was getting 
additional screen time. They say Douglas wanted the picture to be more like the 
1984 romantic comedy "Romancing the Stone," in which he co-starred with 
Kathleen Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis wanted her character in "Cutthroat," which is being directed by her 
husband, Renny Harlin, to be similar to another pirate movie, "Mistress of the 
Seas," which Columbia put on the back burner last year because of costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiff between highly-paid Douglas, who walked off at the last minute, and 
Davis, who is expected to get about $3.5 million on her first film since the 
box-office flop "Angie," reveals how important stars view screen time. Davis 
wanted the bigger role. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with Davis carrying the lead role, sources say, is that she isn't 
considered a big draw overseas. The popularity of a star overseas is 
particularly critical to this film because 60% of the budget is coming from 
foreign investors who are banking on a worldwide name. 
</P>
<P>
 The big question some are asking is why didn't Carolco's chairman, Mario 
Kassar, dump Davis and Harlin, keep Douglas and let him bring in a new 
director? Nobody knows or can figure it out, and Kassar isn't talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Money is causing some films to fizzle before they even begin shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The plug was pulled on Oliver Stone's "Noriega" and "Evita" after projected 
costs soared into the stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is "Crusade," which was to star Schwarzenegger. Carolco's 
foreign investors, Canal Plus and Pioneer, who were financing the picture, had 
originally anticipated a budget of about $90 million. But then the expectation 
bounced to $120 million, and the partners balked and said keep it to $87 
million.

GETTING NEW LAUGHS OUT OF OLD MOVIES; IMPROV: L.A. CONNECTION RESHAPES 
'WRESTLING WOMEN' WITH A MIX OF COMEDY, SOUND EFFECTS AND MUSIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine a version of the film "The Blob" where the amorphous alien comes to 
Earth not as a hostile invader, but as a Henny Youngman-type comedian looking 
for a gig on "The Tonight Show." Or, how about a movie featuring Cyrano de 
Bergerac as a hard-luck fellow whose limited job skills reduce him to punching 
out the holes in doughnuts with his oversized schnoz. 
</P>
<P>
 No, these aren't old Mel Brooks screenplays that never reached fruition. 
Rather, they are multimedia presentations by the L.A. Connection comedy troupe, 
which reshapes old movies by dropping out their soundtracks and replacing them 
with live comedy dialogue, sound effects and music. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past dozen years, the L.A. Connection's irreverent actor-writers have 
navigated a host of campy and classic film characters through a variety of 
outrageous new situations. In many cases, the group's rewrites contain only a 
tangential connection to the films' original plots and characters. (During 
screenings, the actors- who are accompanied by a keyboard player -- sit in the 
front of the theater with microphones.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody does what we do in a way," says actor-writer Kent Skov, who is also 
the founder and director of the L.A. Connection. "We all sit at home and 
comment on what we see on TV. That's why watching this process is so much fun. 
It's kind of like living out the (outlandish) thoughts and scenarios that go 
through people's minds while they watch TV or movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight at the Nuart Theatre, the troupe will present its version of the 1962 
film, "Wrestling Women vs. the Aztec Mummy." This obscure piece of cinema is 
every bit as cheesy as its title suggests. In the original film, a mummy rises 
from the dead and attempts to reclaim a necklace taken from its crypt by a team 
of women wrestlers. In the L.A. Connection version, Skov and company up the 
camp quotient by throwing into the film's wrestling motif a wedding, a 
honeymoon at a theme park called Aztecland, a love-struck mummy and a stream of 
wacky jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This performance will represent the sixth time the L.A. Connection has tackled 
"Wrestling Women vs. the Aztec Mummy." But like all its films that receive 
repeat performances, the script will be updated to reflect current social 
topics. 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Connection delivered its first live film presentation in 1982. It 
occurred after Terry Thoren, who was then an executive of the Landmark Theater 
chain, asked the group to do a performance of the 1958 B movie, "Attack of the 
50 Ft. Woman," at the old Fox Venice theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only had one week to prepare for that performance," recalls Skov. "There 
wasn't a videotape of the movie available, so we had to rent a 16mm projector 
to use during rehearsals. It was a nightmare trying to wind the projector back 
and forth" so they could map out the dialogue for each scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we sold out the performance and did an encore three weeks later to 600 
people. We figured we had something exciting because we couldn't always sell 
out 40 or 45 seats in our own theater (in Sherman Oaks) doing conventional 
improv comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the L.A. Connection has turned film dubbing into a virtual art 
form. The troupe tailors its dialogue so that it closely matches the lip 
movements of the characters on the screen. This can be a laborious process, 
says Skov, since the group is trying to achieve this sense of reality while 
attempting to develop a script that's involving and funny. 
</P>
<P>
 The improv group also tries to keep each of its performances under 90 minutes. 
With some longer films, Skov will take out an entire 20-minute reel rather than 
selectively edit a work in a way that some might find objectionable. 
</P>
<P>
 However, during a performance of the film "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," a 
projectionist once included and excluded the wrong reels. This left the actors 
scrambling to whip up new dialogue on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A similar predicament developed during a presentation of "Andy Warhol's 
Frankenstein." 
</P>
<P>
 "We had planned to do the R-rated version of the movie but (the distributor) 
sent us the X-rated version by mistake," remembers Skov. "Because we had 
screened the uncut X-rated version a couple of times prior to deciding to do 
the R-rated version, we were familiar with some of the additional scenes that 
came up. But it was a shock that we had to improvise for 20 minutes. Boy, that 
really threw us for a loop!" 
</P>
<P>
 Skov feels the L.A. Connection is actually better known and appreciated in a 
number of cities outside of the Los Angeles area. Thanks to the group's 
television appearances, it has managed to develop solid followings in cities 
such as Detroit, Tucson and Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The improv group first gained national attention in 1983 when it landed a 
regular spot dubbing film clips on Alan Thicke's short-lived "Thicke of the 
Night" variety show. Two years later it had its own syndicated TV series called 
"Mad Movies." But poor ratings contributed to the program's demise in 1986, 
though episodes of the group's dubbed movies did subsequently reappear on 
several cable networks. Last November, the Arts & Entertainment Network also 
aired a one-hour L.A. Connection special called "Movie Madness Mystery." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would absolutely love to do more TV," Skov says. "We've done syndicated and 
cable TV. A network series would be the last step. If we got that kind of 
exposure, we would be that close to becoming a household name." 
</P>
<P>
 * The L.A. Connection will perform "Wrestling Women vs. the Aztec Mummy" 
tonight at the Nuart Theatre, 11272 Santa Monica Blvd., West Los Angeles , at 8 
p.m. Admission $10. Information: (310) 478-6379 or (818) 784-1868.

'SOMEONE WHO'LL WATCH' IS SOMETHING ELSE; AT OLD GLOBE THEATRE, THREE FINE 
ACTORS SHINE IN A SHOW THAT SERVES AS A HISTORICAL REMINDER AND A TALE OF HOW 
WE KEEP EACH OTHER'S SPIRITS ALIVE ON A DAILY BASIS.

 "Someone Who'll Watch Over Me," Frank McGuinness' 1992 Off Broadway show about 
a British professor, Irish journalist and American doctor held hostage in a 
Beirut basement, is the ultimate actor's showcase. 
</P>
<P>
 From the West End to Off Broadway to its California premiere at South Coast 
Repertory in March, McGuinness' question of how three men can survive the 
boredom of months of being chained to a basement wall has transposed into the 
theatrical question of how three chained actors can hold our attention for 
nearly two hours on a minimal stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the skilled and sensitive direction of Sheldon Epps at the Old Globe 
Theatre, Cotter Smith's verbally adroit Irishman, Richard Easton's 
literature-loving Englishman and Terry Alexander's passionate American do just 
that in this intermissionless version of the play. They mesmerize, even though 
McGuinness doesn't plunge deeply enough into any of his characters . . . and 
particularly lacks authenticity in the dialogue of the black American (but in 
McGuinness' defense, the part wasn't written as a black role, even though it 
has been cast as such in the three productions). 
</P>
<P>
 Though neither director nor cast can solve what's lacking in the play, these 
impeccable performers help the show, at times, to realize its potential both as 
a reminder not just of the at least 88 hostages who disappeared in Lebanon in 
the 1980s, but as a cautionary tale of how we keep each other's spirits alive 
on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 The prisoners watch over each other as we all watch over those whose lives we 
touch, keeping each other from madness and despair with the most important 
tools humankind has yet developed -- laughter, love and imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 McGuinness, an Irish playwright, is clearly most at home in his portrait of 
the Irish journalist, and Smith's charged performance realizes not only his 
character's love of language, but also his anger and anguish. He sends his 
words shooting and shimmering, like pebbles skipping on the water, even as he 
puts a haunting spin and shadow on the lightest of wordplay. 
</P>
<P>
 Easton, an Old Globe associate artist, and one of the treasures of that 
company, captures the sheer terror of the newest member of the incarcerated 
team, a freshly caught, apolitical devotee of poetry. He navigates the journey 
of grief from denial to anger, frustration, bargaining and acceptance with 
inspiring and dignified grace. 
</P>
<P>
 But the words McGuinness crafts for Adam fall falsely on American ears, in 
part because he makes him simplistically proud of his country. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Irishman rails about hundreds of years of Irish oppression and the 
British professor uses Scarlett O'Hara's Irish ancestry as a basis for a theory 
that the Irish were pro-slavery in the American Civil War, the playwright gives 
the American nothing to say. But, as if compensation for such a glaring 
omission, Alexander conjures up unwritten depths that make his pain palpable, 
staring at them as if he finds their conversation unbelievable and is struck 
mute by his own consuming fear of death. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One element the Old Globe has over the SCR production (which for some reason 
inserted an intermission) is the sense of imminent danger it conveys. Within 
the suffocating confines of Greg Lucas' bleak basement set, there is one 
opening -- suggestive of a door -- to which the rag-clad hostages steal a 
glance, radiating fear of their captors looking in on them and listening to 
them. The presence of threat suffuses even the hostages' most fanciful moments 
with desperation and anguish. 
</P>
<P>
 In the New York staging, each actor had a leg chained to the wall. Here, the 
wrists are chained, allowing more movement. Of course, if you want to consider 
the real chains of the play, look to McGuinness' own limited understanding of 
who these people are. And yet, it would be a mistake to dismiss this as a mere 
acting exercise, for despite the play's lapses, it has moments of taking 
flight, eloquently underlined by Michael Gilliam's mood-enhancing lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Go with it, follow the looks sometimes more than the words, feel the different 
stages of grief as projected by these fine performers and, for at least a few 
moments, you may just get a whiff of the sadness and salvation of the human 
condition.

'BEST LITTLE WHOREHOUSE': UNRISQUE BUSINESS; THE FULLERTON CIVIC LIGHT OPERA 
PRODUCTION IS A BIT TOO TAME, ALTHOUGH IT SUCCEEDS IN CREATING THE BROTHEL'S 
LOOK AND SURROUNDING ENVIRONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Fullerton Civic Light Opera was reportedly so worried about the sauciness 
of "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" that it pruned most of the dirty words 
and warned subscribers about the musical's suggestiveness. Only in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this bit of pre-show nervousness, director Lara Teeter assured 
everybody that the production's raciness would be in place -- at least the 
costumes were bound to be sexy. He's right; they sort of are. It's just too bad 
little else is. 
</P>
<P>
 The revival that opened at the Plummer Auditorium over the weekend makes you 
wonder why season ticket-holders had to be notified in the first place. This is 
a tame staging that could use more than hot outfits; it craves a flush of 
winking salaciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, we're offered a glimpse of skin, even a derriere now and then, but it's 
only a bottom-jerk reaction to the show's country-fried primal impulses. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1978 musical celebrates the "Chicken Ranch," a historic Texas brothel that 
took its name because post-Depression patrons were allowed to pay for services 
with poultry. The cathouse had flourished since the 1840s but ran into trouble 
in 1973 when a TV evangelist and his local-yokel vigilantes, "The Watch Dogs," 
managed to shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
 This show by Carol Hall (music and lyrics) and Peter Masterson and Larry L. 
King (book) doesn't rise beyond the mediocre -- unspectacular tunes and a 
predictable story line -- but it proved popular, running for more than 1,500 
performances on Broadway. And it took to the big screen in the 1982 movie with 
Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton staging is most successful in creating the brothel's look and 
surrounding environs. The sets, borrowed from the Riverside Civic Light Opera, 
may not be original, but they are professional and more than satisfy the 
musical's needs. The Chicken Ranch parlor, with its slightly gaudy visuals and 
peeks into the welcoming darkness of the back rooms, is the much-used 
centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Give lighting designer Donna Ruzika much of the credit for bringing an 
occasional whiff of decadence to the production. At times, the lighting seems 
downright smoky, just like any good red-light district is suppose to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are Mela Hoyt-Heydon's costumes, a grab bag of fishnet, leather 
fringe and chaps, and snuggly tight bodices. Not as risque as touted, but they 
do draw the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whorehouse" stars Eileen Barnett as Miss Mona, the ranch's madam. Barnett, 
who's appeared in several TV programs, including "Knots Landing," plays the 
role of the knowing courtesan well enough but could bring more heat to the 
characterization. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This would especially help in sparking a flame between Mona and Darrell 
Sandeen's Sheriff Dodd, the sympathetic lawman who once was her lover. Sandeen 
has the gritty looks and style of a veteran desert rat, but that only goes so 
far here. He does have one of the show's more interesting singing voices, 
though. 
</P>
<P>
 For straightforward gag-relief, the Light Opera turns to B.W. Wiff as the 
pompadoured Melvin P. Thorpe. His caricature of the preacher who's eager to 
bring down the ranch once and for all is as broad as a Texas landscape -- in 
other words, the kind of yuk-yuk clown endemic to so many comic musicals.

 Harry Carey Jr. will be on hand to autograph his "Company of Heroes: My Life 
in the John Ford Stock Company" when "The Trail of '98," which featured his 
father, screens Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Silent Movie Friday, 611 
N. Fairfax Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1928 spectacle, directed by Clarence Brown and in which Harry Carey played 
the villain, traces with documentary-like fidelity, a grueling journey to the 
Klondike Gold Rush in the Yukon. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Carey, those who endure blizzards, raging rivers, an avalanche 
and a climactic Dawson saloon fire are a stalwart Ralph Forbes and a demure 
Dolores Del Rio. It includes pre-earthquake stock footage of San Francisco's 
original Palace Hotel. KEVIN THOMAS

 RODEO'S FRIEND: The new movie "It Could Happen to You" is about winning the 
lottery. So the California Lottery people are promoting it with a new media 
blitz. Included is a mention of Christene Lentz, 26, of Capistrano Beach, who 
picked up $19.58 million for a winning lotto ticket almost seven years ago. . . 
. Say the lottery people: Lentz first bought a BMW convertible, "then headed 
for Rodeo Drive." Since then she's bought four homes, a yacht, a doll shop, and 
has made major contributions to the Children's Miracle Network.

 SAFE WHEELS ONLY: Can you really get upset with a movie like "Lassie"? Yes, 
says the Cypress-based Yamaha Motor Corp. The company is unhappy with a 
Paramount Pictures' "Lassie" promotion showing a youngster who pops a wheelie 
while riding a Yamaha ATV off-road vehicle . . . "It is not a safe use of the 
vehicle," says Yamaha spokesman Roy Watson. "Running that promotion is a 
disservice to children watching. We do not recommend wheelies." No response yet 
from Paramount.

SLAYING SUSPECT ELUDES MANHUNT; HOMICIDE: POLICE SAY OXNARD MAN WANTED IN DEATH 
OF SOCCER COACH MAY HAVE FLED TO MEXICO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 An Oxnard man suspected of slaying a respected soccer coach has eluded a 
police manhunt for more than a week, and authorities say he may have sought 
refuge with relatives in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're only 175 miles from the border," said Oxnard police spokesman David 
Keith. "Any time you have a suspect like this, you have to entertain that 
notion." 
</P>
<P>
 Police are looking for Armando Rivas Balderama, 20, a known gang member who 
was arrested but not prosecuted two years ago for allegedly shooting at rival 
gang members. Although Balderama is an American citizen born in this country, 
he has extended family in Mexico, Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is suspected of gunning down 35-year-old Roberto Calderon Leyva outside a 
south Oxnard pizza parlor on July 10. Witnesses told police that the 
confrontation took place after Balderama accused Leyva of staring at his 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
 A judge issued a warrant for Balderama's arrest on July 13, but police have 
been unable to locate the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we just don't know where he is," Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two detectives are working on the case full time, authorities said Tuesday. In 
addition, 160 patrol officers have a photograph of the suspect and have been 
informed of his hangouts, Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-dozen tips called in about Balderama's whereabouts have lead to dead 
ends, Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're waiting for someone to call and say they've seen him," the police 
spokesman said. "We're doing everything we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Leyva's widow and two children witnessed the shooting, and are trying to cope 
with their loss but remain fearful as long as the suspect is at large, said 
Esperanza Gonzalez, one of the victim's seven sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 But she expressed confidence in the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to catch him sooner or later," Gonzalez said. "It may take a 
couple of days or longer, but they will catch him." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez paused, then said: "They need to catch him, because he's going to do 
it again to another innocent family." 
</P>
<P>
 Leyva's survivors have begun psychological counseling to deal with their 
grief, Gonzalez said. The rest of Leyva's family have vowed to do whatever they 
can to support the young widow, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are suffering," she said. "We still can't believe it happened. But we are 
very close and we are trying to work together to help her." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Leyva was eating pizza with his family about 6:30 p.m. when Balderama 
apparently became upset because Leyva looked at Veronica Balderama, the 
suspect's 23-year-old sister, police said. The two men exchanged words and both 
parties were asked to leave the restaurant by a manager, police and witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The altercation continued as Leyva and his family reached the parking lot. 
Balderama then pulled out a gun, shot Leyva in the stomach and fled the scene 
with his sister, police said. Leyva died 10 hours later at St. John's Regional 
Medical Center in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Balderama was arrested that night on suspicion of aiding a fugitive, 
and police found Armando's pickup truck at his home. 
</P>
<P>
 An elderly man who answered the door at Balderama's residence in south Oxnard 
Tuesday said he did not know the suspect's whereabouts. The man, who would not 
give his name, said the family has relatives in Chihuahua, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he didn't think Armando would go there. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was born here," the man said. "Mexico is not his home."

HUNTSINGERS BOW OUT OF VENTURA AVE. PROJECT; DEVELOPMENT: THE MOVE SURPRISES 
LANDOWNERS' PARTNERS. IT ALSO THREATENS THE FUTURE OF PROJECT, WHICH WAS 
OPPOSED BY NEIGHBORING SMALL BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Stunning Ventura city leaders and their own business partners, a local 
landowning family announced Tuesday that they are dropping out of a huge 
private redevelopment effort on Ventura Avenue, possibly putting the entire 
project in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not participate in a project which is a financial liability to our 
business neighbors on Ventura Avenue and Stanley Avenue," wrote Carl F. 
Huntsinger in a two-page letter to Ventura Mayor Tom Buford. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with the Neel family and Kinko's Service Corp., Carl Huntsinger and 
his brother Fritz had proposed building 200 homes, office buildings, bike paths 
and parks on a 77-acre lot north of Stanley Avenue, south of Seneca Street, and 
west of Ventura Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The site is now a jumble of vacant lots, citrus groves, auto salvage yards and 
industries servicing the oil industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Ventura City Council members said they were startled by the Huntsingers' 
decision to pull out of the project, which would upgrade the city's west end 
without costing the city money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big disappointment," said Councilman Steve Bennett. "I called Carl 
Huntsinger and asked him if there was anything the city could do (to change his 
mind), and he said, 'No.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The way the site is laid out, the Huntsinger family owns a narrow, seven-acre 
strip across the property's northern end. The Neel family owns the adjoining 26 
acres to the south, and Kinko's holds the deed to the 22 acres south of the 
Neel property. 
</P>
<P>
 A strip of industrial businesses lines the area's southeast perimeter, 
bordering Stanley and Ventura avenues. The Huntsinger family owns a few of 
these small parcels but most of the land belongs to small business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Neel, one of the partners in the development deal, said he had no idea 
the Huntsingers would drop out of the project until Carl Huntsinger called him 
at 8:30 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was absolutely flabbergasted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Neel said he intends to press ahead with the project and hopes Kinko's 
also will stay committed to the development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything we've ever said is unchanged," he said. "I think it's something 
that's needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Neel said since his family owns 73% of the proposed residential portion of the 
site, he will ask the council to give him 73% of the original housing 
allocations he requested -- in other words, permission to build 146 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the council is scheduled to award housing allocations for the first 
time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members said they fear that Kinko's would now back out, too. One 
reason the city staff and council members have been so excited about this 
project is that Kinko's officials say if it goes through, they will stay in 
Ventura and expand their national corporate headquarters on the land they own 
north of Stanley Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, however, Kinko's officials said they are committed to the project 
only as it was originally proposed, with the city rezoning all the industrial 
properties on the site to light-industrial and commercial use. Existing 
businesses would be allowed to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But small business owners said they worry that they will ultimately be forced 
out of the area and have spent months lobbying the developers to drop their 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, 14 of these small business owners threatened to file a lawsuit if 
the development went forward. They have complained for months that the proposal 
before the city was designed to surround them with neighbors who would find 
their noisy, smelly industries distasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alone, the City Council and the Planning Commission were not going to listen 
to us," said Bob Casey, owner of OCO Tool Company. "They had their minds made 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 So Casey and neighboring businesses hired environmental lawyer Glen Reiser, 
who began digging and soon came up with charges of possible chemical 
contaminants on the northernmost Huntsinger property.  
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, Reiser met with the Huntsingers' attorney, Lindsay Nielson. 
Tuesday morning, the Huntsingers said that after five years of working to put 
the deal together, they wanted out. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Huntsinger said he and his brother have been troubled for weeks over the 
complaints pouring in from their longtime colleagues on the Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were raised on the Avenue," said Huntsinger, who now manages family citrus 
groves in Ojai. "Our father started his business on the Avenue in 1921 and some 
of our neighbors now used to be our suppliers. We felt we had an allegiance to 
these people." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntsinger said he also decided to pull out because of opposition from the 
city's planning commissioners. Some commissioners have said they think the 
200-home community is poorly designed or should not be included in the overall 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the City Council often makes final decisions on major projects and most 
council members say they want the project to go forward.  
</P>
<P>
 Huntsinger said it was largely a coincidence that he and his brother changed 
their minds only days after his attorney met with the business owners' 
attorney. But by hiring a lawyer, he acknowledged, "they were a little more 
organized than they had been before." 
</P>
<P>
 But Planning Commissioner Ted Temple, who has criticized the project as 
incompatible with the surrounding area, said he thinks Huntsinger just bowed to 
legal threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they started looking at the possibility of a real controversy 
surrounding hazardous waste sites," he speculated, "that's when they said, 
'Let's get out.' "

VENTURA MAY COLLECT 'GREEN WASTE'; RECYCLING: A PROPOSAL TO BE CONSIDERED BY 
COUNCIL MONDAY WOULD HELP THE CITY MEET A STATE MANDATE BY SENDING LESS 
MATERIAL TO LANDFILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura households would get a third waste can for yard clippings and pay an 
average of $2.18 more per month for trash pickup under a proposal approved 
Tuesday by a City Council committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The new "green-waste" recycling program, to be considered by the full council 
on Monday, would go into effect Oct. 10 and would help the city meet a state 
requirement to reduce landfill waste. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30% of the city's waste is yard clippings, said Councilman Steve 
Bennett, chairman of the three-member Environmental Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The yard clippings would be picked up every other week, alternating with 
recyclable waste that is now collected each week, but would then be rounded up 
only twice a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's trash hauler, E.J. Harrison and Sons Inc., would transport the yard 
clippings to Cal-Wood Recycling/Agromin in Camarillo. Once there, the waste 
would be recycled into a material applied to freeway embankments to prevent the 
growth of weeds. The material eventually decomposes to soil, Bennett said. He 
said the clippings are also recycled into some other materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett predicted the new recycling program would bring a dramatic decrease in 
the amount of city waste sent to Ventura County landfills. The decrease, he 
said, would help bolster efforts to comply with a state law requiring that 
landfill waste be reduced by 25% by 1995 and by 50% by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai has already implemented a program to recycle yard clippings, and several 
other cities around the county are planning to start similar programs soon, 
Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's proposal includes some restructuring of recycling rates that would 
also increase fees for commercial businesses that recycle, said Assistant City 
Manager Steve Chase, the city's environmental coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase said the restructuring is being recommended because residents were 
paying more than their share in processing fees for recycling, while commercial 
businesses were paying less than what it costs to recycle their garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past we've been having (residents) sort of subsidize commercial," said 
committee member Councilman Greg Carson. "Now we're going to have everybody pay 
their own way."  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the average increase per household of $2.18 under the proposal, Chase 
said about 25% of residents would see a decrease in their monthly trash 
collection fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Because yard clippings that used to be stuffed in the green trash bin will now 
be put in a separate brown container, those residents will be able to use 
smaller trash collection bins that do not cost as much for trash pickup. 
Residents have a blue bin for other recyclables. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development Tuesday, the Environmental Committee voted to 
investigate whether to charge E.J. Harrison Inc. $76,000 that city officials 
said the company has failed to bill its industrial customers since Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee postponed a decision on whether the city should absorb the 
$76,000 -- driving trash pickup rates even higher -- or the Harrison company 
should take the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Harrison company has "some new information that they have ways to 
offset the costs. But nobody knows what it is yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Kahn, an attorney for Harrison, said his company had undercharged 
industrial customers for waste pickup since January because the company did not 
catch a provision in a city resolution ordering an increase in some industrial 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said E.J. Harrison Inc.'s accountant believes the city overestimated 
the amount of industrial waste the company had recycled in the last six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe once we explain it, there won't be any shortfall," he said.

VENTURA COUNCIL PUTS POLI STREET MEASURE ON BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura voters will decide this November whether Poli Street, which bisects 
the Ventura High School campus, should be closed during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous vote just after 1 a.m. Tuesday, the Ventura City Council agreed 
to put the initiative on this year's ballot. The action rewarded the measure's 
dogged supporters, who fell 243 short of the 8,589 petition signatures needed 
to qualify the issue for a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to settle it one way or the other," said a relieved Verna 
Thompson, who worked for months gathering signatures. "This should not go on 
forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative demands that the city open Poli Street, a road that runs 
parallel to Main Street and slices right through the north end of the Ventura 
High campus. The measure also calls for removing the newly installed gates at 
Palomar Avenue and Sunset Drive, two through roads farther up the hillside from 
Poli Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted last August to shut off Poli to through traffic during 
school hours, after 150 people crowded the council chambers to argue the issue 
for hours. Since traffic increased on nearby roads, the council also closed 
Palomar and Sunset later in the fall, galvanizing some residents of those 
streets to join the initiative effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, students and school officials say blocking off Poli protects students 
from random violence as they cross campus and reduces the cacophony of rushing 
autos and honking horns that drifts into the classrooms bordering the road. 
</P>
<P>
 But neighboring hillside residents insist that the closure creates unbearable 
gridlock on nearby streets. Also, they argue, closing the streets makes it 
harder for emergency vehicles to reach residents in a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the council said they favor closing Poli Street as a temporary 
solution to the problem, but agreed to put the measure on the ballot in the 
hope of settling the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Joseph Spirito, superintendent of the Ventura Unified School District, 
said he would not oppose putting the issue to the electorate. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you move this onto the '94 ballot," Spirito told the council, "we will 
support that and do everything we can to move this to a closure." 
</P>
<P>
 Activists gathered enough signatures to place the initiative on the 1995 
ballot, which will be an official city election and a petition needs signatures 
from only 10% of all registered voters. But this fall's election is not a city 
election, so a ballot measure requires signatures from 15% of the city's 
registered voters to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Poli Street initiative falling just short of that 15%, only the 
council could move the issue onto the ballot in November.

SAN DIEGAN TOP CHOICE FOR CHIEF; SERVICES: JAMES E. SEWELL NAMED TO TAKE OVER 
BELEAGUERED COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT. SUPERVISORS WILL VOTE NEXT WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A San Diego deputy fire chief was named Tuesday to take over the beleaguered 
Ventura County Fire Department, where the last chief retired amid criticism 
that the agency costs too much. 
</P>
<P>
 James E. Sewell, a 24-year veteran of the San Diego Fire Department, is top 
choice to replace retired Chief George Lund next month, said Chief 
Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg. The Board of Supervisors is set to 
vote on the choice next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewell, 45, said he was not aware that a Ventura County audit in October said 
his new department is top-heavy with managers, too free with overtime pay and 
lax with sick leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor, Sewell said, was he told that Lund left in March the day after the 
supervisors refused to give the 443-member Ventura County Fire Department any 
of the money that Proposition 172 allots for emergency agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sewell said: "Regardless of what they've been through. . .I want the folks 
in the department and the folks on the board and the folks in the community to 
be proud of the department. If they're not, that's something I'll have to 
address." 
</P>
<P>
 Sewell's colleagues say he is well-prepared for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has not only a lot of insight, but he has a lot of energy and he believes 
in doing quality work and supporting his people," said Deputy Chief Monica 
Higgins, San Diego's fire marshal. "That philosophy can go a long way, 
especially in this type of environment when budgets are tight." 
</P>
<P>
 Sewell helped his department plug into a $34-million computer-aided dispatch 
system linking San Diego's police and fire departments, Higgins said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also improved public relations in the fire marshal's office, she said. 
Sewell extended hours at the front desk and staffed it full-time with 
inspectors who could check building contractors' plans on demand, streamlining 
the application process, she said. He also computerized the process for 
figuring how many sprinklers are needed in new buildings, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Sewell wrote a bid to have San Diego firefighters provide citywide 
paramedic services -- a campaign that lost to a private ambulance company only 
because of city politics, said Fire Chief Robert Osby. About one third of the 
city's fire stations provide paramedic service. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did an absolutely outstanding job in coordinating the material and making 
the presentation, and the outcome was a political decision rather than a 
business decision," Osby said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sewell also has the respect of the San Diego firefighters union president, who 
cited his professionalism and hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a very strong work ethic, and he's a very motivated individual," 
said Ron Saathoffpresident of International Firefighters Union (AFL-CIO) Local 
145. "I really don't know Chief Sewell personally, but he's a guy who's always 
strived to do the best job he can and continue his education, with the ultimate 
goal of being fire chief some day. I think that's been a career goal of his 
from the earliest days in the Fire Department." 
</P>
<P>
 If Sewell has a failing, it is that he can appear overly serious, Chief Osby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to come up with something and say there's improvement needed, I'd 
say, 'Hey, lighten up, guy,' " Osby said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's all business, and if you don't understand him and the way he is, you'd 
say maybe he doesn't have the warmth and the glow and the wonderful, 
approachable personality you'd want anyone to have," Osby said. "But once you 
know him, you know that's not true." 
</P>
<P>
 As head of San Diego's 42 fire stations and overseer of the department's 
operations division, Sewell said he has seen plenty of brush fires and 
bare-bones budgets like those he expects to face in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm aware that every government agency in the state has financial 
difficulties," he said. "San Diego has those, San Diego County has those, and 
I'm sure Ventura County -- unless they've struck gold or something -- they've 
got those problems too." 
</P>
<P>
 Sewell was chosen from a pool of 17 candidates that a headhunting firm plucked 
out of many more applicants for the job, Wittenberg said. The supervisors 
identified about six top candidates from the pool, and five -- including Sewell 
-- were interviewed by Wittenberg and Supervisors Maggie Kildee and Vicky 
Howard.

SUMMER SCHOOL ENROLLMENT DECLINES; EDUCATION: SIMI OFFICIALS ATTRIBUTE DROP TO 
FEWER COURSES, QUAKE'S EFFECT. CONEJO EDUCATORS CITE A RESTRUCTURING OF 
CLASSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For the second straight year, summer school enrollment in Simi Valley has 
dropped by more than 100 high school students, a decline educators have 
attributed in part to changing course offerings and the need to take time off 
after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials in the Conejo Valley have also reported a decrease in high 
school enrollment for summer school, but said the numbers are probably the 
result of course restructuring that has alleviated a need for some students to 
take summer courses. 
</P>
<P>
 At Royal High School, where students from Simi Valley's two high schools 
attend summer classes, 984 students registered for summer school this year. 
</P>
<P>
 That number has dropped from 1,123 students registered in 1993 and 1,232 in 
1992, Simi Valley district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's down and we're not sure why," Assistant Supt. Susan C. Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many students -- and their families -- may still be recovering from January's 
quake, which caused extensive damage at Simi Valley High School, some officials 
suggested. "It might just have to do with people being weary in general," Parks 
speculated. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Love, summer school principal at Royal High School, agreed. "Part of 
it is the earthquake this year. A lot of people still have houses in 
disrepair." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley is offering fewer courses this year -- another possible factor 
contributing to the enrollment drop, Love said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always have this base of kids who need summer school to make up classes," 
Love explained. "It is the other kids, the more motivated students who want to 
get ahead, those are the ones we're not seeing as many of because we are not 
offering the classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer social studies courses, such as history and government, are being 
offered this year in Simi Valley because educators determined that summer 
sessions do not provide enough time for a thorough study of the material. 
</P>
<P>
 "The push is not to cover vast amounts of material but to go in-depth," Love 
said. "We looked at some kids and their preparation and noticed that social 
studies classes in summer school were not providing the in-depth education in 
six weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Although many elementary schools continue to offer arts, crafts and other 
enrichment classes during the summer, many high schools focus on academic 
courses such as math or economics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally in summer school you could take arts and crafts and all kinds 
of fun stuff," Love said. "But summer school has become more of an opportunity 
for students to make up (failed courses) and remediate their skills." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Conejo Valley Unified School District, summer school enrollment is down 
for different reasons, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are about 100 less from last year," said Max Beaman, summer school 
principal at Newbury Park High School, which has about 960 students enrolled 
from the district's four high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The decrease, he said, is largely due to students no longer needing to take 
academic classes in the summer to make room for elective courses during the 
regular school year. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of Newbury Park High School's course restructuring last year, some 
elective classes are now offered before classes during the regular school year, 
eliminating the need for students to take summer classes to get ahead, Beaman 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Fewer) of the Newbury Park kids are going to summer school because of that," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Simi Valley, however, a need to juggle class schedules is one reason 
students are enrolling in summer school. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen-year-old Dennis Marsh is taking a government class this summer because 
he wants to take Spanish -- a class in which he "didn't do so hot" -- in the 
fall. Marsh said he knows students who are taking summer classes to make room 
for other courses during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a few of us that are in music who are taking classes," he said, 
referring to band members like himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsh, who will be a senior at Royal High School in the fall, said negotiating 
his classes doesn't bother him. "I think the scheduling works out fairly well," 
he said.

2 MORE CASES OF 'FLESH-EATING' STREP BACTERIA REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two more cases of the so-called "flesh-eating bacteria" have cropped up in 
Ventura County in the past week, a situation doctors attribute more to 
coincidence than to an outbreak of the virulent strep infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Just hours after a Fillmore woman was rushed into special therapy Friday, an 
Illinois woman visiting Thousand Oaks was admitted to Los Robles Regional 
Medical Center suffering from the condition, which physicians call "necrotizing 
fasciitis." 
</P>
<P>
 And on Tuesday, a Camarillo man already at Los Robles for an infection 
developed symptoms of the flesh-killing disorder and was transferred to the 
hospital's hyperbaric medicine center. There, all three patients are receiving 
pure oxygen treatments designed to stop the bacteria's spread. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three patients doesn't make an epidemic or a pandemic," said J. B. Wilmeth, 
the physician in charge of the specialized treatment center. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilmeth, who treats five to eight such cases each year, said it is not unusual 
for the symptoms to develop in the heat of the summer. He also noted that all 
three patients have health conditions making them susceptible to the bacterial 
disorder, which is caused by streptococcus and other germs. 
</P>
<P>
 The bacteria, which might cause a sore throat in one victim, can kill off skin 
and tissue in others, he said. Typically that happens when there is a breakdown 
in the system, a cut in the skin or a lapse in the immune or circulatory 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, a small sore will develop into a gaping lesion that can require skin 
grafts or amputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really, rarely, if at all, happens in healthy individuals," said Wilmeth. 
He said he could not account for the recent case of a Santa Barbara triathlete, 
Bernard Donner, 35, who nearly lost a leg to the disorder. 
</P>
<P>
 But the three Ventura County cases are easier to understand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital did not release the names of the two latest victims, but Wilmeth 
said the 49-year-old Camarillo man suffered from diabetes and the 73-year-old 
Illinois woman had circulatory problems in her legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalupe Pulidocq, the 63-year-old Fillmore woman transferred from Santa 
Paula Memorial Hospital on Friday, also suffers from diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido has since undergone several rounds of treatment in Los Robles' 
hyperbaric chamber, a pressurized cylinder that allows doctors to administer 
doses of pure oxygen. The oxygen kills the bacteria and strengthens the healthy 
cells around the sore. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulido's sore, which began as a pimple on her thigh, extended from her groin 
to her knee when she arrived at the hospital Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is doing marvelously and we're trying to decide when to transfer her back 
to Santa Paula," Wilmeth said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The three patients show a different mix of bacteria causing the infections, 
more evidence that the cases are not related to any sudden outbreak of the 
strep bacteria in the county, he said.

BUILDER SEEKS EXEMPTION ON HOME LIMITS; MOORPARK: THREE CITY COUNCILMEN WOULD 
APPROVE MOVE TO AVOID LAWSUIT. BUT SLOW-GROWTH ADVOCATES OBJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A majority of the Moorpark City Council wants to exempt a major home builder 
from newly proposed limits on homes built each year, prompting an outcry from 
some slow-growth advocates. 
</P>
<P>
 Three councilmen said they support exempting Carlsberg Financial Corp. from 
any future limits on growth that would affect the company's plans to build 550 
homes in the southeast corner of town. They say such an exemption is the only 
way to end legal confrontations with the Santa Monica-based developer. 
</P>
<P>
 But growth-control advocates are accusing council members of caving in to 
pressure from the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three of them are a bunch of wimps," said former City Councilman Clint 
Harper, who helped draft Measure F, the city's existing growth control 
ordinance in 1986.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think they do great damage by excluding the largest acting developer within 
city limits," he said. "They're showing no judgment and very little backbone. I 
shudder to think what kind of consideration other projects will receive, when 
you have three councilmen running scared every time a developer even says, 
'Boo.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The matter comes up for consideration at tonight's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Paul Lawrason, Councilmen Bernardo Perez and Scott Montgomery support 
making the Carlsberg development exempt from any future changes in the city's 
1986 slow-growth ordinance, which expires at the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 An eight-member committee of council members, planning commissioners and 
residents are now working on a draft law to replace Measure F. The present 
draft would reduce the number of building permits issued each year from 270 to 
250. 
</P>
<P>
 And, perhaps more importantly to developers, the draft changes would limit the 
number of unused allocations for building permits that a developer could carry 
over into future years. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members say the changes would even the pace of development, making 
it steadier from year to year. 
</P>
<P>
 But developers say that the economy dictates the amount of building and they 
have to be able to hold onto housing allocations in slow years so that they can 
build when people are buying homes again. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the recession, no developers have applied for permits during the 
last three years and there are more than 1,400 allocations for permits waiting 
to be used, Montgomery said. Those allocations would be wiped out if the 
present draft ordinance is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery argues that if the council does not make an exemption for 
Carlsberg, the company will rush to build the homes before the stricter 
growth-control ordinance is adopted next year. He said Harper misunderstands 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion if we don't allow the exception, we will be requiring them to 
begin to build 550 homes within a 12-month period," Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he feared the city could not defend itself against a lawsuit, if 
it tried to force Carlsberg to comply with future growth control measures after 
approving its 550-home project. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the city settled a $17-million lawsuit with Urban West Development 
after attempting to make the company comply with Measure F after its housing 
project had already been approved. To settle the suit, the city exempted their 
2,500-home tract from its slow-growth law. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Carlsberg sued the city over the limit on homes the developer would 
be permitted to build at the northwest corner of Tierra Rejada Road and 
California 23. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of an exemption from future growth controls was raised in ongoing 
negotiations between the developer and the city to settle that lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said he did not want the city to be a target of another lawsuit, 
especially when Carlsberg indicates it is willing to abide by the existing law. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlsberg President Ron Tankersley said he did not want another confrontation 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll live with the existing law," he said. "But what we can't live with is 
the uncertainty of a future ordinance that hasn't even been adopted. We don't 
want a situation where the council will grant permits and then take them away. 
We can't live with that kind of uncertainty."

CYCLISTS GETTING 2 MILES OF LANES NEXT TO FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA CATANIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to make it easier for commuters to pedal to work and school, Caltrans 
has installed bike lanes along a two-mile stretch of the Moorpark Freeway 
between Thousand Oaks and Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The $110,000 project was launched after bicyclists complained that there was 
no safe bike route between the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Caltrans will officially open the lanes, which run along both sides 
of the freeway between Olsen Road in Thousand Oaks and Tierra Rejada Road in 
Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the lanes were completed, cyclists pedaled up a steep, winding section 
of Moorpark Road called the Norwegian Grade. Blind curves make the trek 
especially dangerous for bicyclists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be a big improvement," said Al Bandel, a member of Rancho 
Simi Trail Blazers, a volunteer group that helps maintain bike and horse trails 
in Simi Valley. "We're always looking for new and safer places to ride, and 
this will definitely be safer than that treacherous grade." 
</P>
<P>
 Some cyclists, however, said they would not feel any safer riding along the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the grade is a problem," said Paul Biderman, who owns a bike shop in 
Moorpark. "But I think riding on the freeway you have a greater risk of getting 
hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley resident Larry Hainline agreed. "Traffic is just going too fast," 
he said. "I would not consider it safe at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans engineer Gary Ethier said the project meets Caltrans' safety 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done everything in accordance with Caltrans safety standards," Ethier 
said. "We've made the lanes as safe as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Bright yellow paint marks the eight-foot-wide bike lanes, which run alongside 
the vehicle lanes on the road shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the project, Ethier and his crew replaced several dozen storm drain 
grates with specially designed covers to prevent bike tires from getting stuck. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans decided not to install guardrails because they wanted to keep the 
shoulders open for vehicles that have to pull over in emergencies, Ethier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike bike paths, bike lanes are designed to be used by both bikes and 
motorized vehicles," Ethier said. "As long as everyone pays attention and 
drives cautiously, there shouldn't be any problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic officials and residents have questioned the safety of a similar bike 
lane along the Ventura Freeway near La Conchita where a cyclist was struck by a 
car and killed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Blakemore, administrator of a proposed countywide 200-mile bike path 
system, said he hopes only experienced cyclists will venture onto the freeway 
bike lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 "For someone who's not an expert cyclist, riding along the freeway is 
extremely hazardous," Blakemore said. "It puts a slow-moving object along with 
a lot of fast-moving objects, and if there's a collision, we all know who's 
going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 If the countywide bike path proposal is approved by the Board of Supervisors, 
it could eventually offer a safer alternative for cyclists traveling between 
all the county's cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bike path system could be a long-term solution," Blakemore said. "But 
these freeway bike lanes are the best that can be done in the short term." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans will officially open the Moorpark Freeway bicycle lanes Friday during 
a brief ceremony at 10:30 a.m. near the freeway's southbound Tierra Rejada Road 
on-ramp.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; DISABLED ADULTS SCORE A VICTORY IN GAME OF 
LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Not too many softball teams would be happy with a 17-10 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 But the players on the Training for Independent Living team saw that score in 
a recent game as a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a pretty decent showing for our team," said Mary Engel, lead 
instructor in the program for developmentally disabled adults. "I've never seen 
anyone get bummed out about losing a game. They're out there every Monday 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 After years of fielding a team in the Special Olympics, the players at the 
Ventura center decided this year to join the regular city league, playing teams 
from businesses and neighborhoods around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura city recreation officials were reluctant to let the team join at 
first, until they saw how well the other teams accepted their developmentally 
disabled opponents, Engel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monday night games not only give the players a chance to practice for 
their Special Olympics contest later this summer. They also offer a chance to 
mingle with the rest of society, which is the whole point of the Training for 
Independent Living program, Engel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mainstreaming into the community, learning to access the community, 
learning to interact," Engel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The developmentally disabled adults live at the Ventura Training for 
Independent Living facility on Palm Street, most of them in separate apartments 
with roommates. They learn how to prepare meals, handle money, even deal with 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-pitch softball games become just another way of developing 
socialization skills. The softball team includes family and staff members, as 
well as the developmentally disabled players, ages 20 to 50. Engel's son, Paul, 
is the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 They have yet to win a game in the softball league. But in the past, the 
center's team has taken two silver medals in the Special Olympics. This year, 
Engel said, they are going for the gold. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PRINCIPAL'S FIRING UPHELD BY BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At a meeting Tuesday punctuated by hisses from protesters, the Ventura County 
school board let stand a controversial decision to fire a principal who 
challenged his boss in a race for superintendent of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Education adopted a legal opinion from the Ventura 
County Counsel's office that Supt. of Schools Charles Weis acted within his 
authority when he fired Principal Dan Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision sparked angry comments from about two dozen Flynn supporters in 
the audience, including one woman who announced her plans to run for the county 
board in November.

<P>
 The board had asked for the county counsel's opinion after an attorney for 
Flynn publicly called for county trustees to reinstate the principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn, who had worked under Weis for three years as principal of the county's 
three juvenile court schools, ran unsuccessfully against Weis for the 
superintendent's position in the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than three weeks after the election, Weis told Flynn he was not renewing 
his contract effective July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Weis has stated the firing was based solely on Flynn's poor job 
performance, some of the principal's supporters have charged that the action 
was a political pay-back. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Flynn supporters at Tuesday's meeting used the public forum as an 
opportunity to assail Weis for the firing. 
</P>
<P>
 When board President John McGarry warned the protesters to confine their 
comments to the narrow legal topic of the specially called meeting, some people 
hissed while others yelled out that their right to freedom of speech was being 
suppressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Flynn supporter, Ventura resident Angela Miller, announced her plans 
to run this fall for the seat held by Trustee Juanita Sanchez-Valdez. MAIA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LEVY BANCORP POSTS PROFIT IN 2ND QUARTER

<P>
 The parent company of Bank of A. Levy reported a $1.87-million profit Tuesday 
for the second quarter of 1994, a sign that the Ventura-based institution is 
recovering from the recession, bank officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 While Levy Bancorp had also posted a $1.36-million profit for the first 
quarter of 1994, that profit was preceded by losses for seven straight 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank posted a $3.48-million loss for the second quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall C. Milligan, president and chief executive officer, said the bank 
recovered $1.05 million in the second quarter of 1994 in real estate and 
commercial-business loans that had gone unpaid during the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the bank also wrote off $617,000 in bad loans and lost $456,000 in 
devalued real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message to our customers is clear," Milligan said. "Bank of A. Levy is 
strong and has money to lend to help local businesses and fuel the recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of A. Levy is Ventura County's largest locally owned bank. It has 17 
branches throughout the county. MARY F. POLS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: HOME SALES INCREASE 26% IN 2ND QUARTER

<P>
 Home sales in Ventura County increased 26% in the second quarter of 1994 over 
sales in the same period last year, real estate industry analysts said this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 From April to June, 3,008 new and existing homes were sold in the county, 
according to a report released Monday from TRW REDI, a company that compiles 
data on real estate.In 1993, 2,383 sales were recorded for those months. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price of a home sold in those three months was $230,234. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura (County) is doing well," said Nima Nattagh, an analyst with TRW REDI. 
"Along with the rest of Southern California, it is emerging from the 
recession." 
</P>
<P>
 Existing homes did better on the market than new homes, Nattagh said. The 
average price of new homes sold has dropped 5.9% since second quarter 1993, and 
homes that cost less than $200,000 are selling quickly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the six Southern California counties, home sales in Riverside County showed 
the most improvement since last year, with Ventura County a close second. MARY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; HOUSING ALLOCATION PLAN RECOMMENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura should spread its coveted housing allocations among as many developers 
as possible, a city housing committee recommended Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro-business council members Rosa Lee Measures, Jack Tingstrom and Jim 
Monahan, sitting as the housing committee, drew up a list of how to distribute 
all but 140 of the city's housing allocations.None of the developers would be 
allowed to build before 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members have said they do not want to commit all of Ventura's 
housing allocations this year. They said they are worried it will greatly 
increase the pace of development in future years. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the council is scheduled to grant developers permission to build as 
many as 1,018 dwellings through 1999. It's the first time the council has 
issued housing allocations in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee recommended that developer Ron Hertel, who wants to swap his 
land at Telephone and Kimball roads for city-owned land at Telegraph Road and 
Petit Avenue, be given 150 housing allocations. 
</P>
<P>
 Presley of Southern California, a Newport Beach-based developer, should be 
allowed to build 60 condominiums and 60 houses on land at the northwest corner 
of Telephone Road and Saratoga Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 And Beazer Homes, which operates out of Sylmar, should get permission to 
construct 150 homes on about 40 acres at Telegraph and Kimball Roads, the 
committee recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm for total competition and I wanted to get the most out of this that we 
could," Tingstrom said. "It creates competition in the housing market and 
competition for pricing." 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom said dividing up the allocations among several developers will also 
create the most possible construction-related jobs in the area. CONSTANCE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; DEVELOPER TO PAY FOR FOUNDATION REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Camarillo homeowners' association will receive nearly $3 million to repair 
inadequate foundations beneath townhomes that led to cracked walls and floors, 
the group's attorney said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole Foods Inc., which owns Barclay Hollander Corp., agreed on June 29 to pay 
the Camarillo Springs Townhomes Assn. for the damages, averting a civil trial 
scheduled to begin in early August. 
</P>
<P>
 The association filed the lawsuit in Ventura County Superior Court three years 
ago after homeowners began noticing hundreds of cracks in their patios, garage 
slabs, interior walls and tile floors. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Alexander Robertson said the cracks occurred because the homes were 
built on foundations that could not accommodate the seasonal swelling and 
contracting of clay soil in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like constructing your house on a sponge," he said. "As soon as moisture 
was introduced, the soil would swell and heave beneath the concrete slabs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a thin, lightly reinforced slab, it will crack and buckle." 
</P>
<P>
 The cracks occurred within the 121-unit Palomares section of the Barclay 
Hollander development that sits on Camarillo Springs Road at the foot of the 
Conejo Grade. The townhomes were built between 1987 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson said the builder knew of potential soil problems before construction 
through a soil engineer's study. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, the developer ignored that study and hired a second soil 
engineer who "told them that the soils were not expansive" and would not 
require thicker foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Dole Foods Inc. did not return telephone calls Tuesday. JULIE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; BUSY INTERSECTION TO BE WIDENED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the help of $63,000 in federal funds, Oxnard plans to widen the 
intersection of Ventura Road at Channel Islands Boulevard -- one of the most 
congested in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A second southbound left-turn lane and a right-turn arrow for eastbound 
Channel Islands Boulevard traffic will be added. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traffic lights will also be relocated from the median strip to overhead 
poles to improve visibility and reduce the incidence of signal knockdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at it as one of our most heavily congested intersections," said 
Oxnard traffic engineer Joe Genovese. "We found that it had a large accident 
rate. We're adding a (second) left lane to reduce the number of rear-end 
collisions when the lanes fill up." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, there were 22 accidents at the intersection, Genovese said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to cost $106,200, with the city paying the remainder 
of expenses. Construction is expected to begin by the end of the year and the 
project should be complete next spring, Genovese said. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; EVENT TO TEACH FIRMS BENEFITS OF 
DAY-CARE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo believes he's found a way to encourage 
business owners to subsidize child care for their employees: show them it pays. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Schillo has organized a free seminar on July 28 to teach business 
owners about the financial boosts they could get by either providing on-site 
child care or helping their employees pay for day care. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will learn about a state tax credit they can earn for every 
employee who sends kids to day-care -- a credit they could pass back to their 
workers in the form of subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 They'll also learn about the advantages of sponsoring day care for mildly ill 
children, so parents no longer have to stay home when kids have runny noses. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminar will take place from 7:30 to 9 a.m. in the City Hall council 
chambers July 28. Schillo has already mailed invitations to 2,000 local 
business owners, but others are welcome as well. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PLANNERS RECOMMEND LIMITS ON BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction would be severely limited on hundreds of acres in remote areas of 
Thousand Oaks under a recommendation by the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the objections of a lawyer for Prudential Insurance Co., which owns or 
has a stake on all three parcels involved, the commission recommended late 
Monday that the property be rezoned to protect the land from dense development. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Thousand Oaks City Council approves the planning recommendations, 
developers would be allowed to build nine homes on the most hotly contested 
property -- 200 acres next to Hidden Valley. Prior zoning would have allowed as 
many as 40 houses to be built in the hilly terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also voted to limit construction to three homes on 24 acres 
that straddle the city's boundary with Westlake Village. No houses would be 
allowed on 26 acres in the North Ranch area, where a landfill once operated, 
under the recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks attorney Charles Cohen told the commission that there were no 
plans for housing projects on any of the properties in the near future, but 
Prudential would have preferred to have the option for development, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will vote on zoning for the three parcels in September.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; BOY SHOT IN ARM BY FRIEND WITH GUN

<P>
 Law enforcement officials are urging parents who own guns to keep them away 
from children after a 16-year-old in Moorpark Tuesday became the second youth 
in less than a week to be shot by a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moorpark teen-age, whose name was not released by authorities, was shot in 
the arm after he and Hector Bautista Galaviz, 19, had been handling a small 
caliber handgun, a Ventura County sheriff's deputy said.The boy was not 
seriously hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Galaviz was arrested, but was released when it was determined the shooting was 
accidental, authorities said. The incident follows a fatal shooting last week 
in which a Thousand Oaks teen-ager said he took his father's handgun and 
accidentally shot his girlfriend in the eye. Jacqueline Ann Reay , 16, died 
shortly after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only assume that these guns are coming from parents that may have them 
in the house," said Sgt. Bruce Hansen. "Parents really need to make certain 
that if they have guns in the house, they are kept in a safe place." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen suggested that parents who own guns lock them in a safe or purchase a 
trigger lock that works with a key. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Moorpark shooting Tuesday morning, police said Galaviz and the 
16-year-old had been drinking when the incident occurred. The victim's mother 
had to be hospitalized due to stress brought about by the situation, 
authorities said. MATTHEW MOSK

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; DIFATTA TO SEEK SCHOOL BOARD SEAT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley resident Janice DiFatta has announced her candidacy for one of two 
open seats on the Simi Valley school board. 
</P>
<P>
 DiFatta was the first candidate to file candidacy papers with the Ventura 
County Elections Division Monday, which was the first day of the filing period 
that ends Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Doug Crosse and community activist Sharon Hushka have also announced 
that they intend to run for seats on the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Positions held by Crosse and board President Carla Kurachi are up for election 
on the November ballot. Kurachi has not said whether she will seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 DiFatta, a Simi Valley resident since 1979, has been an active parent in the 
Simi Valley Unified School District for 12 years and is a past president of the 
Parent Teacher Assn. Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The 42-year-old mother of two said she favors a back-to-basics style of 
education, focusing on academic fundamentals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel there is a lot of instability on our board currently," she said. "I 
think there needs to be a change of direction and I think we need to stop and 
focus on what is best for the kids in the Simi Valley district." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of DiFatta's goals are establishing four-year high schools in Simi Valley 
and a fundamental junior high school, which emphasizes stricter academic 
curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a very strong parent interest in a fundamental junior high school," 
she said. "Also, there's a lot of interest in another fundamental elementary 
school. I think that would be a step in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 DiFatta also encourages greater parent involvement in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think generally the parents feel like their input is asked for after the 
fact," DiFatta said, adding that the school board should "invite parents to sit 
on committees and truly value their input." TRACY WILSON

PORT HUENEME COUNCIL FACING TOUGH DECISIONS; BUDGET: PANEL'S OPTIONS INCLUDE 
CLOSING THE POLICE DEPARTMENT, CUTTING CITY SERVICES OR RAISING TAXES AFTER 
VOTERS NARROWLY REJECTED PARCEL TAX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With budget pressures mounting, the Port Hueneme City Council tonight faces 
the difficult choice either of shutting down the city's Police Department, 
making deep cuts in other city services or raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff has presented the council with an array of options since the city's 
voters narrowly rejected a parcel tax that would have raised $500,000 the city 
needs to keep its 21-member police force. 
</P>
<P>
 The council can shut down the Police Department and arrange police protection 
from the county sheriff's department or from the Oxnard Police Department. The 
council could also make widespread cuts in other city services or adopt a 
utility tax to cover the $500,000 shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two weeks, council members have received more than 400 letters 
from residents urging them to save the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is that the city hangs on until the economy turns around and we 
will have more money to support the department," said Valorie Morrison, 
chairwoman of the Save Our Port Hueneme Police Department committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the Police Department is gone, they are gone," she said. "We can't get 
them back." 
</P>
<P>
 The move to adopt a utility tax came after a property tax measure aimed at 
preserving the city's police department failed just short of the two-thirds 
voter majority in the June 7 election. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members Dorill Wright and Toni Young said they may favor a 
utility tax because of strong support of residents to maintain an independent 
police force. 
</P>
<P>
 "A large majority of the people voted to keep their own Police Department and 
that is an indication of what residents want," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said she will do anything she can to keep the Police Department. 
"Although I am not convinced that the utility tax is the right answer," she 
said, "I will do whatever it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 Young said the city may have other options such as curtailing park maintenance 
until the economy turns around. "When the economy improves, so will the city's 
finances," Young said. "We may just have to sit and wait."  
</P>
<P>
 But City Manager Richard Velthoen strongly opposed cutting back on maintenance 
and because public property allowed to deteriorate would cost the city more 
money in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only services cut that will not affect the enhancement of public property 
or public safety would be to reduce services or close the community center," 
Velthoen said. "Everything else would just cause more problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Velthoen suggested that one benefit of adopting a city utility tax could be 
persuading the Navy, the largest landowner in the city, to contribute to city 
revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There could be some arrangement made that the Navy would pay some utility 
tax," Velthoen said. "But they would have to agree to it. I don't think we have 
any power to tax federal property." 
</P>
<P>
 If the city contracts with the sheriff's department, some residents fear it 
would take longer for the deputies to respond to calls for help and that 
deputies wouldn't bother with some of the friendly gestures of the city's 
police force, Sgt. Ken Dobbe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, Dobbe said, Port Hueneme police officers arrive at accidents and fire 
scenes before the ambulances or the Fire Department. The officers also help 
residents when they are locked out of their cars and check on their houses when 
they go on vacation, Dobbe said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two weeks, the more than 100 residents who make up the Save Our 
Port Hueneme Police Department committee have mounted a public relations 
campaign to win support of the council. 
</P>
<P>
 With donations from local businesses and residents, they paid more than $300 
to run ads in newspapers. One of the ads asked residents "to make the will of 
the people a reality" by cutting out a printed letter to the council, signing 
their names and mailing it to City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been beating the bushes. Hopefully, people will pack the City Council 
chambers," Morrison said. "We want to make it clear what we want." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Port Hueneme City Council will meet 7:30 p.m. today at City Hall, 250 N. 
Ventura Road. Residents will be allowed to speak on the fate of the city police 
force about 8 p.m.

BEILENSON, SYBERT ABOUT EVEN IN ELECTION FUND RAISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) and attorney Richard Sybert are 
running neck-and-neck in fund raising as they prepare for a November election 
test to determine who will represent a congressional district that stretches 
from Thousand Oaks to Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign finance reports filed Tuesday by Beilenson show the veteran lawmaker, 
now seeking his 10th term in office, had $135,852 on hand June 30 when the 
books on the most recent reporting period closed. Beilenson, 62, represents the 
24th District, one of the nation's most affluent congressional areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the 42-year-old Sybert, a former cabinet-level official in Gov. 
Pete Wilson's Administration, had $122,759 in his campaign account, according 
to the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports also reveal Sybert spent $365,497 during the first six months of 
this year in his successful bid to win the GOP nomination to run against 
Beilenson. In the June 7 primary, Sybert scored 47% of the Republican vote in a 
field of five candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Beilenson spent only $41,057 to win renomination in the 
Democratic primary against one foe, Scott Gaulke, a follower of political 
extremist Lyndon LaRouche. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest campaign documents show how heavily Sybert has relied on his 
personal wealth to fund his quest for office. During the first six months of 
1994, Sybert raised only $90,871 from outside sources, but lent his campaign 
committee $421,685 at 5% interest. 
</P>
<P>
 A Harvard Law School graduate, Sybert was a partner in a major Downtown Los 
Angeles law firm for 12 years. In 1991, Sybert was named director of Wilson's 
Office of Planning and Research, and late last year he became president of a 
Santa Barbara-based toy design firm. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first six months of this year, Beilenson raised $113,058 from 
outside sources. The congressman, however, continues to carry on his campaign 
books a $50,000 loan he made to himself to fund his 1992 reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert said Tuesday that he expects to spend about half a million dollars 
between now and the Nov. 7 election. That would put this year's race in the 
same league as the 1992 race between Beilenson and his GOP rival, 
ex-Assemblyman Tom McClintock. Two years ago, Beilenson spent $616,000, his foe 
$459,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson could not be reached for comment.

RED CROSS SEEKS HELP FOR FLOOD VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Red Cross is seeking donations to help families left temporarily 
homeless by flooding in Georgia, Alabama and Florida, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 15,000 families have been affected by the flooding, which places the 
disaster among the most severe emergencies for the Red Cross, spokeswoman Judy 
Iannacone said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that all disaster assistance is free and is made possible by 
donations. Checks made to the American Red Cross Disaster Relief Fund may be

JEAN F. PERRY; HOUSING AGENCY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jean F. Perry, who found homes for needy Ventura residents, died Sunday. She 
was 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Perry worked for the city's housing authority from 1971 to 1981, first as 
housing manager and then as the executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing authority uses federal money to finance housing projects for 
low-income city residents, and helps place residents in homes they can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 Abby Aguilera, the city's current housing manager, said Mrs. Perry was always 
more concerned with people than paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very caring person," said Aguilera, who worked under Mrs. Perry. 
"She cared a great, great deal for the people that we served, and they cared 
very deeply for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Perry was also an avid golfer and bridge player. She is survived by a 
brother, Ronald Jackson; son, David Perry; daughter, Diane Luttrell; and two 
grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ted Mayr Funeral Home in Ventura is handling arrangements.

TWO RECRUITS FOR UC IRVINE INJURED IN ONE-CAR ACCIDENT; BASKETBALL: SHIPP AND 
SIMMONS' RENTAL CAR LEAPS DIVIDER, HITS TREE AND TURNS OVER. SHIPP, THE DRIVER, 
WAS REPORTED IN CRITICAL CONDITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A prominent UC Irvine basketball recruit was critically injured and another 
suffered minor injuries when the rented convertible they were in flipped over 
in front of the campus early Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Tchaka Shipp, 20, was reported in critical condition with head 
injuries after undergoing surgery at Western Medical Center in Santa Ana. Kevin 
Simmons, 19, who managed to crawl out from under the car, suffered bruises and 
was released from the hospital Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine police Sgt. Scott Cade said the two New York City residents were going 
east on Campus Drive shortly after 2 a.m. when their car leaped a curb on the 
median, slammed into a tree and flipped onto its roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the car appeared not to have been exceeding the 45 m.p.h. speed 
limit at the time of the accident, and investigators also ruled out drugs or 
alcohol as factors in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipp may have fallen asleep at the wheel, and Simmons was sleeping in the 
reclined passenger seat at the time of the crash, said Officer Keith Milledge. 
Both were wearing seat belts, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got two guys driving down the road at about 2:19 and they hit the center 
divider for no reason," Cade said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons, accompanied by UCI basketball Coach Rod Baker, declined to comment as 
he was wheeled out of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The recruits -- who have not yet been formally admitted at UCI -- are expected 
to be key additions to the Anteater squad, which reached the Big West 
tournament final after a 7-19 regular-season record. 
</P>
<P>
 Shipp, a 6-foot-8 forward who played two seasons at Seton Hall, would be a 
sophomore at Irvine, but NCAA rules require him to sit out one season. He would 
be eligible to play two more years. A former star player at Brooklyn Lincoln 
High, Shipp was a reserve at Seton Hall, averaging 2.9 points and 2.8 rebounds 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 He announced he was transferring to Irvine in June, shortly after Pirate Coach 
P.J. Carlesimo was hired as coach of the Portland Trail Blazers. Baker was once 
an assistant coach under Carlesimo at Seton Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 A UCI spokeswoman said Shipp has not yet applied for admission, but Baker said 
Shipp planned to apply in time for the fall term beginning Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons, who is also 6-8, would be a freshman. A former high school star in 
Brooklyn, N.Y., he was ranked by Basketball Weekly among the top 65 prep 
recruits when he originally signed with Irvine in 1993. But Simmons was 
academically ineligible because he missed some required courses, and attended 
Redemption Christian Academy, a prep school in Troy, N.Y., last season. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI admissions officials are reviewing Simmons' application, said spokeswoman 
Karen Newell Young. "It's not unusual to admit athletes even later than this," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said the two men moved from New York to California about two weeks ago 
to begin jobs that he declined to identify. Shipp and Simmons were paying to 
stay in a campus fraternity house rented to non-students in the summer, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw what was at the accident," said Baker, who was awakened shortly after 
the crash. "I feel for them. Thank God they are strong-bodied. And I'm of the 
belief that they'll be able to fight through the injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the two were returning from a friend's house after attending a 
Torrance basketball tournament that included a New York City youth team on 
which Simmons once played.

RAIDERS SIGN FREDRICKSON, CUT TOWNSEND; PRO FOOTBALL: DEFENSIVE END IS RELEASED 
TO MAKE ROOM UNDER SALARY CAP FOR NO. 1 PICK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Greg Townsend, it's the end of a long and distinguished career as a 
Raider. 
</P>
<P>
 For Rob Fredrickson, it's only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Two players, one old and one young, one a defensive lineman too expensive to 
keep on the roster, the other a linebacker too valuable to keep out of camp, 
traded places Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders released the 32-year-old Townsend, an 11-year veteran, a two-time 
Pro Bowl pick and the AFC's all-time sack leader with 107.5, and signed 
Fredrickson, their No. 1 draft choice out of Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend would have received $1.5 million this season and $1.6 million next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders had told him not to report to camp while they continued their 
efforts to trade him, but there were no takers. Although the Raiders were 
reportedly willing to settle for a conditional seventh-round draft pick from 
Philadelphia, Eagle officials chose, instead, to wait out the Raiders, figuring 
they would be forced to cut Townsend to make room under the salary cap for 
Fredrickson. 
</P>
<P>
 But by waiting, the Eagles now have competition. Three of the Raiders' rivals 
in the AFC West -- the Denver Broncos, Kansas City Chiefs and Seattle Seahawks 
-- all are reportedly interested in Townsend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Greg Townsend was the best pass rusher I've ever seen," Raider Coach Art 
Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't thank him enough for what he has done for this organization. He was 
a gentleman and a team player. But it was time for Greg to move on and it was 
time for us to move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 His troubles with the Raiders began two years ago when he held out through all 
of training camp, reporting overweight and out of shape several days before the 
season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend never seemed to catch up in that 1992 season. By last year, although 
he was still a starter and still showed flashes of the player who had 
overwhelmed opposing lines in the past, Townsend was playing little more than 
half the time, often giving way to Anthony Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, with the return of Scott Davis after two seasons of retirement, and 
the signing of Jerry Ball, Townsend was deemed expendable because of his 
advancing age and high salary. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just the opposite for Fredrickson. 
</P>
<P>
 With the release of middle linebacker Joe Kelly in the off-season, the Raiders 
drafted Fredrickson to battle for the job with second-year man Greg Biekert. 
</P>
<P>
 That puts an added burden on Fredrickson, who was an outside linebacker at 
Michigan State and now must not only learn to play with the pros, but learn a 
new position. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting out training camp wasn't helping. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was time for him (Fredrickson) to be on the field," said Steve Ortmayer, 
the Raiders' director of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday morning, Fredrickson agreed to a five-year deal, monetary terms not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to play so bad," said Bruce Allen, Fredrickson's agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson has been staying with Allen in Redondo Beach for the last 10 days 
while negotiations dragged on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd look at his face every day," Allen said. "He wanted to get hit." 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson will get his chance now. 
</P>
<P>
 While he waited for a deal to be struck, he worked out daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to keep my mind off the contract," Fredrickson said. "It was hard. 
All football players want to do is play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of work to do," he said after taking part in his first workout 
Tuesday afternoon. "It's a big difference playing inside. Outside, you have 
more time to react. Inside . . . it's instinctive." 
</P>
<P>
 But he's more than happy to learn the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very exciting," Fredrickson said. "It's every kid's dream to play in the 
NFL. I don't really have time to think about who I'm playing with. It really 
hasn't sunk in yet."

CARNIVAL-LIKE CELEBRATION FOR BRAZIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an all-day, three-city tour, Brazil's World Cup soccer champions were swept 
up on the shoulders of this beleaguered nation in a massive outpouring of 
affection and admiration that stretched from the slums of Rio de Janeiro to the 
presidential palace in Brasilia. 
</P>
<P>
 The team, which won an unprecedented fourth World Cup, started in the 
northeastern beach city of Recife and reached Rio where it was greeted by 
500,000 screaming, dancing, shouting, crying fans, more than one-third of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The team plane was three hours late, because of excess baggage from 
last-minute shopping by players who decided to take advantage of their Los 
Angeles visit to buy televisions, stereos, refrigerators and washers that are 
outrageously expensive here. 
</P>
<P>
 As the plane touched down, Romario, the team's star throughout the monthlong 
World Cup '94, hoisted the nation's flag through the pilot window. Ricardo 
Rocha, the only player from the state, led the team off the plane, kissing the 
ground and hoisting the World Cup trophy into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 In Recife, where the governor had declared Tuesday a state holiday, the team 
mounted red fire engines for an 11-mile parade from the airport along the Praia 
da Viagem beach through a virtual sea of people. 
</P>
<P>
 Bands played and fireworks exploded overhead. Scores of mounted police 
struggled to keep back the enthusiastic fans who danced jubilantly, their small 
red, white, yellow and blue umbrellas held overhead, while shouting "Teatra 
Campeao! Teatra Campeao! (Four-time champion)." 
</P>
<P>
 People crammed into every available space along the parade route, clinging to 
balconies, hanging from flagpoles and hoisting themselves up trees. Mothers 
held babies in the air to behold their triumphant warriors for the historic 
moment, the first World Cup title in 24 years for a nation in which soccer is 
more religion than sport. Others held up pictures of Romario, who is being 
called "the little saint." 
</P>
<P>
 Recife was where Brazil routed Bolivia, 6-0, last August in a morale-boosting 
qualifying victory that launched the team toward the World Cup finals. Brazil 
soccer officials pledged then to repay the loyal support they had received from 
Recife fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The stop, scheduled to last for an hour, went on for three. Players finally 
re-boarded their plane for the nation's capital, Brasilia, where they were met 
by an even larger crowd, including President Itamar Franco and much of the 
nation's Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounting another set of fire engines and the same car used for a similar 
celebration when the team last claimed the Cup, team members hoisted a yellow 
crash helmet in honor of another Brazilian legend, race car driver Ayrton 
Senna, who was killed in a racing accident last May in Italy. They had 
dedicated their title to Senna. 
</P>
<P>
 They slowly made their way through another mass of fans adorned in green and 
yellow, Brazil's national colors, before arriving at the Treis Podres where the 
president presented them with the Order of Sporting Merit, the nation's highest 
such honor. 
</P>
<P>
 From the second-floor balcony of the presidential palace, the team members 
looked down into a near wall of green and yellow. Fans waved green and yellow 
flags, there were green and yellow hats, green and yellow shirts, green and 
yellow dogs, green and yellow cars -- even green and yellow people. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rio, hundreds of thousands of fans, many of whom had been waiting for 
nearly 10 hours, stretched across the 20-mile parade route from the city's 
airport to the beach community Leblon. The crowd was smaller than expected 
because of the team's late arrival, partially because of a holdup by federal 
customs officials querying team members regarding their troublesome luggage.  
</P>
<P>
 The team, exhausted after 24 hours of travel, mounted another set of fire 
engines for a caravan through downtown, Flamengo, Copacabana, Ipanema and 
finally to Leblon. Samba bands, their drum corps beating out a pounding rhythm, 
lined the route, and fans began dancing and shouting in jubilation upon word 
that the team had finally touched down, seven hours late. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an especially sweet stop for the team's other star, Bebeto, who would 
meet for the first time his son, born in Rio de Janeiro during the World Cup.

WHINE? CORKING FEAR REAL; HERZOG, OTHERS SAY LAMONT WAS RIGHT TO LOOK FOR 
CHEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Whitey Herzog has been waiting for the day when somebody, anybody, would 
follow his lead and check for corked bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm telling you right now," said Herzog, who managed 18 years in the major 
leagues, "if you checked everybody in baseball, you'd have a whole room full of 
corked bats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, with the way the ball's flying out this year, you'd be stupid not 
to check some of these guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been going on for years, but everybody has been talking so much 
about the balls being juiced, they forget some of these bats are juiced too." 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Lamont of the Chicago White Sox became the first manager in baseball this 
season to check for a corked bat Friday when he requested that Cleveland 
outfielder Albert Belle's bat be examined. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle's bat was sawed in half Monday by the American League office and cork 
was discovered. He was suspended for 10 games. Belle appealed, and will have a 
July 29 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kills me how people now are saying that Lamont only did it because they're 
in a pennant race with Cleveland," Herzog said. "The guy was cheating, so what 
the hell difference does it make? Why are we sticking up for outlaws?" 
</P>
<P>
 The art of corking bats has been going on for decades, but only now, players 
say, has it been perfected to a science. There are woodsmen who drill holes at 
the end of bats, insert cork, plug the holes, sand and laminate, believing no 
one will ever know. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a private wood-working shop in Cleveland," said Red Sox reliever 
Steve Farr, Belle's former teammate in Cleveland, "so what happened with him 
didn't surprise me at all. That stuff has been going on since I was there for 
the first time 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I know pitchers that cheat, and I know hitters that cheat. You could pick 
five, six, seven guys on every team that cheat, so it's no big deal unless you 
get caught. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, just a few weeks ago (while Farr was with Cleveland) a guy grabbed 
someone's bat during batting practice, and when his bat broke, cork went 
everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "And this was right in front of the visiting manager." 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage of using corked bats, according to players and coaches, is that 
it gives the bat a lighter feel and enables hitters to generate greater bat 
speed. It provides a springboard effect, they say, with the ball jumping off 
the bat and carrying farther than normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Belle has 27 homers this season, and is batting .350, his use of a 
corked bat was a surprise. If anyone was suspected of using a corked bat on the 
Cleveland roster, members of the Angels and Red Sox said, it was leadoff hitter 
Kenny Lofton. Lofton began the season with six home runs. This season, he has 
10. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth," said Angel hitting coach Rod Carew, "Belle is the 
last person I'd have suspected. He didn't need it, not with that power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, I'm surprised guys are still doing it. I've played with guys who did 
it, but I thought it was something that went out in the early '80s." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel second baseman Harold Reynolds: "You hear about some guys using 
steroids for some extra pop, but not cork." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, it was no surprise to Herzog, who accused then-New York Met Howard 
Johnson of using a corked bat in 1987 and is convinced there is a widespread 
use of illegal bats today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an X-ray machine at (Busch Stadium)," Herzog said, "and one night when 
the Mets came into town, we decided to have all of their bats checked. Well, we 
found four of those (players) using corked bats, including Howard Johnson, but 
(Darryl) Strawberry, (Gary) Carter and (Keith) Hernandez were all clean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnson had gone from 10 homers to 36 in one year, so I know something's not 
right, anyway. So we marked his corked bat, and when he came to the plate, I 
got umpire Paul Runge to take it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing was, when the game was over, Runge gave the bat back. He didn't 
know the rule. He apologized, but as soon as he gave that bat back, it was long 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'Next time I come out here to check bats, I'm going to bring a 
chain saw to home plate with me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson on Monday denied the allegations that he used a corked bat, just as he 
had in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, the most ridiculous aspect of the rule regarding allegedly corked bats, 
critics say, is that managers are allowed to challenge only one bat a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "So that means once the first guy is checked," Farr said, "a team can bring 
the whole arsenal out." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Herzog: "It's about as stupid as the beanball rule. If they really want 
to stop all this . . ., they should have a scanner by the bat rack. You want to 
stop this . . ., then get an X-ray machine like you've got at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I don't think cheating is ever going to stop in this game. I'm convinced 
to this day that the (Minnesota) Twins were stealing our signs in the '87 World 
Series when we were at their place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked (Tom) Brunansky and (Tommy) Herr if they were cheating when they got 
to our place, but they both denied it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, they're honest boys, so I'd like to believe him. But I've also had 
players that I know damn well have corked bats, and they denied it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the hell are you going to do?"

WHEN ONE SLIP CAUSES BIG FALL; ALL-STATE RECEIVER'S FUTURE IN DOUBT AFTER 
SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the morning that a bullet ripped through the door of his girlfriend's 
home in Newbury Park, Leodes Van Buren was a whisper away from beating the 
odds. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Van Buren, an all-state wide receiver at Newbury Park High, on 
April 8. He was charged with one count of shooting into an inhabited dwelling. 
Van Buren's girlfriend, Marcie James, and their 2-year-old daughter, Andreya, 
were in the house at the time, but no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, 19, pleaded not guilty and will stand trial in Ventura County 
Superior Court beginning Monday on the felony charge, which carries a maximum 
penalty of seven years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever the outcome of the trial, the incident, at least temporarily, has 
shattered what was shaping up as a remarkable success story. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, once on the path to gangbanging, instead became the first person in 
his immediate family to graduate from high school. He had signed a letter of 
intent to play football at Colorado this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But after his arrest, Colorado officials informed Van Buren that he did not 
meet academic requirements for the school and declared his letter of intent 
void. 
</P>
<P>
 That was a blow to Van Buren, one of the best receivers California has ever 
produced. The 6-foot-1, 190-pound receiver led Newbury Park to the Southern 
Section Division II championship last fall. He had a state-record 269 
receptions and 4,456 yards receiving in his prep career. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Van Buren maintains his innocence of the weapons charge, he said the 
experience has forced him to mature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just learned my lesson that no matter how big you are, you can always fall 
down," Van Buren said. 
</P>
<P>
 And by changing his story from what he initially told police on the day of the 
shooting, Van Buren contributed to his tumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren said he went to James' house after they had argued on the telephone 
on the morning of April 8. He later called a 911 emergency operator and 
reported that he had fired a shot at her house. James corroborated the story. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next day, Van Buren told police a companion had actually fired the 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren said he had initially lied to police to protect his companion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could get away with it because I played football and I was good 
at it," Van Buren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren, who never has identified his companion, feared possible retaliation 
if he did. 
</P>
<P>
 James, an all-Western State Conference softball pitcher at Moorpark College, 
also has changed her story. 
</P>
<P>
 She said in a phone interview that she had lied to police because she was 
angry at Van Buren. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had found out he cheated on me and that broke my heart," James said. "I 
told myself that if he does something to hurt me, I will get him back. It was 
immature, but I did it." 
</P>
<P>
 The two have since reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
 At a preliminary hearing on May 26, James, 20, testified that it was Van 
Buren's companion who had fired the shot. She also testified that before Van 
Buren fled the scene that morning, he told her he would say he had done it "to 
show everyone how much I love you." 
</P>
<P>
 Police searched the house where Van Buren lives with his legal guardian, Ken 
McGee, but did not recover a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren said he is confident he will be found not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what happened. (Marcie) knows what happened. We are going to put all 
this behind us," Van Buren said. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a lot that Van Buren has had to put behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren grew up in South-Central Los Angeles, in a neighborhood where they 
pulled dead men out of the community pool and where the path you took to your 
friend's house was dictated by where you thought opposing gang members might 
not be lurking that day. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to guess, and sometimes you get lucky and sometimes you don't," Van 
Buren said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 10, Van Buren saw what happened when one of his friends made an 
unlucky choice. The boy took a shortcut across a baseball field and about 10 
other boys suddenly appeared. They surrounded the boy, beat him and left him 
paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, Van Buren was drawn to the violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to hang out on the corners and wait until someone was walking down 
the street and then just beat them up for no reason at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren watched his sister, Lady, become involved in gangs and he knew that 
if he continued the way he was going, he would follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're really young, you're not in a gang yet, but you hang out with 
them and it's like you are," Van Buren said. "Eventually, you get jumped in, 
and to me, that's when your life is over." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren went to his mother, Annie Carter, and told her, "Mom, I want to be 
something in life." 
</P>
<P>
 That meant getting away from his neighborhood. But Carter was a single, 
unemployed mother and didn't have the resources to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter McGee, Van Buren's sixth-grade teacher at the time at Woodcrest 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Van Buren) really was a neat kid," McGee said. "He came into my room and was 
kind of like a leader almost instantly. He has a lot of presence about him." 
</P>
<P>
 McGee became a surrogate father for Van Buren, whose own father had separated 
from his mother and left the state when Van Buren was 4. 
</P>
<P>
 McGee had divorced years earlier and his two children lived in Florida with 
his former wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation seemed ideal -- the lonely single man needing some company and 
the wayward youth needing a change of environment. With Carter's permission, 
Van Buren moved into McGee's Newbury Park home. They gave each other nicknames, 
becoming "Lee" and "Gee." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt like God sent a gift to me," Carter said of McGee. 
</P>
<P>
 There were times, however, when Van Buren and McGee felt that the arrangement 
was less than heavenly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't always easy," McGee said. "He wasn't very accustomed to a 
structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Things like attending school and telling McGee of his whereabouts were novel 
to Van Buren. Discipline did not happen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of it was giving him a lot of time," McGee said. "He needed time to 
think about things . . . and because I didn't have any other children here, I 
could just kind of wait for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren got his wake-up call in eighth grade. McGee told him that because of 
his poor attendance at the Conejo Valley continuation school, he might not be 
able to attend Newbury Park his freshman year. 
</P>
<P>
 That meant Van Buren would not be playing football, something he was eager to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 So Van Buren put in hours after school and during the summer to make up for 
lost time and persuade the principal at Conejo Valley to give him the necessary 
recommendation for Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal was impressed with Van Buren's effort and gave him the 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 And Van Buren started on the varsity his freshman year. In football, he did 
not disappoint anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very intense player," said George Hurley, Newbury Park's coach. "He 
never, ever missed practice. He didn't take it lightly and clown around and 
goof off. When it was time to work, he was working." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren also had the good fortune to play with quarterback Keith Smith for 
three seasons. Smith ended his prep career as the state's all-time passing 
leader with 9,971 yards.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was really nice for us that both of these people were together at the same 
time," Hurley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Buren said that he does not really enjoy football, but wants to continue 
playing because it can help him get a college education.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Van Buren requested a release from his letter of intent after hearing 
that Colorado might declare it void, questions remain about the propriety of 
the school's action. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Plati, Colorado sports information director, said that although Van Buren 
had passed the Scholastic Aptitude Test, he had not completed all the academic 
requirements to be admitted to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The irony of it is that he wasn't even admissible here to start with . . . ," 
Plati said. "We're allowed to make cases (to the school's admissions board) for 
certain kids, but with this other thing hanging over his head, it would be hard 
to make a case for him." 
</P>
<P>
 McGee said that Van Buren had not finished an English class that Colorado had 
asked him totake at Newbury Park during the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurley, however, insists that Van Buren was academically eligible to get into 
the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it probably was an easy way for (Colorado) to back out of a situation 
that both (the school) and Leodes were uncomfortable with," Hurley said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Van Buren is left to wait and see if and when his football career will 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like we were going to finish high school and everything was going 
to fall into place the way we had planned for it to," McGee said. "And now, 
it's kind of like, get through this and then we'll see where to go from there, 
and that's hard."

MIKE DOWNEY: PLENTY'S IN STORR FOR KINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sam McMaster took charge. The sociable new general manager of the Kings rose 
to make the introductions Tuesday, in a room occupied by Joe Cohen, Bruce 
McNall, Barry Melrose, Rogie Vachon, most of L.A.'s boys of winter. 
</P>
<P>
 There were several young hockey prospects in their midst, the future of the 
team. Among them: Jamie Storr, 18, the goaltender of tomorrow, drafted higher 
than any goalie in the NHL's last 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Becoming McMaster of ceremonies, the GM asked: "Anybody know who was taken 
higher?" 
</P>
<P>
 No takers at first. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a smart kid in class, McNall said: "I do! I do!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Who?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom Barrasso." 
</P>
<P>
 Headmaster McMaster now turned to ask, "Jamie, did you know that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Like a shy kid in class, Storr merely nodded. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen, standing in a corner, smiled with satisfaction and said: "Yeah. He knew 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the new King family tree. Cohen, the new (with Jeffrey Sudikoff) 
majority co-owner. McMaster, the new decision maker. And the kids, top draft 
choices Storr and left winger Matt Johnson, a couple of teen-agers, Johnson 
already 6 feet 5 and 230 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck with World Cup; time to start talking Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp opens on Labor Day. The kids still have to sign up. Then the coaches have 
to evaluate whether the kids are already ready for the big-time. They're only 
18. Is it conceivable Storr could replace Kelly Hrudey or Robb Stauber right 
now? Could it be Johnson is one of those muscular boys Melrose has been seeking 
everywhere but Venice Beach? Is McMaster the man to bring the Kings the rings? 
</P>
<P>
 In other words: 
</P>
<P>
 If the New York Rangers can do it, good Lord, can't we?  
</P>
<P>
 McMaster's first mission was the draft. He said the player he wanted most was 
Storr. He said he had known Jamie since Jamie was 14. He saw the kid from 
Brampton, Canada, tending goal in a junior game and imagined what he would be 
like after puberty. He said, "You don't have goalies like him come along that 
often." 
</P>
<P>
 One problem: 
</P>
<P>
 Poor as they were last season, the Kings had only the seventh pick of the 
first round June 28 at Hartford. And no way Storr would last that long. He 
would go, oh, fifth, as Barrasso, John Davidson and Ray Mariniuk had. Or even 
fourth, because Edmonton scouts were drooling. Oiler director of hockey 
operations Kevin Prendergast had said, "He's a pressure player, destined to be 
an outstanding pro." 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster made provisions. If he couldn't have Storr, he would take Brett 
Lindros, little brother of Eric. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem: 
</P>
<P>
 Lindros wanted no part of Los Angeles. Brett's dad got on the phone to 
McMaster and said, "There's a rumor you might take our son." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's no rumor," McMaster says he told Carl Lindros. "That's a fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindros said his son would not report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'That's too bad,' " McMaster recalls.  
</P>
<P>
 The way the King GM understands it, the Lindros family wants nothing to do 
with Wayne Gretzky. McMaster says, "They're under the impression that Wayne 
bad-mouthed Eric. Wayne has no idea where they got that." 
</P>
<P>
 As the draft loomed, Edmonton abruptly determined that Bill Ranford had good 
years left in goal. Officials from the Washington Capitals began pestering 
McMaster to trade down, because they wanted Storr. But so did the Kings, who 
now had a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Jamie was gone, I'd probably have gone for Lindros," McMaster says, 
chuckling. "But only to trade. I don't even know if he would have come up to 
the podium. I could have been standing there with Lindros' name on a sweater 
and a stupid look on my face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about you, but I want a kid playing for me who thinks being 
drafted is one of the greatest days of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster got his man. Made his day, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe that the L.A. Kings are secure in goal for many years now," 
McMaster said. "The future is solidified. I think Stauber has to jump up right 
now to be No. 1, if he's ever going to be, because it's time. Because this kid 
isn't going to take long. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's his composure everyone notices about Jamie, first thing. He defies you 
to score. He's a stand-up goalie who moves like a Ranford, like a (Kirk) 
McLean. He doesn't give you any space to score. He just shuts it off, period." 
</P>
<P>
 Storr took a stroll into the Forum rink Tuesday, to check out what could 
become his new home office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Feels perfect," he said, smoothing his hand across the crossbar, sliding his 
street shoe along the crease. 
</P>
<P>
 His father had been a goalie, one who, at 31, after playing for an industrial 
team, enrolled in an academy for would-be goaltenders and stood beside 
8-year-olds. Jim Storr quit his job and spent $10,000 on lessons, equipment, 
even a puck-shooting machine. In 1979, he let the Maple Leafs use him for 
target practice. It was wrongly reported as a tryout. Jim lets them be wrong, 
enjoys it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Storr gestures toward center ice at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was 11, I was having trouble skating from here to there," he says. "So 
people said I should stick to being a goalie. I got called sluggish and even 
lazy. Then they found out I had an iron deficiency. Soon as we corrected that, 
I never had another problem. But I found I liked being a goalie more than 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Can an 18-year-old be goalie for the Kings? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey," Storr says, "I wouldn't have hired a personal trainer this summer if I 
wasn't serious. This is where I want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Good answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Go to the head of the class.

 Tuesday night's game between the Baltimore Orioles and Seattle Mariners was 
postponed after four 15-pound insulating tiles fell from the ceiling of the 
Kingdome and today's makeup doubleheader will remain in doubt until the roof 
can be closely checked. 
</P>
<P>
 A 32-by-48-inch tile fell nearly 180 feet into the stands behind home plate 
about 4:30 p.m. PDT. Three more fell an hour later, two into the third tier of 
stands and one onto a walkway in the first tier. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured and players continued taking batting practice until the 
postponement was announced less than an hour before the scheduled 7:05 p.m. 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first time a sporting event at the 18-year-old Kingdome has been 
postponed, said Carol Keaton, a spokeswoman for the King County-owned stadium, 
although minor delays have occurred at other events. 
</P>
<P>
 The gates had not been opened, and no fans were admitted. About 15,000 to 
17,000 had been expected to attend the game, Mariner spokesman Dave Aust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's doubleheader is the last scheduled meeting of the teams this season, 
but Aust said no decision will be made on those games until the roof is 
checked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until they can guarantee it's secure, we can't possibly play another game," 
Aust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariner general Manager Woody Woodward said the players had been told to be at 
the Kingdome at 11 a.m. today ready to play a doubleheader if necessary. The 
doubleheader was set to begin at 12:35 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Refunds will be offered to those who bought tickets for the Tuesday night game 
and to those who paid for parking on Kingdome-operated lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire exterior of the roof is being overhauled, starting with the area 
where the tile fell, said Jerry Lytle, project manager for the repair 
contractor, Pacific Components. Old roofing material is being removed from the 
concrete dome and is being replaced with new coating. 
</P>
<P>
 The dome's roof is made up of 40 concrete sections and the incident occurred 
in the section where work began. 
</P>
<P>
 The roof has been leaking for some time.

 A Brazilian soccer fan was murdered by his brother-in-law because he praised 
the Italian team during the World Cup final, news agency Estado reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose de Oliveira Lima, 44, was stabbed to death by Raimundo Leadro in a bar in 
the remote Amazon town of Rio Branco after Lima said Italy was playing well by

OVERLOOKED GUARD NOW HARD TO IGNORE; BASKETBALL: UCI SUMMER LEAGUE GIVES TREVOR 
RUFFIN SECOND CHANCE AFTER HIS ATTITUDE KEPT HIM FROM BEING DRAFTED. LAKERS 
MIGHT INVITE HIM TO CAMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Considering he almost single-handedly took the Hawaii Rainbows to the NCAA 
basketball tournament last season and then led everyone at the NBA's pre-draft 
camp in scoring, Trevor Ruffin would have been within his rights to whine about 
being passed over in the NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ruffin learned in high school that people don't like whiners, they like 
players. So he has dropped the "woe is me" act and let his game do the talking. 
</P>
<P>
 And lately, Ruffin's game has made people wonder why he wasn't drafted. 
Through seven games with the Lakers' summer league team, he is averaging 22 
points, 2.7 rebounds and 3.2 steals. Against Phoenix Saturday night, Ruffin 
scored 33 points on 13-of-23 shooting in 35 minutes. And then Monday against 
Phoenix, Ruffin scored 31 points on 13-of-22 shooting while handing out eight 
assists and making five steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Musselman, coach and general manager of the Rapid City Thrillers in the 
Continental Basketball Assn., took one look at Ruffin and knew he probably 
wouldn't be seeing him in the CBA anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a guy who's going to be in the NBA," Musselman said. "He can play." 
</P>
<P>
 Laker General Manager Jerry West wouldn't go that far, but he seems impressed 
with Ruffin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised he wasn't drafted," West said. "I thought he was a very good 
player at the (pre-draft) camp in Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
 With the ASICS Summer Pro League at the Bren Center winding down, the Lakers 
must soon decide whether to bring Ruffin to training camp in Hawaii as a backup 
point guard for Nick Van Exel. It appears that decision might already have been 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have an interest in (Ruffin)," West said. "We're going to try and see 
if we can maintain that interest in some way." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ruffin: "Mr. West has talked to me a lot, given me pointers. I'm sure if 
they were just going to boot me out of here, he wouldn't be giving me any 
pointers. I haven't heard any negative things." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffin said he would love to sign with the Lakers. But until he actually signs 
a contract, he is leery of thinking too highly of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior at Bennett High School in Buffalo, Ruffin averaged 37 points and 
figured every college coach in the nation would come knocking on his door. But 
Ruffin quickly learned there wasn't much need for 6-foot point guards with bad 
grades and bad attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 The only Division I college that offered Ruffin a scholarship was Virginia, 
but Ruffin couldn't even accept that because he failed to take the Scholastic 
Aptitude Test and he didn't have the grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was too big for my britches," Ruffin said. "I wouldn't say it cost me, but 
it definitely brought me down. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . My attitude was, I was thinking the world would revolve around me. 
When you're young, you think you're the man. You think you're on top of the 
world. But then you realize, Buffalo's a real small place." 
</P>
<P>
 So Ruffin went to a bigger place -- Cleveland -- but a smaller school -- 
Cuyahoga Community College -- to prove himself. Almost immediately, he proved 
himself to NBA players such as Ron Harper and Charles Oakley, who played 
against Ruffin in summer pickup games at Cleveland State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always picked to run in the first game with the pros, while the people 
that had been playing overseas were sitting down," Ruffin said. "If you play 
basketball, you know that's an accomplishment. That helped build my inner 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffin said former Cleveland State Coach Kevin Mackey also built Ruffin's 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Mackey told me I reminded him of a guy named Tim Hardaway," Ruffin 
said. "I'm thinking, 'Thanks a lot, but why not Isiah Thomas or somebody like 
that?' But once I saw (Hardaway of the Golden State Warriors), I really took it 
as a compliment." 
</P>
<P>
 And once Ruffin saw Hardaway's crossover dribble, he decided he would try it 
himself. Ruffin resembles Hardaway in facial features and muscular appearance, 
so he figured he might as well play like him, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll let you judge my crossover," Ruffin said. "I'm my biggest critic, so I'm 
definitely not going to praise myself. It's an effective move. Just because 
it's the 'UTEP two-step' doesn't mean he owns it. If it works for you, it works 
for you. Just because somebody has a Porsche doesn't mean you can't try to get 
one, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hardaway is not scared of anything, so I figure we're about the same size, 
same build, why should I be scared? He's pretty much been my driving force. 
Once I saw he could make it . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 After a year in Cleveland, Ruffin took his Texas two-step to Arizona Western 
College in Yuma, for, of all things, more recognition. Though Arizona Western 
is in the middle of the desert, it has a reputation for producing point guards. 
A decent one named Nate Archibald once played there. 
</P>
<P>
 In one season at Arizona Western, Ruffin averaged 30 points and eights 
assists, breaking all the NBA Hall of Fame guard's school records. Those 
numbers were good enough to earn Ruffin a free ride to Hawaii, where he started 
two seasons. As a senior, Ruffin averaged 20.8 points and was an All-Western 
Athletic Conference first-team selection and WAC tournament MVP. 
</P>
<P>
 While in Hawaii, Ruffin developed a reputation for being a prolific long-range 
shooter. In a game against Louisville, he had 10 three-pointers in scoring 42 
points. In Hawaii's first-round loss to Syracuse in the NCAA tournament, Ruffin 
had 24 points, including seven three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had definite NBA range, which a lot of guys coming out of college don't 
have," Musselman said. "He effortlessly shot the 'three' and that stuck out." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffin's range has continued to stick out in the summer league. He has made 12 
of 32 (38%) from behind the arc. But West says he would like to see more of 
Ruffin's passing skills. He is averaging only 3.4 assists and nearly 3.5 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He scores, but the summer league is conducive to scoring," West said. "He 
needs to learn how to get the ball to people." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruffin says he is trying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to look for my teammates first," he said. "There's enough time in 
the game where I don't have to search for my shot. I can let the game come to 
me as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I like to have the ball in my hands as much as possible. That way, you're 
always a threat to score. Coach (Larry) Drew told me to think in that nature. 
It's an adjustment, but it's not like I have to fight any old habits." 
</P>
<P>
 Laker assistant Bill Bertka also has been helping Ruffin make the transition 
from college shooting guard to NBA point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "He showing progress," Bertka said. "It's not only the skills part that's 
tough, but the mentality of it. People say he's similar to Tim Hardaway, but he 
doesn't make those kind of decisions yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that impressed me in Chicago was how physically strong he is and 
how he can take it to the basket. He's also got a very competitive nature and 
he has a strong inner confidence that reflects well." 
</P>
<P>
 But as Ruffin will tell you, that inner confidence wasn't always a great 
reflection on his character. But through hard work, Ruffin has managed to turn 
a negative into a positive. So even if he doesn't make the Lakers' roster, you 
won't hear him crying.  
</P>
<P>
 "No matter where you go, every day is not going to be perfect," Ruffin said. 
"You might as well take the good with the bad. If you can't get in the front 
door, there's always the back door, a window or something. Just getting in the 
house is the object."

KING OF THE ROAD; DAVID WOODWORTH NOT ONLY TRAVELS THE COUNTRY IN RVS, HE 
COLLECTS THEM IN NAME OF HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are about 25 million recreational vehicle enthusiasts in the United 
States, but there is only one David Woodworth. 
</P>
<P>
 A former pastor, Woodworth says he has not changed faiths, but to hear him 
talk you would swear he has converted from Christianity to RVism. His two-story 
house in Bakersfield has a few Christian decorations. It is loaded with RV and 
camping paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I collect everything from underwear to matches to canned goods to sleeping 
bags to folding furniture to hunting and fishing equipment," Woodworth says. 
"Anything that would be of interest to RVers for the period of time I'm 
focusing on." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodworth, 55, could very well be the country's only RV historian. When the 
Smithsonian Institute wants to set up a historical display, it calls him. It 
did so in 1986 for its exhibit, "At Home on the Road." After all, nobody else 
had an Imperial Toilet Tent from 1919. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Recreation Vehicle Industry Assn. organized its National RV History 
Tour, Woodworth was a natural. His enthusiasm for RVs and their progression 
through time borders on obsession. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the perfect ambassador," says Jon Tancredi, a spokesman for RVIA. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodworth, sponsored by RVIA, will travel to 87 cities this year, in an RV, of 
course, to preach the benefits of RV travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reasons for doing it are freedom, the chance to have your home with you, 
and to see the country in comfort," he says. "Those reasons have remained 
constant throughout the whole time. It's only the vehicles themselves that have 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodworth can tell you that the average RVer today is 49, owns his own home, 
earns just less than $40,000 a year, travels 5,900 miles and spends more than 
23 days on the road each year.  
</P>
<P>
 But he can also tell you that the first RVs were built in 1902. That one of 
the primary factors for the birth of RV travel was a growing dissatisfaction 
with leisure travel by train, which was considered by some to be too 
restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodworth can go into great detail about the first RVs, many of which were 
little more than modified cars. The McMillan Auto-Bed, a 1920s invention 
consisting of steel rods, brackets and a roll of thick canvass -- at a cost of 
$10 -- turned early Fords into RVs merely by transforming seat cushions into 
beds.  
</P>
<P>
 "Your bed conforms to every curve of your body, and it is wide enough and 
strong enough for two grown people or three -- yes, at a pinch, four children," 
reads an advertisement, one of hundreds Woodworth has on the shelves of his 
library. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodworth's home is full of such literature. He has all the records of the 
forerunners of the Good Sam Club -- it offers members travel benefits and 
discounts -- a group of Model T campers called the Tin Can Tourists organized 
in 1919. He has hundreds of old photographs, including one of a 1919 modified 
Cadillac "pulling trailer" and one showing a view of Camp Robert E. Lee and the 
vehicles used on "The Four Vagabond Camping Trips," a demonstration of sorts to 
publicize car camping in the late teens. 
</P>
<P>
 The four vagabonds were car maker Henry Ford, inventor Thomas Edison, 
naturalist John Burroughs and rubber tycoon Harvey Firestone. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Woodworth's books, "Motor Camping," published in 1923, explains the 
growing popularity of car camping during the Roaring '20s: 
</P>
<P>
 "In these days when the (traveling) habit is being contracted by many 
thousands who tour the southlands during the winter season and across the 
continent during the summertime, there are many who find it most convenient to 
have special caravan car bodies, which in effect are land yachts or traveling 
bungalows." 
</P>
<P>
 Such vehicles, some built on standard chassis and others made by special 
order, became known as motor bungalows. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outfit is a real home," wrote the book's authors, J.C. Long and John D. 
Long. "The beds are made up at night from the seats in somewhat the same manner 
that a lower berth takes shape under the deft hands of George, the porter. But 
these berths are longer, wider and infinitely more restful. Then the windows 
are large and can be raised without the aid of a crowbar." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodworth bought his first RV 25 years ago, a 1928 Ford Model A Phaeton that 
-- like other RVs of the day -- had been modified for car camping. 
</P>
<P>
 He became so caught up in his investment that he began traveling around the 
country in the old car, reaching a top speed of 60 m.p.h. on the straightaways, 
camping next to the modern RVs with his two daughters and a 1928 fold-out 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more I started looking into it, the more I realized that here is a major 
part of American history that still exists," Woodworth says. 
</P>
<P>
 He has since bought 22 more RVs, including his pride and joy, a 1937 Hunt 
House Car, which when new cost as much as a house -- about $2,500. But unlike 
many houses of the period, the Hunt House Car actually had a shower and 
restroom inside the house, or car, which Woodworth says is basically the same 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hunt House Car, built by cinematographer Roy Hunt and nicknamed "the 
Star," also had a two-burner stove that doubled as a heater and an icebox. 
About the only drawback of the art deco-style RV is that there are only a 
couple of places that a person 6 feet or taller can stand without bumping the 
ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodworth's Hunt House Car is fully restored and functional, but he doesn't 
drive it much. Nor does he drive the Model A. Or his 1929 Wiedman, or any of 
his 22 RVs for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The RVIA is paying Woodworth's expenses while he is touring the country, and 
letting him use a 34-foot Winnebago, complete with central air conditioning and 
heating, a VCR and all the other amenities of home. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodworth says making the transition from Model A to modern era was easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I get to travel in a brand new RV, with all modern conveniences," he 
says. "And I can sit on the couch and watch (the television show) 'Coach.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, the great indoors.

TOUGH TRANSITION GAME; TARVER STRUGGLES TO GAIN INVITATION TO NBA CAMP AFTER 
INJURY AS UCLA SENIOR LOWERED HIS STOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a move that was typical Shon Tarver, a sharp cut through the lane and a 
leap to the basket that so often ended with two points for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 However, early last season against Louisiana State, the jumping ability that 
vaulted him into the spotlight betrayed him. 
</P>
<P>
 As he drove the lane for a layup, he suffered a twisted right ankle when he 
landed on another player's foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarver was not the same the rest of the season -- he could not move without 
pain -- and the sky-high expectations of his senior season were never realized. 
When NBA Draft came in June, he was not selected. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 6-foot-5 guard's hopes to break into the NBA were renewed when he 
earned a spot on the Magic Johnson's All-Stars, one of 16 teams of NBA hopefuls 
and veterans competing in the Summer Pro League at UC Irvine over the next six 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the last chance for the former Santa Clara High standout to earn 
an invitation to a preseason camp after his ankle injury sidetracked his hopes 
to play in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarver regrets playing on that injury.  
</P>
<P>
 In hindsight, he wishes he would have sat out several weeks during the regular 
season rather than play through the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was playing injured, I just aggravated it," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It just got worse, but I really wanted to get out there, so I wound up 
playing on it. I did what I could." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but his production suffered. In seven games before getting hurt, he 
averaged 16.4 points and 6.6 rebounds a game. After the injury, the averages 
were 13.9 points and 4.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 As the season wore on, Tarver worried about mounting criticism.  
</P>
<P>
 Now he wishes people would have known the full extent of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were saying my head wasn't in it, that kind of stuff," Tarver said. 
"What I kind of wish was that (the injury) could have been known, if it had a 
higher profile, but I don't have any control over that." 
</P>
<P>
 He could not control what the NBA thought of him, either.  
</P>
<P>
 Once considered one of the premier guards in the Pacific 10 Conference, he did 
not impress scouts at the NBA's annual pre-draft camp in Chicago in early June. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of talk about Shon," said Brian Taylor, coach of Magic 
Johnson's All-Stars. "People were trying to figure out what happened to him 
last season. They were concerned about his shooting and what happened to his 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost seven months after getting hurt, Tarver says he has regained his 
explosiveness and mobility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's like rebuilding, starting all over from scratch," he said. "The more 
I play, the better off I am because I'm getting more acclimated to things 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarver's outside shooting, though, has been spotty. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a good stroke," Taylor said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a matter of him feeling confident. He's going to get those shots 
and he's got to take those shots." 
</P>
<P>
 In five Summer Pro League games, Tarver's numbers are modest: 12.2 points and 
3.8 rebounds in about 20 minutes a game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a struggle for Shon," Taylor said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed a little out of it in Chicago. It's always tough because you're put 
on teams with guys you've never played with before and you're supposed to 
shine. "It's going to take time in the gym. He does have the tools to be an NBA 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 But even if his offense does not come around, his defense might be enough to 
get him into a camp. "The last game we played, he was very important for us to 
win," Taylor said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Still, they're going to expect him to come off the bench and score in just a 
few minutes. "He won't be able to use an injury as an alibi, even if it's a 
good one. In the NBA you have to play with those nicks and injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarver has shown he can play well while injured, as he did when he scored a 
career-high 30 points in games against Oregon and California last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it was because of the adrenaline or playing against two lottery picks 
(Cal's Jason Kidd and Lamond Murray)," Tarver said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I seemed to be able to move a lot better. . . . but it's something you can't 
sustain." 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, Tarver's comfort level is rising, and so is his confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he'll get an opportunity to get into someone's camp," Taylor said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy working with him. He's got a great attitude. All he's got to do is 
keep working hard." 
</P>
<P>
 At least those are factors Tarver can control, and he's looking forward to the 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a learning experience," he said. "I know that I'm going to be OK. I'll 
be fine."

BURDETT DIES AFTER BATTLE WITH AIDS; OBITUARY: SPORTSMAN DIVISION DRIVER 
REVEALED HE WAS HIV-POSITIVE IN A LETTER IN SAUGUS SPEEDWAY RACING PROGRAM A 
YEAR AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Steve Burdett, a former Sportsman division driver at Saugus Speedway who 
retired from racing last season after announcing he was HIV-positive, has died 
after a five-month illness as a result of AIDS. He was 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdett died Thursday at 7:30 a.m. at his home in West Hollywood after 
battling lymphoma since February, according to his mother, Nanette Matuska. 
Burdett had been hospitalized periodically until a few weeks ago, Matuska said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had chemotherapy and he seemed to be getting better for a while," she 
said. "But they didn't think he was going to make it very long." 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 14, 1993, Burdett, a popular 10-year Saugus veteran, pulled off the 
track and out of the Sportsman points race in the middle of a 50-lap main 
event.  
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly fatigued by the virus but not suffering from AIDS, Burdett 
decided he was no longer able to meet the physical demands of driving. 
</P>
<P>
 He also seized the opportunity to deliver a message. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier that evening, in an open letter in the track's racing program, Burdett 
announced to the crowd of almost 5,000 that more than two years ago he tested 
positive for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 And although it was not mentioned in the letter, Burdett had begun to admit to 
his competitors that he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdett said he wrote the letter for the purpose of promoting AIDS awareness 
and to quell rumors about his sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This disease isn't going to go away overnight," Burdett said in an interview 
last August. "If it ever happens to other people, they can think back: 'Steve 
Burdett handled it. So can I.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As for his sexual identity, Burdett said, "I am who I am. I'm not going to 
pretend I'm someone I'm not. . . . I just hope people can accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 Burdett's career began in 1984 in Saugus' defunct Modified division. He joined 
the Sportsman class in 1986 but never won a main event or finished higher than 
11th in points.  
</P>
<P>
 Burdett competed part time after testing positive for HIV in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 After his retirement, Burdett's driving responsibilities were assumed by car 
owner Henry Miles of Sylmar.  
</P>
<P>
 The team was unable to finish the season because of mechanical and financial 
difficulties, and did not field an entry this season. "He was there helping 
me," Miles said about last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a real big part in actually having the car out there. But after the 
second time the engine blew, that was all there was to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Burdett continued to work as an auto mechanic in Hollywood before becoming 
ill, but he did not appear at Saugus this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in and out of the hospital quite a bit," Miles said. "Finally, it got 
to the point where they couldn't do anything more for him, so he went home." 
</P>
<P>
 Burdett is survived by his parents, who divorced when he was a toddler, a 
sister, two half-brothers and a half-sister. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is scheduled Friday at 7 p.m. at Bade Mortuary, 10177 
Tujunga Canyon Blvd., Tujunga.

SYLMAR CLEARED IN ITS HANDLING OF DISCIPLINARY CASES; REVIEW: L.A. UNIFIED 
RULES SCHOOL DID NOT GIVE PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT TO FOOTBALL PLAYERS ARRESTED 
IN CAMPUS DRUG SWEEP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District has ruled that three Sylmar High 
football players who were arrested in a recent campus drug sweep did not 
receive preferential disciplinary treatment from Sylmar administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 25, after a lengthy undercover operation at the school, 18 male 
students at Sylmar were arrested by the juvenile narcotics division of Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Three football players were arrested, two of them minors. All 18 were arrested 
on suspicion of felony sale of narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Browning, a senior district administrator, reviewed Sylmar's handling of 
the incident and ruled the players received no special treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Browning looked at it and was OK with it," said Barbara Fiege, City Section 
athletics commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar Principal Linda Ambro could not be reached Tuesday for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege said the athletics office received a tip that Sylmar had given the 
football players preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the players who were arrested have remaining eligibility. Neither was 
expelled and their arrest will not affect their athletic eligibility for the 
fall, Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the players arrested were considered to be among the serious 
offenders, Fiege said. Sylmar administrators separated the students into two 
groups according to the severity of the allegations and then disciplined them 
accordingly, Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the arrests dealt with the sale of marijuana, though at least 
one adult was arrested on suspicion of the felony sale of cocaine. Only three 
of the students arrested were adults. The names of the minors were not 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 An undercover officer posing as a student was placed on campus several months 
before the arrests were made. The sweep was made as part of a program in which 
schools are randomly singled out for undercover surveillance, police said.

SPURS TRADE THE RIGHTS TO CURLEY, A DRAFT PICK TO GET ELLIOTT BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Antonio Spurs re-acquired forward Sean Elliott on Tuesday when they 
sent the rights to first-round draft pick Bill Curley and a 1997 second-round 
draft pick to the Detroit Pistons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spurs traded Elliott to the Pistons last year for forward Dennis Rodman, 
who led the NBA in rebounding at 17.3 per game.The Pistons later tried to trade 
Elliott to the Houston Rockets for Robert Horry, but the deal was called off 
when Elliott failed a physical because of a kidney injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott, a restricted free agent, was expected to sign a multiyear deal with 
the Spurs beginning at about $1.35 million and allowing him to become an 
unrestricted free agent next season, according to Tuesday's San Antonio 
Express-News. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott played in 73 games last season and averaged 12.1 points. He has a 14.3 
scoring average for his five seasons in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-9 Curley was the 22nd overall pick in the June draft after 
finishing second on Boston College's career scoring list with 2,102 points and 
second in rebounding with 996.

KINGS MAKE HEADWAY WITH FREE AGENT BLAKE; HOCKEY: DEFENSEMAN, WHO SEEMED ON 
VERGE OF LEAVING, SAYS HE WOULD LIKE TO STAY IN LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Kings seemed almost resigned to moving forward without defenseman Rob 
Blake on their blue line next season, saying they were not confident he would 
return to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, the Kings and Blake sounded a more positive tone in regard to his 
future in Los Angeles. King General Manager Sam McMaster smiled and nodded, 
saying, "It's a pleasant situation. We've made some headway." 
</P>
<P>
 McMaster has spoken with Blake on the telephone and met with Blake's agent, 
Ron Salcer, for an hour and a half this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are coming around pretty good," Blake said Tuesday from his summer 
home in Canada. "There's a few stipulations they want to work on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to leave. Barry (Melrose) and the style he coaches best fits me 
and that helps the decision. Money is one thing, but where you like to play is 
important. If you get stuck in a city you don't like, it makes it tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Blake recently bought a home in the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kiss of death, right?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the Kings had offered him a four-year package in the $6-million 
range. Blake became a restricted Group 2 free agent on July 1. He said the 
Kings have since improved their offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rob is a great young defenseman," Melrose said of the 24-year-old. "We think 
Rob wants to stay here and we want him to stay here." 
</P>
<P>
 In other King developments: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Several prospects -- goaltender Jamie Storr and forwards Matt Johnson, 
Kevin Brown and Jeff Shevalier -- were in town for testing and other 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see what we're trying to build here," Melrose said at a Forum news 
conference. "They're all big. They're all talented. We've had them here for 
three days. . . . They're the direction we want to go with this team." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Training camp will start on Sept. 5 at the team's practice facility in 
North Hills. McMaster said that about 53 players will be invited to camp. 
Forward Phil Crowe, who played in 31 games last season and had two assists and 
77 penalty minutes, is a free agent and won't be back, Melrose said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The first exhibition game is Sept. 11 against the Mighty Ducks in San 
Diego. Three exhibitions are scheduled for the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose gave the four youngsters instructions for training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had them in here and told them they should come into camp thinking they can 
make the team," he said. "I said they're not here to meet Gretz (Wayne Gretzky) 
and shake hands with Marty (McSorley) and get autographs. I want them to come 
in with that attitude."

 Bond yields continued to slide Tuesday, as market optimism intensified ahead 
of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the dollar rose strongly despite news that the U.S. trade 
deficit widened in May. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, selling of some banking and technology stocks kept pressure on 
the broad market despite the ongoing bond rally. The Dow Jones industrials 
eased 7.12 points to 3,748.31. 
</P>
<P>
 In the credit markets, the Treasury's key 30-year bond yield fell to 7.46% 
from 7.50% on Monday; shorter-term yields also declined. 
</P>
<P>
 The T-bond yield has been dropping steadily from its recent peak of 7.73% on 
July 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan is to appear before a Senate panel today and Friday with updates on 
Fed economic and monetary policy. Recent reports suggesting that the economy 
slowed in the first half of this year have convinced many analysts that the Fed 
won't raise short-term rates again before late August at the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment has recently increased investors' willingness to buy bonds.  
</P>
<P>
 "The tone of the market has turned constructive," said Sung Won Sohn, chief 
economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the currency market, rumors of unrest in North Korea provided a 
reason for technically motivated traders to exchange Japanese yen for dollars, 
currency dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rumors started the ball rolling, but people were already looking to buy 
dollars for technical reasons," said Zlatko Glamuzina, chief dealer for the New 
York branch of Banco di Sicilia. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the Commerce Department reported a widening of America's overall trade 
deficit in May -- to $9.17 billion from $8.5 billion in April -- the U.S. 
deficit with Japan narrowed nearly 20% to $4.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts were doubtful, however, that the deficit figure represented a 
turning point in America's longstanding trade imbalance with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, currency dealers cheered the trade report, pushing up the dollar in New 
York to 99.25 Japanese yen from 98.35 on Monday. The dollar also gained against 
the German mark, to 1.568 marks from 1.547 on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, stocks were mostly lower amid a flood of quarterly corporate 
earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, retreating issues outnumbered advancing ones 9 to 8 on 
the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks traded in a narrow range throughout the day as investors reacted to 
earnings reports from some of the largest companies. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE Corp., General Electric, Sprint, TRW and Amgen were among those posting 
better-than-expected earnings, and their stocks rose accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earnings are coming in just about right, and there have been some nice 
positive surprises," said Bill Allyn, managing director at Jefferies & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But concern about earnings in certain sectors, particularly banking and 
technology, kept a lid on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer chip giant Intel, for example, announced earnings late Monday that 
were in line with expectations. But the company also said its profit margins 
shrank. The stock fell 1 5/8 to 57 on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase Manhattan's strong earnings report also was overshadowed by its remarks 
about tighter competition in the banking business. Chase shares slid 2 3/8 to 
36 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks losing ground with Intel included software firm Lotus 
Development, which dropped 5 5/8 to 33 1/8 after saying that product delays and 
pricing pressure hurt its second-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, computer maker Compaq, which is scheduled to announce earnings today, 
fell 1 1/4 to 33 1/4 in heavy trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Other losers included Computer Associates, down 7/8 to 40; Cirrus Logic, off 3 
5/8 to 27 5/8; Powersoft, down 4 to 50 3/4, and IBM, off 1 1/4 to 55 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Banking stocks hit by selling included Signet, which sank 4 3/8 to 36 1/2 on 
its earnings report. Among other falling issues, Citicorp dropped 1 1/4 to 40 
3/4, First Chicago eased 1 1/8 to 48 7/8 and BancOne lost 1 to 33 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 But California banking issues were mixed, as many California institutions 
reported strong quarterly earnings. First Interstate eased 7/8 to 78 and Wells 
Fargo slipped 1 1/4 to 157 1/2, but Ahmanson inched up 1/8 to 20 1/8 and Union 
Bank was unchanged at 29 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Southland-based biotechnology giant Amgen jumped 2 1/8 to 48 7/8 after its 
strong earnings report prompted several Wall Street brokerages to upgrade their 
ratings on the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merrill Lynch retreated 7/8 to 36 1/4 after reporting second-quarter 
earnings of $1.18 a share, compared to $1.52 in the equivalent three months of 
last year. That was below market expectations of $1.36 a share for the period. 
</P>
<P>
 * PepsiCo was unchanged at 30 1/2. The company said second-quarter profit rose 
5%, a sub-par performance that reflected lagging profits from the company's 
restaurants and beverage businesses abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Frankfurt share prices rose sharply in the last few minutes of 
trading, as players covered short positions. The market mood was buoyed by hope 
for a Bundesbank rate cut Thursday. The 30-share DAX average closed 30.60 
points higher at 2,128.79. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average ended 57.52 points higher at 20,775.16; 
London's Financial Times 100-share average rose 9.3 points to 3,091.3. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index finished 18.96 points lower at 2,255.30. 
</P>
<P>
 In U.S. commodity trading, corn and soybean futures fell to new contract lows 
Tuesday on favorable weather and a government report that painted a rosy 
picture for both crops. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets, copper futures reached contract highs and coffee cooled off 
as traders took profits from the recent jump in prices from damaging weather to 
Brazil's crop. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil prices closed mostly higher.

 Stronger than any other stone, resistant to heat, wear and electricity, 
diamonds are indeed forever. That's why diamond films are used to coat tools 
for machining aluminum-silicon alloys, the hard, lightweight materials that are 
critical to the auto industry. A new technology developed at the Department of 
Energy's Argonne National Laboratory can "grow" diamond films at least six 
times faster than current methods, thus reducing their cost and making new 
applications -- such as faster computer hard drives or new types of computer 
chips that operate at higher temperatures -- economically attractive. The usual 
process for growing diamond films involves hydrogen and methane. The latter, 
which is made of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms, provides the carbon, 
which is what diamonds are made of. When the elements are mixed together, a 
carbon atom separates and attaches itself to a film made of a neutral element 
-- but only after the hydrogen carries out a series of reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Argonne's method is faster because it eliminates hydrogen, methane and the 
associated intermediate steps. Argonne relies on "buckyballs" as a direct 
source of carbon. Buckyballs, also known as fullerenes, are recently discovered 
carbon molecules consisting of 60 carbon atoms arranged in a hollow shape, like 
a soccer ball. Microwaves excite a mixture of argon gas and buckyball vapor to 
break the buckyballs into carbon atoms that bond directly to the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Hear This: While most of us feel assaulted by the noise pollution of 
airplanes roaring overhead, dogs barking and car alarms blasting, these 
everyday noises could help with hearing tests for hard-to-test patients. 
</P>
<P>
 For small children and some adults, the pure tones of a standard hearing test 
often produce little response. Small children get bored or their minds wander, 
while some adults, such as stroke victims, also have difficulty paying 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But researchers at Pennsylvania State University have found that everyday 
sounds might elicit a response from these hard-to-test groups. In a study, the 
researchers filtered 25 sound effects to a narrow, one-octave bandwidth. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sounds, including those of cats, frogs and roosters, came from natural 
sources. Others, such as car horns and planes, were environmental noises. The 
sounds were tested on normal-hearing adults first. Researchers will test 
children next, who will probably pay more attention to yowling cats than to 
rarefied notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Plastics Surgery: Oil and water, as every schoolchild knows, don't mix. 
Neither do the molecules of different types of plastic. The more different the 
molecules, the less compatible they are, and that makes it very difficult to 
create certain kinds of composite plastics. But composites can be very 
valuable. They are often stronger and stiffer than metals, weigh less, don't 
corrode and are impervious to temperature changes and other types of stress. 
</P>

 Now scientists at the University of Dayton Research Institute and 
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base have come up with a way to chemically graft 
plastic molecules to form a strong, lightweight material. The problem they 
confronted was a very strong plastic, known as a rigid-rod polymer, that had a 
major flaw. When heated for molding, it darkened and decomposed instead of 
softening. If the scientists could mix it at the molecular level with a strong 
but flexible resin, they could create a molecular composite that, when heated, 
could be formed into shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 My Dotrong, a polymer research scientist at the University of Dayton, has 
patented a complex chemical process that breaks down the two plastics' tendency 
to repel one another, making possible a composite that retains strength and 
stiffness and can be molded. Though research is still in its early stages, 
scientists believe that the composites hold potential for the aerospace, 
automobile, housing and other industries.

 Collagen Blocker: Glaucoma, a cause of blindness in nearly 80,000 Americans, 
is the nation's second-most-common cause of blindness. While it can be treated 
with surgery, one of the complications is the scarring caused by the production 
of collagen, the main component of scar tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at UCLA's Jules Stein Eye Institute have found that 
gamma-interferon, a natural product of the body's white blood cells, inhibits 
the production of collagen. Most ophthalmologists use drugs after surgery to 
prevent scarring, but these drugs are toxic and can prevent cells from 
dividing, creating complications in other parts of the eye. While human 
clinical application is still a few years away, researchers found that 
gamma-interferon specifically inhibits collagen production. KATHLEEN WIEGNER

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; READY FOR THE FUTURE? APPLE'S NEW POWER MAC IS WORTH LOOKING INTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Apple Computer is known for its willingness to innovate and take risks, and 
those traits shine brightly in the company's new line of personal computers, 
the Power Macintosh systems.  
</P>
<P>
 These are the first PCs to come with a new-generation central processing unit 
-- the PowerPC chip -- but they maintain the legendary "look and feel" of the 
venerable Mac. Like the other Macs, they are elegantly designed, simple to set 
up and easy to use, but it will take a new generation of software to fully 
exploit their potential. 
</P>
<P>
 The PowerPC chip, which was developed by Apple, IBM and Motorola, is based on 
so-called reduced instruction set computing (RISC) technology. In principle, 
that means more performance from a smaller and cheaper package -- though Intel, 
which makes the 486 and Pentium CPUs for IBM-compatible PCs, claims its 
technology is as good or better. I judge a machine by how well it runs my 
software, and on that score, the Power Mac fares very well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The main advantage of Power Macs is that they are substantially faster than 
previous Macs. But there is a big caveat: To take advantage of the performance 
abilities of the new PowerPC, you need software that has been written or 
adapted for the chip. Programs designed specifically for this chip run in 
"native mode." Other Mac software runs in what's called emulation mode -- they 
require the machine to emulate the old-style Macs and their old-style CPUs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Power Mac does this emulation very well, but it comes at a performance 
price: Existing programs run more slowly on a Power Mac than they do on earlier 
high-end Macs, though the performance is certainly acceptable. There were about 
100 "native mode" PowerMac applications as of June 16, according to Apple. Most 
Macintosh software developers, over time, are expected to adapt their programs 
to run in native mode.  
</P>
<P>
 If you need a new Mac, you should seriously consider the Power Mac as an 
investment in the future. If you already have a Mac, you might want to postpone 
upgrading to a Power Mac until your favorite programs are adapted for use on 
the new machine. Despite the change in CPU, the basic software on the new Macs 
works just as it does on the older Macs -- a nice feature for those who are 
upgrading. 
</P>
<P>
 As with all Macs, the Power Mac 7100/66AV I tested was easy to put in gear. 
The entire setup process -- from sealed cartons to a working system -- took me 
less than 15 minutes. I never cracked open a manual and didn't give much 
thought to which cables went where. If they fit, I plugged them in. But that's 
exactly the point. There really wasn't any need to read anything or even to 
think about the process. It wasn't quite as simple as plugging in a new 
toaster, but it was close. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, there were no CONFIG.SYS files, AUTOEXEC.BAT files or WIN.INI 
files to worry about, as there are with IBM-compatible machines. The Macintosh 
system software -- which comes "pre-installed" -- simply worked, as did all the 
programs I installed. And the process, too, is pleasantly mindless: Insert a 
disk into the drive, click on the "Install" icon and wait while the machine 
copies the file. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this comes as a big surprise, since the Mac is famous for being easy 
to configure. What did come as a bit of a shock was how easy it was to use the 
CD-ROM drive that is built into this and other Macs that have the "AV" 
(audiovisual) designation. 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, running a multimedia CD title on the Mac involves inserting the 
disc and clicking on an icon. Compare this to Windows, where you typically have 
to run an "install" program and then wait while it copies several megabytes' 
worth of files are onto the hard disk. (Multiply this by several titles and you 
can quickly fill up a 200-megabyte drive.) 
</P>
<P>
 Then you have to worry about what that "install" program might have done to 
your CONFIG.SYS, AUTOEXEC.BAT, SYSTEM.INI and WIN.INI files. Some even copy 
files to your Windows system directory. Most CDs don't come with an "uninstall" 
program, so if you later decide to get rid of the program, you have no idea 
which files are safe to delete. 
</P>
<P>
 The Power Mac I tested came with an Apple monitor and built-in stereo 
speakers. All Macs have the ability to play back sound, while IBM-compatible 
PCs must be equipped with a special sound board. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple advertises that the Power Mac can run MS-DOS and Windows programs. 
That's true, but it requires a special program, called SoftWindows, which lets 
the Mac emulate a PC. It's OK if you have to run an occasional DOS or Windows 
program, but don't buy a Mac if what you really want is a machine designed for 
DOS or Windows. To run SoftWindows properly, you'll need a Mac with at least 16 
megabytes of RAM. Even then, Windows runs excruciatingly slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If what you do want is an easy-to-use Macintosh that's poised for the next 
generation of software, then a Power Macintosh makes a lot of sense. The prices 
start below $2,000, though you'll probably spend a lot more. The unit I tested, 
with 16 megabytes of RAM and a 500-megabyte hard disk, has a retail price of 
about $4,000, plus $599 for the audiovisual monitor and $90 for the keyboard.  
</P>
<P>
 Another option is to buy a less expensive Mac with a conventional (68040) CPU 
that can later be upgraded to PowerPC. Apple this week introduced a line of 
low-cost Macs designed for home use. Machines in the Macintosh Peforma 630 
family use a Motorola 68040 CPU and come with at least 4 megabytes of RAM and a 
250-megabyte hard disk. You can get an optional video-TV system just in case 
you want to watch television in a little window while you use your Macintosh. 
</P>
<P>
 The board will also allow you to capture video images that can be used as 
still graphics in reports and other documents. Prices for the new Performas 
range from about $1,500 to $2,349. Multimedia models with CD drives start at 
$1,900. Apple plans to release a Power Macintosh upgrade card for these 
machines, expected to be priced at about $600.

BLOODY CROWBAR FOUND IN FAMALARO'S HOUSE; EVIDENCE: POLICE CONSIDER TOOL A 
POSSIBLE WEAPON IN DEATH OF DENISE HUBER. SEARCH EXPANDED IN ORANGE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A search of the country club home of John Joseph Famalaro -- who has been 
charged with the murder of Denise A. Huber -- turned up a bloodied crowbar that 
police consider a possible murder weapon as authorities expanded their search 
Tuesday in Orange County seeking further evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Still fearing other victims, authorities were successful in tracking down at 
least five of nine women in Southern California and Phoenix whose names 
appeared on a list developed following a search at Famalaro's home. Detectives 
planned to appeal for the public's help Wednesday in locating the remaining 
people on the list, which included Huber's. 
</P>
<P>
 Court documents filed Tuesday in Arizona indicated that police have seized 
numerous suspicious items from Famalaro's home, including articles of women's 
clothing, some of which appear to be stained with blood, a blood-tainted tarp 
and what police suspect might be the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of the prosecution, a judge on Tuesday agreed to hold Famalaro, 
37, without bond. He was previously held in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 As the investigation continues, police are trying to determine whether the 
house painter is connected with two murders in Phoenix and one in Sedona. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more we have delved into it, the stranger and more likely the aggravating 
factors," said Yavapai County Deputy Atty. Tom Lindberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Shoults, whose wife, Gloria, was on the list, expressed surprise 
because their only connection with Famalaro was that they had sold him a van 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The police, who called to check on Gloria's well-being, "said that her name 
had turned up on some papers they had found," said Shoults, of Dewey, Ariz. 
"Having somebody like that in your neighborhood I guess does make your hair 
stand up a little bit, because this is generally a quiet area." 
</P>
<P>
 The revelations came days after the body of Huber, 23 at the time of her 
disappearance, was found in a freezer in the back of a stolen rental truck 
parked in Famalaro's driveway. The Newport Beach woman vanished three years ago 
after she became stranded on the Corona del Mar Freeway with a flat tire. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber was believed to have been bludgeoned to death, and a crowbar would be 
consistent with the type of weapon used, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Authorities, who have not ruled out additional suspects, said they want to 
question Famalaro's brother-in-law, Duane Thobe, and Famalaro's brother, 
Warren, in connection with the case. Warren Famalaro is a convicted child 
molester. Two days before Huber's body was discovered, Thobe went to the 
Arizona Public Service and asked that the power to John Famalaro's home be shut 
off, according to court documents. The next day, Famalaro's mother, Anne, 
requested that power be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 * Police concluded a comprehensive search of Famalaro's home. Using axes, 
rakes and shovels, authorities Tuesday dug as far down as 10 feet below the 
surface in three areas of Famalaro's home where cadaver-sniffing dogs had 
"alerted," but no new bodies were discovered. Investigators also expanded the 
search to other locations, including Sedona, where Famalaro once ran a handyman 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Orange County, police began visiting several storage lockers Famalaro had 
rented and had stored the deep freezer in before moving to Arizona. Police went 
to at least three local storage facilities Tuesday -- Trabuco Self Storage and 
Lake Forest Storage, among them, and an office in an industrial park in Laguna 
Hills that Famalaro used for his painting business. Costa Mesa Detective Sgt. 
Jerry Holloway said investigators "are finding some items of evidence that we 
can use," but he declined to elaborate. Investigators have also learned that 
people had been curious about the Ryder truck and the extension cord running to 
it, but that when neighbors and acquaintances of Famalaro asked what was in the 
the freezer, he would reply, "Meat." 
</P>
<P>
 * Investigators are focusing on reconstructing how Famalaro and Huber may have 
come into contact the night of her disappearance, June 3, 1991, and his 
movements since. Although police said Tuesday they believe she was killed in 
Orange County shortly after her abduction and then transported via freezer, it 
may be difficult to fix a time and place of death because of the condition of 
her body. 
</P>
<P>
 The freezer was purchased June 10, 1991, a week after Huber disappeared, at a 
Montgomery Ward & Co. store in Orange County, according to documents filed by 
the Yavapai County attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also have not been able to explain why the corpse would have 
been carted around for years after the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what makes this case bizarre -- the way he moves a body around like 
this," said Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith. "It doesn't make any sense." 
</P>
<P>
 * Law enforcement sources alternately discounted and were intrigued by the 
theory that Famalaro may have lured Huber to her death by posing as a law 
enforcement officer. Two phony Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department shirts 
were among the numerous items seized from his home. Both shirts had handmade 
replicas of the Los Angeles County sheriff's official patches sewn on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa's Lt. Smith said he thought Huber was "too smart to fall for such a 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that weighs against that theory is that it's very unusual to have a 
uniformed officer with long hair and a beard," Smith said, adding that everyone 
police have interviewed said Famalaro has sported a beard and mustache for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Other law enforcement sources found the bogus-police theory credible, as did 
Huber's family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe that Denise would get in a car with a stranger," Ione 
Huber, Denise's mother, said. "This makes sense. She would trust someone in a 
uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery of the list of names initially fueled speculation that the murder of 
Huber could be one in a string of multiple killings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is far from over," said Yavapai County sheriff's spokeswoman Laurie 
Berra. "We have to make sure we don't have additional victims." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's attorney, Lawrence William Katz, attacked the strength of the case 
against his client and the media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a serial killer here," Katz said. "This coverage has been 
completely overdone." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he fully expects a grand jury to indict Famalaro by Thursday. He 
vowed that he would immediately seek to overturn the indictment on the basis 
that excessive publicity has compromised the grand jury -- the same tactic used 
by O.J. Simpson's lawyers in his murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 If a grand jury does not issue an indictment Thursday, as expected, Famalaro 
is scheduled to appear at a preliminary hearing on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Search warrant papers filed in Arizona on Tuesday revealed that police 
confiscated an extensive array of potentially incriminating items from 
Famalaro's home during an exhaustive search last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the bloody crowbar, a number of seized items had crimson stains, 
including strips of white cloth, a tarp, tissue, a "yellow paper bodysuit," a 
sweatshirt and articles of women's clothing. Authorities are awaiting the 
results of blood and fingerprint tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Also found were purses, handcuffs, keys to handcuffs, numerous rolls of duct 
tape and masking tape, drug paraphernalia and other items of women's clothing 
that were not soiled with blood. They included a white blouse, a "teddy" and 
pantyhose, along with feminine napkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also seized videotapes and photographs, which they declined to describe 
the content of, as well as directions on how to use the freezer Huber's body 
was found in; two Rolodexes; an answering machine; hair samples; numerous spent 
.38-caliber cartridges; and plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
 At least initially, the list of names -- including that of one man -- caused a 
scare, because police feared that Huber, whose name was on the list, might have 
been just one victim. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of one woman, Susan Rose Baylard, police found her credit cards 
and identification. They also found credit cards belonging to Deborah Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women, as have others on the list, have since been contacted by 
authorities and appear to be alive and well, authorities said. Police would not 
say what relationship, if any, the women had with Famalaro. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few cases, police have only a first name -- "Donna" and "Mary' -- and are 
planning to solicit the public's help in identifying and locating the women. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Shoults, whose wife, Gloria, was on the list, said in an interview 
Tuesday evening that they had had no contact with Famalaro since they sold him 
a van in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know him," Shoults said. "When he bought the van from me he was new 
in town." 
</P>
<P>
 When news broke of Famalaro's arrest, Shoults said "it didn't ring a bell at 
all." But shortly thereafter, someone from the sheriff's department telephoned 
to check on his wife's well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 As more details emerged about Famalaro, court documents released Tuesday also 
spelled out how investigators made the grisly discovery last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, a suspicious Elaine Canalia alerted authorities 
about the Ryder rental truck parked at Famalaro's home last Wednesday. Canalia 
told Phoenix police that on the afternoon of July 9 she was at the Prescott 
Valley Flea Market where she met Famalaro, who was peddling paint. When 
Famalaro took her to his house, she became suspicious of the truck, in part, 
because it was covered with a tarp. 
</P>
<P>
 She jotted down the truck's license plate number and vehicle identification 
number and gave it to the Phoenix police, who turned the information over to 
the Yavapai County Sheriff's Office. 
</P>
<P>
 When sheriff's officials responded to his house, they noticed a number of 
paint cans around the truck and suspected that the location might be a 
"clandestine drug laboratory." 
</P>
<P>
 After narcotics officers searched, they concluded it wasn't a drug lab, but 
planned to seize the truck because it had been reported stolen from a Ryder 
outlet in San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to contact Famalaro at the house were unsuccessful, so authorities 
contacted a locksmith to open the truck and the trailer. When they saw the 
23-cubic-foot freezer, which was locked and taped shut, they decided it should 
be opened to make sure nothing valuable would perish when the power was turned 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the lid was opened," court documents say, "a strong odor of a decomposed 
body struck Detective Mark Garcia. He then noticed in the freezer what was a 
large bundle of black plastic. Garcia then felt that plastic and felt what he 
determined was an arm to a body." 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's body lay frozen in a semi-fetal position with the hands handcuffed 
behind her back. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives immediately quizzed neighbors, who said Famalaro had moved into the 
house 1 1/2 years ago and that the Ryder truck had first appeared in January. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3:30 p.m. that afternoon, Famalaro was stopped in a red 1994 Jeep Cherokee 
and was taken into custody for possession of the stolen truck. That day, police 
also recovered a white van with a bullet hole that belongs to Famalaro. 
</P>
<P>
 According to investigators, the Ryder truck was rented Jan. 28 for one-day 
service. Ironically, it was reported stolen to the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department on July 12, the day before Huber's body was discovered, due to a 
"foul-up" in paperwork by Ryder. 
</P>
<P>
 Piecing together what little they have, police suspect that Huber was killed, 
stored in the freezer in a Laguna Hills storage bin for a year, then moved to a 
San Clemente storage facility, where it was kept in about a year and a half 
before being transported to Famalaro's Prescott Country Club home. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear whether a trial, should there be one, would be held in 
Orange County or Arizona. As prosecutors prepared for a secret grand jury 
proceeding or a possible preliminary hearing, they too expressed concern about 
the amount of attention the case had garnered, and possible tainting of the 
jury pool in this county of 120,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Also unclear is how soon the family will be able to bury Huber in South Dakota 
next to her grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents, Ione and Dennis Huber, said medical examiners in Arizona told 
them Tuesday that they cannot release their daughter's body until they complete 
tested on two items believed to be the murder weapons, one of which is believed 
to be the bloody crowbar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our funeral plans are up in the air, but we don't want to pressure them," 
Ione Huber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, the Hubers granted interviews to several television 
stations, saying they were still trying keep their daughter's case, which has 
attracted national attention from the beginning, alive, and encouraging people 
with possible information about the suspect to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's parents, meanwhile, paid a visit to their son in jail late Tuesday. 
Also listed as visiting him was a local bail bondsman. But late Tuesday he was 
still incarcerated. 
</P>
<P>
 A jail official said Famalaro attended a religious "rap session" Saturday 
night along with about two dozen other inmates. The official said he did not 
talk about himself but participated in the program by singing songs and hymns, 
which included "Rock of Ages." He also asked for a Catholic Bible. The official 
said he did not seem depressed, as he has been described by his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Faicchio Sr., Famalaro's former roommate in Lake Forest, said Tuesday, "I 
really think he just flipped. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "One never knows anybody really," he said. "How could you truly? Be a mind 
reader or something?" 
</P>

CLUES SIFTED FOR MIND-SET OF A KILLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE MARQUIS, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A titillating trophy, a twisted sexual fantasy-come-true, a silent but grisly 
means of revenge. In the mind of Denise A. Huber's killer, experts say, the 
23-year-old victim may have symbolized a way to resolve sexual impotence or 
infantile conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who follow the history of bizarre and brutal crimes have never before 
heard of one quite like this: A young woman apparently bludgeoned to death, 
then carted around, naked and handcuffed, in a freezer for as long as three 
years. But some psychiatrists and criminologists ventured to speculate Tuesday 
on the murderer's mind-set. 
</P>
<P>
 "The handcuffs suggest to me the person was frightened of women. . . . The 
freezing of the body suggests tremendous ambivalence, love-hate, a desire to 
preserve and keep intact. This is coming from a very disturbed individual," 
said Dr. Lawrence Sporty, a Tustin psychiatrist on the faculty at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 The murder suspect, arrested last week after the body was found in a stolen 
rental truck at his Arizona house, is John Joseph Famalaro, a painting 
contractor described variously by those who knew him as amiable or 
irresponsible and reclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 There would not necessarily be any obvious signs of disturbance in someone who 
committed a murder like Huber's, several experts said. All cautioned that they 
could not comment specifically on Famalaro or his background. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at (Jeffrey) Dahmer," said Robert R. Hazelwood, an experienced former 
FBI criminologist, referring to the case of a murderer who ate parts of his 
victims' bodies. "He seemed normal to a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Some psychiatrists suggested that Huber's killer could have been on the losing 
end of a long-running power struggle with a domineering mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly (the crime) represents some extreme desire to control and destroy," 
said Dr. David Spiegel, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the 
Stanford University School of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would not be surprising if it represented some displaced anger toward a 
mother who intruded and controlled his life. . . . It may play out some fantasy 
of being in complete control of a person." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's mother, like John, left conflicting impressions on friends and 
acquaintances. Anne Famalaro has been described as a strong-willed, 
opinionated, religious woman who was involved in conservative causes, such as 
the drive for "fundamental schools" in Santa Ana, before moving to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very argumentative type of a person," said Santa Ana City Atty. 
Edward J. Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another Orange County acquaintance, Beverly Schick, described the mother 
as a "wonderful person" who did a lot of community work. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, who moved to Arizona 1 1/2 years ago reportedly to care for his 
parents, lived next door to his mother in Dewey, about 15 miles from Prescott. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother, who could not be reached for comment Tuesday, told The Times on 
Sunday that she really couldn't tell reporters much about her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's a good boy," she said. "I don't know what to make of all this." 
</P>
<P>
 There were, however, suggestions of trouble in the family. Famalaro's older 
brother, Warren, was committed for nearly nine years to a state mental hospital 
for sexually assaulting two minors while a chiropractor. He subsequently lost 
his license. 
</P>
<P>
 David Stark, a chiropractor who purchased Warren's practice in the early 1980s 
and got to know several members of the family, said Anne Famalaro was ambitious 
for her children. 
</P>
<P>
 Stark recalls one of the sons telling him that in their childhood, whenever 
the family drove past workers toiling by the side of the road, Anne Famalaro 
would point to them, admonishing her children: "Do you want to do that all your 
life? You'd better work harder." 
</P>
<P>
 After Warren's conviction, his mother, a devout Roman Catholic, barely spoke 
to him, Stark said. Although Warren worked as Stark's office manager as part of 
the buyout agreement and his mother frequently stopped by for treatments, Anne 
Famalaro all but ignored her son, the chiropractor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wouldn't even talk to Warren," he said. "She would come in, get her neck 
adjusted and leave. I think she just stopped her communication with Warren." 
</P>
<P>
 Stark said both brothers were ambitious, but that Warren was successful while 
John's efforts always seemed to fall short. Each time John came in to the 
office, Stark said, he seemed to be starting on a new career. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day he was going to chiropractic college, the next time he was going to 
(police) cadet school, then he was trying real estate. Then the next time he'd 
be talking about going to law school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 John also was frenetic, "always going a mile a minute, talking about whatever 
he had going next," Stark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Park Dietz, the country's best known forensic psychiatrist, said the 
storage of the body in a freezer could relate to necrophiliac fantasies. 
Necrophiles are aroused by sexual contact with, or sexual fantasies about, 
corpses. 
</P>
<P>
 Dietz, the government's key witness in the Dahmer case, said necrophiles often 
have a particular concern about being rejected or humiliated and not performing 
well enough. "These are more often going to be momma's boys not successful at 
dating," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing report for Warren Famalaro included a statement from a former 
girlfriend, Mary Willhoite, who said Anne had tried to force the couple apart. 
She told authorities that the mother once threatened to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts suggested that Huber's murderer could have had an elaborate 
fantasy life involving his victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The body "could be a reminder of what was exciting, namely the murder. It 
could represent an affirmation of some achievement of power in his life," said 
Dr. Bruce Danto, a Fullerton forensic psychiatrist who was a homicide detective 
for eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 As Dietz put it, necrophiles "have a rough awareness of what's turning them 
on. . . . What they don't understand is why they have this taste. They're 
ashamed of the sexual part of what they do" but not necessarily of violence 
they might perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Dietz said the desire is not for the corpse per se, "but for the unresistant, 
undemanding, totally compliant, totally controlled sexual partner." 
</P>
<P>
 Necrophiles are a varied group, he said. Many merely fantasize, while there 
are others like Dahmer, who drugged his partners so he could have sex with them 
for hours, and then tried to perform lobotomies on his victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one knows how common (necrophilia) is," he said. "It's one of the darker 
secrets." 
</P>
<P>
 Dietz and others said the reason Huber was stored in a freezer need not 
involve necrophilia or have symbolic significance. It could be practical: The 
murderer could have been trying to obscure the time of death and confound those 
trying to build a case against him, or to delay discovery of the body. 
</P>
<P>
 But that would not explain the handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question I would have is when she was dead, why weren't the handcuffs 
removed? . . . That would indicate symbolism," Hazelwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts disagree on what would inspire this type of killer. Spiegel said it 
could be an accumulation of small offenses over the course of a lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if there is a common profile," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe there are a lot of uncorrected small transgressions in their lives and 
they just blow up. They absorb more than a normal person would." 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, he said, may be "a replacement for a person they'd really like to 
kill." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sporty said such a gruesome crime would have to be inspired by something 
much more traumatic, such as severe and repeated child abuse -- and even that 
probably would not fully explain it. 
</P>
<P>
 He and others suggested a brain injury or substance abuse could have played a 
role. Dahmer, for example, was an alcoholic. 
</P>
<P>
 "People can survive and recover (from abuse) without it coming out to be 
anything like this horrendous crime," he said.

NEWS ANALYSIS; SIMPSON CASE IGNITES DEBATE ON LEGAL ETHICS; LAW: ETHICAL BOUNDS 
OF DEFENSE LAWYERS' REMARKS ARE MURKY IN STATE. GARCETTI'S COMMENTS ARE ALSO 
QUESTIONED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the legal profession is full of people known for their rhetorical 
excesses, even lawyers face limits on what they can say. 
</P>
<P>
 No lesser authority than the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that lawyers must 
watch their remarks in an attempt to assure fair and just trials. But in 
California -- the only state that has not adopted American Bar Assn. rules on 
lawyers' comments -- the line between fair comment and foul play is often 
murky. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is no surprise that the latest comments from O.J. Simpson's defense 
team, headed by Century City lawyer Robert L. Shapiro, have touched off a 
robust debate in legal circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Simpson's defense team, speaking anonymously to reporters, 
suggested that Los Angeles Police Detective Mark Fuhrman may have planted 
evidence in an attempt to frame the former football star on murder charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind calling someone a liar to his face, but to just slander someone 
anonymously and slink off into the darkness, this bothers me," said Los Angeles 
defense lawyer Harland Braun, referring to the unsubstantiated and hotly denied 
suggestion that Fuhrman may have planted a bloody glove at Simpson's estate. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, defense lawyer Barry Tarlow said Simpson's attorneys had 
been "forced to descend into the gutter approach of litigation used by Dist. 
Atty. Gil Garcetti." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the prosecution side has come in for its share of criticism -- largely 
because of public comments by Garcetti and leaks from unnamed law enforcement 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarlow blasted a "devastating series of orchestrated leaks" about Simpson -- 
most recently, reports that the former football star was carrying a passport 
and $10,000 when he led police on a low-speed chase through Orange and Los 
Angeles counties a month ago, casting doubt on the ex-athlete's statements that 
he was contemplating suicide in the wake of his former wife's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran defense lawyer Gerald L. Chaleff said both sides are leaking 
information and theories to the media in an attempt to manipulate the opinion 
of potential jurors in the double murder case: "None of these statements, 
suppositions or leaks can be cross-examined." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tragic to see a case like this where we seem to have a trial by leak or 
press release," Chaleff said. "Throughout this entire process, no one is coming 
forward to take responsibility for statements, leaks or suppositions that are 
being released, either from the Los Angeles Police Department or from the 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it is the allegation that Simpson was carrying cash and a passport, or 
the claim that Fuhrman may have planted evidence, "the press ought to say we 
are not going to publish this unless someone is willing to sign their name to 
it," Chaleff said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a long tradition of lawyers trying to manipulate the media, but this 
case is different, said West Los Angeles defense lawyer Barry Levin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time I as a defense lawyer feel I can ethically benefit my client by 
making a pretrial release of information, I will do so. But most of the time no 
one in the media will listen. It's not Bob Shapiro's fault that the media has 
an insatiable appetite for any story or theory in this case. He's just doing 
his job." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Marcia A. Morrissey agreed. "The defense would not be doing 
their job correctly if they ignored the media," she said. "We don't litigate 
cases in vacuums, unfortunately." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Shapiro told the National Assn. of Criminal Defense lawyers in a 1993 
speech that "the importance and power of the media cannot be overemphasized" in 
high-profile cases when the media comes "in droves." 
</P>
<P>
 In a landmark 1966 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the murder 
conviction of Cleveland physician Sam Shepard on the grounds that he was denied 
a fair trial because of extensive pretrial publicity. However, the high court 
added that such reversals are not a total solution: 
</P>
<P>
 "The courts must take such steps by rule and regulation that will protect 
their processes from prejudicial outside interferences. Neither prosecutors, 
counsel for defense, the accused, witnesses, court staff nor enforcement 
officers coming under the jurisdiction of the court should be permitted to 
frustrate its function." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, by a narrow majority, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that greater 
restrictions can be placed on the speech of a lawyer handling a case than can 
be imposed on other people. The purpose of the restrictions is to assure a fair 
and just trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic standard set out by the high court is whether a lawyer's comment 
poses "a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing a judicial 
proceeding." But that standard is too vague to offer lawyers any "bright line 
guidance," said USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Anthony Kennedy's plurality opinion stressed, however, that particular 
care must be taken with any regulation that would inhibit "the criminal defense 
bar, which has the professional mission to challenge the actions of the State." 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, the Nevada Bar Assn. attempted to sanction a defense lawyer for 
comments he made after his client was indicted. The lawyer portrayed 
prospective government witnesses as drug dealers and money launderers. The 
Supreme Court held that the Nevada rules were too vague to give the lawyer 
sufficient guidance on what he was permitted to say. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Bar Assn. has adopted model rules about lawyer comments on 
pending litigation. But there is little case law to provide guidance on the 
ethics of what lawyers can and cannot say about a case, Chemerinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is particularly murky in California because it is the only state 
that has not adopted the American Bar Assn. rules, said New York University law 
professor Stephen Gillers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that, it is highly unlikely that attorneys on either side of the 
Simpson case would face bar association or court sanctions for comments they 
have made, legal experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are no rules, then there are no rules to break," Gillers said. He 
said that if California had the ABA rules, lawyers on both sides in the Simpson 
case might be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited statements by Garcetti on "This Week With David Brinkley" on June 19, 
two days after Simpson was arrested. "Well, it's not going to shock me if we 
see an O.J. Simpson, sometime down the road -- and it could happen very soon -- 
it could happen months from now -- say, 'OK, I did do it, but I'm not 
responsible.' We've seen it in Menendez. It's going to be a likely defense 
here, I believe, once the evidence is reviewed by the lawyers," Garcetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any suggestion of an ultimate guilty plea" violates one of the ABA rules, 
Gillers said. "The district attorney is not supposed to predict a guilty plea 
because it signals to the public a likelihood of culpability based on what the 
public assumes is the prosecutor's broader knowledge of the case. The subtext 
is 'I know the facts.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti disagreed with Gillers' interpretation of the rule. "As a prosecutor, 
it is my job to anticipate defenses," he said. "The ABA section in question 
does not go to anticipating possible defenses, but to a situation involving a 
possible guilty plea of a defendant or in which a defendant has already made a 
confession or admission." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillers said that statements attributed to the defense team suggesting 
Detective Fuhrman planted evidence violate a different ABA rule against 
attacking the character of a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for a response, Shapiro said: "I won't take any position on any 
evidentiary matter except in the courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillers also said the defense might have run afoul of an ABA rule in referring 
to allegedly racist remarks Fuhrman made when he was attempting to get a stress 
disability pension from the Police Department in 1983. Gillers said those 
statements might have violated a rule against commenting on information "the 
lawyer knows or reasonably should know is likely to be inadmissible as evidence 
in a trial and would, if disclosed, create a substantial risk of prejudicing a 
fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
 However, other lawyers disagreed, saying it was possible that Fuhrman's prior 
statements might be admissible on cross-examination as part of a defense effort 
to show that he was biased against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, Gillers said, even those states that have adopted the ABA rules 
do not enforce them vigorously. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemerinsky said much of what lawyers in the case have said to the media has 
been "completely appropriate," including a Garcetti news conference in which he 
praised the prosecution team after Simpson was bound over for trial, and 
various statements by Shapiro questioning the strength of the prosecution case. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said he, too, was troubled by Garcetti's comments on the Brinkley show 
and by the suggestion that Fuhrman planted evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense has no obligation to speak to the press at all, but once they've 
made the accusation that the police officer planted evidence, they have an 
obligation to say what the factual basis for that statement is," Chemerinsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a factual basis, an immediate disciplinary and criminal 
investigation of the officer should be launched. If there is no factual basis, 
the policeman is owed an immediate apology and the lawyers acted unethically," 
Chemerinsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillers said the defense had no such obligation, and said he would be 
surprised if the defense came forth with more information on the issue at this 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kind of motive that would prompt them to make the charge is inconsistent 
with the desire to explain themselves. By leaving it unexplained, they play 
into rumor and public suspicion." 
</P>
<P>
 One possible remedy available to both sides is seeking a gag order. Thus far, 
neither side has done that or even hinted that it plans to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Garcetti said: "We have never asked for a gag order in a case, 
and I cannot imagine a situation in which we would." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said: "If we were to seek a gag order, we would do that in court and 
we would not discuss it beforehand." 
</P>
<P>
 Gag orders are granted infrequently. Last year, a federal appeals court 
overturned a gag order imposed on Braun by a federal judge presiding over the 
criminal trial of four Los Angeles police officers accused of beating Rodney G. 
King. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals court said that Braun could not be prohibited from making critical 
comments about the prosecutors in the King case. Ultimately, his client and one 
other officer were acquitted and two officers were convicted and are serving 
federal prison terms.

ISRAEL SUGGESTS SHARED CONTROL OF HOLY SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In hope of holding on to this spot as its "eternal and undivided capital," 
Israel is exploring establishment of an "interfaith administration" for the Old 
City and other holy places, diplomats said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 This would give Christians and Muslims a share in control of those parts of 
the 5,000-year-old city that are sacred to them -- and effectively remove the 
question of Jerusalem's future from the international agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Israel has aroused the interest of the Vatican on the Christian side 
and of Jordan and Morocco on the Muslim, the diplomats said. Israel is talking 
through intermediaries with Saudi Arabia because of its leading position in 
Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerusalem's future is "closed politically but open religiously," Israeli 
Foreign Minister Shimon Peres asserts these days, adding that he finds 
"interesting" the saying of King Hussein of Jordan that "sovereignty of the 
holy places belongs to the Almighty in Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 Hussein's strong interest in Jerusalem, where his family has had the role of 
protector of Islamic shrines, could well make its future a major issue when he 
meets Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Monday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But Palestinians, who want East Jerusalem as capital of an independent 
Palestine, are alarmed at Israel's approach, fearing it will deprive them of 
one of their strongest arguments for a share of Jerusalem and scatter 
international allies they now have on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is Israel raising the Jerusalem issue, and in a pressing way, at this 
moment, although it was the party that insisted on postponing the discussion 
about it until the final-status talks?" the East Jerusalem newspaper Al Quds 
asked in an editorial reflecting the mounting Palestinian concern. "The object 
might be to close the (topic) of the city before the time for negotiations 
about it comes." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the accord on Palestinian self-government signed in September, Israel 
and the Palestine Liberation Organization must open negotiations within two 
years on Jerusalem's future and other issues that must be resolved for final 
settlement of the Palestinian question. Although the other issues, including 
statehood, borders and Jewish settlers, will be very difficult, Jerusalem's 
fate has already emerged as the most emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat in ringing tones and in virtually every speech 
promises Palestinians they again will be able to travel to Jerusalem to pray at 
its Islamic and Christian shrines. And Israeli rightists opposed to the accord 
with the PLO use that image and the possible division of Jerusalem into two 
capitals, one Israeli and the other Palestinian, to bring tens of thousands of 
demonstrators to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli maneuver became dramatically clear when Israel extended an 
invitation to Hussein to visit Jerusalem and pray at Al Aqsa mosque, whose 
golden dome he had re-gilded this year; the invitation was offered after Israel 
put off requests by Arafat and senior PLO officials to make the same 
pilgrimage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Should (Hussein) come, he can expect a very nice reception as the head of a 
country that wants to make peace with Israel and as one whose family 
traditionally and historically has been in charge of maintaining the Islamic 
holy places," Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert said of the invitation to the king. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept that Peres and other Israeli officials have been exploring, 
diplomats here said, would place the shrines and perhaps the whole of the 
walled Old City under an interfaith committee made up of Christian, Jewish and 
Muslim representatives, removing the religious sites from all Israeli 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Israelis believe that, if they can get an agreement on 'Holy Jerusalem,' 
then dealing with municipal Jerusalem will be easier," a senior Western 
diplomat said, assessing multiple off-the-record conversations he has recently 
had on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, much of the emotion will be drained away, and all sides will be 
reassured about their shrines," the diplomat said. "Secondly, the remaining 
Arab portions of Jerusalem might even be sliced into another, adjacent 
municipality -- call it East Jerusalem, call it Al Quds as the Arabs do -- and 
that could become the Palestinian capital without dividing the present urban 
area." 
</P>
<P>
 In suggesting an interfaith administration, Israelis have stressed that none 
of the religions would have primacy, diplomats said, and the question of 
sovereignty, a major issue not only for Israelis and Palestinians but for all 
Arabs, would be left open. They distinguish between this concept and past 
proposals to "internationalize" the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis emphasize that full control of the holy places -- particularly 
the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the traditional burial place of Jesus, the Al 
Aqsa mosque and the Dome of the Rock, from which the Prophet Mohammed is 
believed to have ascended to heaven -- would be with the Christians and Muslims 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish representatives would be responsible for the Western Wall, Judaism's 
holiest site as the remains of the ancient temple. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned, Christian representatives would come from the denominations 
long active in Jerusalem, particularly Catholics, Greek and Russian Orthodox, 
Anglicans and Lutherans. The Muslim representatives would come from those 
countries -- Jordan, Morocco and Saudi Arabia -- that have exercised 
custodianship over Islamic holy places and from Palestinians. Jewish 
representatives would probably be Israeli but could include Jews from other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In a visit to Jordan this month, Archbishop Jean-Louis Tauran, who serves as 
the Vatican's foreign minister, urged that discussions about Jerusalem's future 
be brought forward -- and not restricted to Israel and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before territorial problems are solved, we have to find international 
guarantees to safeguard the uniqueness of the city . . . as assurance that, 
never again, one party would claim Jerusalem as their possession," Tauran said.

<P>
NO HAITI INVASION BEFORE SEPTEMBER, OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED and DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a steady drumbeat of threats aimed at frightening Haitian military 
leaders out of power, the Clinton Administration has set aside any plan for 
armed intervention here until September at the earliest, U.S. and foreign 
officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason is practical, the officials said: The U.N. force that would be 
needed to provide order on the island after U.S. troops came ashore will not be 
ready before the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Administration officials noted, Democratic leaders in 
Congress have asked President Clinton to hold off, expressing fears that the 
U.S. public is not yet convinced that an invasion is justified. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we're talking months," a senior U.S. official said when asked 
how long the option of military action was being delayed, "but weeks, sure." 
Asked if that meant that no invasion was likely before September, he nodded 
affirmatively. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, a State Department official involved in Haiti policy said it is 
becoming clear that no military action would be launched in August. "I don't 
think we're moving that fast," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Jerusalem, Secretary of State Warren Christopher said he is willing to 
wait for some time before recommending an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need to see if the sanctions won't work," Christopher said. "The 
new, enhanced sanctions have only been in effect for a limited period of time. 
Clearly nobody thinks the use of force is the most attractive option. . . . It 
may come to that, but the President has not made that decision. He is 
continuing to go forward with the (sanctions), trying to put the maximum amount 
of pressure on the illegal government." 
</P>
<P>
 The officials' estimates conflicted with the Administration's own public 
threats against the regime of Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the military leader who 
overthrew Haiti's elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a week ago, in Berlin, Clinton said the Cedras regime's continued 
existence is intolerable. "We have got to bring an end to this," he declared. 
But even while he is keeping the military option on the table, Clinton still 
hopes that Cedras will decide to leave without an armed confrontation, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats in the Haitian capital said the main factor delaying military action 
is the inability of the United States and its key allies to assemble an 
international force to handle peacekeeping duties after any invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. diplomat said there are three crucial problems in forming the force, 
which could include more than 15,000 troops and civilian experts -- "finance, 
mandate and command and control" -- meaning the countries involved in 
organizing the plan have not settled on how to pay for the force, what it is 
supposed to achieve and who would run the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are major obstacles, said a diplomat from a country that has been asked 
to contribute to the force. "Those three elements are the defining ones. 
Without all three in place, there is no international force." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that his government's assessment is that it will take "two or three 
months" before the international unit is in place. "My government will not take 
part as things stand now," he said. He added that "we fully expect the issues 
to be settled." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. diplomat, looking distressed, agreed that "nothing will happen 
(regarding armed action) until all three" disagreements are resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is a change in the design of the international force. The 
original idea, which grew from negotiations between the Haitian military and 
Aristide in 1993, was for a small U.N. force that would retrain the Haitian 
military and police as part of a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 But the force now under consideration would be a much larger, U.S.-led 
operation that would maintain order, guarantee the safety of the Aristide 
government and the military and assume some degree of civil control. 
</P>
<P>
 That shift is a major factor in the difficulty of putting together the force, 
according to other diplomats, because it costs far more and changes the role 
from one essentially of trainer to occupier. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine Albright, said 
a dozen or so nations, including some in Latin America and the Caribbean, had 
agreed to join the United States in a peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
 But diplomats interviewed Tuesday stressed that those countries' commitments 
are tentative. The nations include Argentina, Barbados, Belize, Brazil, Canada, 
Chile, France, Guyana, Jamaica, Panama, Suriname and Trinidad. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic U.S. politics are also a consideration in any possible Haiti actions, 
according to officials here and in Washington. Democratic leaders in Congress 
have warned Clinton that the public is not ready for military intervention and 
urged him to give economic sanctions longer to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), Senate Armed 
Forces Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and House Foreign Affairs Committee 
Chairman Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.) all weighed in publicly against an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said they took the legislators' views seriously but 
refused to say whether they had pushed back the possible time frame for 
military action. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Lake, Clinton's national security adviser, acknowledged Tuesday that 
the congressional leaders had urged caution and said the Administration 
promised to "consult" with Congress further before an invasion is launched. He 
suggested that Clinton would expect the nation to rally behind the U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the President were to order a military operation in Haiti, he would 
certainly go to some lengths to explain to the American people with precision 
what our interests are, what the mission is . . . (and) when we expect to 
accomplish it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton faces a political dilemma in considering the timing of an invasion of 
Haiti, but it is long-term rather than short-term. Administration officials and 
military officers said a well-planned U.S. invasion would take a few days, at 
most, to overwhelm Haiti's lightly armed 7,000-member army. The problem, they 
said, would come afterward -- when U.S. and allied troops try to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the military regime already have threatened to go underground in 
the face of an invasion so they can launch terrorist attacks against occupation 
troops. Any peacekeeping operation would require "many months," Christopher 
warned earlier this month.

D.A. MEETS WITH BLACK LEADERS ON FAIRNESS ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Recognizing the racial sensitivities underlying O.J. Simpson's prosecution on 
charges of double murder, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti met for nearly two hours 
Tuesday with prominent members of Los Angeles' African American community, who 
emphasized their misgivings about whether the football great is being treated 
fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those in attendance were some of the best-known names in black Los 
Angeles -- the Rev. Cecil Murray of First African Methodist Episcopal Church; 
John Mack, president of the Los Angeles Urban League; Joseph Duff of the 
National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People; civil rights attorney 
Connie Rice; Joe Hicks of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; 
attorney Johnnie L. Cochran, and Judge Roosevelt Dorn, whose voluntary transfer 
in January left the Downtown criminal courts bench with no blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging with Mack from the private meeting at the Urban League headquarters 
in the Crenshaw district, the district attorney said he assured the group that 
Simpson will get a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're interested in fairness for Mr. Simpson and that's my interest also," 
Garcetti said. "But we're also interested in fairness to the victims and 
interested in fairness, frankly, for the community as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Mack said the group of ministers, lawyers, civil rights leaders and others 
made suggestions to Garcetti designed to ensure that Simpson receives a fair 
trial and that blacks would perceive it in that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those suggestions, Mack said, was a strong one that the district 
attorney integrate the all-white, all-male panel that will decide whether the 
death penalty should be sought against the former football great. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack said Garcetti was also pressed to ensure that the jury that will decide 
Simpson's fate be racially mixed. "It is essential," Mack said, "that O.J. 
Simpson be tried by a jury that is representative of the immense diversity of 
this city, including African Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Potential jurors, Mack said, should be closely questioned about their 
attitudes on interracial marriages to weed out anyone "blinded by any hang-ups 
they may have about an African American man being married to a white woman." 
</P>
<P>
 The group further emphasized the dangers of either side adopting a 
win-at-any-cost strategy, throwing justice -- for Simpson and for the victims 
-- to the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two people were brutally murdered here, that sometimes gets lost," Mack said. 
"We are concerned that the guilty parties are brought to justice. If O.J. 
Simpson did it, then he should go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who is black, has maintained his innocence in the June 12 slayings of 
his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman, both of 
whom were white. Simpson is expected to be arraigned Friday in preparation for 
his murder trial, which could begin in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a source close to the case said Simpson will offer a reward of at 
least $250,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the 
"real" killer. "It'll come within the next couple of days," the source said of 
the reward, which is expected to be announced at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, questions have been raised by some legal analysts about the 
defense's lack of apparent effort in locating the true assailant if Simpson is 
not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting Tuesday, which Garcetti sought and Mack arranged, could be 
potentially significant for the district attorney. Nineteen months ago, after 
prosecutors lost the state case against officers accused of beating Rodney G. 
King, Garcetti promised African Americans and other ethnic groups that he would 
restore credibility to the criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 That court defeat in Simi Valley led to the deadliest riots in the United 
States in this century. Many believe racial divisions remain high in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the news conference, Garcetti emphasized that the gathering Tuesday was one 
of several he has conducted in various communities throughout the county to get 
feedback on many issues, including the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, he said, he met with representatives of Jewish organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack emphasized that he does not view the Simpson case, in and of itself, as a 
racial issue. But he said that African Americans in general, and historically, 
have had deep suspicions that they are too often treated unfairly in America's 
court system. 
</P>
<P>
 The perception of bias against blacks was deepened in Los Angeles, he said, 
with the verdicts in the King beating case and the case of Soon Ja Du, a 
Korean-born grocer, who fatally shot a black teen-ager in the back of the head 
in 1991 after they fought over a container of orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Du was convicted of voluntary manslaughter, she was given a fine and 
sentenced to probation and community service, an outcome that enraged many 
people of all races, but especially blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Mack cited polls that show wide disparities in the attitudes of 
whites and blacks toward Simpson's arrest and prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 A Field Poll released Tuesday shows that 62% of the whites questioned, 
compared to 38% of the blacks, said Simpson is "very likely or somewhat likely" 
to be guilty of murder. Fifty-five percent of whites interviewed said they 
think Simpson can get a fair trial, compared to 35% of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack was asked about reports that a white detective who found a key piece of 
evidence against Simpson on the former athlete's estate had used a racial slur 
to refer to blacks. The Urban League president took the opportunity to warn 
both the defense and the prosecution about the danger of injecting racial 
issues into the case when there is no basis for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope that people would not forget the literal hell this community has 
gone through the last two or three years," he said, referring to the events 
leading up to and after the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said he had intended to maintain the privacy of the meeting with Mack 
and the others, but could not because of the almost unprecedented interest the 
media has about anything to do with the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Mack's criticism of his all-white death penalty committee, made 
up of top administrators in his office, Garcetti said the issue "is of concern 
in the perception of fairness." He made no commitment to integrate the panel -- 
which until recently included a black woman who was elevated to a federal 
judgeship two months ago -- or to take specific action on the other issues 
raised by the group. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the death penalty, Mack said he told Garcetti he is "categorically 
opposed" to it on moral grounds and because Death Rows "throughout California 
and throughout the nation" are disproportionately filled with black people. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no circumstance that would justify the death penalty because we 
don't need to add another person to that already crowded line," Mack said.

<P>
 Riots, fires, floods and earthquakes. And now, a plague of stinginess? 
</P>
<P>
 There it is in black and white, a list: 50 areas ranked in order of charitable 
giving per capita. At the top, Minneapolis, Atlanta and Columbus, Ohio. And way 
down at the bottom -- well, two from the bottom, at No. 48 -- is Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 We've got more rich people than any region except New York. But we give less 
per capita than areas with far less wealth, according to a recent survey by the 
Chronicle of Philanthropy. On average, people here gave $7 each to United Way 
in 1992, compared to $32 in Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, the first conducted by the Washington, D.C.-based biweekly, focused 
on donations in 1992 and 1993 to 10 major nonprofit organizations including the 
Boy Scouts, YMCA and Red Cross, plus charitable contributions to a broad range 
of nonprofits by local foundations and corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the survey, the Los Angeles metropolitan area included all of Los Angeles 
County except Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Are we really a metropolis of Scrooges? 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, like any best and worst list, the survey is a subjective thing, 
just one of many possible arrangements of statistics -- and open to challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, local philanthropists say the rankings do not reflect the real 
generosity here. Angelenos, they say, tend to give to small, specialized 
organizations not included in the Chronicle's study. And they say burgeoning 
immigrant communities tend to give in ways the survey does not include -- such 
as contributing to churches or to needy relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 But the same local experts say the study reflects a stark reality: It's hard 
to raise money here. 
</P>
<P>
 And they say things are getting worse: pledges to the local United Way dropped 
25% last year to $64 million. The same problem afflicts other nonprofit 
organizations across the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession is cited as a major cause. The dilemma for fund-raisers is that 
as people lose their jobs, they are transformed from donors to recipients of 
charity, swelling demand as funding shrinks. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, private philanthropy is taking on a bigger share of the 
burden of providing essential social services because of government cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But the roots of the problem, say fund-raising veterans, go far deeper than 
the economic climate. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of local nonprofit organizations offer a number of other reasons for 
the charity shortfall: 
</P>
<P>
 No sense of community. Geographic sprawl. A crazy quilt of ethnic diversity. 
Lots of rootless newcomers. Too much new money, too little old. Corporate 
downsizing and the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, all the usual suspects cited by those who say L.A. is going to 
hell. Philanthropy imitates life. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a city where people come to , a growing, dynamic city. We're young, 
we're poor, we're dreamers, we're entrepreneurs. That is a wonderful, dynamic 
stew for a city, but it's a death knell for philanthropy," said Jack Shakely, 
president of the California Community Foundation, which manages money left to 
charity by wealthy individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "People coming from the East and Midwest are from cities with a strong 
philanthropic tradition and yet when they come out here it's easy not to be 
(involved)," said John Fishel, executive vice president of the Jewish 
Federation Council of Greater Los Angeles. Although his organization raised 
about $40 million in the Los Angeles area last year, on a per capita basis, 
Jews give far less to the local Jewish fund than their counterparts in Tulsa, 
Okla., or Cleveland, according to the Chronicle survey. 
</P>
<P>
 This curse of newness may explain why California cities in general did poorly 
in the study. San Diego, facing many of the same problems as Los Angeles, 
ranked 40th. The Chronicle broke out Long Beach, which ranked 49th, from Los 
Angeles even though it is an integral part of the region's fund-raising 
efforts. Fresno came in last. (Orange and Ventura counties were not included 
because none of their cities were among the nation's 50 largest.) 
</P>
<P>
 Only San Francisco -- old, prideful and established -- did well, coming in 
12th. Experts say it has a cadre of old families and corporate leaders who help 
nurture a sense of community. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people point out that Los Angeles' large low-income population may dampen 
overall giving. But studies show that the poor almost always give a bigger part 
of their income to charity than the rich, and local experts say that is 
probably true here as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, managers of many nonprofits put much of the onus on the habits of the 
rich. In many cities, there is enormous peer pressure among social lions to 
make their mark in philanthropy. But here, there is no single, cohesive elite. 
The barons of the very separate entertainment, Downtown business, aerospace and 
real estate industries rarely hang out together, and the guest lists of society 
events on the Westside or in Pasadena still have limited overlap. Thus, 
overwhelming social pressure to give rarely comes to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s and 1960s, Los Angeles was a smaller place where one person could 
sometimes overcome these differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Chandler, wife of the late Times Publisher Norman Chandler, was famed 
for her ability to corral a variety of people to raise funds for the Music 
Center, emblem of a united Los Angeles: "Mrs. Chandler used to figure out the 
shortfall and call up her . . . friends," said Alice Coulombe, a founder of the 
Los Angeles Opera League. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, it was considered an achievement to meld Jewish and Gentile 
social circles. Today, things are far more complicated. Nobody has brought 
together the wealthy Taiwanese immigrants of San Marino, the Mexican Americans 
of Hacienda Heights and the African Americans of Baldwin Hills who will be 
philanthropic movers and shakers of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Coulombe wants to reach everyone. The handwritten appeals for funds cluttering 
the dining room table in her Arroyo Seco home are going out to a gradually 
diversifying audience -- such as a new group called Hispanics for L.A. Opera. 
But Coulombe admits she and other fund-raisers still deal mainly with a 
relatively narrow slice of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is the Dorothy Chandler of today? "That may be a type that's gone," 
Coulombe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without strong personalities cracking the whip, giving may flag. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Museum of Art was embarrassed by a report it 
commissioned last year that said its trustees gave only a fraction of what 
their peers in other cities gave to museums in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there are many giving individuals among the region's wealthy. 
Lillian Disney, widow of Walt Disney, gave $50 million toward the new Frank O. 
Gehry-designed Disney Concert Hall in Downtown. Music mogul David Geffen is 
well known for his generosity to many causes, including a $1-million gift to 
AIDS Project Los Angeles. Developer Stuart Ketchum gave millions to build the 
sleek Downtown YMCA. Many other donors, both famous and unsung, contribute 
large amounts to charities and civic institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some cities you go to, that if you don't become part of the giving 
scene, you're not accepted," said Lodwrick Cook, the Louisiana-born chairman of 
Arco. "That doesn't happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 Cook led fund raising for the renovation of the Central Library, and won 
praise for taking on the widely shunned job of chairman of Rebuild L.A. Arco 
was recently rated No. 1 among American corporations in its donations to 
minority organizations by the Washington-based National Committee for 
Responsive Philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, big corporations like Arco have less money to give than they used to. 
Like most large companies, Arco has reduced its work force as profits have 
slipped, and its charitable contributions are declining as well, from $17 
million in 1993 to a projected $12.5 million in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles area, small companies, not large ones, will drive future 
economic growth. That is bad news for fund-raisers. It is far more 
labor-intensive to raise a million dollars by pounding the pavement among 50 
little start-ups than by knocking on one oak door at a corporate headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiences of the Los Angeles Festival show vividly the nature of this 
change to a more diverse -- and less efficient -- donor base. In 1984, when the 
festival began as the Olympic Arts Festival, it was bankrolled simply: by two 
$5-million checks from the Olympic Organizing Committee and Times Mirror Co., 
which publishes the Los Angeles Times, said Laurie Dowling, the festival's 
former director of development. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the next three festivals had to work harder and harder for smaller 
donations. Last year, it took about 500 checks, plus wads of $1 bills that came 
in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival director Peter Sellars spent the year trotting from Korean American 
Rotary Club meetings to elegant Iranian cocktail parties to meet potential 
donors. It was great for building interest in the festival. But it was not an 
efficient way to raise money. The festival has had to cut its staff -- 
including Dowling -- and is refashioning itself as a more modest event. 
</P>
<P>
 If the big Downtown and defense companies are diminishing sources of funds, 
Hollywood money remains an unattainable goal for many local nonprofits. 
Although the entertainment industry attracts a lot of attention for its 
star-studded fund-raisers for national and international causes, the industry 
has a reputation among many grass-roots organizers for seeming to ignore its 
own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Owens, executive director of the African American Unity Center in 
South-Central Los Angeles says his group enjoyed an outpouring of support from 
Downtown corporations after the 1992 riots. But aside from donations by music 
mogul Berry Gordy Jr. and by Mann Theaters, the response from the entertainment 
industry has been "very little," Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Mexican American Legal Defense Fund, a national civil rights 
organization based in Los Angeles, President Antonia Hernandez says she has not 
been able to get any support from the entertainment industry outside of a few 
Latino actors. Despite the fact that Latinos will soon be a majority of the 
population here, "the interest within the entertainment industry for the Latino 
community has been nil," she said. MALDEF must go to East Coast foundations for 
most of its funding, raising less than 10% of its $5.4-million budget in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Paulsen, president of the Permanent Charities Committee of the 
Entertainment Industries, disagrees with the criticism. "Our industry is 
extraordinarily benevolent," she said. The reason that the industry's 
generosity may not be recognized, she said, is that "a lot of people with a lot 
of money do it very quietly." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the splintered nature of Los Angeles' business community, the 
fragmentation of its population and the phenomenal pace of demographic change 
also hurt charitable giving. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, experts say, the older, largely white population may be 
reluctant to give because they feel that their donations will go to an area 
that looks completely different from the one they have known, full of people 
speaking languages they cannot understand. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, many would-be donors from the newer groups are not giving 
more because they feel the mainstream charities are not adequately serving 
their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Many times they do not give simply because they are not asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody called Roger Huibonhoa, for example. He had to go out looking for 
places to give. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hong Kong-born high-tech venture capitalist and longtime Pacific Palisades 
resident, he has money, time and a deep interest in helping the city. So 
several years ago he phoned a man he had happened to see in a magazine article 
-- Stewart Kwoh, executive director of the Asian Pacific American Legal Fund. 
Huibonhoa now heads the organization's fund-raising drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to just give blindly," he said. "I don't mind giving to the 
Music Center, but I don't know them, and they don't know me. But (at the legal 
center) I can know the founder personally." 
</P>
<P>
 Huibonhoa does not believe that people should retreat into helping only their 
own ethnic groups, and his family gives to causes from Nebraska to Africa. But 
he believes that philanthropic habits have to be nurtured close to home -- 
especially among immigrants unfamiliar with the American style of giving. 
</P>
<P>
 Some nonprofit managers say it is easier to foster the habit of philanthropy 
with small, local organizations than with big, mainstream organizations unable 
to change fast enough to accommodate new groups. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, many of the scores of organizations that have sprung up in the 
last two decades to serve people who speak Spanish, Chinese or Armenian cannot 
get on the membership rolls of the United Way. Why, say people from these 
communities, should we give to an umbrella organization that appears to leave 
us out in the rain? 
</P>
<P>
 "United Way did not have a good reputation in ethnic communities," said 
Herbert Carter, president of the United Way of Greater Los Angeles. "They had 
little decision-making power in United Way." 
</P>
<P>
 Although United Way statistics show that the "mainstream" nonprofits it funds 
serve a largely minority population, the perception among many people was that 
those nonprofits were run by people outside their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who is African-American, says he is working hard to diversify United 
Way's management and distribution of funds. Even critics praise him for his 
efforts, which include setting up ethnic advisory boards. 
</P>
<P>
 But few believe that he has succeeded in turning around a huge organization 
burdened with entrenched interests, from the corporate heads who lead its 
workplace fund-raising drives to the traditional recipients of its largess who 
are reluctant to share their fast-shrinking pie with new agencies. The number 
of member agencies funded by United Way has shrunk 10% in five years, at a time 
when community activists say the roster should be broadening. 
</P>
<P>
 Asian American organizations received 0.6% of total United Way donations in 
the county, while the Asian population is 10% of the county, according to a 
1990 study by a consortium of nonprofit groups. When potential donors in the 
Asian American community see trends like this, they are less willing to give, 
said Deborah Ching, executive director of the Chinatown Service Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to show people you're doing something they care about before you ask 
them for money," said Ching, whose organization assists poor immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Because many service agencies feel they cannot get the support they need from 
United Way and major foundations, they are turning to specialized funds. In 
addition to the 25-year-old Black United Fund, the Women's Fund, United Latino 
Fund, Asian Pacific Community Fund and Earth Share (an environmental fund) have 
sprung up. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to redistribute existing giving but increase giving," said Mary 
Rapoport, development director of the Los Angeles Women's Foundation, which 
distributed about $300,000 to 30 ethnically diverse agencies last year. "We do 
know that some women, when they see a women's foundation, are going to give 
when they didn't give before." 
</P>
<P>
 Providing employees with more choices about where they give significantly 
increases overall giving through payroll deductions, without cannibalizing 
United Way campaigns, studies show. Retail giant Carter Hawley Hale saw its 
employee donations more than double last year when it allowed an employee 
committee to expand the slate of charities beyond United Way. 
</P>
<P>
 People -- including people in Los Angeles -- are very generous to causes they 
feel connected to, fund-raisers say. But community activists are still 
struggling to arouse that sense of connection. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you make people part of and responsible for a community?" asks Carter 
of the United Way. "How do you get people to understand that the things they 
wish for themselves can't be secured if other people don't have a basic quality 
of life?" Where the Region Ranks 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to people in the 49 other largest metropolitan areas in the United 
States, people here give relatively little per capita to major charities. Here

 Many organizations are devising new strategies and enlisting old traditions to 
increase community involvement. They include: 
</P>
<P>
 * L.A. Works, founded by actor Richard Dreyfuss, provides easy, "just show up" 
volunteer activities for individuals and groups. Examples include matching 
ready hands with homeless shelters that need painting or community garden plots 
that need clearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hispanics for L.A. Opera has been established by Latino opera fans to 
encourage attendance and financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 * The United Latino Fund, the Asian Pacific Community Fund, the Los Angeles 
Women's Foundation, and Earth Share have recently joined forces to mount 
payroll deduction campaigns with public employers. They are following the lead 
of the Brotherhood Crusade Black United Fund. The groups are trying to gain 
access to employees of private corporations as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * The United Way allows donors to designate individual charities instead of 
just the umbrella fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many Jewish preschools and Mommy and Me toddler classes pass a traditional 
tzedakah box daily or weekly for children to put coins in to encourage the 
habit of charity early in life. Tzedakah means justice, and the donations go to 
food banks, homeless shelters, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 * Private foundations are increasingly requiring community organizations to 
form collaborative projects when they apply for funds to reduce redundancies 
and build coalitions. The result: an increase in multiethnic projects.

SCIENTISTS AT SOUTH POLE GET BEST VIEW OF JUPITER'S SHOW; ASTRONOMY: ENDLESS 
NIGHT AND TEMPERATURES OF 80 BELOW ZERO ARE IDEAL FOR TELESCOPES, IF NOT FOR 
HUMANS. 
</P>

<P>
 In a frozen wilderness where explorers once died for the sake of a penguin's 
egg and chunks of petrified wood, Hien Nguyen is collecting spectacular images 
of a fire in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 At the South Pole -- atop an ice pack two miles thick, where it is drier than 
the Sahara and colder than parts of Mars -- astronomers like Nguyen this week 
are getting what may be the clearest view on Earth as Jupiter and a comet clash 
in the heavens overhead. While their colleagues at other major observatories 
around the world contend with rain, fog, pollution and viewing opportunities 
constrained by daylight, Nguyen and his colleagues at the South Pole Station 
can be assured of pristine darkness throughout the celestial encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 At this time of year, the sun at the South Pole never rises and Jupiter never 
sets, because the station is centered on the axis of Earth's rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 As the death rattles of comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on Jupiter ignited blazing 
fireballs and dark storms larger than Earth itself, almost the entire staff of 
the station huddled together in the cold by Nguyen's small infrared telescope 
to marvel at the sight before them. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time, the whole station felt like we were together," Nguyen 
reported Tuesday via a satellite link. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, who fled from Vietnam to Southern California in 1981, is among 26 
scientists spending the six months of continuous winter darkness under the blue 
geodesic dome of the National Science Foundation's South Pole Station. Now a 
research associate at the University of Chicago, he is the station science 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The spreading bruise of debris and superheated gases left in Jupiter's 
southern hemisphere by Monday's explosion of a two-mile-wide comet fragment now 
rivals the 300-year-old "Great Red Spot" as the most prominent feature on the 
planet's immense surface, astronomers said. The red spot measures 20,000 by 
8,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Two more comet fragments hit Jupiter on Tuesday. The white-hot glow from one 
impact -- that of Fragment K -- was at least three times the size of Earth. 
Starting today, three more large fragments were to slam into the planet's upper 
atmosphere, hitting the same spot over a period of 20 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll have three -- boom, boom, boom," said planetary scientist Heidi B. 
Hammel, who is leading the scientists analyzing the images from the Hubble 
Space Telescope. "You are going to have one heck of a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday, the South Pole Infrared Explorer Telescope (SPIREX) that Nguyen is 
operating had detected five of the nine comet fragments that had struck 
Jupiter, he said in an interview conducted via electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "For this particular event, our polar site is unique since the sky is 
continuously dark during the impact period," he said. "Had this occurred during 
the summertime, our detector would be immediately saturated by the shining sky 
background and probably would not be able to detect Jupiter itself, let alone 
the explosions." 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions are so extreme -- the temperature Monday was minus 80 degrees 
Fahrenheit, with 25 m.p.h. winds drifting snow over the telescope -- that the 
atmospheric impurities and water vapor that blur most astronomical images froze 
out of the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The frigid atmosphere over the South Pole contains less than one-tenth the 
water vapor found over the Mauna Kea observatories in Hawaii, one of the best 
telescope sites in use. 
</P>
<P>
 Infrared light, an invisible form of energy radiated by any hot object, is 
more easily detected in the bitter chill. Because the telescope also is more 
sensitive when it is refrigerated, the small 24-inch SPIREX instrument is 
yielding some of the most dramatic and important images of the impacts on 
Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The atmosphere at the pole is many times more stable and transparent than for 
the best mid-latitude infrared observatories," said John P. Lynch, the National 
Science Foundation's director of polar aeronomy and astrophysics. "Because of 
the cold, dry atmosphere and the cold telescope itself, a two-foot telescope at 
the South Pole might be comparable to a 30-foot telescope -- like the Keck at 
Mauna Kea -- at those infrared wavelengths." 
</P>
<P>
 "That is an awfully extreme thing to say, but that is what the numbers show," 
Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The science foundation-funded Center for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica 
set up the infrared telescope earlier this year as part of a five-year, 
$20-million effort to transform the pole into a center for astronomy and 
astrophysics. A larger telescope is scheduled for construction there later this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Hereld, the principal investigator for the SPIREX project at the 
University of Chicago, spent two months at the pole earlier this year 
assembling the telescope facility from 14,000 pounds of parts, computer 
equipment and infrared sensors. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago this week, Hereld's only contact with Nguyen during the comet 
encounter is an intermittent computer link that depends on two aging 
satellites. The satellites have strayed far enough from their original orbits 
to be briefly visible at the pole every day, when they can be used as relay 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen never expected to end up at the South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
 He fled Vietnam by boat when he was 17, leaving behind his mother and much of 
his family. He settled in Torrance long enough to learn English at El Camino 
College, then received a physics degree from UC Berkeley and went on to 
Princeton University for his graduate work. He moved to the University of 
Chicago in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he hopes to set up a planetarium and a major observatory in his 
native country. University officials are encouraging the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went from being a refugee afloat on a boat on the China Sea to being a 
Princeton graduate, a University of Chicago post-doctoral fellow, and now 
science leader at the South Pole," Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a real success story."

PRESIDENT SIGNALS HE IS FLEXIBLE ON HEALTH COVERAGE; REFORM: CLINTON TELLS 
GOVERNORS HE WOULD BE SATISFIED IF A BILL IS PASSED THAT MOVES IN DIRECTION OF 
INSURANCE FOR ALL. HIS CONGRESSIONAL ALLIES ARE CAUGHT BY SURPRISE.

<P>
 Striking a new, conciliatory tone on health care that caught his congressional 
allies by surprise, President Clinton appeared Tuesday to water down his demand 
for guaranteed health coverage for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at the annual conference of the nation's governors here, Clinton said 
he recognizes that any piece of legislation would fall short of truly covering 
everyone and that he would be satisfied if Congress can pass a bill that moves 
in the direction of universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we're not going to get right at 100% (coverage) but we know that 
you've got to get somewhere in the ballpark of 95% or upwards," he said. The 
comment was in response to a question from a Republican governor who asked 
whether he would settle for something less than universal, employer-financed 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also said he would accept a plan that does not require companies to 
cover all workers, the so-called employer mandate. "I would not rule out a 
health bill that didn't have an employer mandate in it," the President said, 
adding the qualifying phrase, "if we knew that we were moving toward full 
coverage and we had some evidence that it would work." 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, members of Congress have been arguing about whether Clinton's 
demand for health care for all citizens had to mean, literally, care for 
everyone -- a goal that almost certainly cannot be achieved without a law 
requiring companies to provide insurance for all workers -- or whether the 
White House would accept something less, such as insurance for 95% of 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 And for weeks, White House officials strenuously have refused to get into that 
argument, fearing that to clarify their stance would evaporate the convenient 
ambiguity that may be needed to reach compromise on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton changed that Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The President had said similar things about the mandate in the past, but the 
timing of his remarks, combined with the language suggesting that 95% would be 
enough, set off a furor of spin and counterspin. The war of words left unclear 
by day's end whether Clinton had deliberately set out to signal new flexibility 
in his position or whether he had merely succumbed to his periodic, and 
politically dangerous, habit of thinking out loud. 
</P>
<P>
 Whichever the case, the subject consumed official Washington for much of the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative and moderate Democrats seized on the President's words as a 
welcome sign of willingness to compromise. Liberal Democrats, members of the 
congressional leadership and some of Clinton's own aides insisted that his 
words meant less than they appeared to mean. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means we can get a bill. . . . This is a big day," proclaimed Finance 
Committee Chairman Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), whose panel dealt the 
Clinton plan its most serious setback to date by passing a bill that does not 
include an employer mandate and does not reach universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), the leading foe of the Clinton 
health plan, was so taken with the President's comments that he read a 
transcript of them before a cluster of microphones and a bank of television 
cameras. Dole said that Clinton appeared to be "inching in our direction." 
</P>
<P>
 "Good for him!" exclaimed Sen. J. James Exon (D-Neb.), a leading conservative 
Democrat. "Until the President said something like that, I think we were dead 
in the water." 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton's words stunned his allies in Congress, where House and Senate 
leaders are at an extraordinarily delicate moment in their efforts to put 
together legislation that retains the controversial employer mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Clinton plan's supporters insisted publicly that his comments did 
not mark a change of position but off the record several indicated that they 
were furious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess there's going to be some clarification," said Senate Labor and Human 
Resources Committee Chairman Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), trying to put the 
best face on the President's comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton did attempt to clarify what he meant later in the day but his remarks 
to reporters provided little additional guidance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you have to have a universal coverage goal because if you don't have 
the idea of trying to essentially have functionally full coverage -- whatever 
that is, it's a very high percentage -- then the rest of these reforms will not 
work," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton adviser George Stephanopoulos insisted that the congressional reaction 
was a "misreading" of what Clinton had said. "I think he said less than they 
think," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Stephanopoulos added, Clinton had "set a new standard" for what would be 
acceptable in a health reform plan, noting that Clinton repeatedly had said in 
his remarks to the governors that he wanted a bill that "will work." 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these plans that purportedly get to 95% don't actually work," 
Stephanopoulos added. "They're underfinanced, they don't actually do what they 
claim." 
</P>
<P>
 But, as White House officials know, a bill that "will work" and a bill that 
"will cover everyone" are not necessarily the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday evening, after watching Clinton's remarks echo across the nightly 
network news programs, White House officials were sufficiently worried to have 
Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta issue a statement trying to clarify what Clinton 
had said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President's bottom line is what it's always been -- guaranteed health 
coverage for every American. And that's what he said to the governors today," 
Panetta said. "Are we willing to discuss ways to guarantee universal coverage? 
Absolutely. Are we changing the goal? Absolutely not." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason Clinton's remarks hit such a nerve is their delivery at a time when 
the congressional Democratic leadership has been delicately trying to piece 
together compromise bills that can pass. White House strategists have been 
hoping to pass a bill in the House that contains an employer mandate, giving 
themselves leverage for an eventual compromise with whatever bill emerges from 
the more conservative Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 But many House members have strongly resisted the idea of voting for such a 
controversial measure precisely because they think that the White House would 
only abandon the idea later, forcing them to cast a politically dangerous vote 
for naught. Clinton's words only heightened those fears. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House had been billing the speech to the governors as a major health 
address and those who back the Clinton plan had been hoping for a new show of 
resolve on the most contentious provisions of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Clinton repeatedly struck a conciliatory note. "All I ask in the 
closing weeks of this debate is that we take the political air out of the 
balloon and ask ourselves what will work for ordinary Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 That statement drew resounding applause from the state chief executives. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's remarks contrasted with the sometimes strident rhetoric of his 
recent speeches. His remarks also conflicted somewhat with those made earlier 
in the day by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, who fielded questions during 
ABC's "Good Morning America" program. She hewed closely to the official White 
House position, at least the one taken up to the time of the President's 
speech, about the need for universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Mrs. Clinton, however, offered some degree of wiggle room, talking of the 
need for universal coverage "at least being phased-in at some point." 
</P>
<P>
 If that is not done, she said, "you will make the problem worse. I don't want 
to be back here in two years explaining to people why their premiums have gone 
up under so-called reform." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the President here among the governors, some of whom he had served with 
for years, Clinton spoke softly and carried not a big stick but an olive 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
 The unique fraternal chemistry that Clinton feels with governors can sometimes 
produce the unexpected. According to the accounts of several people present at 
a private meeting among Clinton and some governors early this year, the 
President said that he opposed the price controls in his own plan and indicated 
for the first time that he was willing to jettison his proposal to require most 
Americans to join government-organized purchasing cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Those earlier reported comments, which Clinton subsequently denied making, had 
also exasperated his supporters. "I was a governor for eight years," Sen. John 
D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.) said at the time. "I enjoyed it. I like 
governors. I like to be around governors. But I'm certainly more interested in 
health care than I am in the collegial feeling of being with governors." 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks Tuesday, Clinton went out of his way to praise Dole, who 
preceded him at the podium, for his commitment to produce some form of health 
legislation. Dole was for the most part characteristically caustic in 
discussing Clinton's own efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole argued for a much more gradual and limited approach to health care than 
Clinton has advocated, one that would postpone universal coverage and other key 
Clinton objectives, such as employer mandates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a reality check," Dole said. He cited declining support for the 
President's program in recent polls as evidence that Clinton was trying to push 
Americans further and faster on the issue that they want to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "The health care system may not be perfect but it is the best in the world," 
he said. "It needs repair but I'm not certain that it needs a complete and 
total overhaul and certainly not a complete and total takeover by the federal 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 Challenging the concept of universality, central to Clinton's approach, Dole 
asked: "How do you get there? How much does it cost? Is it 91%, 92%, 95%? Is it 
Ivory soap? What is it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pointing out that even the Social Security system, the broadest of all federal 
entitlement programs, did not cover all Americans when it was first introduced, 
Dole said: "I have no trouble with everybody being covered in America. The 
issue is how do we do it and how much does it cost. And I suggest that between 
getting it done right and getting it done fast, many of us would prefer getting 
it done right." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole complained of partisan rhetoric by the Administration and called for a 
moderate and bipartisan approach that unwittingly anticipated the President's 
subsequent address. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas senator said that he believes "there is enough good will left" to 
enact a program within the next 30 to 40 days. But, he said, unless Congress 
acts within that time, election year pressure would prevent enactment of any 
health reform measure until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Congress enacts, Dole predicted, it will not include an employer 
mandate or a so-called trigger mechanism, which would impose a mandate in the 
future if nearly all Americans were not covered by health insurance by some 
fixed date. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to criticism by governors of his own health care proposal because it 
proposes putting a limit on federal expenditures for Medicaid, thus adding to 
the financial burden on the states, Dole said that his staff is working on an 
alternative approach.

RWANDA REBELS URGE REFUGEES TO HALT FLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Victorious Tutsi-led rebels installed a "national unity" government Tuesday 
and urged a halt to the desperate flight of millions of terrorized Rwandan 
refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half of this Central African nation's population has either fled or is 
on the move toward the border with Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Maj. Gen. Paul Kagame, the rebel leader who became Rwanda's vice president and 
defense minister Tuesday, has sought to reassure the majority Hutus that they 
have no reason to flee in the wake of carnage that has left hundreds of 
thousands of people dead, mostly minority Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the leaders of the ousted hard-line Hutu government have mounted what 
appears to be an organized campaign, mostly through radio broadcasts, 
predicting Tutsi retribution, to persuade their supporters to follow them into 
Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels, who blazed from exile to victory in the 14-week civil war, routed 
the Hutu government. Fearing that the rebels will retaliate, 1.7 million Hutus 
have poured across the border into Zaire in the past week, and refugee 
officials say 1.5 million more are on their way in an exodus of epic 
proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief officials predict widespread famine unless massive aid arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 Little evidence has emerged of reprisals by Tutsi rebels against Hutu 
civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is a day of joy and sorrow," Kagame said as he took the oath of office 
in the capital, Kigali. Two moderate ethnic Hutus, Faustin Twagirimungu and 
Pasteur Bizimungu, were sworn in as prime minister and president. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (rebel) army has removed a system of oppression and dictatorship, but 
only at the cost of many lives," Kagame said. 
</P>
<P>
 The makeup of the new government generally follows a power-sharing plan worked 
out in a peace agreement signed in August to end a three-year civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was never implemented and the war restarted after President 
Juvenal Habyarimana, a Hutu, was killed in a suspicious plane crash April 6. 
His allies began a systematic slaughter of Tutsis and moderate Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
 The two new deputy prime ministers are officials of the rebel Rwandan 
Patriotic Front. Twenty other Cabinet members also were sworn in, five of them 
rebel leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 people watched the inauguration from the lawn of the Parliament 
building, shattered by shells in fighting for the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the far southwestern corner of the tiny Central African country, the 
refugee flight continued. If all those moving through the southwest cross into 
Zaire, it would bring the number of Rwandans living in refugee camps in 
neighboring countries to about 3.5 million. Rwanda's prewar population was 
about 8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel official Alexis Kanyarengwe asked the refugees to come home. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is peace," he said. "No Rwandan should ever be a refugee again. There 
has been a lot of suffering in this country, and now the RPF has decided to 
work democratically to end Rwanda's pain." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Sunday, an estimated 400,000 refugees have crossed into Kamannyola, 
Zaire, from the southwest border. About 300,000 more crossed the border farther 
north. Nearly 1 million Hutu civilians and soldiers fled into the Zairian 
border town of Goma from northwest Rwanda last week. 
</P>
<P>
 And 1.5 million more Hutus were streaming toward the southwestern Rwandan 
border town of Cyangugu and believed to be headed for Bukavu, Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 The first exodus sent 350,000 people across the eastern border into Tanzania 
in late April. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really an exodus of a nation. The whole country is coming out of its 
borders. We can't cope," Panos Moumtzis, a spokesman for the U.N. high 
commissioner for refugees, told reporters in Goma. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . What we really need right now is an enormous reaction, an enormous 
response" from international donors, Moumtzis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest needs are food and water. "Clearly, if we don't have our act 
together in the next two or three days, we will witness an incredibly 
disastrous situation of famine on an unprecedented scale," said Daan Everets of 
the World Food Program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon is stepping up aid flights to the refugees and is considering 
sending civil affairs officials to help with relief efforts, a Pentagon 
spokeswoman said Tuesday in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force transport planes and privately contracted aircraft will fly 78 
missions, carrying medical supplies and food into Goma.

EDWARDS HAS RIGHT STUFF FOR BUILDING BOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the budget ax falls on military posts across the nation, this vast 
aerospace stronghold -- once a stomping ground for "Right Stuff" test pilots, 
now a landing ground for space shuttles -- remains a prosperous contradiction. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era of defense downsizing, its $457-million budget is substantially 
fatter this year than last. Its 15,000 employees bustle confidently among 
hangars, offices and classrooms. Dozens of sleek military jets take off and 
land each day, as they have for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years after one of its most famous alumni -- former NASA test 
pilot Neil Armstrong -- became the first human to set foot on the moon, Edwards 
has not only dodged the budget bullet, it is undergoing a construction boom. 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers believe the base's assets -- a legendary aircraft testing 
center, excellent flying weather and long, forgiving runways in the Mojave 
Desert -- have immunized it against ongoing budget cuts that have ravaged much 
of California's once thriving military-industrial establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some think that President Clinton, whose reelection strategy is 
tied to winning California in 1996, may go out of his way to spare Edwards and 
other California posts in the next round of base-closure decisions next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But others worry that continued pressure to reduce defense spending -- and a 
politically charged rivalry with the Navy's Patuxent River flight test center 
in Maryland -- may eventually siphon dollars away from Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards officials say the base actually will benefit from the defense 
build-down, as other installations are closed or reduced and their 
aircraft-testing functions are shifted to Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Edwards will inherit some other flight-test activities as other bases back 
east close," said Robert D. Johnstone, the base's planning chief. "I think 
you'll see testing gravitate toward the southwestern United States . . . and 
Edwards will be at the hub of those test ranges." 
</P>
<P>
 One such "inheritance" took place this spring when a 950-person air wing was 
transferred to Edwards from Ohio's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base at a cost of 
$42 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4950th Test Wing and its 26 aircraft were moved despite opposition from 
Ohio congressional members including U.S. Sen. John Glenn, himself a former 
astronaut. The wing's arrival at Edwards marked the biggest single addition to 
the base in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards was able to absorb the Ohio wing in part because it was constructing 
an $11.9-million office building to house its own 412th Test Wing staff. The 
two wings share the 90,000-square-foot building, finished a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the base expects to receive about $50 million to computerize a huge 
high-tech chamber where aircraft electronic warfare systems can be tested 
without outside electrical interference or fear of satellite snooping. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Bakersfield), who represents the Edwards area, said that 
appropriation is the result of a behind-the-scenes struggle between him and 
Rep. Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), whose district includes the Patuxent River base. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said Hoyer wanted federal money to enlarge a similar but smaller 
chamber at Patuxent River that was already computerized. Thomas said he argued 
that the money should be spent to computerize the Edwards chamber, already the 
world's largest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won that one," Thomas said. "Those kind of battles are going on very 
quietly." 
</P>
<P>
 A Hoyer spokesman said he was unaware of any tiff between Hoyer and Thomas, 
and that Hoyer has secured $30 million for the Patuxent River chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Connell, an ex-Navy test pilot who heads a Ridgecrest-based group that 
wants the Pentagon to beef up Edwards and other Southern California bases, said 
he is aware of discussions within the military to transfer to Edwards some 
activities performed at Patuxent River and at Florida's Eglin Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell said he is optimistic about Edwards' future in part because 
California's delegation in Congress -- both Republicans and Democrats -- seems 
to be pulling together more to protect local bases from further cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In an illustration of how hardball politics can affect military installations, 
Connell said California lawmakers recently discovered that a number of aides to 
congressional representatives from Maryland and Florida were scheduled last 
week to tour Edwards and the China Lake naval air weapons station, about 60 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the inspection, he said, was to sniff out any waste or 
duplication at the California bases that could be used as ammunition against 
any proposals to dismantle the East Coast bases. 
</P>
<P>
 When Southern California congressional members learned of the trip, they 
demanded to be part of it -- prompting the East Coast staffers to cancel, he 
said. His account was confirmed by an aide to Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon 
(R-Santa Clarita), who represents part of Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 But Connell's view of the possible bounty awaiting Edwards is not universally 
held. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Wilcox, a Los Angeles-based consultant who helps local communities adjust 
economically to base shutdowns, said the Pentagon is unlikely to want to break 
up Patuxent River -- the Navy's own flight test center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pax River is very unique and the Navy is very jealous of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoyer's spokesman, Jesse Jacobs, said the Maryland congressman is unlikely to 
allow Patuxent River to be dismantled without a fight. "Steny is not prepared 
to let any part of Pax River go," Jacobs said. "He has not worked harder on any 
issue than base closure." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox said that despite a third round of base cutbacks scheduled next year, 
he believes Edwards and other California bases are unlikely to suffer. With 
Clinton pegging his reelection hopes on winning in California, he will not be 
eager to inflict more economic setbacks on the state, said Wilcox. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal outlays for Edwards' famed Flight Test Center -- which represents most 
of the base budget -- have grown steadily since 1992, despite deep cuts at 
other military bases. From a fiscal 1992 appropriation of $363 million, the 
budget jumped to $407 million in 1993 and $457 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides ideal flying conditions and enormous dry-lake runways, Edwards boasts 
a reputation as the Air Force's premier aircraft test facility. Its well-known 
test pilot school has supplied more skilled fliers for the U.S. astronaut corps 
-- more than 70 out of 214 -- than any other single source. 
</P>
<P>
 All three members of the Apollo 11 moon-landing crew were associated with 
Edwards. Armstrong was a NASA test pilot there in the late 1950s and early 
1960s. Michael Collins graduated from the test pilot school in 1960. And Buzz 
Aldrin became commandant of the school in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards' centerpiece is the Flight Test Center, where cheat-the-devil test 
pilots immortalized in Tom Wolfe's "The Right Stuff" pushed experimental jets 
and rocket planes to their limits -- and sometimes beyond -- in the 1940s, '50s 
and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 It is where Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier. Where Armstrong restarted 
the engines on a flamed-out X-15 just before it hit the ground. Where a space 
shuttle first landed in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Zooming to the edge of space in high-performance aircraft, test pilots at 
Edwards laid many of the scientific foundations for the space program. The 
base's Rogers Dry Lake -- a 44-square-mile swath of hard-packed desert that 
forms an immense natural runway -- is a national historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Fliers at Edwards proved that humans could withstand the strains of hypersonic 
acceleration and perform under weightless conditions. They helped develop 
celestial navigation equipment used in the Apollo program. 
</P>
<P>
 "To work at Edwards in those times was extremely exciting," said state 
Assemblyman William J. (Pete) Knight (R-Palmdale), a former Edwards pilot who 
holds the world speed record for fixed-wing aircraft -- 4,520 m.p.h. in an 
X-15. 
</P>
<P>
 But flying experimental planes is dangerous work. Since the late 1940s, about 
55 military and civilian pilots have been killed at Edwards. Whenever a 
colleague plowed into the Earth at high speed, pilots sardonically said he had 
"drilled a hole" or "augured in." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the mid-1950s, pilots often retreated after a day at the base to the 
Happy Bottom Riding Club, a raucous bar run by Florence (Pancho) Barnes, a 
former Hollywood stunt pilot, gunrunner and rum smuggler known for her foul 
mouth and fondness for good times. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pancho's bar, young pilots boozed, brawled and argued endlessly about who 
was the fastest, toughest, hottest. There were stag parties, fistfights and 
drunken forays into the desert to hunt bear and deer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our clubhouse and playroom, and if all the hours were ever totaled, I 
reckon I spent more time at her place than I did in a cockpit over those 
years," wrote Yeager in a 1985 autobiography. "And I was flying about five 
different airplanes daily." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the base is best known as a landing site for the space shuttle, whose 
occasional arrivals attract tens of thousands of spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 Although testing at Edwards once involved exotic jet and rocket-propelled 
aircraft, it revolves today mostly around existing planes that have been 
modified. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnstone, the base's planning chief, said he expects Edwards to lose about 
700 employees by next summer as testing on the Air Force's new C-17 cargo plane 
winds down. However, he said he hopes employment levels will rise again in 1997 
or 1998, when the F-22 fighter is expected to undergo shakedown flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, base officials continue to battle massive toxic-waste problems, 
cracking runways and home builders' encroachment. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards already has spent $68 million cleaning up leaked fuel and toxic 
solvents, and the bill could soar as high as $400 million, said Bob Wood, the 
base's environmental restoration manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers last week dug up the 200th of more than 500 underground storage tanks, 
many of which were buried years ago and have leaked. Base spokesman Dennis 
Shoffner said toxics seeped into a shallow water table beneath Edwards, but 
none of its drinking water wells -- which draw from 400 feet deep or deeper -- 
have been contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said the cleanup may be complicated by the desert tortoise, a federally 
protected species which roams the area. The cleanup may be suspended in areas 
where it would disturb tortoise habitat, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The base also faces cracks in its lake bed runways that keep growing. The 
worst one, which slices across a runway used only rarely for landings, is now a 
half-mile long and 5 feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
 The cracks are the result of a sinking of the lake bed caused by pumping from 
an underground aquifer the base shares with Lancaster and Palmdale. In an 
effort to minimize the settling, the base recently tapped into the California 
Water Project for drinking water and redesigned its sewage plant to recycle 
water, Shoffner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another nettlesome problem is continuing home construction under the base's 
flight corridors. Base officials worry that if too many people move in, noise 
complaints could force the base to change flying routes or even shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Antelope Valley's explosive rate of population growth has slowed 
during the recession, the base still faces development pressures from Lancaster 
and the Rosamond area in Kern County. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards officials have worked closely with local planners to limit growth on 
the base's flanks. Officials in Lancaster and Los Angeles, Kern and San 
Bernardino counties recently drafted rules to limit builders to one home-per-2 
1/2 acres in a 2-mile-wide buffer zone around the base, Johnstone said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to after the fact make changes for them because they chose to 
live there," said Rep. Thomas. "Frankly, the base is more important than any 
individual homeowner . . . or group of homeowners." 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnstone said population growth is a problem that will not disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing that closes a base is encroachment," he said.

THE HUBER MURDER CASE; ARREST CAME AFTER TIP BASED ON INTUITION; INVESTIGATION: 
A WOMAN FELT SOMETHING ABOUT THE TRUCK IN FAMALARO'S DRIVEWAY SEEMED STRANGE. A 
CALL TO A DETECTIVE PROVED HER RIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It wasn't anything she could quite put her finger on, but Elaine Canalia just 
felt there was something about the truck parked in John Joseph Famalaro's 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, whom she had known for two months, already had a van and a pickup 
truck, she said in an interview Tuesday, so why would he need another large 
vehicle? He obviously wasn't driving the yellow Ryder rental truck, not with 
all the boxes of paint cans stacked around it. 
</P>
<P>
 Canalia, who had visited Famalaro's home July 9 to buy some painting supplies, 
on a whim scribbled down the license number on a scrap of paper and, several 
days later, passed it on to a detective friend in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 That moment of intuition would end a 3-year-old mystery and lead to the 
discovery of Denise A. Huber's preserved body hidden in a deep freezer inside 
the rental truck. The Newport Beach woman had been missing since June 3, 1991, 
when she failed to return from a rock concert in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The riddle of Huber's disappearance was almost solved a month before, however. 
Ryder officials missed their own opportunity to unravel the case in June when 
they failed to follow up on a lead supplied by a San Clemente woman, who had 
traced Famalaro to his Dewey address. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Copeland, who makes her living finding missing heirs, had gone to the 
San Clemente Ryder franchise with her daughter, who was returning a rental. She 
struck up a conversation with the clerk about her occupation. The clerk told 
her he had someone he wanted to find, then asked her if she could track 
Famalaro, who had failed to return a truck rented in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Using computer databases common to her trade, she located Famalaro. 
</P>
<P>
 "His name was very unusual, so it wasn't hard to find," Copeland said. 
</P>
<P>
 She gave the information to the San Clemente franchise, who passed it on to 
Ryder officials at the moving company headquarters in Miami. For whatever 
reason, they didn't follow up, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryder officials in neither San Clemente nor Miami would comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be several more weeks before Canalia would see the truck and become 
curious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assumed when I wrote the license number down that the truck was stolen," 
said Canalia, 44, a Phoenix paint manufacturer and distributor. "Never in my 
wildest dreams did I think that poor girl would be found in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Canalia and her business partner, Jack Court, had done business with Famalaro 
since May, always meeting him at the Prescott Valley Swap Meet. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 9, Canalia said, Famalaro asked her and Court to come to his house to 
look at some colorant he wanted to sell. Once there, the trio loaded several 
boxes of it into Canalia's car. 
</P>
<P>
 Canalia had the impression that Famalaro was in a hurry that night -- stacking 
and loading the boxes so quickly, she said. He wouldn't even allow Court's 
10-year-old grandson to use the bathroom, saying there was no running water in 
the house. But they all had a long day at the swap meet, and Canalia assumed 
Famalaro was tired. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sight of the moving truck kept nagging at her. "It just seemed so out 
of place," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 12, when a detective friend came to her warehouse to buy some paint, 
Canalia gave him the license number, suggesting it was worth checking. Making a 
call from her office, he learned the truck had been stolen in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the detective returned to Canalia's warehouse and while there 
received a phone call from his colleagues, who had found the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "From where I was, I heard him say, 'homicide . . . body . . . freezer,' " 
recalled Canalia. "I was horrified. It makes me sick to think I was standing 
right next to this truck that (held) this body." 
</P>
<P>
 Canalia called Huber's parents early this week to express her sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 They told Canalia it was God's will that she helped find their lost child, 
said Ione Huber, Denise's mother. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ione Huber, Canalia told the grieving couple that she had this 
"really weird" feeling while she was at the house and, while there was "nothing 
(overtly) suspicious about the truck," there was "this real strong pull" coming 
from it. 
</P>
<P>
 She told us she "didn't know the reason," Huber said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huber knew where the pull came from. "We've been praying really hard," she 
said.

THE HUBER MURDER CASE; FAMALARO'S ARREST LEAVES SEDONA RESIDENTS TALKING; 
REACTION: TOWN STUNNED BY REVELATIONS, WHILE THOUGHTS OF POLICE TURN TO LOCAL 
UNSOLVED MURDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When residents learned that area handyman John Joseph Famalaro was accused of 
murdering a woman whose frozen body was found in his freezer, the thoughts of 
the town turned to Marjorie (Midge) Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope, 50, of Sedona left her job at a local souvenir shop on Halloween, 1992, 
and was never seen alive again. 
</P>
<P>
 Her car was found abandoned along a busy road, an eerie similarity to Denise 
A. Huber's disappearance the previous year. Hope's keys were still inside, 
along with her purse. A part of her skull -- with a bullet hole -- was later 
found in the high dessert a few miles away, along with her jawbone. 
</P>
<P>
 Sedona Police Chief Bob Irish said Tuesday that his department is looking at 
Famalaro as a possible suspect in the Hope murder partly because of the 
similarities to Huber, who vanished from an Orange County freeway three years 
ago. Her bludgeoned body was discovered last week in a freezer in a truck 
parked in Famalaro's driveway in Dewey, about an hour's drive from here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, (Huber's killing) is a gruesome murder and we have reason to believe 
that Midge met a gruesome end," Irish said. "It might turn out there is no 
connection whatsoever but we know he was in the neighborhood when she was 
reported missing, so we are checking it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Many in this artists' community, which is nestled beneath scenic red rocks, 
said they were shocked by the arrest of Famalaro, who had worked as a house 
painter, carpet cleaner, contract handyman and, most recently, real estate 
salesman in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you I considered him a friend. I used to hug him, but when I heard, 
the first thing I thought of was (Hope)," said a local dry cleaner who spoke on 
the condition that her name not be used. Famalaro had run his home improvement 
and carpet cleaning business in the area for about two years, operating the 
business out of a rented post office box. In April, he began working for a 
Sedona real estate company. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro had become active in the local Chamber of Commerce and was a charter 
member of the Sedona Referrals Club, a business networking group. He dropped 
out of both organizations early this year, citing the need to spend more time 
with his aging parents who live next door to him at the Prescott Country Club 
in Dewey. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a kind, mild-mannered man," said real estate agent Gary Strohm, 
president of the networking group. "I think I am a good judge of character, but 
I have been blindsided by all of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Strohm said Famalaro never talked about women or indicated he had any kind of 
social life. He only talked about business or family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt real sorry for him because he was under a lot of stress," Strohm 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dry cleaning operator said Famalaro came to her earlier this year 
distraught, worried about mounting bills, and feeling stretched thin by work 
and family obligations. 'At one point we considered having a charity event to 
raise money for him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Famalaro lost his Arizona contractor's license after 
customers complained about shoddy work and refusal to repair mistakes. He then 
began selling paints and other home improvement items. In court records filed 
since his arrest, he depicted himself as nearly destitute. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Famalaro joined the Real Estate 101 firm in Sedona after presenting 
a resume that listed prior work as a licensed chiropractor, extensive college 
classes and a one-year stint as a Los Angeles Sheriff's Department reserve 
officer, said Dick Holborow, head of the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very impressive resume," Holborow said adding that many agents did 
not know Famalaro well because usually worked in the office just one day a 
week. Before Famalaro joined the firm, Holborow said, he hired the handyman to 
clean the rugs at the company and was pleased with the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Holborow said he is worried about the effect Famalaro's arrest will have on 
his business. "It certainly doesn't bode too well for this kind of operation. 
This whole thing is bizarre," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irish, the police chief, said his interest in Famalaro has been piqued by the 
suspect's loner work habits and the amount of time he spent on the road as he 
traveled between California and Arizona. "It could be completely aboveboard but 
it is something we need to check," said Irish, adding that Hope also had ties 
-- mainly old boyfriends -- to California. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not known if Famalaro and Hope had ever met. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro often advertised his services in the Red Rock News in Sedona. "No 
gimmicks! No catches! No fine print!" an ad earlier this year promised. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman who handles business advertising at the newspaper said she and other 
women in her office often suspected that Famalaro inflated stories about his 
business prowess to impress them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just say we didn't believe all of his stories," the saleswoman said, 
speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 One fellow real estate agent said she was considering fixing Famalaro up with 
a girlfriend because he seemed so nice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am so glad it never happened," the agent said. "I would never have forgiven 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Another real estate agent said Famalaro had been urging her to take him around 
to see homes for sale -- specifically vacant homes. The woman, who said 
Famalaro sometimes made her feel uneasy, kept postponing the outing. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me he just seemed a little weird -- the whole thing about vacant homes," 
she said. "My hair stood up when I heard he was arrested." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Warfield, a local printer, said Famalaro often appeared distracted while 
talking to others but chalked it up to stress and his family life. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Juda, owner of a local engraving shop, said Famalaro had recently come to 
him looking to have a book -- possibly a Bible -- inscribed with calligraphy as 
a gift. Juda believed it was a gift for a recent graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro also ordered up a plastic real estate name tag to wear while doing 
showings. The tag and its $5.35 bill remained at the shop Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he is coming to pick it up," Juda said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON STICKS WITH SILENCE AS HIS 
POLICY ON TAX DISCLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Can a candidate for major office win election in California today without 
revealing his or her personal income taxes? 
</P>
<P>
 The question appears likely to be tested in this year's U.S. Senate race, in 
which Republican candidate Michael Huffington contends that voters are more 
concerned about how a lawmaker will behave in office than about personal bank 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Disclosure is not required by law, but experts are divided about whether it is 
required to win. Trust is not an abundant commodity in politics these days, 
they say, especially when almost nothing -- including private diaries, sexual 
behavior, college antics and particularly money -- seems beyond public 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, most candidates for U.S. Senate and governor in California have 
come to treat income tax disclosure as routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Huffington, a freshman congressman from Santa Barbara, said he is 
confident that voters want to grant a degree of privacy to their public 
officials. So far, he seems willing to suffer the tauntings of his Democratic 
opponent, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no plans to release (income tax records) because it is not required . 
. . to run for the Senate," Huffington said. "I think it is something that is 
not relevant to the campaign. . . . The tax issue people care about is whether 
a politician is going to raise their taxes or lower them." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, who was pressured into revealing 16 years of her and her husband's 
income taxes during the 1990 governor's race, has continued the practice since. 
She has challenged Huffington in a radio commercial to release his returns or 
"get out of the race." 
</P>
<P>
 She and other Democrats contend that Huffington warrants even more scrutiny 
than most candidates because he is using his personal fortune -- estimated at 
more than $70 million -- to finance an extraordinarily expensive campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "In your case Mr. Huffington, full disclosure is especially compelling," state 
Democratic Chairman Bill Press wrote to the Republican nominee in a letter last 
month. "You have publicly committed to spending as much as $20 million to win 
the general election. In the history of the entire country, no one has ever 
spent that much in personal funds running for the United States Senate. . . . 
Surely, you will recognize this request as simply the price you must pay to 
earn the public trust." 
</P>
<P>
 So how much of an issue is this likely to be? 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at past races is not a good indicator. In the 1978 New York governor's 
race, for instance, it dominated the campaign debate. In other races, such as a 
1992 California U.S. Senate campaign, it scarcely made a ripple. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate race, Republican Bruce Herschensohn declined to release his 
taxes, but offered to make the disclosure if Democratic rival Barbara Boxer 
agreed to a statewide televised debate. "It showed we had nothing to hide (and) 
it showed that she was more afraid of debating than she was interested in 
Herschensohn's taxes," said Ken Khachigian, who managed the GOP campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In most races, however, when taxes are released, they scarcely gain any 
attention. Both candidates in this year's race for governor in California have 
made their tax returns public without creating major headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people think all politicians are crooks," said George Gorton, 
campaign manager for Gov. Pete Wilson. "Pete's always felt that he should do it 
. . . just to be cleaner than clean." 
</P>
<P>
 Mervin Field, an independent pollster in San Francisco, said there is no 
California polling data regarding voter attitudes on the question because so 
many candidates provide the information. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, the question has been asked in polls, but not recently. In 1987, 
65% of the respondents in a Times Mirror study said income tax information 
should "almost always" be reported by candidates. In 1988, a Roper poll of 
women found 72% saying they would not consider a candidate who did not release 
tax information. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the state data, Field said he expects Huffington will be forced 
to disclose the information or seriously damage his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see him winning without revealing his income taxes," Field said. " . 
. . And the longer he delays, the greater the speculation that there is 
something he is trying to hide." 
</P>
<P>
 Political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe also warned that Huffington must beware 
of sending a message that he is above conventional rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a question of right or wrong," she said. "It's a question of 
arrogance. It's a question of hubris . . . . I think the major reason that 
voters would argue for disclosure is that he is putting himself above everyone 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington supporters and strategists said they do not expect the issue of tax 
returns to become a problem for the GOP nominee. In the past, they said, it has 
become a major issue only if the electorate develops suspicions about the 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say this was a non-issue," said Khachigian, who also is advising 
Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican political consultant Sal Russo agreed that voters usually will 
respect a candidate's financial privacy and that it may not be a major issue 
for Huffington. But he also acknowledged that it is easier for an opponent to 
raise suspicions about a relative newcomer such as Huffington than about a 
veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this was Ronald Reagan, people would say leave him alone," said Russo. "I 
think it has more effect when you use it against somebody who people don't know 
very much and who is wealthy. So if you are looking for a person who could be a 
victim of this kind of attack, Huffington could be that kind of victim." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign already has tried to plant the seeds of suspicion in the 
electorate that they hope will grow into a public demand for disclosure. In her 
current radio commercial, Feinstein asks about Huffington's fortune: "Where did 
all this money come from? Secret Indonesian oil deals? Cozy family stock 
transfers? And are you paying your fair share of taxes?" 
</P>
<P>
 A point of contention between the campaigns -- one that tax statements might 
address -- has been whether Huffington's fortune is the result of skillful 
business deals, as he has claimed, or the birthright of the son of a hugely 
successful Texas oilman. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's campaign argues that income tax statements would confirm 
Huffington's claim that he purchased his share in the family's petroleum 
company at a market rate. 
</P>
<P>
 On the campaign trail, Huffington says his fortune is proof of the American 
dream because it is the product of a $1,000 investment he made in a financial 
services company shortly after college. The candidate also says his family 
connections did not give him any special preference when he later joined his 
father's company, the Houston-based Roy M. Huffington Inc., which was sold in 
1990 for an estimated $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the family enterprise was privately held, there are few public records 
that show what took place within the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no deep, dark secret about how he got it," Khachigian said. "The 
company was sold and the returns to his dad and to himself were, I gather, 
substantial. There is very little to learn about Mike Huffington and the source 
of his wealth." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also drew attention to his private finances last month when he 
charged in a television commercial that Feinstein did not pay income taxes in 
1978, 1979 and 1985 -- based on the statements she released during the 
governor's campaign -- while he has always paid his. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein explained that she did not owe taxes for two of those years because 
her former husband was dying and the family was forced to pay major medical 
bills at the same time it was without his income. She paid no taxes the third 
year because of a major business loss, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington's claim that he has paid all of his taxes opened the door for 
Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata to ask: "How do we know?" 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington declined to say in an interview whether there have been any years 
he did not pay income taxes. "You can ask," he said. "You can ask about 
someone's sex life. But they don't have to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 He also sought to turn the issue back at Feinstein, saying it proves she is 
not interested in talking about issues that are more important for voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means they can't find anything real to talk about," he said. "Career 
politicians focus on the funniest thing. They don't want us to focus on their 
record, so they don't focus on ours."

LIFETIME COSTS CALCULATED FOR BIRTH DEFECTS; HEALTH: THE FIGURE FOR A 
CALIFORNIA CHILD WITH CEREBRAL PALSY NEARS $500,000, RESEARCHERS SAY. THEY URGE 
INVESTMENT OF FUNDS IN STUDY OF CAUSES AND PREVENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One in every 33 infants born in California has a severe birth defect and the 
costs of medical and educational care for such children can be staggering, 
according to a new state-funded study, the first to examine such lifetime 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The direct medical and supportive costs for an individual with a birth defect 
such as cerebral palsy approach half a million dollars, while the cumulative 
costs for the state run into the hundreds of millions of dollars, according to 
a study published today in the journal Inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 On an individual basis, birth defects are as costly or more costly than 
life-threatening diseases, such as cancer and heart disease, but 
proportionately far less money is spent researching their causes and 
prevention, according to economist Norman J. Waitzman of the University of 
Utah, who led the study under a contract from the California Department of 
Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spend only about $60 million per year on birth defects research in the 
United States, but several billions on cancer," Waitzman said. "We could get 
more bang for the buck" by increasing the amount spent on the search for the 
causes of birth defects, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investing now in finding the cause of birth defects will save millions of 
dollars in the future," said Dr. John Harris, chief of the California Birth 
Defects Monitoring Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Waitzman emphasized that the cost estimates are extremely conservative and do 
not include the emotional and indirect costs of birth defects, such as parents' 
time lost from work. "When those are included, the costs are much, much 
higher," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The California birth defects program, unique in the country and a source of 
some of the data used in the study, monitors more than 300,000 births per year, 
tracking birth defects and trends with its registry. The state "is ahead of the 
nation in having a birth defects surveillance system," according to Dr. 
Jennifer L. Howse, president of the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. 
Expanding the program nationwide could lead to much better understanding of the 
causes of birth defects, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 The new study is based on births from 1988. Waitzman's teams estimated the 
cumulative costs of direct medical care, special educational costs and 
supportive care, which includes community services, nursing care in the home 
and specialized transportation costs such as school busing for the handicapped. 
They used Medicare and Medi-Cal costs in their calculations, which are often 
substantially lower than the costs incurred by private insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, there were 657 California children born with cerebral palsy, for 
example, an incidence of about 1.23 cases per 1,000 births (about the same as 
the national average). The projected lifetime cost for care of these children 
was $445,000 per person, Waitzman calculated. For the 657 cases, that totals 
more than $292 million. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 558 children born with Down's syndrome, the projected cost per child 
was estimated at $410,000, for a total of more than $228 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Waitzman and others hope that more research will reveal the causes of Down's 
syndrome and other birth defects whose origins remain unknown. But researchers 
can already use the findings to evaluate the benefits of prevention programs 
for those few cases where information is available about causes, according to 
Sonja Bentley, community services manager for the birth defects program. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers know, for example, that feeding supplements of folic acid to 
pregnant women can reduce the incidence of neural tube defects, such as spina 
bifida, and federal officials have proposed that bread and flour be 
supplemented with the vitamin. Waitzman has already used the new data to 
calculate cost/benefit ratios for the proposed program and expects to publish 
his results shortly.

BLOODIED CROWBAR DISCOVERED IN HOME OF MURDER SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON and GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A search of the home of John Joseph Famalaro, who has been charged with the 
murder of Denise Huber of Newport Beach, turned up a bloodied crowbar and a 
list of about 10 names, nine of them women, authorities revealed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities located at least five of the women in Southern California and 
Phoenix. They planned to appeal for the public's help today in identifying the 
remainder. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement authorities also began searching sites in Orange County for 
evidence. Court documents filed Tuesday in Mayer, a town near Prescott in 
central Arizona, indicate that police have seized numerous suspicious items 
from Famalaro's home, including articles of women's clothing, some of which 
appear to be stained with blood, a blood-tainted tarp and the crowbar that 
police suspect may be the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The revelations came after the body of Huber, 23 at the time of her 
disappearance, was found last week in a freezer in the back of a stolen rental 
truck parked in Famalaro's driveway. Huber vanished three years ago after she 
became stranded on the Corona del Mar Freeway with a flat tire. Famalaro, 37, 
is being held in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Shoults, whose wife, Gloria, was on the list of names, expressed 
surprise because their only connection with Famalaro was that they had sold him 
a van two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, who called to check on Gloria Shoults' well-being, "said that her name 
had turned up on some papers they had found," said Shoults, of Dewey, Ariz. 
"Having somebody like that in your neighborhood . . . does make your hair stand 
up a little bit, because this is generally a quiet area."  
</P>
<P>
 Huber was believed to have been bludgeoned to death, and a crowbar could have 
been the type of weapon used, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Authorities, who have not ruled out additional suspects, said they want to 
question two men who are related to Famalaro in connection with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 * Police completed a comprehensive search of Famalaro's home, and expanded 
their search in Orange County, where Famalaro had rented several storage 
lockers and where he kept the freezer before moving to Arizona. Using axes, 
rakes and shovels, authorities Tuesday dug as deep as 10 feet below the surface 
in three areas of Famalaro's home where cadaver-sniffing dogs had "alerted," 
but no other bodies were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Police went to at least three storage facilities in Orange County on Tuesday, 
including Trabuco Self Storage and Lake Forest Storage. Costa Mesa Detective 
Sgt. Jerry Holloway said investigators "are finding some items of evidence that 
we can use," but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are focusing on reconstructing how Famalaro and Huber may have 
come into contact June 3, 1991, the night of her disappearance, and his 
movements since. Police said Tuesday that they believe Huber was killed in 
Orange County shortly after her abduction and that her body was transported in 
the freezer, but it may be difficult to fix a time and place of death because 
of the condition of the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement sources alternately discounted and were intrigued by the 
theory that Famalaro may have lured Huber to her death by posing as a law 
enforcement officer. Two phony Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department shirts 
were among the numerous items seized from his home. Both shirts had handmade 
replicas of the Los Angeles County sheriff's official patches sewn on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's attorney, Lawrence William Katz, disputed the strength of the case 
against his client and attacked news media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he expects a grand jury to indict Famalaro this week. He said he 
would immediately seek to overturn the indictment on the ground that excessive 
publicity has compromised the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Search warrant papers filed in Arizona on Tuesday revealed that police 
confiscated an extensive array of potentially incriminating items from 
Famalaro's home during an exhaustive search last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the bloody crowbar, a number of seized items had crimson stains, 
including strips of white cloth, a tarp, tissue, a "yellow paper bodysuit," a 
sweat shirt and articles of women's clothing. Authorities are awaiting the 
results of blood and fingerprint tests.

STILL THE RIGHT STUFF; EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE DEFIES DOWNSIZING TREND, EXPECTS 
HIGH-FLYING FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the budget ax falls on military posts across the nation, this vast 
aerospace stronghold -- once a stomping ground for "Right Stuff" test pilots, 
now a landing ground for space shuttles -- remains a prosperous contradiction. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era of defense downsizing, its $457-million budget is substantially 
fatter this year than last. Its 15,000 employees bustle confidently among 
hangars, offices and classrooms. Dozens of sleek military jets take off and 
land each day, as they have for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years after one of its most famous alumni -- former NASA test 
pilot Neil Armstrong -- became the first human to set foot on the moon, Edwards 
has not only dodged the budget bullet, it is undergoing a construction boom. 
</P>
<P>
 Many observers believe the base's assets -- a legendary aircraft testing 
center, excellent flying weather and long, forgiving runways in the Mojave 
Desert -- have immunized it against ongoing budget cuts that have ravaged much 
of California's once-thriving military-industrial establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some think that President Clinton, whose reelection strategy is 
tied to winning California in 1996, may go out of his way to spare Edwards and 
other California posts in the next round of base-closure decisions next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But others worry that continued pressure to reduce defense spending -- and a 
politically charged rivalry with the Navy's Patuxent River flight test center 
in Maryland -- may eventually siphon dollars from Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards officials say the base actually will benefit from the defense 
build-down, as other installations are closed or reduced and their 
aircraft-testing functions are shifted to Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Edwards will inherit some other flight test activities as other bases back 
East close," said Bob Johnstone, the base's planning chief. "I think you'll see 
testing gravitate toward the southwestern United States . . . and Edwards will 
be at the hub of those test ranges." 
</P>
<P>
 One such "inheritance" took place this spring when a 950-member air wing was 
transferred to Edwards from Ohio's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base at a cost of 
$42 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4950th Test Wing and its 26 aircraft were moved despite opposition by 
Congress members from Ohio, including U.S. Sen. John Glenn, a former astronaut. 
The wing's arrival at Edwards marked the biggest single addition to the base in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards was able to absorb the Ohio wing in part because it was constructing 
an $11.9-million office building to house its own 412th Test Wing staff. The 
two wings share the 90,000-square-foot building, finished a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the base expects to receive about $50 million to computerize a huge 
high-tech chamber where aircraft electronic warfare systems can be tested 
without outside electrical interference or fear of satellite snooping. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill Thomas (R-Bakersfield), who represents the Edwards area, said that 
appropriation is the result of a behind-the-scenes struggle between him and 
Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Maryland), whose district includes the Patuxent River base. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said Hoyer wanted federal money to enlarge a similar but smaller 
chamber at Patuxent River that already is computerized. Thomas said he argued 
that the money should be spent to computerize the Edwards chamber, already the 
world's largest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won that one," Thomas said. "Those kind of battles are going on very 
quietly." 
</P>
<P>
 A Hoyer spokesman said he was unaware of any tiff between Hoyer and Thomas, 
and that Hoyer has secured $30 million for the Patuxent River chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Connell, an ex-Navy test pilot who heads a Ridgecrest-based group that 
wants the Pentagon to beef up Edwards and other Southern California bases, said 
he is aware of discussions within the military to transfer to Edwards some 
activities performed at Patuxent River and at Florida's Eglin Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell said he is optimistic about Edwards' future, in part because 
California's delegation in Congress -- both Republicans and Democrats -- seems 
to be pulling together more to protect local bases from further cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In an illustration of how hardball politics can affect military installations, 
Connell said California legislators recently discovered that a number of aides 
to congressional members from Maryland and Florida were scheduled last week to 
tour Edwards and the China Lake Naval Air Weapons Station, about 60 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the inspection, he said, was to sniff out any waste or 
duplication at the California bases that could be used as ammunition against 
any proposals to dismantle the East Coast bases. 
</P>
<P>
 When Southern California congressional representatives learned of the trip, 
they demanded to be part of it -- prompting the East Coast staffers to cancel, 
he said. His account was confirmed by an aide to Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon 
(R-Santa Clarita), who represents part of Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 But Connell's view of the possible bounty awaiting Edwards is not universally 
held. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Wilcox, a Los Angeles-based consultant who helps local communities adjust 
economically to base shutdowns, said the Pentagon is unlikely to want to break 
up Patuxent River -- the Navy's own flight test center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pax River is very unique and the Navy is very jealous of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoyer's spokesman, Jesse Jacobs, said the Maryland congressman is unlikely to 
allow Patuxent River to be dismantled without a fight. "Steny is not prepared 
to let any part of Pax River go," Jacobs said. "He has not worked harder on any 
issue than base closure." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox said that despite a third round of base cutbacks scheduled next year, 
he believes Edwards and other California bases are unlikely to suffer. With the 
President pegging his reelection hopes on winning in California, he will not be 
eager to inflict more economic setbacks on the state, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal outlays for Edwards' famed Flight Test Center -- which represent most 
of the base's budget -- have grown steadily since 1992, despite deep cuts at 
other military bases. From a fiscal 1992 appropriation of $363 million, the 
budget jumped to $407 million in 1993 and $457 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides ideal flying conditions and enormous dry lake runways, Edwards boasts 
a reputation as the Air Force's premier aircraft test facility. Its well-known 
test pilot school has supplied more skilled fliers for the U.S. astronaut corps 
-- more than 70 out of 214 -- than any other source. 
</P>
<P>
 All three members of the Apollo 11 moon landing crew were associated with 
Edwards. Armstrong was a NASA test pilot there in the late 1950s and early 
1960s. Michael Collins graduated from the test pilot school in 1960. And Buzz 
Aldrin became commandant of the school in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 At the centerpiece Flight Test Center, cheat-the-devil test pilots 
immortalized in Tom Wolfe's "The Right Stuff" pushed experimental jets and 
rocket planes to their limits -- and sometimes beyond -- in the 1940s, '50s and 
'60s. 
</P>
<P>
 It is where Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier. Where Armstrong restarted 
the engines on a flamed-out X-15 just before it hit the ground. Where a space 
shuttle first landed in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Zooming to the edge of space in high-performance aircraft, test pilots at 
Edwards laid many of the scientific foundations for the space program. The 
base's Rogers Dry Lake -- a 44-square-mile swath of hard-packed desert that 
forms an immense natural runway -- is a national historic landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 But flying experimental planes is dangerous work. Since the late 1940s, about 
55 military and civilian pilots have been killed at Edwards. Whenever a 
colleague would plow into the Earth at high speed, pilots would sardonically 
say he had "drilled a hole" or "augured in." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the mid-1950s, pilots often retreated after a day at the base to the 
Happy Bottom Riding Club, a raucous bar run by Florence (Pancho) Barnes, a 
former Hollywood stunt pilot, gunrunner and rum smuggler known for her foul 
mouth and fondness for good times. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pancho's, young pilots boozed, brawled and argued endlessly about who was 
the fastest, toughest, hottest. There were stag parties, fist fights and 
drunken forays into the desert to hunt bear and deer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was our clubhouse and playroom, and if all the hours were ever totaled, I 
reckon I spent more time at her place than I did in a cockpit over those 
years," wrote Yeager in a 1985 autobiography. "And I was flying about five 
different airplanes daily." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the base may be best known as a landing site for the space shuttle, 
whose arrivals attract tens of thousands of spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 Although testing at Edwards once involved newly invented aircraft such as 
exotic jet and rocket planes, it revolves today mostly around standard planes 
that have been modified with new avionics and other high-tech gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnstone, the base's planning chief, said he expects Edwards to lose about 
700 employees by next summer as testing on the Air Force's new C-17 cargo plane 
winds down. However, he hopes employment levels will rise again in 1997 or 
1998, when the F-22 fighter is expected to undergo shakedown flights. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, base officials continue to battle massive toxic waste problems, 
cracking runways and encroachment by home builders in Lancaster and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards already has spent $68 million cleaning up leaked fuel and toxic 
solvents, and the bill could soar as high as $400 million, said Bob Wood, the 
base's environmental restoration manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers last week dug up the 200th of more than 500 underground storage tanks, 
many of which were buried years ago and have leaked. Base spokesman Dennis 
Shoffner said toxic material seeped into a shallow water table beneath Edwards, 
but none of its drinking water wells -- which draw from 400 feet deep or deeper 
-- have been contaminated. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said the cleanup may be complicated by the desert tortoise, a federally 
protected species that roams the area. The cleanup may be suspended in areas 
where it would disturb tortoise habitat, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The base also faces cracks that keep growing in its lake bed runways. The 
worst one, which slices across a runway used only rarely for landings, is now 
half a mile long and five feet wide. 
</P>
<P>
 The cracks are the result of a sinking of the lake bed caused by pumping from 
an underground aquifer the base shares with Lancaster and Palmdale. In an 
effort to minimize the settling, the base recently tapped into the State Water 
Project for drinking water and redesigned its sewage plant to recycle water, 
Shoffner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another nettlesome problem is continuing home construction under the base's 
flight corridors. Base officials worry that if too many people move in, noise 
complaints could force the base to change flying routes or even shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards officials have worked closely with local planners to limit growth on 
the base's flanks. Officials in Lancaster and Los Angeles, Kern and San 
Bernardino counties recently drafted rules to limit builders to one home per 2 
1/2 acres, said Johnstone, in a two-mile-wide buffer zone around the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to after the fact make changes for them because they chose to 
live there," said Thomas, the congressman. "Frankly, the base is more important 
than any individual homeowner . . . or group of homeowners." 
</P>
<P>
 But Johnstone said population growth is a problem that will not disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing that closes a base is encroachment," he said.

EX-AIDE GETS PROBATION IN CAPITOL CORRUPTION CASE; COURTS: KARIN WATSON, A 
GOVERNMENT WITNESS WHO PLEADED GUILTY FIVE YEARS AGO, WILL AVOID PRISON. SHE 
PROVIDED KEY TESTIMONY AGAINST SEN. FRANK HILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost five years after pleading guilty to a political corruption charge, 
former Assembly Republican aide-turned-government-witness Karin Watson was 
sentenced Tuesday to three years probation and will not have to serve time in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson, who provided key testimony against former GOP state Sen. Frank Hill of 
Whittier, was treated leniently because of her years as a cooperating 
government witness in the federal probe of corruption in the state Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Her decision in 1989 to cooperate with prosecutors and plead guilty to 
extorting $12,500 from an undercover FBI agent "turned her life upside down," 
said Assistant U.S. Atty. John K. Vincent in urging the court to spare her from 
serving prison time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once she agreed to cooperate with federal authorities," Vincent said, "she 
was fired from her job at the Legislature, and her so-called friends at the 
Legislature began to act as if she never existed." 
</P>
<P>
 In arguing for leniency before U.S. District Judge Edward J. Garcia, Vincent 
said his office viewed "Ms. Watson's culpability as much less than that of the 
elected officials for whom she worked, who made extortionate activities she 
pled guilty to a requirement of her job." 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal sentencing guidelines, Watson could have faced up to two years 
in prison and a $40,000 fine for her part in arranging $10,000 in campaign 
contributions for her ex-boss, former Republican Assembly leader Pat Nolan of 
Glendale, and a $2,500 payment to Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Garcia agreed to forgo the fine and prison time for Watson, saying 
her cooperation "did subject her to much more (hardship) than is usually the 
case with cooperating government witnesses." 
</P>
<P>
 In aiding the government, Watson, who now lives in the Chico area, also helped 
make the case against Nolan, who was charged with Hill. In February, Nolan 
pleaded guilty to a racketeering charge in exchange for a reduced prison 
sentence. He is serving a 33-month term at a minimum security prison camp in 
Dublin, east of Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who resigned from the Senate this month, was convicted of using his 
office to extort a $2,500 honorarium from a businessman, who was in reality an 
undercover FBI agent. While awaiting his sentencing in September, Hill has 
asked that the verdict against him be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time Watson pleaded guilty, prosecutors recommended that she serve no 
more than six months in a halfway house rather than be sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vincent made his pitch for an even lighter sentence, in part because of 
the long delay in seeking criminal indictments against Hill and Nolan -- which 
had the effect of "leaving her in limbo for over five years." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to being shunned by friends, Watson and her husband suffered "some 
business setbacks, so they found themselves in rather dire economic straits," 
Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also contrasted her predicament with other targets of the federal 
corruption probe who chose to fight the charges against them. In her case, 
Vincent said, "there has not been the outpouring of support for her from the 
Legislature and the lobbying corps as there was for (Capitol lobbyist) Clay 
Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who was convicted in December on 10 counts of racketeering, mail 
fraud, conspiracy and money laundering, is serving a 6 1/2-year sentence at the 
Dublin camp. He is appealing his conviction, and many prominent Capitol 
lobbyists have been raising money to help with his mounting legal bills.

THE HUBER MURDER CASE; SUSPECT HAD SOUGHT TO ENTER POLICE WORK; FAMALARO: WITH 
THE DISCOVERY OF TWO SHERIFF'S DEPUTY SHIRTS AT ARIZONA HOME, INTEREST IN LAW 
ENFORCEMENT TAKES ON ADDED SIGNIFICANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Murder suspect John Joseph Famalaro wanted to be cop and was for a brief time 
enrolled in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department training academy for 
reserve officers, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro's interest in law enforcement has taken on added significance since 
authorities in Arizona found two look-alike Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy 
shirts in his Arizona home as they were searching for evidence in the death of 
Denise A. Huber. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, 37, who was arrested last week in connection with Huber's death, 
made several attempts in 1983 and 1984 to become a police officer, sheriff's 
deputy or reserve officer but was either rejected or dropped out early in the 
application process, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest he ever got to his goal was four months spent as a reserve 
sheriff's deputy, said Deputy Irma Becerra of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. Famalaro began the six-month training program in November, 1983, 
but dropped out in March, 1984, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Famalaro voluntarily resigned two months prior to the completion of his 
training because of an injury which prevented his participation in academy 
physical training," Becerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 To get into the training academy, candidates must submit to an extensive 
background check, a physical exam, psychological testing, a written exam and an 
oral exam, Deputy Jeff Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very extensive process before you are sent to the reserve academy for 
a six-month training program," Cannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to his stint at the academy, Famalaro had applied to be a reserve deputy 
with the Orange County Sheriff's Department, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after submitting his application in May, 1983, Famalaro dropped out of the 
application process. He had passed a written exam, physical agility test and an 
oral interview, Lt. Dan Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process was terminated due to a lack of interest on Famalaro's part," 
Martini said. "We just waited and didn't hear from him." 
</P>
<P>
 But a year later, two months after dropping out of the Los Angeles academy, 
Famalaro once again applied for a position with the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department, this time for a job as a full-fledged deputy, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lieutenant could not say how far Famalaro went in the application process 
the second time. But in June, 1984, "he was not selected for whatever reason." 
</P>
<P>
 That same year, Famalaro applied to be an officer with the Irvine Police 
Department but dropped out early in the process, Lt. Sam Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 City policy prohibits release of specific information about a job applicant, 
Allevato said, so he could not say exactly when Famalaro applied or how far 
into the application process he got. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect also attended Rancho Santiago College (then Santa Ana College) 
from September, 1975, to June, 1979, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 College officials said that in 1984 he requested that his transcripts be sent 
to Cal Poly Pomona. But officials at the university said they have no record of 
Famalaro attending school there. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at companies that supply uniforms to the training academies of the 
Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department 
said Tuesday that it is not difficult for someone to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Legally, anyone can buy any pair of pants or shirt they want," said Ken 
Matthews, manager of Long Beach Uniforms. "It's when people start to try and 
affix department patches to them that we have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro reportedly had sewn a handmade replica of Los Angeles Sheriff's 
Department patches to the uniform that was found in his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't sell the patches to anyone who doesn't have the proper 
identification," Matthews said. "If we did, we might have all sorts of people 
going around trying to make false arrests." 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies, however, such as Uniforms Inc. in Los Angeles, will sell 
department patches to anyone, manager Wayne Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa Police Lt. Ron Smith, who has investigated the Huber case, 
discounted a theory that Famalaro may have lured Huber to her death by posing 
as a law enforcement officer, saying she was "too smart" for that.

21 KILLED IN PANAMANIAN PLANE CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A commuter plane exploded in the air and crashed Tuesday in a mountainous area 
in northern Panama, killing all 21 people aboard, the Civil Aeronautics 
Administration said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration director Zozimo Guardia told a news conference that several 
witnesses saw the Alas Chiricanas Airline plane explode around 4:30 p.m., about 
six miles beyond its takeoff point at the Colon airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reports received is that the aircraft is in pieces and the bodies are 
strewn over an area a quarter of a mile around it," Guardia said. "There are no 
survivors." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the cause of the crash is being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Guardia said the plane, a Brazilian-made Embraer, carried 18 passengers and a 
crew of three. It was on a routine flight from Colon, at the Atlantic entrance 
of the Panama Canal, to Panama City, at the Pacific entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the passengers were businessmen, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyewitnesses said heavy rain and winds tossed the plane into nearby television 
antennas shortly after takeoff, Manuel Zambrano, regional director of the 
Protection System, told RPC radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue crews have already retrieved 14 bodies from the wreckage, the National 
Civil Protection Service said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the worst crash in Panama since June, 1992, when a plane from COPA 
airline crashed in mountainous Darien province, killing 47 passengers on board, 
most of them Colombians.

UNDER FIRE, BERLUSCONI DROPS DETENTION DECREE; ITALY: ORDER LIMITING ARRESTS IN 
CORRUPTION CASES SPARKED UPROAR. CRISIS HAD THREATENED GOVERNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bowing to public outrage and the likely collapse of his young coalition 
government, Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi scrapped a controversial 
decree Tuesday that would have limited magistrates' powers of arrest in 
corruption cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Withdrawal of the decree represented a humiliating defeat for the billionaire 
media tycoon and political rookie, who was elected in March by an electorate in 
open rebellion against massive institutional corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi said the decree, issued last week, was intended to protect the 
civil rights of criminal suspects by ending pretrial detention for most 
white-collar crimes. Critics called it a bald attempt to short-circuit the work 
of magistrates investigating corruption and the Mafia. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition had mushroomed to encompass not only corruption-investigating 
magistrates who are some of the most respected public figures in the country 
but also Berlusconi's own coalition partners, thus seriously threatening his 
government's stability. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Berlusconi backed away from a showdown he clearly would have lost 
and called a Cabinet meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabinet spokesman Giuliano Ferrara said the government agreed to withdraw the 
decree and resubmit the proposal as a bill for parliamentary approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrara, who has Cabinet rank, said that ministers agreed major cases of 
bribery and corruption should be restored to a list of offenses for which 
suspects could be remanded in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi's two main coalition partners, Umberto Bossi of the Northern League 
and Gianfranco Fini of the National Alliance, opposed the decree and asked 
Berlusconi to scrap it in a letter made public Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The measure met with vast opposition in the country and the Parliament, with 
the result of a clear-cut division in the government majority," they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Magistrates, who have used pretrial detention extensively against corruption 
and Mafia suspects, were among the strongest critics. A 30-month investigation 
into institutionalized corruption has netted more than 3,000 political and 
business figures; companies routinely paid kickbacks to individuals and 
political parties in exchange for government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 The decree would have banned magistrates from using pretrial prison custody 
for suspects in about 30 types of crimes, among them offenses in public 
administration, more commonly known as bribery and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic reaction came from the judges themselves, chief of them 
Antonio di Pietro, the Milanese investigating magistrate who led the justice 
campaign against institutionalized corruption and rivals the Pope in the esteem 
in which he is held among Italians. 
</P>
<P>
 Di Pietro and other magistrates discovered early on that a few days in cells 
with "common criminals" was the quickest, surest way of enticing confessions 
from business people and politicians. On Friday, an outraged Di Pietro said he 
was resigning as the leading Tangentopoli (Kickback City) judge and asked for a 
transfer in protest of the decree. 
</P>
<P>
 Another threatened resignation came from Interior Minister Roberto Maroni, who 
claimed he was "misled" about the true content of the decree, written by 
Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi. 
</P>
<P>
 As a quick result of the decree, scores of high-level politicians and business 
leaders were freed from jail and remanded to house arrest -- 124 of them, 
according to Italian newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking Monday on one of the three national television channels he owns, 
Berlusconi denied there was a threat the outcry could topple his government. 
But for the first time, his voice agitated and hoarse, Berlusconi did not rule 
out a compromise, saying he was "open to improvements" on the decree, from 
coalition members or the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Italians tend to see pretrial detention as an aid to speedy justice in a 
country where cases typically drag on for years, and his opponents accused 
Berlusconi of acting to support business allies and disgraced old-line 
political parties and their scandal-tarnished leaders.

DATELINE: SEATTLE; THROUGH HIS GLASS, ARTIST IS SEEN AS PRIZED ASSET IN 
NORTHWEST; DALE CHIHULY HAS WON ACCLAIM IN THE ART WORLD AND CULT-HERO STATUS 
IN HIS HOMETOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as the Pacific Northwest helped pioneer richly brewed coffee, handcrafted 
beer, jet airliners and computer software, perhaps it also will contribute in 
elevating the stature of the artist in society. 
</P>
<P>
 As Seattle residents can tell you, one contemporary artist in this region now 
rivals billionaire technologist Bill Gates and baseball star Ken Griffey Jr. in 
permeating the consciousness of the community and reflecting the region's proud 
image of itself. 
</P>
<P>
 An artist? 
</P>
<P>
 It is an understatement to say that Dale Chihuly is an artist with glass. To 
those inside the culture of the arts -- as well as to those with less-refined 
eyes -- Chihuly has popularized glass and explored its frontiers like no 
American since Louis C. Tiffany. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the critics here and elsewhere say, itself quite a mouthful. His 
vivid expressions of color, fashioned into fantastic shapes -- platters, 
vessels, spheres, chandeliers, intertwined tubes -- and his technical mastery 
in fashioning glass objects in previously unheard-of sizes make his work the 
most prized of any Seattle artist, alive or dead. 
</P>
<P>
 But 52-year-old Chihuly (ch-WHO-ly) has gone a good many steps further. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a star; he's mythological. He makes people here feel good. Everyone 
here, even the crowd at a sports bar, knows of at least one artist -- Dale 
Chihuly -- and they know his work," says Marie McCaffrey, former Seattle arts 
commissioner and a longtime community activist. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a living piece of the Northwest -- part of what characterizes the 
region and tells us that's what we're like." 
</P>
<P>
 The best of our artists are loose threads in the social fabric, and they are 
discussed most often in terms of those things that separate them from other 
people: their elitism, their undecipherable quality, their desire to shock, 
their renegade struggles for, and against, commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
 Chihuly embodies some of this. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing he looks like an artist -- with his wild-man thatch of curly 
hair, eye patch (covering an injury from a car accident), his chartreuse pants 
and clownish, paint-splattered shoes. And, no doubt, he enjoys indulging in the 
public theatrics we allow our artists -- the kind of temperamental character 
who, at his own press conference, may choose to sit with reporters as if to 
watch rather than make a presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are other components to Chihuly's career that have come to give 
artists esteem in the Northwest beyond just art. 
</P>
<P>
 He shares. A quarter-century ago, he co-founded the region's Pilchuck glass 
school, which brought the Italian art of glass blowing and shaping to the 
United States in a big way. He became a foremost influence in moving glass from 
craft to art, and his students now form an expanding glass art movement across 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, he is not too famous or important to speak to a class of wide-eyed 
junior high students or to welcome into his studio visiting artists from around 
the world. And he continues to support a variety of charity auctions with 
donations of his time and art. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a promoter. Chihuly glass shared the stage with President Clinton at a 
meeting of leaders of Asian nations in Seattle last November. He explores new 
ways of expression -- including designing sets made of plastic, not glass, for 
the Seattle Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 A native Northwesterner, he defied the conventions of the high art world -- 
not moving his studio to New York or Los Angeles. Instead he established his 
popularity locally and then worldwide with collectors, leaving the critics to 
fall into line. Today, his work is part of the permanent collections of 107 
museums around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 He challenged the very definition of the contemporary artist -- that of a 
solitary individual answering the drive of creativity. Instead, modern glass 
blowing on Chihuly's scale is a team endeavor, with sometimes more than a dozen 
artists working to create a single "Chihuly" piece. Prices range from $3,000 to 
$500,000 or more -- although one lucky collector found a Chihuly at a Goodwill 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, he seems to maintain a level perspective on success and on art. 
</P>
<P>
 "My purpose, glass, my vision, my style, happens to bring some pleasure to 
people," he says from the waterfront Seattle boathouse, located directly under 
an Interstate 5 freeway bridge, that serves as his home and glass "hot shop." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what drives me . . . but I guess I wouldn't do this just for 
myself, although I know that some artists would." 
</P>
<P>
 His success and fame so dominates the local scene that other artists 
frequently chafe and struggle in his shadow. But few deny that Chihuly's 
greatest achievement remains his most difficult: He consistently produces 
unique work that can be appreciated without regard to the refinement of one's 
artistic understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really can't argue with Dale Chihuly. His work is never ho-hum, never 
boring. But neither is he impenetrable or offensive. I've never seen anyone who 
looked at a Chihuly and didn't say, 'Wow,' " says Kristine Easterday, a Seattle 
businesswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here tend to own their heroes, and he's ours."

 With one hand on a 16th-Century Bible and the other on Ukraine's 1991 
Declaration of Independence, Leonid Kuchma was sworn in Tuesday as this 
nation's second president. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first peaceful transfer of executive power in Ukraine's turbulent 
modern history. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as he took over from outgoing rival Leonid Kravchuk, Kuchma called 
for "essential changes in Ukraine's economic and political course" to avert 
economic disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In a short inaugural address, Kuchma, 55, vowed to reform the country's 
devastated economy, cut taxes, fight crime, liberalize foreign-exchange 
controls and sign a comprehensive treaty for closer economic ties with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview on Russian television Sunday, Kuchma suggested that the way to 
renew those ties is through the creation of Ukrainian-Russian corporations for 
the production of weapons, space launchers and other high-tech equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchma's pro-Russian tilt appears to have placated Russian-speaking 
separatists in the Crimea, where Kuchma won almost 90% of the vote in the July 
10 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In a symbolic move that would have been unlikely had Kravchuk won, Crimean 
President Yuri Meshkov joined other regional leaders in the marble-walled 
chamber of Parliament to watch Kuchma swear "to defend the sovereignty of 
Ukraine." 
</P>
<P>
 "A normal man has come to power, and the political climate has improved," 
Meshkov said after the ceremony. "We won't be so tough in our positions now." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchma differs from his predecessor in his approach to ridding Ukraine of the 
176 strategic nuclear missiles left on its territory when the Soviet Union 
collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 He took a significantly less strident position in the Russian television 
interview than he had previously, saying, "The sooner we get rid of these 
missiles, the better for Ukraine." 
</P>
<P>
 But on previous occasions he has opposed signing the 1968 Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty until it is amended to accommodate Ukraine's 
"inheritance" of nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "The treaty is up for renewal next year," Kuchma said at a post-election news 
conference with a shrug that suggested Ukraine might wait until then before 
signing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchma promised Tuesday that one of his first acts as president will be to 
propose legislation giving the Russian language official status alongside 
Ukrainian. The pledge drew cheers from some lawmakers but is likely to raise 
nationalist hackles. 
</P>
<P>
 As a peasant boy, Kuchma grew up speaking Ukrainian but spent decades in the 
exclusively Russian-speaking world of Soviet aerospace, eventually rising to 
head Ukraine's largest missile factory. He took a few lessons to polish his 
rusty Ukrainian before the presidential campaign began. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchma's most daunting task will be to revive an economy in shambles. Kuchma 
estimates that four in 10 Ukrainians are unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Official statistics released Monday show a 40% drop in production in the first 
six months of this year, and output of some consumer goods has plunged 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy's reserves left over from the Soviet Union are totally 
exhausted," Oleg Soskin, the deputy head of a Kiev think tank, told Reuters 
news service. "Kuchma has no more than two months to get his reforms going."

TRADE TENSIONS SHADOW GORE IN CANADA; NORTH AMERICA: VICE PRESIDENT, OTTAWA 
OFFICIALS EMPHASIZE FRIENDSHIP IN SPEECHES. BUT DISPUTES OVER FLOW OF GOODS MAY 
WORSEN.

 Vice President Al Gore met with Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and 
other top officials here Tuesday, emphasizing the strong friendship and 
economic ties that endure between the two countries despite rising trade 
tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 In public remarks, Gore, Chretien and Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Sheila 
Copps all stressed the historic amity between the United States and Canada. 
Gore even recalled that a Canadian neurosurgeon operated on his son, Albert 
Gore III, in 1989, restoring the 6-year-old's use of his arm after he had been 
struck by a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Private meetings were also described by both sides as cordial. 
</P>
<P>
 But Canadian officials suggested that Chretien and others made clear their 
views on the trade irritants, which threaten to worsen in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore's visit came one day after farm state members of Congress met with 
President Clinton pressing for U.S. limits on the import of Canadian wheat, 
which American farmers believe is unfairly subsidized. 
</P>
<P>
 If the United States acts to cap Canadian wheat imports, Canada is expected to 
retaliate against American food products, including California wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators from the two countries also are deadlocked over each country's 
share of the salmon catch in the Pacific Northwest. That impasse threatens to 
erupt into a "salmon war" in which fishermen from both countries would catch as 
much as possible, depleting stocks and disrupting conservation efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore said he hoped the disputes would be resolved amicably, but added, "you 
can't possibly have trade flows as large as the ones between our two countries 
without having disputes from time to time." 
</P>
<P>
 Canada's emphasis on the trade snags, considered relatively minor by American 
officials, underline the peculiar nature of the bilateral relationship, in 
which a hiccup by the giant to the south can feel like an earthquake in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the tension over wheat and salmon, there are unresolved disputes over 
Canadian export of softwood lumber to the U.S. and limited access by American 
brewers to Canada's beer market, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 While these arguments account for only a small part of U.S.-Canada trade -- 
which totaled about $250 billion last year and could hit $275 billion in 1994 
-- they are well-publicized here. 
</P>
<P>
 That stems in part from the one-sided nature of the relationship -- almost 80% 
of Canada's trade is with the United States -- and in part from the expectation 
here that adoption of the North American Free Trade Agreement would end such 
disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Americans suggest we have a cap on the amount of wheat we can sell to 
the United States, that doesn't sound like the Yankee free trader we had 
expected," Copps said in an interview last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The announced purpose of the visit by Gore, who was accompanied by his wife, 
Tipper, was to plan for the Summit of the Americas, scheduled for December in 
Miami. Canada wants the summit to focus on economic issues, with an eye toward 
expansion of membership in NAFTA beyond the United States, Canada and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 There also was discussion of a possible visit to Canada by President Clinton, 
but no announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the nearly nine months since Chretien's Liberal Party won a landslide 
election, ending nine years of government by Conservatives Brian Mulroney and 
Kim Campbell, there have been other disagreements with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The most notable have been over Canada's reluctance to back possible military 
action to oust the military dictatorship in Haiti and its gentle urging for an 
end to the U.S.-enforced isolation of Cuba.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When she begins her sixth year of detention today, one of the world's most 
famous political prisoners probably will follow what her husband once described 
as an "austere and disciplined" regimen. 
</P>
<P>
 At her lakeside home in Myanmar's capital of Yangon, Aung San Suu Kyi, 49, 
will rise before dawn to meditate and listen to the news on shortwave radio.The 
rest of the day, she will read, exercise and do household chores. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, she will listen to music. She is said to prefer classical but 
recently has expressed a fondness for the reggae of the late Bob Marley. 
</P>
<P>
 Suu Kyi, leader of the pro-democracy movement in Myanmar, formerly Burma, and 
winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, was arrested July 20, 1989, under a law 
against "subversive elements." 
</P>
<P>
 Daughter of the country's founding father, Gen. Aung San, who was assassinated 
in the run-up to independence in 1948, she has grown in stature as she 
stoically waits for the junta to deliver on promises of restoring democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, her National League for Democracy won a landslide election victory, 
but the military nullified the results and cracked down on opponents.

 Passengers aboard a cruise ship that may be linked to an outbreak of 
Legionnaire's disease were pulled off the vessel in Bermuda while the water 
system was being flushed, the cruise line said. There are three confirmed cases 
of the disease among passengers who took a recent cruise on the Horizon, owned 
by Celebrity Cruises of Verona, N.J. Health officials said that 10 other 
potential cases are being investigated.Some of those involved people who have 
been on other cruises of the ship. Legionnaire's disease is a form of pneumonia 
transmitted by bacteria in airborne water droplets. The 1,243 passengers were 
taken off the ship in Bermuda for 24 hours while the ship's water was flushed 
at sea and the water system re-chlorinated. They will re-board the vessel this 
morning and return to New York on Saturday, officials said.

SENATE BACKS CASH INSTEAD OF FOOD STAMPS; POVERTY: STATES SEE ADMINISTRATIVE 
SAVINGS. BUT SOME PEOPLE ARGUE THAT CHILDREN MAY GO HUNGRY BECAUSE PARENTS 
COULD BUY WHATEVER THEY WANTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 States won a victory on Capitol Hill for a critical element of anti-poverty 
policy Tuesday, persuading the Senate to allow them to distribute cash rather 
than food stamps to poor people. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial cash option is popular with many states because it enables 
them to curtail administrative procedures and costs associated with the 
$27-billion food stamp program and provides flexibility to use the savings and 
even the cash payments themselves for welfare reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 But many advocates for the poor and supporters of federal nutrition programs 
ardently oppose the option, arguing that it will cause more children to go 
hungry because their parents will be free to spend the money on items other 
than food. Food stamp supporters say the concession could undermine the 
exceptional political support the 33-year-old program enjoys among the public 
and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 An amendment to a $68-billion spending bill for the Agriculture Department and 
other agencies would have banned such "cash-outs" of food stamps. But in 
response to heavy lobbying by governors, the Senate voted, 63 to 34, to strike 
the provision. The House, however, already has passed a version of the bill 
that prohibits states from launching welfare reform demonstrations based on 
cashing out food stamps, so debate on the issue is not over. 
</P>
<P>
 Governors had sent letters to all senators urging them to continue to permit 
states the flexibility to use any remaining parts of their federal payments for 
food stamps to help reform their welfare systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Senate should embrace and encourage rather than prohibit state and local 
initiatives that will better serve needy Americans and help break the grinding 
cycle of poverty and dependence," Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, however, said cash payments have potentially dire consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Providing cash instead of coupons will increase the number of hungry children 
in America," Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Agriculture 
Committee, said during the debate. "I am worried that food stamp cash-out will 
leave poor families even poorer. I am worried that landlords will just raise 
rents, knowing that their tenants have additional cash." 
</P>
<P>
 McCain responded that such views have helped create a welfare system that 
encourages dependency, contributing to its unpopularity among taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that some advocates do not like the idea of cash-outs and wage 
subsidies because they fear that poor families will not or cannot make the 
proper spending choices if empowered to do so," he said. "To me, this kind of 
paternalism is at the core of our troubled welfare system." 
</P>
<P>
 States have had the cash option in the past but it has become increasingly 
popular as federal and state governments have begun trying to overhaul programs 
for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight states, including California, already have been given permission by the 
Agriculture Department to make cash payments instead of distribute food stamps 
in certain counties. Some states are experimenting with giving the food stamp 
money to employers to supplement wages of poor workers. Others are offering 
people on welfare a chance to get cash instead of food stamps if they go to 
work. Still others simply send poor recipients cash rather than food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a dozen other states have requests for the option pending and several 
others are preparing applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies of the experiments have found that, when given cash instead of food 
stamps, recipients buy less food. In San Diego County, where all households 
eligible for food stamps have been receiving cash since 1990, their food 
purchases decreased by 7%. In Alabama, a state where cash assistance is much 
lower, food expenditures decreased by nearly 20% when the state opted to offer 
eligible households in three counties cash rather than stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Greenstein, executive director of the liberal Center on Budget and 
Policy Priorities here, said history shows that, if cash replaces food stamps, 
American taxpayer support for the program will die. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1970s, benefits for Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the 
primary welfare program for cash assistance to poor families, "have fallen 45% 
in purchasing power, while food stamp benefits have stayed constant. Why is 
that? The American public is much more willing to support food stamps than cash 
assistance," Greenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has made a point of stressing that he supports states' 
flexibility in designing solutions to welfare reform without excessive 
micromanagement by the federal government. His welfare reform initiative, which 
he introduced earlier this summer, sets a two-year time limit on AFDC benefits 
but not on food stamps.

SHUTTLE ASTRONAUTS MEASURE GROWTH OF THEIR SPINES IN SPACE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Columbia's astronauts measured their spines Tuesday to understand the effects 
of space travel and logged time on an exercise bike as the shuttle's two-week 
mission began to wind down. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hieb and Dr. Chiaki Mukai measured each other's backbone with an 
ultrasound-imaging machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all astronauts, Hieb and Mukai have grown a few inches in space because 
the spine stretches in zero gravity. They have measured their heights every day 
in orbit -- Tuesday was the 11th day of a 14-day flight -- and kept a record of 
back pain, a common ailment among astronauts in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
 Flabby muscles also are a side effect of space travel, which is the reason for 
all the cycling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I plan to ride for about 8,000 miles," Hieb said, referring to the distance 
covered by Columbia, not his feet. "It should take me about 30 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttle is due to land at the space center Friday.

 "There are clear signs the house was broken into while the man was asleep,"

 "It is possible the dog just walked off -- but that's unlikely, as it was

8 MILLION WORKERS AT RISK OF LOST PENSIONS, REICH SAYS; RETIREMENT: THE LABOR 
SECRETARY CALLS FOR LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO FUND THEIR 
PLANS FULLY SO BENEFITS WOULD BE ASSURED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 At least 8 million workers risk losing all or parts of their pensions because 
employers are failing to keep up their payments to assure that benefits will be 
provided, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich told Congress on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Warning that the federal pension guaranty program could be confronted with the 
same kind of multibillion-dollar liability that the government faced in the 
savings and loan crisis, Reich called for legislation to require full funding 
of pension plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Promises are being broken," the Cabinet officer told a House Education and 
Labor subcommittee. "The longer we wait . . . the more people will be hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Reich said some big companies are exploiting loopholes in the federal pension 
law to avoid making contributions that would be adequate to finance future 
pensions for their work forces. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, many workers are being shortchanged or deprived of promised 
retirement payments and the projected deficit of the government's Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corp. is rising rapidly, Reich noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most pension plans are well-funded, he said, highly disturbing trends 
have almost doubled the amount of underfunding from $27 billion in 1987 to $53 
billion five years later. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the deficit of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., the 
government-run insurance program that is intended to assure payment of 
retirement checks, has doubled in the last five years to $2.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Year after year, the gap between pension promises and pension assets has 
widened," Reich testified. "This chronic underfunding can undermine our 
retirement system." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Slate, executive director of the pension guaranty agency, said the 
original federal pension law enacted in 1974 contributed to underfunding 
because it allowed companies to pay for pensions over a period of 30 to 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies can utilize credits and offsets and set actuarial assumptions so 
that contributions are minimized," Slate said. "Fully within the law, many 
employers have been able to make little or no pension contributions, even 
though their plans are severely underfunded." 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 1.2 million workers and retirees now receive benefits from 
financially troubled firms that are not making proper pension payments, Reich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pension problem is concentrated in major industries -- steel, auto, rubber 
and airlines -- that once were financially powerful but have become less 
profitable in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Sharon Steel Co. closed its manufacturing operations and 
terminated its five pension plans at a time when they were underfunded by $250 
million. Although the federal pension guaranty program will pay full benefits 
for most of the 7,000 retired Sharon workers, about 1,200 will get only partial 
pensions because not all of their benefits were covered by the federal 
guarantee. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a 55-year-old retired worker who had been getting $860 a month 
now will receive less than $500 a month because of the underfunding, Reich 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a related issue, Reich said the Clinton Administration does not favor 
action now to guarantee the pensions of retired workers who receive annuities 
from insurance companies. Underfunding of pensions is a more serious problem 
that should be addressed first, he said, because states that regulate insurance 
firms also have pension guarantee programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Assn. of Retired Persons urged Congress to broaden the 
responsibilities of the federal pension program to include annuities, arguing 
that failure to do so would leave "a gaping hole" in the federal safety net for 
pensioners. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recent failure of several large insurance companies, particularly 
Executive Life Insurance Co. of California, has underscored a giant omission in 
the federal framework protecting defined benefit pensions," AARP spokesman 
Dudley Lesser said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the state of California took over the failed firm, the retirement 
benefits of those receiving annuities were slashed by 30%, he said, indicating 
the inadequacy of state backup funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.), chairman of the subcommittee considering the 
legislation, indicated that he is prepared to act on the annuity issue as well 
as the underfunding of pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in Congress must take steps to protect the blameless," he said. Pension 
Safeguards 
</P>
<P>
 Although most pension plans are well-funded, the amount of underfunding has 
nearly doubled since 1987. If you suspect mismanagement of your fund: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ask your employer for a copy of Form 5500, a report your plan must file 
periodically with the Labor Department. This will tell you how your pension 
assets are invested, whether they are adequately diversified and whether the 
plan is getting a decent return on its investment. But the forms can be 
technical. If necessary, ask a financial adviser for an interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check with your employee benefits representative if you have questions or 
concerns about your plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * Obtain information on pension rights in general by sending for the Guide to 
Understanding Your Pension Plan (document D13533), available free from American 
Assn. of Retired Persons. The address: AARP Fulfillment, 601 E St., N.W.,

 Democratic Gov. Zell Miller easily won renomination in a primary election 
while millionaire Guy Millner was headed for a runoff in a five-way race for 
the chance to be the state's first GOP governor since Reconstruction.Millner, 
an Atlanta businessman in his first bid for office, didn't capture the 50% vote 
total needed to avoid a runoff Aug. 9. He will face former Waycross Mayor John 
Knox, who pitched his campaign to the party's right wing. In other races, Rep. 
Newt Gingrich, the House minority whip, defeated political newcomer Bob Terrell 
in a GOP primary in Atlanta's northern suburbs.

NEW STUDY FINDS RECORD 1 IN 3 AMERICANS SERIOUSLY OVERWEIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One in three American adults is now seriously overweight, the highest number 
ever reported, a new government study says. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of overweight Americans jumped an unprecedented 8% in 11 years, the 
National Center for Health Statistics reported.That figure translates to 58 
million people who face an increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and other 
chronic ailments because they weigh at least 20% more than the ideal body 
weight for their age, height and sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The study said Americans' average body weight jumped about eight pounds 
between 1980 and 1991. The typical 5-foot-4-inch woman is about 25 pounds 
overweight and the average 5-foot-10-inch man carries about 30 pounds too much. 
</P>
<P>
 The new figures, drawn from the third National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey, show that not only are more Americans overweight, but also 
"the average body weight is increasing," said Robert J. Kuczmarski, lead author 
of the report, which appears in today's Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The information comes from a national survey of a representative sample of the 
U.S. population. It was conducted from 1988 to 1991 and involved 8,260 
Americans, age 20 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous surveys showed a 1% increase in the number of overweight Americans 
from 1960 to 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional studies have hinted at an increase in the number of overweight 
Americans. But the scope and rapidness of the increase caught researchers by 
surprise, particularly given the recent popularity of lower-fat foods and the 
increased attention to exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that the highest proportion of overweight Americans are 
women, with 35% above the ideal body weight, compared with 31% of men. Also, 
the number of overweight adults continues to increase with age until about 50 
to 59 years, when it then starts to decrease.

CLINTON VOWS TO KEEP VACCINE INITIATIVE; HEALTH: ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS 
DEFEND PROGRAM BROUGHT INTO QUESTION BY GAO. THEY SAY EFFORT TO BOOST 
IMMUNIZATION RATES CAN START ON TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration vowed Tuesday to press ahead with its embattled 
preschool vaccination initiative even as lawmakers released a congressional 
report raising fundamental questions about the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no time to reverse course," Health and Human Services Secretary Donna 
Shalala said at a news conference called to respond to the report by the 
General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm. "Congress and the 
President have set a course and our goal is within reach." 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO report questioned whether the Vaccines for Children program could 
begin on time, assure the integrity of highly sensitive vaccines and achieve 
its goal of boosting immunization rates by expanding the distribution of free 
vaccine. Four members of Congress who released the assessment promised to seek 
to delay the start of the program or scrap it entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 But a short time later, a phalanx of senior Administration officials defended 
the $500-million-a-year plan and expressed confidence that they can meet the 
Oct. 1 starting date. The program would expand the purchase of discounted 
vaccines and distribute nearly one-third of the nation's supply through a 
single facility in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Top officials from Health and Human Services and the General Services 
Administration acknowledged that the new program is behind schedule and that it 
will not be "glitch-free" or fully operational in 73 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, they said that delaying implementation would impose a hardship on 
states counting on the new program, could lead to higher prices for vaccines 
and would undercut momentum in the effort to inoculate young children against 
such diseases as measles, mumps, hepatitis and polio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have in place all necessary systems to order, purchase and deliver 
vaccine in a safe and efficacious way," said Dr. David Satcher, director of the 
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "We are confident that we 
will be ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The dueling congressional and Administration news conferences -- during which 
all parties maintained that their prime concern was to immunize at least 90% of 
all children by the age of 2 -- were the first round in what looms as a 
three-day struggle over the immediate fate of the vaccination program. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dale Bumpers (D-Ark.), a longtime immunization advocate, said that the 
Administration would be "foolish in the extreme" to proceed on schedule. When 
the Health and Human Services spending bill for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 
comes before the Appropriations Committee today, he said he will propose 
legislation to prohibit funds from being spent on the program until a later 
date or until congressional concerns have been allayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bumpers also plans a hearing Thursday on the GAO report, at which 
Administration officials plan to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 The new program, which was touted by President Clinton as his first domestic 
policy initiative, will provide free vaccines to private physicians to immunize 
Medicaid recipients who are children, uninsured children and Native Americans. 
In addition, children whose insurance does not cover vaccines will be eligible 
if they get their shots at a federally approved community health center or 
rural clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, doctors in each state will place vaccine orders with state 
agencies, which will approve and forward them to the CDC. The agency will then 
transmit them to manufacturers or to a distribution center in Burlington, N.J., 
operated by the GSA. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaccines may be shipped from manufacturers directly to doctors and public 
health clinics or from the warehouse to the states, which would then distribute 
them to local doctors and clinics. Currently, private doctors and states can 
order vaccines directly from manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO report noted that all those covered under the new program already can 
receive free vaccinations from public health clinics and that most recent 
studies "indicate that vaccine cost is not an important barrier." The auditors 
said that the new program is likely to benefit only children without insurance 
who will now be able to get their shots from private doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 More important impediments, the GAO said, include education of physicians in 
private practice and at public clinics, the availability of public health 
facilities and the "lack of knowledge and awareness of the vaccine schedule on 
the part of parents." Administration officials said that they are addressing 
these factors as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO said that only four of 15 contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
to buy vaccines at discounted prices have been awarded, that states have only 
begun to enroll private physicians in the program and that accounting 
mechanisms are lacking to detect misuse, fraud or abuse. The agency also 
expressed concern that the government does not have enough time before Oct. 1 
to develop and test packaging and shipping systems, and computer hardware and 
software for tracking vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
 The biologicals, which must be refrigerated at specific temperatures or frozen 
during shipping and storage to retain their potency, will be handled by the 
GSA, which has never transported such pharmaceuticals.

ISRAEL BLAMES IRAN FOR ARGENTINE BOMBING; TERRORISM: RABIN CALLS ON WORLD TO 
CRACK DOWN ON ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS. MORE THAN 70 PEOPLE STILL MISSING IN BUENOS 
AIRES BLAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Tuesday blamed radical, Iranian-backed 
Islamic groups for bombing a Jewish community center in Argentina and called on 
the world to mount a campaign to "strike at this viper and crush its skull." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin said Israeli intelligence received warnings that Hezbollah, an 
Iranian-sponsored Muslim group, would seek revenge somewhere in the world for 
"blows it had suffered from the Israeli army in Lebanon" and that "it is clear 
where the trail leads" from Monday's bombing in Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 The Argentine government said at least 26 people were killed and 127 injured 
Monday when the blast transformed a seven-story building -- which had as many 
as 200 people in it at the time -- into a heap of mangled steel and masonry. 
Jewish leaders in Buenos Aires reported late Tuesday that the death toll had 
climbed to 34, with 147 people hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion destroyed nearby cars and heavily damaged businesses as far as a 
block away. 
</P>
<P>
 Wire service reports indicated that, as of Tuesday, more than 70 people were 
still unaccounted for at the site, where three survivors had been pulled from 
the wreckage overnight. Rescuers freed a fourth victim whose legs were pinned 
for 31 hours under the rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world community must actively organize operations, cooperate both with 
respect to secure intelligence and in actions against the extremist Muslim 
terrorist groups," Rabin said, reacting to the Buenos Aires bombing. "If this 
is not done, I fear that we will be victimized each time that those who wish to 
attack do so. . . . They have these capabilities, and they are deployed around 
the world." 
</P>
<P>
 A special concern for Israel, Rabin said, are Jews who live in other countries 
where they could become targets for revenge attacks against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "This again underscores the commonality of Jewish fate," he said. "It 
obligates the countries in which Jews live to take appropriate steps for 
increasing security for Jews, certainly in those countries where a radical 
Islamic terrorist infrastructure exists." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, speaking to his Parliament, vowed, "The 
government of Israel will never forget and will never forgive those who carry 
out these attacks and those who assist them." 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, Rabin dispatched 
Israeli intelligence agents and police bomb specialists to help with the 
investigation and to begin the hunt for those responsible. Israel also sent 
military rescue specialists to aid in the search for survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Menem, who blamed the bombing on outsiders, added that it is possible that 
"minuscule" Argentine elements helped. He also speculated that Islamic 
fundamentalists bent on destroying the Middle East peace process carried out 
the attack, Reuters news service said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press quoted him as saying that an Iraqi man carrying an 
expired Brazilian passport was detained Monday night while trying to cross the 
border to Brazil in Paso de los Libres, about 620 miles north of Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres also blamed Iran for the Buenos Aires bombing. "Iran with its lies, 
hostility and hatred is trying to turn the Jewish people into a collective 
Salman Rushdie," Peres said, referring to the death sentence pronounced by Iran 
on the British author. "It is a terrible regime, and I am sure it will cause 
more trouble in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 In Tehran, the Iranian Foreign Ministry denied any involvement in the bombing 
at the headquarters for Argentina's two main Jewish organizations: the 
Argentine Israelite Mutual Assn., a social aid group, and the Delegation of 
Argentine Israelite Assns., an umbrella group for Jewish organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Iranian spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi was quoted by Tehran Radio as condemning 
"terrorist acts against innocent people from any religion and nationality." 
</P>
<P>
 Brig. Gen. Yigal Pressler, Rabin's adviser on terrorism, said concerted action 
was now needed to avert future attacks. "The answer to attacks of the type that 
occurred in Argentina is not defensive activity," Pressler said. "Another 
fence, another roadblock, another guard will not help. 
</P>
<P>
 "The countries of the world must cooperate intensively to foil Iranian and 
Islamic terrorism," he said. "It is essential to penetrate them, to collect 
intelligence, to uncover intentions and to foil attacks. Cooperation among 
countries should be tightened, and this matter must take on significance and 
importance." 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Neriah, a retired Israeli intelligence officer and a former Rabin 
adviser on Arab countries, said that "what goes on between ourselves and 
Hezbollah cannot be settled except by a broad consensus in our relations with 
Syria and Lebanon. This issue needs to be brought up in the negotiations." 
</P>
<P>
 Neriah also warned that, in planning its operations against Hezbollah and 
other radical groups in Lebanon, the Israeli army "must take into account that 
the reaction might not necessarily be made at an Israeli target, but could be 
made against any Jewish target." 
</P>
<P>
 Although noting that the protection of Jews in other countries is the 
responsibility of those governments, Pressler and other Israeli officials 
indicated that considerable thought is being given here on providing more 
security advice to Jewish communities abroad.

 Islamic militants shot and killed an Israeli army lieutenant in an ambush 
Tuesday along the Egypt-Gaza Strip border, the army said. 
</P>
<P>
 Izzidin al-Qassam, the armed wing of the Muslim fundamentalist group Hamas, 
claimed responsibility for the attack and called it a response to Sunday's 
riots by thousands of Palestinians barred from jobs in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The slain officer was identified as Guy Ovadia, 23, a deputy company 
commander. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian police later arrested three Hamas members, Palestinian sources 
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas has said it will not use violence against the new Arab authority in the 
self-rule areas, but will continue its attacks on Israeli soldiers and Jewish 
settlers.

CAUSE OF VEGAS SIGN'S COLLAPSE IS UNKNOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Engineers on Tuesday sifted through the debris of what had been billed as the 
world's tallest sign, trying to determine why the $4-million structure crumpled 
during a vicious storm. 
</P>
<P>
 The top quarter of the 362-foot-tall sign atop the Las Vegas Hilton came 
crashing to the ground Monday night as winds of 78 m.p.h. raked the Las Vegas 
Valley. The marquee was designed to withstand winds of 130 m.p.h., a 
spokeswoman for the builder said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're absolutely baffled," said Linda Kring of John Renton Young Lighting & 
Sign Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm dumped up to 1.23 inches of rain on some areas of the valley, caused 
power outages affecting more than 100,000 customers, and left at least a dozen 
people with minor injuries from falling limbs and blowing debris. 
</P>
<P>
 The most severe damage was at the Hilton, where the top portion of the giant 
marquee lay in a 30-foot-high pile of twisted steel and rubble. The debris fell 
on a sidewalk leading to the front of the 3,000-room resort, but no injuries 
were reported. Police canine units were dispatched to the scene Monday night to 
make sure no victims were buried in the debris. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers combed through the wreckage and checked inside the damaged sign 
Tuesday, seeking clues to the cause of the collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Although winds were clocked officially at 78 m.p.h., Kring questioned whether 
they may have been higher at the top of the sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's the question about possible wind shear at the top of the sign," she 
said. "What happened at the 362-foot height is what we are trying to 
determine." 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton spokeswoman Joanne Eshow said no damage estimate was available. She 
said the sign, which was completed in January, could likely be rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire crews were kept busy as the high winds blew down power lines and uprooted 
trees, igniting fires in many locations. One home was destroyed.

GUNMAN SHOT BY POLICE AFTER 5-HOUR STANDOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A gunman who fired a high-powered rifle at least 40 times inside an apartment 
was shot Tuesday after a nearly five-hour standoff with police. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged gunman, identified as Gerome Rogers, 24, of East Palo Alto, 
suffered multiple gunshot wounds, according to police. He underwent surgery at 
San Jose Hospital and was reported in fair condition, a hospital spokeswoman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police shot Rogers about 9 a.m. as he tried to flee the Skyway Apartment 
complex while firing at police, Officer Louis Quezada said. Rogers was armed 
with a handgun and an assault rifle, Quezada said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another man, identified as Darrin L. Mays-Hoskins, 24, of Menlo Park, also was 
wounded. Police said Mays-Hoskins was shot in the foot during the standoff, but 
do not know how the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Mays-Hoskins was flushed out of the apartment with tear gas about 10 a.m. 
Police do not know what role, if any, he played in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Mays-Hoskins also was taken to San Jose Hospital; his condition was not 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrived at the south San Jose complex about 4:30 a.m. and evacuated 
about 200 units after hearing shots fired, Quezada said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Bob Beams said Dorothy Cozine, who identified herself as Rogers' mother, 
had called police and said her son was acting strangely. Cozine told police on 
the scene that her son was armed, Beams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents on both sides of the apartment said bullets pierced their walls, 
injuring at least one person. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured man, David Smalley, said he and his mother barricaded themselves 
in their kitchen after hearing gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hiding behind the refrigerator because we're right next door to him. 
We're trying to get as many walls between us as we can," Smalley said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least eight bullets came through the walls of Smalley's apartment, he said. 
One of them nicked him in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were unsure what prompted the shooting. But Smalley's roommate, Brent 
Holderman, said he was awakened by a man and woman arguing. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the incident, the man who lived next door had been quiet, Holderman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never spoke to them. They kept to themselves," he said.

WORKER DIES IN COLLAPSE OF FREEWAY SOUND WALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A quake-damaged freeway sound wall being razed by a construction crew 
collapsed Tuesday night in the San Fernando Valley, killing one worker and 
injuring at least one other, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred at 7:28 p.m. along the Branford Street on-ramp to the 
southbound Golden State freeway, Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian 
Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said a private construction crew had been dismantling a wall, 
unbolting the 12-foot-high concrete panels from their foundations for removal 
by a crane. Humphrey said it appeared that the wall had been completely 
unbolted but not yet attached to the crane when it suddenly toppled, crushing 
one worker -- a man about 25 years old -- and injuring a second man. 
</P>
<P>
 One worker was declared dead at the scene. The other was taken to Pacifica 
Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley, where he was listed in good condition 
with minor back and leg injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Names of the victims were being withheld pending notification of families.

WHITE HOUSE SHIELDS WHITEWATER DATA, LEACH SAYS; INQUIRY: CLINTON CRITIC 
CONTENDS THE ACTION WILL LIMIT THE SCOPE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS. THE 
ADMINISTRATION SEES HIS COMPLAINT AS POLITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A leading Republican critic of President Clinton's handling of the Whitewater 
controversy complained Tuesday that the White House is restricting 
congressional access to documents and other evidence in an effort to limit the 
scope of next week's hearings in the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.), Rep. Jim Leach 
(R-Iowa) said the restrictions mean that the hearings will cover just 2% to 3% 
of the issues involved in the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings -- which will be conducted by the House Banking, Finance and 
Urban Affairs Committee and its Senate counterpart, the Banking, Housing and 
Urban Affairs Committee -- will focus on the Washington aspects of Whitewater. 
Those issues include some of the questions raised by last July's suicide of 
White House Deputy Counsel Vincent Foster, and the controversial series of 
meetings between staff members of the White House and Treasury Department over 
the federal investigation into a failed Arkansas savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic leadership in Congress has agreed to a request from Whitewater 
special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. to limit the hearings to issues on which 
Fiske has already concluded his investigation. Fiske has said he has not 
completed his review of actions of White House officials immediately after 
Foster's death, when they conducted their own search of his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach complained in his memo that, if the hearings cannot deal with that 
aspect of the Washington side of Whitewater, then the "most important part of 
the investigation, which the majority has allowed us to consider, appears to be 
eliminated from these hearings." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Leach argued that evidence related to the White House and 
Treasury contacts was being overly censured by the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both the White House and Treasury have produced heavily redacted (blacked 
out) documents to the committee based on their own internal determinations," 
Leach wrote in his memo, which was sent to Michel and to Leach's Republican 
colleagues on the House banking panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach said that, at the request of White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler, the 
banking panel chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), has "implemented 
unprecedented document control procedures that are intended to shield the vast 
majority of documents from public disclosure" at the hearings. "It should be 
noted that the documents involved do not impact on an ongoing prosecution and 
do not relate in any manner to personal financial privacy interests." 
</P>
<P>
 A White House spokesman dismissed Leach's complaints Tuesday. "It has, of 
course, been acknowledged by special counsel and others that the White House's 
cooperation with the Whitewater investigation has been both broad and thorough. 
And when congressman Leach complains about our document production, that's 
politics," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Black, a spokeswoman for Gonzalez, refused to comment on Leach's 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater Development Corp. was a failed Ozarks real estate project jointly 
owned by James B. McDougal and then-Arkansas Gov. Clinton and his wife, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton. McDougal also owned Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, an 
Arkansas thrift that was seized by federal regulators in 1989.

 Chicago leads three other cities in the quest to host the 1996 Democratic 
National Convention, but party Chairman David C. Wilhelm cautioned Tuesday, 
"It's not a done deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm said in a telephone interview that negotiations with Chicago officials 
are "further along than any other city" vying for the convention -- San 
Antonio, New Orleans and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilhelm, who managed President Clinton's 1992 campaign, declined to specify 
what the unresolved issues are. But he said negotiations with Chicago officials 
needed to be completed before he could forward any recommendation to Clinton, 
who has the final choice on where the convention will be held. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not made the decision" on a recommendation, Wilhelm said. "I have not 
communicated any such decision to the President." 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that party officials were not talking to representatives 
of the three other cities "in the same way that we are with Chicago."

DISNEY GARAGE FUNDING PLAN FACES CHALLENGE; TRANSPORTATION: FEDERAL OFFICIALS 
QUESTION THE FACILITY'S VALUE. MONEY FOR MAJOR FREEWAY WORK IS NOW UNDER 
SCRUTINY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The planned construction of a giant parking garage across from Disneyland has 
threatened federal funding for a major transit project linking the San Diego 
and Costa Mesa freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials are challenging the Orange County Transportation Authority's 
decision in 1993 to include the seven-story parking structure in the 
$424-million transit project, which would connect the two freeways with 
car-pool lanes and new ramps. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of letters obtained by The Times, the Federal Transit 
Administration has questioned the value of the Disneyland garage to transit 
commuters. The administration further expressed concern that building the 
garage has caused local transit officials to scale back plans to expand bus and 
other services included in the original transitway project. 
</P>
<P>
 "By deferring park-and-ride lots and bus expansion, much of the transit 
benefits of the original proposal would be postponed indefinitely," the federal 
agency said in a January letter to local transportation officials. "If OCTA 
remains committed to including (the garage) in the proposed federal project, 
please provide FTA with an analysis of the transit benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute started in December, 1993, when, nine months after federal 
officials had approved in concept the transitway project, the local authority 
unexpectedly added the Disney garage to the project at an additional cost of 
$223 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Before adding the parking facility to the project, the authority had hoped to 
receive $318 million in federal funds to pay for the highway improvements, 
which, besides the car-pool lanes and ramps, also consists of park-and-ride 
facilities and the purchase of 361 express buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides federal money, funding from Measure M and the state would go toward 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Local transit officials wanted to use $131 million of the $318 million in 
federal funds toward the Disney garage. However, surprised federal officials 
said they expected the $131 million to be used for constructing park-and-ride 
facilities and the purchase of buses -- not a garage. 
</P>
<P>
 The local agency, considering the garage as a transit facility complete with 
express bus service and park-and-ride spaces, thought it belonged as part of 
the "San Diego/Costa Mesa Freeway Transitway" project. 
</P>
<P>
 However, earlier this year the federal officials balked at the garage having 
been added to the project, and suddenly questioned the project's overall value. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal agency noted that of the 12,000 spaces in the garage, only 1,000 
would be available for commuters, and in a letter last month to the country 
transportation authority objected that the garage appears to be intended 
"primarily for Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials also charged that adding the garage had forced local 
transportation officials earlier this year to downsize or delay plans for the 
highway improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, transit administration spokesman Brian Cudahy in Washington said 
the revised transitway project, which includes the garage, "will have to be 
reviewed." 
</P>
<P>
 Cudahy said that federal officials are reviewing whether the local 
transportation agency's request for $318 million in federal funds is too high 
and should be reduced, considering that the agency wants to use part of the 
money for the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a project that already had a shape and dimension to it, and all of a 
sudden the dimension changed," Cudahy said. "This is something that we have to 
deal with." 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of letters beginning in January, federal transit authorities 
questioned the local transportation agency's plans to make the parking 
structure part of the transitway project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the information you (OCTA) have provided, the newly proposed project 
is not as attractive a transit project as the previous project," FTA Regional 
Administrator Stewart F. Taylor said in a Jan. 24, 1994, letter to the local 
transportation agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Gordon J. Linton, administrator of the federal transit agency, was 
more blunt in a letter to the local transportation authority. "The key factor 
is that FTA can only support a viable transit project," Linton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an April 12, 1994, letter to the local authority, Taylor said federal 
officials would need more information about the "redefined project" before 
agreeing to approve federal funds for the transitway. 
</P>
<P>
 "FTA needs additional project justification and financial information on the 
redefined project in order to rate the proposal for (federal funding)," Taylor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Mills, chief deputy at OCTA, denied Tuesday that the transitway project 
has been fundamentally changed because the garage was added to the project. The 
structure is planned for Clementine Street, between Freedman Way and Katella 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But she did acknowledge that funding problems caused by the poor economy have 
forced the authority to eliminate permanently one of three ramps from the 
transitway and defer the purchase of 151 express buses for the lanes after 
deciding to build the garage. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the county transit agency has postponed by eight years to 2008 
the construction of 7,759 park-and-ride spaces to be used by transitway users. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason is that circumstances have changed since the plans (for the 
transitway) were developed in 1989," Mills said. "The revenues we projected to 
receive from sales tax went down. We were expecting significant growth in 
ridership, but we hit the recession and that went down as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Mills said the agency still plans to follow the original plan for the 
transitway but on a "different implementation schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue to meet our (construction plans), albeit on a different 
timeline because of the factors I mentioned," Mills added. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that OCTA officials have explained the situation to federal officials 
in two meetings earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still expect to get the $318 million we asked for. The FTA doesn't make 
funding decisions. That's done by Congress. True, the FTA does make funding 
recommendations and administers the funds, but we still expect to receive the 
money we asked for," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the local transportation agency's decision to include the Disney 
garage in the transitway project has generated confusion in Washington. Local 
officials estimated the cost of the garage at $223 million -- more than half 
the cost of the original transitway project -- and said they expected to 
receive $131 million in federal funds for the garage alone. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's included with the transitway in terms of a funding request to Congress, 
but we've separated the two projects," said Mills. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mills, local officials expected to use $131 million of the $318 
million they hoped to get in federal funds for the Disney garage. However, 
federal officials said they expect the $131 million to be used for constructing 
park-and-ride facilities and the purchase of buses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position is that we expect to make up the $131 million in long-term 
revenue from the parking garage, which we will then use to build the 
park-and-ride facilities and buy new buses," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, federal officials remain opposed to the garage, and questioned the 
local transportation agency's ability to finance the construction of the 
transitway and garage at the same time.

A MAJOR DISCOVERY KIDS LEARN TO LOVE SCIENCE IN HANDS-ON PROGRAM OFFERED AT UC 
IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 Pilar Rodriguez might not wear a tan fedora or faded leather jacket, but you 
can call her Indiana Jones anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilar, 10, and classmates from several elementary, middle and high schools are 
learning about archeology this week by digging for shards of pottery at a pit 
on the UC Irvine campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dream is to find a whole new animal that's never been discovered!" said 
Pilar, who is participating in the Kids Investigating and Discovering Science 
program at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 About 180 children from second through 10th grades are learning about 
Mesoamerican civilizations through the three-week bilingual program, which 
offers mainly Latino students from 10 Santa Ana schools -- and a sprinkling of 
others in Southern California -- a chance to discover science. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was started four years ago by UCI Prof. Eloy Rodriguez, who wanted 
to encourage Latino children, especially girls, to pursue science. Rodriguez 
has left UCI for a teaching position this fall at Cornell University, but the 
program will continue in his absence, teachers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the start of this year's program, which ends Friday, teachers bought an 
assortment of Aztec-style knickknacks from Tijuana, shattered them in pieces 
and buried them in a vacant campus area. Later, students excavated the pieces, 
measured and plotted their locations, and talked in class about how items like 
pots and fetishes were used by ancient peoples. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers really have noticed a difference among these kids when they look at 
their interest in science later," associate director Nydia Hernandez said. 
"It's all hands-on, which keeps them interested."  
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, eight sixth- and seventh-graders stooped under a canvas 
tent and scraped at the earth. They dug a patch of clay soil near the corner of 
Bridge and Mesa roads, recording on paper maps every pottery chunk they found. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauro Salgado, a seventh-grader from Lathrop Intermediate School, hit pay dirt 
when he dug into the middle of a square earthen patch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah! I found something!" he yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally," said Pilar, relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauro brushed away the dirt and uncovered a terra cotta Mayan doll head. He 
pulled out a ruler, plunging it down in the soil to measure how deeply the 
piece was embedded. "Twenty-five centimeters!" he exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Maldonado, a 20-year-old teacher assistant and UCI junior, said the 
students also learn subjects such as physics and math while digging for 
artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They take what they've found back to the classroom," said Maldonado, who grew 
up in Santa Ana. "They make drawings of the pieces, write descriptions, and 
write what they think people may have used the things for." 
</P>
<P>
 In another classroom, Pico Rivera science teacher Tony Sandoval showed a group 
of second-graders -- all wearing crisp, white lab coats -- how to use pulleys 
to lift heavy weights. People used pulleys to lift the heavy boulders needed to 
construct pyramids in Mesoamerica, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Rodriguez, a Santa Ana teacher, then translated Sandoval's words into 
Spanish. Several of the children said " ohhhhh " in understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said using Spanish puts children at ease. "We don't want kids not to 
learn the material because of language barriers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It costs about $600 to teach each student, said Crystal Ricaporte, who 
coordinates the program budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is funded by a $98,850 grant from American Honda Foundation and 
about $10,000 from the National Science Foundation, Ricaporte said. Two other 
teaching projects provide teacher assistants for the program, she said, and the 
Santa Ana Unified School District lends its buses. Manuel Gomez, UCI associate 
vice chancellor for academic affairs, also contributes funds from UCI, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers include parents in the lesson plan to strengthen home teaching. 
Parents often meet in libraries at night to go over homework, and attend 
seminars where they learn about financial aid available for teen-agers to 
attend college. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, the associate director, said she is particularly concerned with 
encouraging young women to discover science -- so organizers recruited many 
Latina teachers to serve as role models. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the program starts each year, teachers ask each child to draw a picture 
of a scientist. In last year's class, "all the girls drew males," Hernandez 
said. "But by the end of the program, many drew themselves as scientists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though many of the kids are from low-income families," Hernandez said, 
"we let them know they have a chance at education."

RAM BACKERS: REMODEL BIG A, BUILD BALL PARK; SPORTS: GROUP URGES PUBLICLY 
FUNDED UPGRADE OF ANAHEIM STADIUM FOR NFL TEAM, PLUS A NEW BASEBALL FACILITY 
FOR THE ANGELS. THEY SAY TIME PRESSURE WAS A FACTOR IN THEIR DECISION.

 A group of local and political heavyweights who are scrambling to woo the Los 
Angeles Rams from ardent suitors settled on a plan Tuesday that includes 
funding a new baseball, rather than a football, stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 At its weekly meeting, members of "Save the Rams" decided to focus on a 
$50-million to $70-million publicly funded overhaul of Anaheim Stadium for the 
Rams while erecting a public and privately funded new baseball stadium for the 
California Angels nearby, said Newport Beach sports agent Leigh Steinberg, 
co-chairman of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heavy push is going to be toward refurbishment," Steinberg said. 
"Economically, it's easier to fund construction of a new baseball stadium than 
a football stadium. . . . It's not as if the effort to save the Rams might not 
soon be needed for the Angels. This way you have two happy tenants." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said the group was more or less forced to shelve plans for a new 
football stadium after hearing from a representative of a Kansas City-based 
stadium contracting firm Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the tremendous timeline pressure we're under, we came to the reluctant 
conclusion that it's almost impossible to put the numbers together for a new 
(football) stadium," said Orange County Supervisor William G. Steiner, a member 
of a subcommittee looking at new stadium possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are expected to announce if -- and where -- they plan to move before 
the football season starts in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said the county already has explored using revenue bonds, at no cost 
to taxpayers, to finance $60 million of the refurbishment and making 17 acres 
of county land -- the Katella maintenance yard across from The Pond of Anaheim 
-- available for use in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussions were also underway with the city of Orange on Tuesday afternoon 
about building a state-of-the-art training facility directly across the Santa 
Ana River from Anaheim Stadium, Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also is rounding up both corporate and individual investors, 
including Bill Taormina, chairman of Taormina Industries Inc., to buy up to 40% 
of the Rams from owner Georgia Frontiere. A number of investors, both locally 
and outside Orange County, have expressed a firm interest in buying a part of 
the team, worth approximately $150 million, Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good pop of cash to give to her," he said. "It's a way to make us 
competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg also said the group would have to guarantee at least 10,000 to 
15,000 season ticket holders and a substantial number of luxury box commitments 
to sweeten the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams are going to need to see base line ticket sales closer to 55,000 
going to 70,000, instead of the 45,000 they said they drew last year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said the refurbished stadium, with completely reconstructed luxury 
boxes and new sightlines, will not look anything like the bland, functional 
concrete of the current stadium. The group hopes to court local businesses, 
including the Walt Disney Co., to make an entertainment corridor, perhaps 
linked by a monorail to other area attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to re-create the area as an activity center," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group intends to unveil its proposal during an elaborate Ramsfest bash at 
the annual Rams booster luncheon on Aug. 19, Steinberg said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The pace is now about to accelerate," he said. "We're not being Pollyannaish 
about this."

BLOODIED CROWBAR FOUND AT MURDER SUSPECT'S HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A search of the country club home of John Joseph Famalaro -- who has been 
charged with the murder of Denise Huber, a former Northridge woman -- turned up 
a bloodied crowbar Tuesday that police consider a possible murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Still fearing other victims, authorities were successful in tracking down at 
least five of nine women in Southern California and Phoenix whose names 
appeared on a list seized at Famalaro's home. Detectives planned to appeal for 
the public's help today in locating the remainder of the names on the list, 
which included Huber's. 
</P>
<P>
 Court documents filed Tuesday in Arizona indicated that police have seized 
numerous items from Famalaro's home, including articles of women's clothing, 
some of which appear to be stained with blood, a blood-tainted tarpaulin and 
the crowbar that police suspect might be the murder weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Shoults, whose wife, Gloria, was on the list, expressed surprise 
because their only connection with Famalaro was that they had sold him a van 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The police, who called to check on Gloria's well-being, "said that her name 
had turned up on some papers they had found," said Shoults, of Dewey, Ariz. 
"Having somebody like that in your neighborhood I guess does make your hair 
stand up a little bit, because this is generally a quiet area."  
</P>
<P>
 The revelations came days after the body of Huber, 23 at the time of her 
disappearance, was found in a freezer in the back of a stolen rental truck 
parked in Famalaro's driveway. Huber, who had moved to Newport Beach, vanished 
three years ago after she became stranded on the Corona Del Mar Freeway after a 
flat tire. Famalaro, 37, is being held in lieu of $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber was believed to have been bludgeoned to death, and a crowbar would be 
consistent with the type of weapon used, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Authorities, who have not ruled out additional suspects, said they want to 
question Famalaro's brother-in-law, Duane Thobe, and Famalaro's brother, 
Warren, in connection with the case. Warren Famalaro is a convicted child 
molester. 
</P>
<P>
 * Police concluded a comprehensive search of Famalaro's home, and expanded 
their search in Orange County, where Famalaro had rented several storage 
lockers and kept the freezer before moving to Arizona. Using axes, rakes and 
shovels, authorities Tuesday dug as far down as 10 feet below the surface in 
three areas of Famalaro's home where cadaver-sniffing dogs had signaled the 
possible presence of something, but no new bodies were discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Police visited at least three storage facilities in Orange County Tuesday. 
Costa Mesa Det. Sgt. Jerry Holloway said investigators "are finding some items 
of evidence that we can use," but he declined to elaborate. Investigators have 
also learned that people had been curious about the Ryder truck and the 
extension cord running to it, but that when neighbors and acquaintances of 
Famalaro asked what was in the the freezer, he would reply: "Meat." 
</P>
<P>
 * Investigators are focusing on reconstructing how Famalaro and Huber may have 
come into contact the night of her disappearance, June 3, 1991, and his 
movements since. Although police said Tuesday they believe she was killed in 
Orange County shortly after her abduction and then transported via freezer, it 
may be difficult to fix a time and place of death because of the condition of 
her body.  
</P>
<P>
 The freezer was purchased June 10,1991, a week after Huber disappeared, at a 
Montgomery Ward & Co. store in Orange County, according to documents filed by 
the Yavapai County Attorney's Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are unable to explain why the corpse would have been carted 
around for years after the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what makes this case bizarre -- the way he moves a body around like 
this," said Costa Mesa police Lt. Ron Smith. "It doesn't make any sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Piecing together what little they have, police suspect Huber was killed, 
stored in the freezer in a Laguna Hills storage bin for a year, then moved to a 
San Clemente storage facility, where it was kept in about a year and a half, 
before being transported to Famalaro's Prescott Country Club home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Law enforcement sources alternately discounted and were intrigued by the 
theory that Famalaro may have lured Huber to her death by posing as a law 
enforcement officer. Two phony Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department shirts 
were among the numerous items seized from his home. Both shirts had hand-made 
replicas of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's official patches sewn on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa's Lt. Smith said he thought Huber was "too smart to fall for such a 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that weighs against that theory is that it's very unusual to have a 
uniformed officer with long hair and a beard," Smith said, adding that everyone 
police have interviewed said Famalaro has sported a beard and mustache for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Other law enforcement sources found the bogus-police theory credible, as did 
Huber's family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe that Denise would get in a car with a stranger," Ione 
Huber, Denise's mother, said. "This makes sense. She would trust someone in a 
uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery of the list of names initially fueled speculation that the murder of 
Huber could be one in a string of multiple killings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is far from over," said Yavapai County Sheriff's spokeswoman Laurie 
Berra. "We have to make sure we don't have additional victims."

<P>
 Famalaro's attorney, Lawrence William Katz, attacked the strength of the case 
against his client and the media coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a serial killer here," Katz said. "This coverage has been 
completely overdone."  
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he fully expects a grand jury to indict Famalaro by Thursday. He 
vowed that he would immediately seek to overturn the indictment on the basis 
that excessive publicity has compromised the grand jury -- the same tactic used 
by O.J. Simpson's lawyers in his murder case.

JUDGE EXCUSES JUROR IN SAMUELS MURDER CASE; COURTS: WOMAN SAYS SHE HAS 'SERIOUS 
QUESTIONS' ABOUT HER ABILITY TO VOTE FOR THE DEATH PENALTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A juror who said she had "serious questions" about her ability to vote for the 
death penalty was dismissed Tuesday from the panel deciding whether Mary Ellen 
Samuels should be executed for murdering her husband and the hit man she hired 
to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid I have lost my credibility with my fellow jurors in my waverings," 
juror Audrey Wilson wrote to Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael Hoff, asking 
him to excuse her from the jury after two days of deliberation.  
</P>
<P>
 "My continued presence has been disruptive to the progress of relevant 
discussions." 
</P>
<P>
 After questioning Wilson at length in his chambers, Hoff excused her and 
appointed an alternate juror to replace her on the panel, which must decide 
whether to recommend that Samuels be executed or sentenced to life in prison 
without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I'm doing the right thing," the judge said in court after dismissing 
the juror. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury was ordered to begin its deliberations anew. There was no immediate 
indication whether the jury had taken any votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Phil Nameth said he was "concerned about any pressure on her, 
based on the fact that the jury may get the impression. . .that they can get 
rid of somebody by pressuring them, bullying them." 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutor Jan Maurizi said the juror took pains in her note to the judge 
to point out that she felt she'd "been treated with fairness and respect by 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 As the trial began in February in Van Nuys Superior Court, attorneys 
questioned Wilson and other prospective jurors extensively about their 
positions on the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the questions routinely asked of jurors in capital cases is whether they 
can set aside their personal feelings and follow what the law says about 
applying the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid I've waffled," Wilson told the judge. "In fact, I'd have to say I 
was really surprised you kept me. I felt I had expressed that I was concerned 
about my ability to perform."  
</P>
<P>
 She added that she still believes "theoretically" in capital punishment, but 
questions whether she can personally cast a vote to execute someone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm undecided and I guess that is frightening to me because I want to be 
sure," she said. "When you get into a situation you discover a lot of things 
about how you feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Although news reporters were excluded from the discussion between Wilson and 
Judge Hoff in his chambers, the court stenographer's notes later were made 
available.  
</P>
<P>
 After deliberating 18 days, the jury convicted Samuels July 1 of two counts of 
first-degree murder with special circumstances that made her eligible for the 
death penalty. The jury found Samuels had masterminded multiple murders, and 
that she had killed for financial gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony during the trial portrayed Samuels as woman who left her husband, 
then plotted his death before the divorce became final to collect his life 
insurance and estate. During the year following his death, she inherited and 
spent $500,000 on parties, limousines, a new Porsche, a condo in Cancun and 
custom clothes from a store called Trashy Lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Samuels, 40, a motion picture camera assistant who worked on the films 
"Lethal Weapon" and "Heaven Can Wait," was shot in the back of the head with a 
16-gauge shotgun on Dec. 8, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 About seven months later, James Bernstein, the 27-year-old reputed drug dealer 
suspected of shooting Samuels, was strangled and dumped in remote Lockwood 
Canyon in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men who admitted killing Bernstein testified that they did so on orders 
from Samuels. They testified under plea bargains in which they pleaded guilty 
to second-degree murder charges and received prison sentences of 15 years to 
life.

SUPERVISORS BACK LIBRARY PARCEL TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Giving up on hope the state Legislature would help with the problem, Los 
Angeles County supervisors Tuesday set out to resuscitate the floundering 
county library system by coming up with a way to impose new property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 By a 3-1 vote, with Supervisor Mike Antonovich opposing, the supervisors 
tentatively endorsed a proposal to raise $30 million annually by charging 
property owners in areas covered by the county library district a maximum fee 
of $30 per parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 The library district, which serves 3.3 million people in 52 cities and the 
unincorporated areas with 87 branch libraries, would use the revenue to restore 
more than $30 million a year in state cutbacks that have forced the county to 
close 10 branches, lay off nearly 300 employees and left dozens of libraries 
open only two or three days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors acted after the failure of a two-year effort to pass state 
legislation to raise the county's library revenues. Those efforts are 
continuing, but even if they succeed, the money would be received too late to 
help the libraries this fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay in state legislation means the county's tax increase is now "the 
only viable option for the libraries," said County Administrative Officer Sally 
Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the county has the authority to create a Mello-Roos district and 
impose the tax in the unincorporated areas, in incorporated cities the tax can 
only be collected if the local government agrees to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, Mello-Roos districts can be created by local governments to 
levy special tax assessments on property, with the money commonly going to 
finance public improvements such as streets and sewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities that refuse to join the tax district would continue to experience 
cutbacks in library hours and services, County Librarian Sandra Reuben said. 
But their refusal could also create headaches for the county in cases where 
residents of a recalcitrant city continued to use a nearby library in the 
unincorporated area without paying for the restoration of services.  
</P>
<P>
 To win support for the proposal, library officials plan to mount an intensive 
lobbying effort, including a series of public meetings in communities from 
Agoura Hills to Lakewood. The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to hold a 
public hearing on the issue Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only eight cents a day," Reuben told the board Tuesday. "We think that's 
a lot of value for that amount of money." 
</P>
<P>
 But Antonovich, whose district includes the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys 
and part of the San Fernando Valley, opposed the proposal, saying residents of 
the library district should be given a chance to register their opinions on the 
tax in an advisory referendum in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Ed Edelman, Gloria Molina and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke declined to 
support such a referendum. Supervisor Deane Dana was absent.  
</P>
<P>
 County officials had long pinned their hopes on several different proposals in 
the Legislature, including a measure -- vetoed last year by Gov. Pete Wilson -- 
which would have allowed the county to tax all residents of the library 
district, including residents of the 52 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly earlier this month rejected by only three votes a bill that would 
have allowed residents of the library district as a whole to vote on whether 
they wanted to pay a library tax. That bill is expected to pass when the 
Legislature reconvenes in August, but would not go into effect for at least a 
year, leaving the libraries short of funds in the meantime.

MANDATORY CHECKS OF 400 BUILDINGS OPPOSED; QUAKES: PANEL CITES COSTS OF 
INSPECTING STEEL FRAME STRUCTURES. IT WANTS MORE STUDY OF REPAIR METHODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Conceding that the problem of quake-damaged steel frame buildings may be more 
intractable than expected, a city panel Tuesday backed away from a proposal for 
costly, mandatory inspections of 400 buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the City Council's Ad Hoc Committee on Earthquake Recovery asked 
for a 30-day study to attempt to reduce the cost after learning the inspection 
charges alone could range from $10,000 to $60,000 per building. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also asked that building and safety officials continue to study the 
repair methods recommended, saying questions remain about whether buildings 
could withstand another major quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the city to ask someone to spend a million dollars for repairs and tell 
them that they may have the same damage if we have the same size quake doesn't 
make sense," Councilman Richard Alarcon told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also asked that housing officials consider devising a plan to 
relocate residents of steel frame buildings if asbestos is found during 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, chairman of the panel, said he is reluctant to require 
repairs when it is not clear how effective they would be in a quake comparable 
to that of Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests conducted at the University of Texas at Austin have found that the 
welding techniques recommended by the city failed when subjected to a simulated 
earthquake of 7.0 magnitude. More recent tests have been more promising but are 
still under review. 
</P>
<P>
 Widespread reports of cracks in welded joints on steel frame buildings shocked 
many engineers because steel frames are designed to bend without breaking in 
the enormous force of a quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, owners of steel frame buildings in the hardest-hit areas 
of the city would be required to inspect at least 10% of the main joints of the 
buildings. The inspections would be required with three months of notification 
by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost could be high because high-rise steel frame buildings can have as 
many as 300 main joints, each of which can cost as much as $2,000 to inspect, 
building officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inspections are completed and reports are filed with the city, repairs 
would have to be completed within one year. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspection program would concentrate on 400 steel frame buildings, 
including about 25 residential buildings, in the San Fernando Valley and West 
Los Angeles, where quake damage was most severe. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the results of the inspections, the city may consider ordering 
inspections of 1,000 more buildings citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson and Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky questioned the need to inspect 10% of 
the joints in each building, saying the cost to some owners may be prohibitive. 
They suggested building and safety officials find a less expensive way of 
assessing damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you need to reduce as much as practical the amount of expense it 
takes," Yaroslavsky told building officials. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related development, the City Council gave the head of the Building and 
Safety Department the power to impose tougher construction standards than those 
currently on the books. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, adopted unanimously, is intended to incorporate proposed upgrades 
into the repair and reconstruction work taking place citywide.

FREEWAY MOTORIST KILLED BY FALLING IRON PIPE; ACCIDENT: TUBES WEIGHING UP TO A 
TON EACH BREAK LOOSE FROM FLATBED TRUCK AND RAIN DOWN FROM OVERHEAD TRANSITION 
RAMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Iron pipes 30 feet long and weighing up to a ton each rained down on the 
Golden State Freeway from an overhead transition ramp Tuesday afternoon, and 
one of them chopped a car almost in half, crushing the driver's head and 
killing him. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people were injured in the freak accident at the point in the northeastern 
San Fernando Valley where the Golden State, Foothill and Antelope Valley 
freeways intersect. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipes broke loose from a flatbed truck on the transition ramp from the 
Foothill Freeway. Eight to 10 of them plunged about 45 feet onto the Golden 
State and Antelope Valley freeways packed with rush-hour traffic, knocking off 
cement chunks from an intermediate transition ramp as they fell. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I could hear was pipes and concrete all around me," said Gary Payne, 43, 
of Valencia, who was driving on the intermediate ramp, sandwiched between the 
upper ramp and the freeway. "I don't know how I made it through." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the pipes, which authorities said were about 18 to 20 inches in 
diameter and weighed about 1,500 to 2,000 pounds apiece, slammed into a white 
Oldsmobile Bravada, knocking off the car's roof, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pipe just sheared it off and opened it like a can of sardines," said Jack 
Gastil of Canyon Country, who was driving his van behind the victim's vehicle 
in the right lane of the northbound Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The impacted car bounced off the concrete center divider of the freeway before 
coming to a rest on its side in the right-hand lanes. The driver's head was 
crushed, Gastil said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was obvious he was dead," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The dead man's identity was not made public pending notification of his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Gastil's van sustained minor front-end damage and he said he was not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred at about 4:15 p.m., said Officer John Manduca of the 
California Highway Patrol. The northbound side of the Golden State Freeway was 
closed for several hours, backing up rush-hour traffic for miles on surrounding 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The pipes fell from a large flatbed truck on the transition ramp from the 
westbound Foothill Freeway to the southbound Golden State, Manduca said. Straps 
or chains holding a load of about 20 of the pipes broke, he said, and many of 
them rolled or bounced over the side of the transition ramp, which arcs high 
over the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The driver is usually responsible for tying down his own load," said Manduca, 
who said the accident was still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver could not immediately halt his truck as the pipes began rolling 
off, Manduca said, and that was why they were dropped over such an extensive 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of them fell past another elevated ramp, which passes under the upper 
ramp but above the Golden State Freeway, from the southbound Golden State to 
the eastbound Foothill freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Several vehicles on the intermediate ramp were hit by debris, but only two 
people were treated for injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Payne said he was driving his pickup truck on the northbound Antelope Valley 
freeway when out of the corner of his eye he saw the pipes falling at him. He 
escaped injury by speeding up, he said, but his front windshield was smashed 
and the sides of his truck dented -- although he isn't sure just what struck 
his vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the pipes landed on the intermediate ramp where Isidro Fernandez, 30, 
of Portersville, was clutching his heart in pain as he sat on the tailgate of 
his pickup truck after a narrow escape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw that pipe coming down and I thought it was going to hit the front of 
the windshield," he said. "I just slammed on the gas." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez was taken to a hospital for treatment of his heart pains, Manduca 
said. The driver of a Toyota pickup truck on the northbound Golden State was 
also hospitalized with moderate injuries after concrete hit his vehicle, 
causing him to swerve into the center divider. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials closed the northbound Golden State and the transition from the 
westbound Foothill freeway to the southbound Golden State while the accident 
was investigated and cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 Northbound rush-hour traffic backed up beyond the Simi Valley Freeway, five 
miles to the south, and freeways and surface roads throughout the area had 
similar backups. 
</P>
<P>
 Manduca said he expected the freeway to remain closed for up to four hours, 
but portions would be reopened as the pipes and wreckage were cleared. 
</P>
<P>
 The death and injury toll could have been much worse, given the volume of 
rush-hour traffic and the number of pipes that fell, said Milton Vrquilla , a 
spokesman for the Los Angeles City Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "For something like this at this time of the day and for the size of these 
pipes, we're lucky we didn't have more damage than we do now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Above the roadway several hours later, the semi-trailer flatbed truck sat 
empty on the left side of the transition road, with debris from the truck's 
bed. Splintered wood and black dirt lined the right side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 By 7:15 p.m., Caltrans workers were using a front-end loader to remove the 
pipe from the northbound side of the freeway to clear the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Webster, a Caltrans regional manager who was supervising the cleanup, 
said the freeway would remain open until crews began working above the main 
road, knocking loose chunks of concrete from the transition roads as well as 
removing sections of mangled guardrail hit as the pipe fell from the truck.

A REAL CATCH-22: TOO MANY FISH FOR ONE BOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAIME ABDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men were plucked from the ocean 14 miles off Dana Point on Tuesday after 
their fishing boat sank, apparently because they had caught too many fish and 
put them all at one end, Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had too many fish and the tail end went awash," Petty Officer Fransico 
Lopez said."The boat went under -- I guess taking all the fish with it unless 
they stuffed fish in their pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 Men and fish were found floating when the Coast Guard arrived at 6:10 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Ron Cochran, 29, of Irvine, owner of the 21-foot boat Ponga , and Darrel 
Beach, 30, of Redondo Beach, made an SOS call at 5:15 p.m. and said the boat 
was taking on water. Within a few minutes after the Coast Guard and two 
helicopters arrived at 6:10 p.m., it had sunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was engulfed rather quickly," Lopez said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was no way to know how many fish they had on board, but it is our 
impression that there were too many fish for that size vessel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said the two men, who were shark fishing, were found on the bow of boat 
but then jumped into the water as it capsized. A helicopter lifted the two from 
the water. A Viking Serenade cruise ship also arrived and offered its help. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither fisherman was injured.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; LIMIT SOUGHT ON AGENCIES' USE OF RANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of law-enforcement agencies that use a shooting range has been 
scrutinized by the Huntington Beach City Council, which wants to limit the use 
of the range by outside agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The range, which opened about 25 years ago at Central Park and is operated by 
the Huntington Beach Police Officers' Assn., currently is used for training 
purposes by more than 30 law-enforcement agencies and other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But some nearby residents and people who use an adjacent racquetball facility 
have complained about the noise created by the firing of weapons and have 
expressed concerns about safety. Some council members have also voiced concerns 
about the noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The range provides an outdoor facility for police officers to get specialized 
training during the day and occasionally at night. For instance, SWAT teams use 
the shooting range to conduct training exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 The public portion of the range was closed a year ago because of safety 
concerns, but there are plans to reopen it after improvements are made. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Police Officer Dennis D. Ford on Wednesday said training is 
necessary to make officers more proficient and that practice is a matter of 
life and death on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford said a sign hanging inside the range master's office sums up the need for 
the facility: "Survival: Practice as if your life depends on it. Because it 
does." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to (practice) especially in today's times," Ford said, adding that 
the location of the shooting range allows local officers to train during work 
time, resulting in cost-savings to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 He said if the facility were to close, officers would have to travel to 
another range in another city or outside the county. He said the city would end 
up paying for overtime costs for officers to train elsewhere and it would mean 
that an on-duty officer would not be readily able to respond to emergency calls 
if they are outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Ed Kerins, vice president of the citizens' group Huntington Beach 
Tomorrow, said he agrees that the gun range is needed to serve Huntington Beach 
police officers, but does not like its location. He also said the number of 
agencies using the facility should be restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach City Council on Monday approved a revised 20-year lease 
agreement with the police association to give the city control of the outside 
agencies that use the gun facility. Under the agreement, the association would 
make improvements to minimize noise and enhance safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Dave Sullivan said he wanted the city to have more control of 
outside agencies that use the facility in efforts to minimize noise to the 
surrounding neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "My intent is not to have an unlimited use by outside agencies and to have 
some control by the city," Sullivan said. "It would be irresponsible for the 
council to give up all oversight or control on what outside groups come in to 
use the gun range." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Orosco, general manager of the shooting range, said that "we can only 
accommodate so many people and any improvements are not going to increase the 
number of agencies who use the range." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Wright, president of the police association, said his group will 
consider the revised lease and decide whether to continue to operate the range 
or close it. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; CITY WEIGHS PUTTING LIENS ON TAX BILLS

 Out more than $400,000 for clearing debris from lots burned in the massive 
Oct. 27 fire, the city is considering placing liens on fire victims' property 
tax bills if they don't pay for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, responding to what Deputy City Manager Cindy King called a 
"rather critical issue," will hold a public hearing Thursday at 6:30 p.m. to 
consider the assessment and allow property owners to protest the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 King said the city sent 282 invoices to fire victims reminding them of the 
debt, but only 98 of them reimbursed the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Mystic Hills property owner Adele Hofmann said she paid as soon as she 
received the recent notice. "This is just a question of a couple thousand bucks 
for the debris removal or cleanup," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the Oct. 27 fire, which damaged or destroyed more than 400 
homes in and around Laguna Beach, the city hired crews to remove hazardous 
waste such as paint, propane and asbestos from the ravaged lots at a cost of 
$612 per property owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the city gave property owners the choice of removing the remaining 
debris themselves or having the city clear the lots under the provisions of the 
city's nuisance abatement law. The vast majority of people allowed the city to 
do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to residents was $2,000 to $4,000, depending on the size of the lot 
and how difficult it was to clean, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said. Such 
costs are generally covered by private insurance companies, he said. For those 
who could show they had no insurance, the city waived the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Hofmann said she and her neighbors let the city do the work because the cost 
seemed reasonable and the displaced homeowners were "in a state of numbness" at 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "After you lose your house, you're in sort of a state of, 'What do I do and 
where do I begin?' " she said. LESLIE EARNEST

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: COUNCIL HALTS MOVE TO CURB GARAGE SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council took to heart the popular bumper sticker slogan, "I brake for 
yard sales," on Tuesday when a move to drastically curb garage, patio and yard 
sales came to a screeching halt. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure introduced by Councilmen Zev Yaroslavsky and Hal Bernson will be 
sent back to the Planning and Land Use Management Committee, where alternatives 
to the strict restrictions proposed will be explored. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion would have limited sale hours to between 8 a.m. and sundown, and 
the number of sale days to two per week, three days maximum during a six-month 
period. Because the motion is aimed at cracking down on perennial yard sales -- 
rather than the occasional dabbler in the used-stuff business -- the measure 
was seen as too stringent and nearly unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who will be affected by the yard sale restrictions would have been 
people like Shelley Evans of Topanga, who runs a used-book sale every day on 
the corner of Topanga Canyon Boulevard and Cheney Drive, up the road from her 
trailer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't free enterprise the backbone of this country?" asked the 52-year-old 
woman, who supports herself solely on the $20 to $30 she earns each day from 
her book sales. 
</P>
<P>
 With her dog, Tailwagger, at her side and a pack of cigarettes to pass the 
time, Evans has sold used books at the corner for the past six months. Supplied 
to her by a neighbor who shares the profits, she sells the hardcover books for 
about a $1 each, and paperbacks and children's books for 25 or 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said she began her book sale after she lost her Postal Service job. 
Because she was a part-time employee, Evans did not have health insurance. So, 
when she fell ill with a rare, polio-like virus, she spent her entire savings 
on hospital bills and could not get her job back after her long absence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand how the neighbors feel . . . with their $500,000 homes," said 
Evans, who will be moving at the end of the month because some Topanga 
residents complained to her landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it looks kind of funky at the corner like this," said Evans, looking 
over her boxes of cookbooks, reference books and novels. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; WACHS OFFERS REWARD IN WOMAN'S KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police on Tuesday asked the public for help in arresting a man they believe 
killed an innocent North Hills mother in the cross fire of a drug-related 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs has offered a $25,000 reward for the 
arrest and conviction of Renee Hurtado's killer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The killing in cold blood of a 21-year-old mother cradling her 19-month-old 
daughter is one of the most heinous crimes I've heard of," said Wachs, speaking 
at a news conference at the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the arrest of 'Lil Man' is not going to bring Renee Hurtado back, 
but it's going to stop him from striking again." Detective Dan O'Hanian said 
Hurtado's suspected killer, who gunned her down outside a North Hills liquor 
store June 11, has been identified as 20-year-old Chaveliaee Hammond. Hammond's 
street name is 'Lil Man.' 
</P>
<P>
 Hammond, who has also been known to use the last name of Bland, frequents the 
Panorama City area and parts of the West Valley, O'Hanian said. 
</P>
<P>
 The detective said the suspect is also a known drug dealer at the corner of 
Van Nuys Boulevard and Plummer Street in North Hills, where the shooting 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 On the evening of June 11, Hurtado made a purchase at a liquor store at that 
intersection and returned to her car, where her daughter, sister-in-law and 
niece were waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Hurtado put her daughter on her lap, gunfire erupted from the front of 
the car. Two stray bullets tore through the windshield, striking Hurtado. The 
gunshots were apparently intended for a man hiding behind Hurtado's car. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shooting might very well have been about who's going to deal drugs in the 
area," O'Hanian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the suspect may be trying to flee the area and hope the reward 
money, secured by Wachs in a City Council vote Tuesday, will inspire anyone 
with information to call detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Hurtado's family was also hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information on the crime or Hammond's whereabouts is asked to call 
Van Nuys detectives at (818) 756-8377, or after hours at (818) 756-8383. JEFF

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH COSTA MESA; TWO ON SCHOOL BOARD WILL NOT RUN 
AGAIN 
</P>

<P>
 Two Newport-Mesa Unified School District board members whose seats will be 
contested in November have announced that they will not run for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry Loofbourrow and Forrest Werner said they will not seek another 
four-year term on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Loofbourrow, who was first elected in 1981 and who is the president of the 
California School Boards Assn., said she felt it was time to step aside and let 
other people join the board.  
</P>
<P>
 "Serving on the school board is just not something I can continue to do," she 
said. "It's an immense privilege, but it's also a profound burden to serve." 
</P>
<P>
 Werner, who also has served on the board for 13 years, said his family urged 
him not to run again because of the stress the job placed on him.  
</P>
<P>
 "My kids said, 'Hang it up, Dad. You don't need this,"' said Werner, who 
retired last month after two decades as a high school counselor in Garden 
Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Werner said he might change his mind if "a good, qualified candidate" does not 
take out candidacy papers before the Aug. 12 closing date. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two incumbents, Judith Franco and Rod MacMillian, took out candidacy 
papers Monday, the day the filing period opened, according to the county 
registrar of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one other prospective candidate, Corona del Mar High School parent Karen 
Wilson, has taken out filing papers. Wilson has been active in educational 
restructuring at the high school, where her son and daughter are students. LYNN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ALISO VIEJO LAGUNA HILLS; RESIDENTS UPSET BY SCHOOL BUS 
LOT PLANS

<P>
 A plan by the Capistrano Unified School District to place a school bus yard 
here has angered residents, who say parking 100 buses near homes will worsen 
traffic problems and reduce property values. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials in neighboring Laguna Hills also have expressed concern about 
the proposal, saying Laguna Hills residents don't want noisy buses rumbling 
down city streets early in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not necessarily opposed to the bus yard being in Aliso Viejo," said 
Heidi Fisher, who lives near the intersection of Aliso Creek Road and Terrace 
View Drive where the yard is planned for an 8-acre site owned by the district. 
"But we think this is a bad location. There are lots of other more suitable 
plots of ground in Aliso Viejo where there are plans for industrial uses." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Randall, the district's transportation director, said about 100 buses, or 
roughly two-thirds of the district's fleet, would be based at the Aliso Viejo 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall said about 40 of those buses would travel south on Aliso Creek Road to 
service schools in Laguna Niguel, while most of the others would travel major 
Laguna Hills streets, including Oso Parkway and Alicia Parkway, to get to 
schools in Mission Viejo and the foothill communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The district hopes to have the new bus site ready for use by September, 1996. 
The current bus yard, which Randall says cannot accommodate the buses needed 
for the fast-growing district, is in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills City Council members Melody Carruth and Randal J. Bressette said 
they are worried about possible environmental effects from the increased bus 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dave Doomey, who is handling the project for the district, said he 
believes the district will not have to complete an environmental impact report 
because the plan fits with uses described in the Aliso Viejo master plan 
document. LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; VOLUNTEERS SOUGHT TO STUDY LIBRARY SERVICE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city is looking for up to 45 residents to voice their opinions about what 
library services they want in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents would form three focus groups to discuss whether they are 
satisfied with current library services and what improvements they would like. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing residents' opinions is one part of a $24,000 library study being 
conducted by David M. Griffith & Associates for the city.  
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills is one of several cities examining the costs and benefits of 
remaining part of the Orange County Public Library District. The district 
receives $538,000 of the city's annual property tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's concern about library service has been prompted by the county's 
transfer of the branch library in Mission Viejo to the city of Mission Viejo, 
and postponing a planned county branch in Aliso Viejo until 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone interested in applying is asked to contact City Clerk Mary Carlson, 
(714) 707-2631, by July 29. LYNN FRANEY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; RESIDENTS TO MAINTAIN SCHOOL DISTRICT LOT

<TEXT>
<P>
 A homeowners association will begin landscaping a Las Virgenes Unified School 
District property next to an elementary school today as part of a joint venture 
that transfers maintenance responsibility to the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 The property, which is about 150 yards long and 25 feet wide, runs adjacent to 
White Oak Elementary School in Westlake Village.Last year, the district 
proposed turning the land into a parking lot, but the First Neighborhood 
Homeowners Assn. opposed the plan, contending the lot would be noisy and 
unsightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to homeowners' concerns, the district scrapped the plan and 
collaborated with the city of Westlake Village to allow White Oak teachers and 
staff to park on the street near the school. 
</P>
<P>
 They also agreed to give the homeowners the right to landscape and beautify 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they will maintain it at a better level than we would be able to," 
said district Supt. Albert Marley. 
</P>
<P>
 The association plans to bulldoze the property to level it before installing a 
new sprinkler system and planting trees and grass. "The homeowners are almost 
delirious," said Skip Vose, vice president of the association. "We're really 
pleased to say the least." The agreement term is five years, but the district 
has the right to terminate the agreement should the property be needed for 
another use, Marley said. SUSAN BYRNES

 Students will feel aftershocks of the Northridge earthquake as late as next 
June when campuses with traditional calendars stay open a week later than 
usual, a spokeswoman for the district said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles School Board voted this week to add five days to every 
1994-1995 school calendar in the Los Angeles Unified School District to make up 
for time lost after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the extension of the school year was provided by a $56-million 
grant from the U.S. Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant is a portion of $85 million in grants to the district from the 
Deparment of Education to cover services such as counseling, tutoring, 
supervision, and other staff needs in the aftermath of the quake, said Roger 
Rasmussen of the district's independent analysis unit. 
</P>
<P>
 About $20 million of it has already been spent. The addition increases the 
number of school days to 185 for most campuses. All schools with traditional 
September to June calendars will stay open until June 29 instead of June 22. 
LEARN schools will end on June 30 instead of June 23, and the 199 year-round 
campuses in the district will add days at various times during the year. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the district schools were closed for at least a week after the 
earthquake while the district surveyed campuses and assessed damage. SUSAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; ARTS EVENTS TO MARK ANNIVERSARY OF FIRE

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the first anniversary of last October's firestorm three months away, 
local groups and relief organizations are planning four days of activities to 
mark the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed a celebration by some and "a healing process" by others, the activities 
will begin Oct. 27, exactly one year after fire ripped through the area, 
damaging or destroying more than 400 homes in the Laguna Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
 While the itinerary is still fuzzy, activities downtown will likely include 
music, dance, poetry readings and exhibitions of fire-related art. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners say they are taking care to respect the feelings of those directly 
affected by the blaze and may schedule more serene activities for fire 
survivors who wish to avoid the hoopla. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of it will be a celebration that we've made it through a year, but some 
people won't want to deal with that yet, and that's fine too," said Marsha 
Bode, Laguna Fire Relief Coalition director. "We're not going to push anything 
on anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Bode said the coalition may schedule a retreat for fire survivors the week 
before the city activities. Mental health workers are expected to put on a 
series of workshops before the event for residents who still need emotional 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be a very stressful time for many, many people," said David 
Sabaroff, manager of the state's Office of Emergency Service Community Liaison 
Office, located in the Boat Canyon shopping center next-door to the coalition's 
office. "It's not just a big party." 
</P>
<P>
 Sabaroff said as many as nine committees are helping to plan the event, which 
will likely begin in front of City Hall with "a moment of silence" for the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 City arts commissioner Jim Lashley said the commemoration will also offer an 
opportunity for artists to display work they created in response to the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like everybody's very interested and wants to get it going," Lashley 
said. "We hope we can have people come from outside the community come and see 
the fire-related art." LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; VOLUNTEER CENTER GETS YOUTH SERVICES GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Volunteer Center of Greater Orange County has received a $25,000 grant to 
encourage community organizations to offer volunteer service and employment 
opportunities for youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based Weingart Foundation, a nonprofit group that supports 
community service, health, education and public policy organizations, provided 
the grant.The money will help fund a three-year Youth Connection Program, said 
Volunteer Center spokeswoman Debra Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will encourage companies and community agencies to employ more 
youngsters in both paid and volunteer positions. Many companies and agencies 
fail to recognize the contributions that children ages 12 to 17 can make, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Youth are willing to do just about anything it takes to get involved. Today's 
youth that I've been working with, they're intelligent and very knowledgeable," 
and willing to serve, Walters said. 
</P>
<P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; COMPLEX IS PLANNED ON RUM RUNNERS SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction is expected to begin early next year on a 10,500-square-foot 
office and retail complex on land that for decades was home to the Rum Runners 
restaurant and nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 The development, approved last week by the City Council, will line Pacific 
Coast Highway for more than a block and is one of the largest developments the 
Old Town district has seen in several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its size, the proposal has produced little opposition. Some residents 
have hailed the project, saying they are eager for something to be developed on 
the vacant lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents said they support the project because it will bring small 
shops and professional offices rather than a new bar or restaurant to the area. 
Before it was closed and demolished about two years ago, Rum Runners was the 
subject of periodic complaints from residents about parking and late-night 
noise and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mitchell Land & Development Co. plans to build three two-story structures 
as well as a 43-space parking lot facing Pacific Coast Highway. Palm trees and 
other landscaping also will be planted. The project is expected to cost just 
over $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Spanish and Monterey style. We tried to make the architecture blend in 
with the residential neighborhood," said David Bartlett, a consultant for the 
project. "We wanted it to have the look and feel of a residential area, but be 
able to function as retail and offices." 
</P>
<P>
 The developers hope that the complex will attract such tenants as real estate 
agents, doctors, lawyers and accountants. Bartlett said the parking lot was 
designed to face Pacific Coast Highway so that cars would not exit onto 
residential side streets. 
</P>
<P>
 A second phase of the project calls for the construction of two homes behind 
the office complex. The Planning Commission will look at those plans tonight. 
The California Coastal Commission will review the entire project later this 
year, said Lee Whittenberg, the city's planning director. 
</P>
<P>
 At last week's council meeting, one resident said the project might cause cars 
to park on Pacific Coast Highway, obscuring the view of drivers trying to turn 
onto the highway from 17th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that a fire hydrant will be installed at that 
intersection, preventing cars from parking in areas where they could block the 
view of the road. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; CITY UPS INCENTIVE TO REPORT VANDALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have increased the incentive to report graffiti vandals in an 
effort to wipe out graffiti all over the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Until earlier this month, the city would reward $500 to anyone who gave 
information leading to the arrest and conviction of vandals who defaced public 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the $500 reward will be offered also to those who report people 
vandalizing private property. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they hope more people will be encouraged to report vandals when 
they see them scribbling on property anywhere throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize that graffiti violators do not discriminate as to what property 
they vandalize," Police Chief Patrick McKinley said in a press release 
announcing the new reward. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Navarrette, a resident whose husband received two $500 rewards last 
year, said she does not believe the reward is enough to persuade other 
residents to report graffiti vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to be a snitch," she said, adding that after her husband, James, 
was given a $500 reward by the City Council in December, someone vandalized his 
truck. She called it retaliation and a good reason to keep quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, police said they believe the reward will act as a deterrent to 
people thinking about committing the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the City Council first used the reward program in February, 1993, police 
said graffiti has dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "The graffiti removal group is working less and less and less," Sgt. Glenn 
Deveney said. MIMI KO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; JULY CHRISTMAS HELPS SICK KIDS FORGET TROUBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Her words struck him dramatically, and Jack Fox found he had a lump the size 
of a baseball in his throat. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you people doing here?" the mother of a hospitalized child said. Fox 
explained that they were bringing Christmas in July to Childrens Hospital Los 
Angeles, something to break the monotony of hospital routine, and bring the 
holidays a little bit early. 
</P>
<P>
 That was good, the mother said, because otherwise her child would not have 
seen Christmas at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can take the pain of adults," said Fox, a veteran newspaper and 
television reporter, editor and producer who lives in Sherman Oaks. "But when 
you see a child in pain you want to do something." He has been a reporter for 
the New York Post, assignment editor and executive producer at KNXT -- now KCBS 
-- managing editor at the Hollywood Reporter, and he owns a publication called 
the Hollywood News Calendar, which is for people who cover the entertainment 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Fox, 65, is running the fifth annual Christmas in July at the 
hospital, a party for hospitalized children that features Santa Claus, presents 
and cartoon characters, at which even the food carts are adorned with tinsel. 
Last year, Fox donned a Santa suit because one of the Santas had to cancel. 
Another year, he bore the friendly jibes of passersby while he drove along 
Sunset Boulevard with a Christmas tree tied to the roof of his car. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's been worth the five years of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get a smile out of a kid, it's the biggest payoff in the world," said 
Fox, who is treasurer of the Radio and Television News Assn. of Southern 
California and uses his contacts there to get volunteers from the media to help 
with the event. Toys are donated by local toy companies and by members of the 
association who will attend a party at the hospital Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "No chemical can give you the lift that this gives you," Fox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes their minds off their illnesses," said Kelli Anderson, an assistant 
nurse manager at the hospital, which treats many children whose parents could 
not otherwise afford the care. "I think any time you can do that they will do 
much better." 
</P>
<P>
 Even those children who don't believe in Santa Claus are glad to see the jolly 
character, somehow buying into the magic surrounding him, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids are a little puzzled when we say 'Merry Christmas,' " said Liz 
Mirzian, director of volunteer services at the hospital. But despite the 
conflict between the Christmas decorations and the calendar, the timing for the 
event could not be better, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have several nice Christmas events in December," said Mirzian. "But after 
the holidays they are all forgotten and so are the children." 
</P>
<P>
 What is also exciting about it is seeing how touched the parents are at having 
something like this, Mirzian said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents are so overwrought with their child in the hospital," Fox said. 
"This is good for them. They're absolutely overjoyed." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox said he has come close to his goal of creating as much as possible of a 
Christmas feeling in the middle of July. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing missing is reindeer, because they don't allow reindeer in a 
hospital," said Fox. "Maybe next year." ED BOND

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; JOBS COULD BE CUT AT WEAPONS STATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 60 civilian workers at the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station could 
lose their jobs under a cost-cutting plan scheduled to take affect in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The cutbacks are part of a nationwide effort by the Navy to streamline 
operations and work more efficiently, said Richard Williamson, public 
information officer for the base. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Defense has asked the weapons station to try to reduce 
civilian employees from 758 to 600 by next year, Williamson said. Base 
officials are unsure if they will be able to reach that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 67 employees facing layoffs, another 33 employees could 
have their pay reduced and 30 more could be moved to new jobs on the base, 
Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff reductions will affect departments throughout the base and might 
cause some duties now handled by the weapons station to be transferred to other 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Civilian workers perform a variety of tasks, from maintaining weapons to 
transporting them on trucks and trains. They also work in the base's science 
lab, Williamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Base officials will not know exactly how many workers will be laid off until 
November. Some workers might decide to take early retirement, preserving the 
jobs of younger workers who would otherwise be laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking for places where we can make reductions," Williamson said. "We 
are trying to build the military of the future." SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; COUNCIL OKS JOINING NEW FIRE AUTHORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council agreed unanimously to join a proposed governing body for the 
Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 5 to 0 last week in favor of a resolution approving a 
joint-powers agreement that would create the Orange County Fire Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The county currently operates the Orange County Fire Department. In addition 
to providing firefighting services for unincorporated parts of the county, the 
department also serves several cities, including Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed authority, if approved by the county and the participating 
cities, would be launched this fall. Each city would have a voting member on 
the authority's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted after hearing City Manager Darrell Essex explain how it 
would function. Essex told the council that an effort last year to create an 
independent district to govern the county Fire Department had been unsuccessful 
in the Legislature. The proposed joint-powers authority does not require 
passage of a state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The catastrophic fires last fall demonstrated the importance of maintaining a 
regional fire service delivery system and involving cities in decisions about 
how their community is to be protected," Essex said in a memo to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "After reviewing numerous options for restructuring of the fire services, it 
now appears that a joint-powers agreement will meet the needs of our 
communities," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Essex told the council that state funding for firefighting would not be 
changed by a shift from county government to a joint-powers authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that I recommend approval of this authority," Essex said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; POLICE BEGIN CITIZEN VOLUNTEER PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Police Department is starting a program that will enlist volunteers to 
check the homes of vacationing residents, said Police Capt. Dave Abrecht. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, "Volunteers in Policing -- VIP's," is part of the community 
policing philosophy adopted by the Police Department last year, Abrecht said. 
It encourages partnerships between police and residents, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 More volunteers are needed to implement the program, Abrecht said. Volunteers 
also will help register bicycles, perform some clerical duties and assist crime 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Application forms are available at the Police Department. Abrecht said 
applicants must submit to a background check, an interview and medical tests 
before being accepted.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; CITY SEEKS TO RESOLVE HOSPITAL DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of San Fernando has put its lawyers aside for the moment, deciding to 
talk out the objections it has over the way Mission Community Hospitals was 
formed earlier this year when San Fernando and Panorama community hospitals 
were combined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the problem we had was a lack of communication," Mayor Raymond Ojeda 
said at Monday night's City Council meeting. City Atty. Julia Sylva had 
outlined several financial and legal arrangements which seemed to violate 
agreements San Fernando Community Hospital made with the city in the mid-1970s 
in order for the city to back a bond issue that financed an expansion of that 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylva had drawn up a complaint letter that was to be sent to the hospital with 
the council's approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Community Hospitals was created by joining Panorama and San Fernando 
community hospitals in an action begun in 1992 and finalized two months ago. 
However, the agreement with the city prohibited San Fernando Community Hospital 
from participating in a merger. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that agreement, the city received a "reversionary right" to the 
property, meaning the city could take title to the hospital in six years when 
the bond is paid off. However, the city is supposed to receive the hospital 
property "free and clear." That is why city officials are also worried about 
the financial arrangements, including liens on the San Fernando property, that 
were made to purchase Panorama Community Hospital in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our fault that you weren't informed about the changes that went on and 
we want to correct it," said Bruce Ackerman, past chairman of San Fernando 
Community Hospital, who stepped up to the podium after Sylva presented a draft 
of the complaint letter to the council and the public. Ackerman said that 
hospital officials wanted to meet with the council in an open session to 
discuss questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was not aware until tonight that you were willing to talk to us," Ojeda 
said, and the council decided to delay any legal action and schedule a public 
forum. Ackerman said he had been trying to meet with the city about the issue 
for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Ackerman said after the meeting that the deal with Panorama Community Hospital 
was not a merger because when San Fernando Hospital purchased it, that hospital 
had been closed for several months. Ackerman said San Fernando merely bought an 
empty building along with the license to operate. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; GAS CO. HAS OPENED NEW PAYMENT CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California Gas Co. officials have a message for customers who have 
wondered where to pay their bills since the Northridge earthquake destroyed the 
San Fernando payment center. 
</P>
<P>
 Look around. 
</P>
<P>
 The new payment center opened three weeks ago directly across the street from 
317 S. Brand, the former payment center that was demolished after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new payment center has been very slow," said Cathy Maguire, district 
manager for the Gas Co. "We've been trying to get the word out. They just 
haven't realized that we are across the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Customers had been using the GTE payment center next door to make payments in 
a drop box after the quake, Maguire said. 
</P>
<P>
 The old location was the only gas company payment center closed by the quake, 
said Maguire. It had taken in between 3,000 and 5,000 payments per month, 
making it one of the busiest centers in the region, Maguire said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other payment center in the San Fernando area is in Van Nuys. Both 
centers serve the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Situated on the ground floor of the Gage Wilson Real Estate building, the new 
payment center offers the same services the old center did. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can pay bills, inquire about bills, get service requests for turning gas 
on or turning it off," Maguire said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new office is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays. There is also a 
night deposit box. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; AIRCRAFT COMPANIES CITED FOR NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Van Nuys Airport has started issuing citations to aircraft companies whose 
pilots exceed noise limits set by the airport's noise-reduction program. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, the airport sent 48 letters to 29 aircraft operators, informing 
them that their pilots had violated decibel limits set by the airport for 
various types of jet airplanes.  
</P>
<P>
 Two hundred operators avoided an impending noise ordinance two years ago by 
agreeing to comply voluntarily with noise limits under the airport's Voluntary 
Noise Control Program. During one week in May this year, however, the airport's 
new noise-monitoring system detected 48 instances in which an aircraft exceeded 
the recommended noise guidelines. With a $1-million tracking system now in 
place, the airport can for the first time identify aircraft responsible for 
each noise violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven companies committed more than two violations. The most citations went to 
Hughes Aircraft Co., with seven, followed by Clay Lacy, six; Stergios Rapis, 
four, and Petersen Aviation, three. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport Manager Ron Kochevar said he believed that, once notified, pilots 
would comply with the voluntary guidelines rather than face mandatory 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to see is those letters getting fewer and fewer in number," 
Kochevar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilots can reduce noise over nearby homes by throttling back the engines, 
easing off on the plane's accelerator and achieving a high altitude before 
flying over residential areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes officials said they are taking the matter seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Joel Morris, director of flight operations,) has already issued a notice to 
the pilots alerting them to the fact that we have, on those six flights, 
exceeded the voluntary limits and instructed them to take corrective measures 
-- as long as they don't compromise safety," Hughes spokesman Kearney Bothwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 High temperatures and a full load can restrict an airplane's ability to 
achieve a high altitude, thus increasing noise, Morris said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the voluntary program fails to keep noise levels in check, Kochevar said, 
the Board of Airport Commissioners may ban the noisiest airplanes from Van Nuys 
Airport. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; EMERGENCY REPAIRS OKD FOR RESERVOIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the two San Fernando city water reservoirs damaged by the Northridge 
earthquake has been targeted for emergency repairs by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, the council authorized the city public works director to hire 
a consultant who will design the repairs to the reservoir, which has leaked as 
much as 600,000 gallons of drinking water since Jan. 17. Bids to do the repair 
work will go out in a few weeks, and the work is expected to be done by the end 
of September, Public Works Director Mike Drake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a week of the quake, divers inspected Reservoir 3A at 13655 Foothill 
Blvd. and found the sealant that closes the gap between concrete slabs at the 
bottom of the reservoir had broken. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council also authorized a study of the older Reservoir 4, next to 
Reservoir 3A, which suffered cracking during the earthquake. Engineers are to 
determine if that reservoir should be repaired or replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairing Reservoir 3A, which was built in 1991 and holds 2.5 million gallons 
of water, is expected to cost about $200,000. Fixing both could cost as much as 
$2.75 million, city officials have estimated. Reservoir 4, built in 1962, holds 
1 million gallons of water. 
</P>

 The issue of repairing the reservoir was raised at Monday night's meeting by 
Councilman Doude Wysbeek, who said that about 3,000 to 4,000 gallons of water 
had been leaking from Reservoir 3A every day. He was concerned about the loss 
of water which city pumps have drawn from the ground and the worsening of the 
damage through corrosion and erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake said that even when Reservoir 3A is emptied and repaired, city residents 
will not notice an interruption in service because they will still have the use 
of Reservoir 4 and will also use the slightly more expensive water from the 
Metropolitan Water District. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando also has two other reservoirs that were not damaged by the 
earthquake. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; SUPERVISORS AWARD DAM-REPAIR CONTRACT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eager to fix damage caused by the Northridge earthquake before the rainy 
season begins, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday voted to 
ignore the normal contract bidding process and pay an experienced engineering 
firm $400,000 to design the repair of the Pacoima Dam.  
</P>
<P>
 The 370-foot-tall dam in the San Gabriel Mountains above Sylmar sustained 
$4.9-million damage in the quake, 97% of which will be paid for by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake created a two-inch gap between the top of the dam and a massive 
concrete block connecting it to the canyon wall. It also caused that concrete 
connection to move about half an inch downstream relative to the dam's crest. 
As a precaution, the reservoir pool behind the dam is being kept at one-seventh 
of its capacity, said Jim Noyes, deputy director of the county Department of 
Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors awarded the contract to the firm of Morrison Knudsen of San 
Francisco, which also designed $3 million in dam repairs necessary after the 
1971 Sylmar quake. TRACEY KAPLAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; MEND BEGINS SHOE DRIVE TO AID NEEDY

<P>
 When people think about footwear during the summer, it's generally in terms of 
how to avoid it as much as possible. This isn't the case at the MEND (Meeting 
People's Needs with Dignity) Center in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 MEND has begun its annual shoe drive this month, collecting shoes to 
distribute to low-income and homeless children in preparation for the coming 
school year. The shoe drive will continue through Aug. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 MEND, which opened in 1971, is a nonprofit organization serving the northeast 
San Fernando Valley. Three days a week, MEND serves food to about 75 families, 
and it distributes clothing to about 30 families a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the organization collected and distributed about 300 pairs of shoes. 
With the help of the community, the group hopes to improve on that number this 
year. The goal is to give at least one pair of shoes to every child in need. 
Donated shoes should be brought to the MEND Center, 13460 Van Nuys Blvd., 
Pacoima. For information, call Lupe Acosta, clothing manager, at (818) 
896-0246. JAMES ELMENDORF

SUPERMARKET MANAGER SLAIN DURING ROBBERY OF STORE; CRIME: GUNMAN FLEES AFTER 
SHOOTING. A BANK IN THE SAME YORBA LINDA SHOPPING CENTER WAS ROBBED LAST YEAR 
BY A BANDIT WHO ALSO WORE A LONG BLACK WIG AS A DISGUISE.

<P>
 The manager of an Alpha Beta market was shot and killed late Monday by a 
robber in a black, shoulder-length wig similar to that worn by a bank robber in 
the same shopping center in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman approached Timothy Eugene McVeigh, 34, of Santa Ana at the check 
stand at about 10:40 p.m. as a handful of customers shopped unaware. He ordered 
McVeigh to give him money, and then shot him in the chest, police Sgt. Ed 
McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy came up and demanded money. We don't know if the manager didn't move 
quick enough for him or what," McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Darius Anderson, vice president of public relations for Alpha Beta's 
parent company, described a slightly different scenario. He said the gunman had 
demanded money from a cashier as McVeigh happened to walk by the check stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The manager happened upon the check stand and asked what was going on," 
Anderson said. The gunman "turned around and fired a shot" at McVeigh. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber escaped from the market, in the 17000 block of Yorba Linda 
Boulevard, with an undetermined amount of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 He was described as about 45, white, medium build, wearing the wig, 
eyeglasses, blue jeans and a purple sweat shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 McVeigh was rushed to Western Medical Center in Santa Ana for surgery and died 
at about 2 a.m., McDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 8, Southern California Bank, also in the Tall Mouse Shopping Center, 
was robbed by a man whom witnesses said was wearing a shoulder-length, black 
wig. The robber, described as having a medium build, wore dark makeup on his 
face and left the shopping center on foot, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald said police are not linking the two robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 McVeigh had worked for the supermarket chain for about 12 years and at this 
store since August, Anderson said. Store officials said he was unmarried and 
had no children. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Barbara Kiley said she was shocked about the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shop there all the time," Kiley said. "This is just terrible. It's very 
disappointing. That's the kind of crime and violence we've worked so hard to 
keep out of Yorba Linda."  
</P>
<P>
 Alpha Beta plans to offer a $10,000 reward for information leading to the 
killer's conviction.

COUNTY SEEKING MORE PARK RESERVE OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alarmed by recent attacks on lifeguards at a public swimming pool in Watts, 
Los Angeles County supervisors Tuesday moved to bolster security in the parks 
by making it more attractive for volunteers to become park police reserve 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget cutbacks and mounting violence have forced the county to rely heavily 
on reserves, a trend that is expected to continue, said Rodney E. Cooper, 
director of the Department of Parks and Recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the county has 69 sworn officers on its park police force and 54 
reserve officers. The reserves, who are qualified as peace officers and carry 
guns, donate 20 hours a week each to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract volunteers to the park police force, the board, without discussion, 
authorized the parks department to purchase disability income insurance for the 
reserve officers. In the past, injured reserve officers received no benefits. 
Under the new policy, injured reservists will receive a weekly disability 
payment of $250 for up to two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance will cost the county only $1,100 annually for all reservists, a 
token amount that was not previously allocated because parks officials did not 
want to single out reserve officers from among the more than 5,000 park 
volunteers, said Park Police Chief Paul Zrofsky. None of the others are covered 
by disability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 But increasing violence in the county's 129 parks, including the recent 
attacks on lifeguards at Will Rogers Park, has lent a new urgency to the need 
to increase the number of reserve officers, Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, six lifeguards were injured in gang-related attacks at the public 
pool. After numerous complaints about new fees imposed on pool users this 
summer, Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke raised more than $65,000 in 
corporate and private donations to eliminate the fees in her district. 
</P>
<P>
 But plans to obtain the insurance were in the works even before the recent 
attacks, Cooper said. Budget cutbacks have left the department 14 officers 
short, making it "essential that we recruit more reserves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservists must pass a background check and psychological exam, and complete a 
34-week-long, part-time training program in either Santa Clarita or East Los 
Angeles, Zrofsky said.

BEILENSON, SYBERT ABOUT EVEN FOR FUND RAISING; ELECTION: CAMPAIGN ACCOUNTS OF 
THE 24TH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT RIVALS ARE $13,000 APART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) and attorney Richard Sybert are 
running neck-and-neck in fund raising as they prepare for a November election 
test to determine who will represent a congressional district that stretches 
from Sherman Oaks to Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign finance reports filed Tuesday by Beilenson show the veteran lawmaker, 
now seeking his 10th term in office, had $135,852 on hand June 30 when the 
books on the most recent reporting period closed. Beilenson, 62, represents the 
24th District, one of the nation's most affluent congressional areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the 42-year-old Sybert, a former cabinet-level official in Gov. 
Pete Wilson's Administration, had $122,759 in his campaign account, according 
to the reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports also reveal Sybert spent $365,497 during the first six months of 
this year in his successful bid to win the GOP nomination to run against 
Beilenson. In the June 7 primary, Sybert scored 47% of the Republican vote in a 
field of five candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Beilenson spent only $41,057 to win renomination in the 
Democratic primary against one foe, Scott Gaulke, a follower of political 
extremist Lyndon LaRouche. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest campaign documents show how heavily Sybert has relied on his 
personal wealth to fund his quest for office. During the first six months of 
1994, Sybert raised only $90,871 from outside sources, but lent his campaign 
committee $421,685 at 5% interest. 
</P>
<P>
 A Harvard Law School graduate, Sybert was a partner in a major Downtown Los 
Angeles law firm for 12 years. In 1991, Sybert was named director of Wilson's 
Office of Planning and Research, and late last year he became president of a 
Santa Barbara-based toy design firm. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first six months of this year, Beilenson raised $113,058 from 
outside sources. The congressman, however, continues to carry on his campaign 
books a $50,000 loan he made to himself to fund his 1992 reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert said Tuesday that he expects to spend about half a million dollars 
between now and the Nov. 7 election. That would put this year's race in the 
same league as the 1992 race between Beilenson and his GOP rival, 
ex-Assemblyman Tom McClintock. Two years ago, Beilenson spent $616,000, his foe 
$459,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson could not be reached for comment.

3 VALLEY MEN ARE ARRESTED IN SERIES OF NATIONAL LOAN SWINDLES; CRIME: OFFICIALS 
SAY THE TRIO ALLEGEDLY USED NEWSPAPER ADS AND TOLL-FREE PHONE NUMBERS TO SUCK 
HUNDREDS OF VICTIMS INTO A CLASSIC SCAM. 
</P>

<P>
 Saying they preyed on those desperate for cash during the prolonged recession, 
authorities have arrested three San Fernando Valley men who they allege used 
newspaper ads and toll-free phone numbers to suck hundreds of victims across 
the country into a classic loan swindle. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Brown, 39, of Van Nuys, and Earnest Strader, 30, and David Allen 
Straughter, both of North Hollywood, had been charged in May with participating 
in a series of allegedly related loan swindles, which authorities said began in 
early 1992. But those criminal charges weren't announced until Tuesday, the day 
after the men were arrested by federal authorities in Winnetka and West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The men each were being held in lieu of at least $70,000 bail, and they were 
set to be arraigned as early as today. 
</P>
<P>
 "These folks were preying on people who needed cash," said Deputy City Atty. 
P. Greg Parham, a prosecutor in the City Attorney's Consumer Protection Unit, 
who is handling the case. "It's a classic advance loan fee scam." 
</P>
<P>
 The men were believed to have worked together and with additional conspirators 
on a series of major loan scams, which began with running classified ads in 
weekly and daily newspapers around the nation, Parham said. 
</P>
<P>
 With ad slogans such as "Personal Loans. Bad Credit Okay. Easy to Qualify," 
they invited people to call the toll-free 800 telephone numbers to obtain 
loans, Parham said. When the victims responded, he said, they were told they 
qualified for a loan, but that to get it they had to send a money order or 
cashier's check for at least $250 by overnight delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Some victims were told the money would be used to pay loan processing fees, 
while others were told the money would pay for loan insurance. But they had one 
thing in common: None got any loan in return, Parham said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hundreds of people around the country fell for the scam," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the three men operated their telemarketing schemes through 
leased offices and instructed victims -- from as far away as New York and South 
Carolina -- to send their money to private mail boxes they rented in the Los 
Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'd usually move one or two weeks ahead of law enforcement activity," 
Parham said. "They were always ahead of investigators. They would just work an 
area for a while and then move on." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, authorities believe the loan scam netted at least $250,000, although 
it was not immediately known how much the three men may have made. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the men are believed to have worked together, they used different 
fictitious business names and sometimes used each other's given names. None of 
the companies had published phone numbers, and authorities said there are many 
unrelated, and legal, companies with similar-sounding names that are listed. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown did business as West Coast Financial and California Financial Services, 
both based in Van Nuys, according to authorities. Strader, also known as 
Spencer R. Straughter, and Straughter, also known as David Strader, did 
business as California Securities, which authorities said operated first in 
Inglewood and later in the Crenshaw district of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Strader also did business as U.S. Financial, which was located in the same 
building as California Securities, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Straughter and Brown also did business as Financial Services, at first in 
Santa Monica and later in Pacoima and Sherman Oaks, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, authorities said criminal investigations of the alleged loan scams 
continue, and that they are searching for several other suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Strader and Straughter were arrested Monday morning in West Los Angeles by the 
FBI and members of the Los Angeles Police Department's Fugitive Detail. Brown 
was arrested Monday at 10:30 p.m. at his Winnetka home by U.S. postal 
inspectors, which conducted the investigation with the FBI.

UCI EXODUS CONTINUES AS ANOTHER DEAN LEAVES CAMPUS; EDUCATION: THE HEAD OF 
UNIVERSITY EXTENSION BECOMES THE 6TH DEAN TO STEP DOWN IN A YEAR. SOME FEEL 
FACULTY IS BEING COURTED AT A TIME OF BUDGETARY CRISIS.

<P>
 An East Coast university has hired a UC Irvine dean, who becomes the sixth 
dean on campus to step down in a year, officials confirmed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Melvin E. Hall, dean of University Extension, will leave July 31 to become the 
dean of continuing education, summer and special programs at the University of 
Maryland, a UCI spokesman said. Hall had worked at UCI since 1989, and was its 
first and only African American dean. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have enjoyed my time at UCI and consider it a good foundation for whatever 
I encounter next," Hall said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer C. Olin, UCI acting executive vice chancellor, said Hall will be 
missed.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a very persuasive and outspoken promoter of a university extension 
program," Olin said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hall's departure adds to a growing list of deans who have stepped down from 
posts at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 Three deans announced their retirements through a voluntary early retirement 
incentive plan in May: Robert Hickok, dean of the School of Fine Arts; Harold 
Moore, dean of the School of Physical Sciences, and Michael Butler, dean of 
Undergraduate Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Walter L. Henry, dean of the College of Medicine, resigned in December. 
Officials announced in March that the dean of the School of Engineering, 
William A. Sirignano, was removed from his position after an academic review. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, of Irvine, moves to a university with nearly twice UCI's enrollment. 
University of Maryland, College Park, is the flagship campus in Maryland's 
higher education system and enrolls about 33,000 students, a University of 
Maryland official said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Fallon, vice president for academic affairs and provost for the 
University of Maryland, College Park, said Hall was chosen from 125 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking for the best qualified person, and he's it," Fallon said. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseeing UCI's extension branch, Hall said he supervised a program that 
grew from about 25,000 students in 1989 to 32,000 students in 1994. The program 
is self-supporting, receiving no funding from the university or state. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back on his years at UCI, Hall said that extension once simply meant 
night school courses. Now it includes working with businesses to train 
employees to be more efficient, providing day classes taken mainly by retirees, 
and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 He also pointed to an expansion into North County; UCI Extension will open its 
first satellite branch in Anaheim on Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hall is a good example of someone who's made outstanding contributions . . . 
in terms of extension for the university and beyond the university," said 
Davida Hopkins-Parham, assistant vice chancellor for academic programs. "It's a 
tragedy, as far as I'm concerned, that we didn't retain him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopkins-Parham said UCI faculty members are increasingly being courted by East 
Coast and Midwest universities at a time of budgetary crises in the University 
of California system.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have been, more than we would want to be, in the position of trying to 
retain people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While some staff members at UCI said the amount of turnover among UCI 
Extension staff during Hall's tenure was controversial, Hall said that the 
staff now reflects the county's ethnic makeup. In 1989 when he started, Hall 
said, only two staff members were from an ethnic minority group. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he does not think his departure will deter other African American 
educators from joining UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think my leaving will have as much an impact on the future as my 
coming here," Hall said. "The fact I came here, and had a successful tenure, is 
going to be far more important than my leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Welgan, an assistant dean of University Extension for three years, will 
fill in as acting dean beginning Aug. 1, Olin said. Welgan, of Laguna Beach, 
has worked with University Extension since 1978.

1 KILLED AND 1 HURT WHEN FREEWAY WALL COLLAPSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A quake-damaged freeway sound wall being razed by a construction crew 
collapsed Tuesday night, killing one worker and injuring at least one other, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey said the incident 
occurred at 7:28 p.m. along the Branford Street on-ramp to the southbound 
Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said a private construction crew had been dismantling the wall, 
unbolting the 12-foot-high concrete panels from their foundations for removal 
by a crane. Humphrey said it appeared that the wall had been completely 
unbolted but not yet attached to the crane when it suddenly toppled, crushing 
one worker -- a man about 25 years old -- and injuring a second man. 
</P>
<P>
 The fatally injured worker was declared dead at the scene, and the injured 
worker was taken to Pacifica Hospital of the Valley in Sun Valley, where he was 
listed in good condition with minor back and leg injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Names of the victims were being withheld pending notification of families. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphrey said investigators from the Fire Department, the California Highway 
Patrol and the Los Angeles Police Department responded to the scene, but added 
that a final determination will be made by Cal OSHA officers, who investigate 
workplace safety incidents.

VALLEY BRIEFING: VAN NUYS COURTHOUSE; THE STRUGGLE WITH QUAKE, BUDGET WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The seven-story Van Nuys Superior Court building has long been a San Fernando 
Valley landmark, a high-rise familiar to locals since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it's gone national -- as the backdrop for the scores of television 
reporters updating the story in the Menendez brothers murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV crews will be back for another hearing Friday in the Menendez case. But 
there's a long-running drama going on behind the scenes -- a court forced to 
deal resourcefully with considerable earthquake damage and severe budget 
setbacks. Quake Damage 
</P>
<P>
 For the courts, the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake hit hard two ways. The quake 
made a mess of the top few floors of the Van Nuys Superior Court building. And 
it virtually destroyed the San Fernando courthouse a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth and sixth floors of the Van Nuys courthouse appear back to normal. 
But the seventh floor, where marble was in danger of falling from the walls, is 
still a construction zone. Walls are propped up by wood beams and metal 
anchors; yellow caution tape is everywhere. The courtrooms can, however, be 
entered -- carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials plan to do a "full seismic survey" of the building, Court 
Manager Zoe Venhuizen said. No one knows when it will be completed, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando courthouse, meanwhile, is out of commission until at least 
next April. For the duration, the San Fernando court is operating from the Van 
Nuys courthouse. Overloaded Courtrooms 
</P>
<P>
 * Van Nuys Superior Court cases: In fiscal year 1993, 2,032 criminal cases and 
6,662 civil filings. The court utilizes an average of 338 jurors a day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Additional San Fernando Court cases: In fiscal 1993, 1,723 criminal and 
3,141 civil filings. Space needs to be found for nine more judges, separate 
district attorney and public defender offices -- in all, about 125 more 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Superior Courtrooms: The building houses 20 courtrooms. It wasn't enough. 
Judges -- some assigned to Van Nuys, others to San Fernando -- have been 
assigned to temporary trailers that ring the north and south sides of the 
courthouse. The seven north-side trailers, plunked down in the midst of 
eucalyptus and magnolia trees, are known around the court as the "treehouse." 
Currently, the treehouse is home to a severe infestation of fleas. The two 
courtrooms in trailers on the south side have no nickname. Last week, a court 
clerk reported that ants had invaded one of the two makeshift courtrooms. Two 
more courts are in trailers across the street. Court staffers have found 
evidence that homeless people are camping out beneath the trailers. Once, 
Venhuizen said, staffers found a sleeping bag. Budget Woes 
</P>
<P>
 The Van Nuys court alone is down 11 of the 42 staffers who work in the clerk's 
office and jury assembly room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like most government operations, there's enough elasticity, enough tolerance, 
to make adjustments for budget shortfalls," said Robert Letteau, the Van Nuys 
court's supervising judge.  
</P>
<P>
 "But I do think," Letteau said, "that we've reached the limit where we really 
can't afford too many more losses." 
</P>
<P>
 To make do, the court relies on help from different sources, Venhuizen said. 
Two workers put in 20 hours weekly to meet welfare eligibility requirements. 
One woman volunteers six hours a week. This summer, the Archdiocese of Los 
Angeles may provide three youths who will work for college credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Even attorneys are pitching in. Lawyers have volunteered to hear small claims 
appeals, settle civil cases and mediate family law cases. 
</P>
<P>
 An innovative domestic violence clinic, located in an office inside the 
second-floor cafeteria, is still open for business five mornings a week. Begun 
in 1992, it offers free help in filling out complicated court forms. 
</P>
<P>
 The court has also maintained an outreach program with James H. Monroe High 
School in Sepulveda, regular five-week sessions that give 10th-graders a chance 
to see how the courts operate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all still works," Venhuizen said. "Somehow."

KILLER OF 7 IN CSUF RAMPAGE DENIED MENTAL HOSPITAL RELEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former janitor who shot and killed seven people in a 1976 rampage in the 
library at Cal State Fullerton was denied release from a state psychiatric 
hospital by a judge Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge James Jackman denied a petition by Edward Charles Allaway 
to have his treatment program declared unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge ordered officials at Atascadero State Hospital to develop a new 
treatment program for Allaway, who was found innocent of the murders by reason 
of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling culminated a five-day hearing that began July 12. That was 18 years 
to the day that Allaway shot nine people at close range in a rampage that still 
ranks as Orange County's worst mass murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge ruled that Allaway's treatment is inadequate, but refused to release 
him to the community or a less-restrictive facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Baptist Sunday school teacher said he was driven insane by 
homosexual activity in the library bathroom he cleaned, as well as by taunts 
from co-workers that his ex-wife appeared in pornographic movies. No such 
movies were made.

POLICE TO RETURN VIDEO SEIZED DURING 4TH MELEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Police will not press charges against Michael W. Thayer, 21, who complained 
that his videotape was seized during the Fourth of July melee in downtown 
Huntington Beach, a department spokesman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Lt. Jim Cutshaw said, Thayer will get his tape back. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had previously said they might use the tape as evidence that Thayer had 
ignored three separate police requests to clear the area. Also, they speculated 
that the tape might prove useful in determining the appropriateness of police 
conduct in the wake of allegations that they had used excessive force to 
control Fourth of July crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cutshaw said the two-hour tape simply recounted Thayer's holiday, recorded 
with a video camera attached to a helmet he wore as he pedaled his bicycle 
around town. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't anything on the tape regarding police activity other than police 
asking people to quiet down at a party," he said. "There is insufficient 
evidence to charge Mr. Thayer of any wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
 Thayer said he was told Friday he could have the tape back and he expected to 
pick it up Tuesday. He said he still intended to lodge a formal complaint about 
police taking the tape.

ANGRY HOMEOWNERS TO MEET OVER CANCELED QUAKE COVERAGE; INSURANCE: DECISION BY 
20TH CENTURY LEAVES SOME POLICYHOLDERS UNABLE TO GET NEW COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As many as 300 disgruntled homeowners reeling from the imminent cancellation 
of their earthquake policies by Woodland Hills-based 20th Century Insurance Co. 
plan to meet tonight to air their grievances. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting is scheduled for 7 p.m. at First Presbyterian Church of Granada 
Hills, 10400 Zelzah Ave.  
</P>
<P>
 Battered by more than $600 million in quake claims, 20th Century has begun 
mailing 45-day nonrenewal notices to its 90,000 quake policyholders -- 
including those with unresolved claims from the Northridge quake -- and stopped 
selling new homeowner policies. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for 20th Century said Tuesday that only 3,400 of the company's 
43,000 quake-related claims, or about 8%, remain unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will also phase out all homeowner coverage over the next two 
years, under an agreement negotiated earlier this summer with the California 
Insurance Department.  
</P>
<P>
 Almost three-quarters of 20th Century quake policyholders live in 
seismologically vulnerable Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul S. Castellani, 20th Century group vice president, declined an invitation 
to attend tonight's policyholders' meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to Michael Ramirez-Mares, chairman of the 20th Century 
Policyholders Quake Action Group, Castellani said the company "will continue to 
be vitally concerned with the fair and prompt resolution of all our 
policyholders' claims resulting from the Northridge earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he added, "We believe it is quite difficult to address the individual 
concerns of our insureds in the forum you propose." 
</P>
<P>
 Many companies are limiting the number of new quake policies they sell, 
fearing that claims arising from another temblor as big or bigger than last 
January's disaster would financially ruin them. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also pressuring state insurance officials to drop the requirement 
that forces companies that sell homeowners insurance to offer quake policies as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, last week, Farmers Insurance Group, California's third-largest 
homeowners' carrier, said it plans to raise the deductibles on most of its 
quake policies from 10% to 25%. So, a homeowner with $200,000 of quake 
insurance would have to pay at least the first $50,000 out of pocket -- and 
perhaps more if the deductible was broken down into categories, as some 
companies do -- instead of $20,000 currently. 
</P>
<P>
 As they start looking for new quake insurance, those who still have unresolved 
claims against 20th Century are getting hit by yet another financial aftershock 
of the January disaster: Very few other companies are issuing quake policies. 
And, as a rule, companies that are issuing policies will not sell them to 20th 
Century customers, or any other quake victims for that matter, until those 
homeowners settle claims with their former insurer and make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry practice, little noticed until now, has become painfully apparent 
to quake victims like Tom McVarish of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "My damage is in excess of $100,000 and 20th Century is doing additional 
studies to determine if my foundation is sound," McVarish said. "They just sent 
me a check today, but I can't do the repairs until they do the foundation 
study, which should have been done three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, I really don't have a home that I can go out and get coverage on," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 McVarish and his wife, Jan, said that together they had called 10 insurance 
companies seeking quake coverage. "Once they find out you have a lot of damage, 
they don't want to go any further," Jan McVarish said.  
</P>
<P>
 Bill Schulz, a spokesman for the state Insurance Department, said he 
understood that sort of frustration, but the insurance practice isn't new.  
</P>
<P>
 "Generally speaking, if you have not settled a claim for existing damage, it 
is nearly impossible to get coverage from a new company," said Schulz. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, if the damage has been estimated by a contractor and a company has 
reached an agreement to begin repairs, as long as that damage is specified, 
companies including the Fair Plan will write coverage," he said. The issuer of 
the replacement policy is most interested in avoiding liability for existing 
damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Fair Plan, an industry-financed insurer of last resort, issues 
fire and earthquake coverage for homeowners statewide, but provides less 
coverage for higher premiums than most private companies charge.

SOLDERING IRON USED IN REPAIRS CITED AS CAUSE OF APARTMENT FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was displaced Tuesday by an apartment fire that was apparently started 
by a soldering iron he had left on in his bedroom, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Parinas, 35, also suffered minor burns to a hand and knee from the fire 
in an apartment building in the 1300 block of San Juan Street, Orange County 
Fire Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Parinas told them he left the soldering iron on overnight 
after making repairs in his bedroom Monday. He was awakened by smoke and tried 
to put out flames with an extinguisher, Cha said. A neighbor reported the fire 
at 7:41 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters had the blaze under control in 15 minutes. No other apartments in 
the 12-unit complex were damaged, Cha said. Investigators estimated the damage 
at $30,000.

WOMAN FELT SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT TRUCK; CRIME: CUSTOMER AT SUSPECT'S HOUSE TOOK 
DOWN LICENSE NUMBER AND PASSED IT ON TO A DETECTIVE FRIEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It wasn't anything she could quite put her finger on, but Elaine Canalia just 
felt there was something wrong about the truck parked in John Famalaro's 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, whom she had known for two months, already had a van and a pickup 
truck, she said in an interview Tuesday, so why would he need another large 
vehicle? He obviously wasn't driving the yellow Ryder rental truck, not with 
all the boxes of paint cans stacked around it. 
</P>
<P>
 Canalia, who had visited Famalaro's home July 9 to buy some painting supplies, 
on a whim scribbled down the license number on a scrap of paper and, several 
days later, passed it on to a detective friend in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 That moment of intuition would end a 3-year-old mystery and lead to the 
discovery, hidden in a deep freeze inside the truck, of the body of Denise 
Huber, a former Northridge woman who had moved to Newport Beach. Huber had been 
missing since June 3, 1991, when she failed to return from a rock concert. 
</P>
<P>
 The riddle of Huber's disappearance was almost solved a month before, however. 
Ryder officials missed their own opportunity to unravel the case in June when 
they failed to follow up on a lead supplied by an San Clemente woman, who had 
traced Famalaro to his Dewey address, the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carolyn Copeland, who makes her living finding missing heirs, had gone to the 
San Clemente Ryder franchise with her daughter, who was returning a rental. She 
struck up a conversation with the clerk about her occupation. The clerk told 
her he had someone he wanted to find, then asked her if she could track 
Famalaro, who had failed to return a truck rented in January.  
</P>
<P>
 Using computer databases common to her trade, she located Famalaro. 
</P>
<P>
 "His name was very unusual, so it wasn't hard to find," Copeland said. 
</P>
<P>
 She gave the information to the San Clemente franchise who passed it on to 
Ryder officials at the moving company headquarters in Miami. For whatever 
reason, they didn't follow up, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Ryder officials in San Clemente nor Miami would comment on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be several more weeks before Canalia would see the truck and become 
curious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assumed when I wrote the license number down that the truck was stolen," 
said Canalia, 44, a Phoenix paint manufacturer and distributor. "Never in my 
wildest dream did I think that poor girl would be found in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Canalia and her business partner, Jack Court, had done business with Famalaro 
since May, always meeting him at the Prescott Valley Swap Meet.  
</P>
<P>
 On July 9, Canalia said, Famalaro asked her and Court to come by his house to 
look at some colorant he wanted to sell. Once there, the trio loaded several 
boxes of it into Canalia's car. 
</P>
<P>
 Canalia had the impression that Famalaro was in a hurry that night -- stacking 
and loading the boxes so quickly, she said. He wouldn't even allow Court's 
10-year-old grandson to use the bathroom, saying there was no running water in 
the house. But they all had a long day at the swap meet, and Canalia assumed 
Famalaro was tired. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sight of the moving truck kept nagging at her. "It just seemed so out 
of place," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 12, when a detective friend came to her warehouse to buy some paint, 
Canalia gave him the license number, suggesting it was worth checking. Making a 
call from her office, he learned the truck had been stolen in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, the detective returned to Canalia's warehouse and while there 
received a phone call from his colleagues, who had found the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "From where I was, I heard him say, 'homicide . . . body . . . freezer,' " 
recalled Canalia. "I was horrified. It makes me sick to think I was standing 
right next to this truck that occupied this body." 
</P>
<P>
 Canalia called Huber's parents, once active in San Fernando Valley Christian 
church circles, early this week to express her sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 They told Canalia it was God's will that she helped find their lost child, 
said Ione Huber, Denise's mother.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PLAN TO DETER PANHANDLING BACKED; CITY 
COUNCIL: LANCASTER ENDORSES A CARD AND POSTER PROGRAM PROPOSED BY AGENCIES 
SERVING THE HOMELESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lancaster City Council has endorsed a new program called "Just Say No to 
Panhandlers" proposed by Antelope Valley agencies that serve the hungry and 
homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's backers ask merchants to put in their store windows "Just Say No 
to Panhandlers" posters showing a picture of a panhandler inside a red circle 
and a slash through it. The poster also will list agencies to which shoppers 
can donate money instead of giving it to panhandlers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, cards listing agencies that will help panhandlers will be 
available at local businesses and the Lancaster Chamber of Commerce. The idea 
is for people to hand the card to panhandlers rather than money, city officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In reality, this card is just as good as the money," said Councilman George 
Runner. "And it helps them to eat in the future as well, because the dollar 
that you give them can hardly buy anything at a fast-food restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 The city will provide graphics help with posters and cards and will research 
possible anti-panhandling laws the city could adopt, Runner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Baker, director of Grace Resource Center, an agency that helps the 
homeless, said the cards ensure that beggars do not use donated money for 
drugs, alcohol or cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth of it is most of them will just throw the card away," Baker said. 
"But you'll know how sincere they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker proposed the "Just Say No to Panhandlers" program to the City Council on 
Monday night and the council endorsed it 4 to 0. Mayor Frank Roberts was 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said businessman Brian Cooley approached him with the idea a month ago. 
Baker has raised about $200 for the effort from friends and the Rotary West 
Club in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Other nonprofit agencies involved are South Antelope Valley Emergency 
Services, the Salvation Army in Lancaster and St. Vincent de Paul Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, people are very warm to it," Baker said. "It meets the needs on a 
whole bunch of different levels." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said the program will ensure that people don't feel like they have to 
give beggars money to help them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all sounds very judgmental, but thousands of dollars are being lost on 
someone's habit," Baker said. "But for me, $10 buys 90 pounds of food."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; AMUSEMENT PARK EMPLOYEE ARRESTED IN 
MERCHANDISE THEFTS

<P>
 It was a paper trail even Elmer Fudd could have followed. 
</P>
<P>
 An 18-year-old female employee of Six Flags Magic Mountain was arrested on 
suspicion of stealing about $3,300 worth of clothing and other merchandise 
featuring the amusement park's cartoon characters by writing more than a dozen 
checks in two days from a closed account, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyshae Shanae Price, 18, of Los Angeles was booked Monday night on suspicion 
of obtaining property under false pretenses, Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Deputy Christopher Valento said. She was released shortly afterward to her 
mother's care. 
</P>
<P>
 Magic Mountain officials learned about the thefts when a handful of Price's 
checks, written to various stores throughout the park, were declared invalid 
because the account had been closed in December, 1993, Valento said. 
</P>
<P>
 Price bought two dozen shirts, three leather jackets, numerous pieces of 
jewelry and other items by writing an unspecified number of checks Sunday and 
13 more Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A security official arrested Price about 9 p.m. Monday when a store manager 
reported Price was trying to make another purchase. Price told the guard she 
had two male friends nearby who were helping her carry the merchandise, but the 
men left before officials could question them. 
</P>
<P>
 Price is no longer an employee of Magic Mountain, said Bonnie Rabjohn, a park 
spokeswoman.

PETS: CITY BACKS A LAW THAT LETS RESIDENTS KEEP THE POTBELLIED ANIMALS. BUT 
THERE ARE SIZE LIMITS.

 A potbellied pig, evicted from his Lancaster neighborhood in March, is back in 
his former home after the City Council's preliminary approval of a law that 
allows residents to keep one pig as a pet -- providing it meets certain size 
and weight requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I heard it, I ran out and picked him up," said Black Jack's owner, 
Laraine Schubert, who drove to Kern County to get the black-haired, 110-pound 
pig. "But I would have kept him here anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 No one testified for or against the ordinance at the City Council's meeting 
Monday night. A final vote is scheduled Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no opposition," said Brian N. Hawley, director of community 
development. "It really is not that big of a deal, but unfortunately at the 
time, we didn't have any regulations for these animals to live in urban zones." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council made the ordinance parallel the 1992 Los Angeles County 
ordinance, which allows potbellied pigs no taller than 20 inches, longer than 
40 inches and weighing 120 pounds or less to be kept in single-family 
residences in unincorporated areas of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawley called Schubert and told her about the vote Monday and said she could 
bring the pig back home six weeks ahead of time. The ordinance will be in 
effect 30 days after the final vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any reason to wait until the ordinance passes," he said, 
referring to the month waiting period before the law takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 But all isn't as easily forgotten for Black Jack, who didn't know why he had 
to leave the home he grew up in and was angry when Schubert arrived to pick him 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really (mad) at me," Schubert said. "I put in all new lawn for him and 
now he is rooting it." 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Schubert urged the council to look at the legalization of potbellied 
pigs after city code enforcement officers ordered her to get rid of Black Jack 
and another pig because they violated city laws making it illegal to keep farm 
animals in a residential area.  
</P>
<P>
 An acquaintance of Schubert reported her to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to move and I got a lot of calls from other people who had pigs 
and didn't want to speak up," Schubert said. "No one really knows that it is OK 
to keep them yet." 
</P>
<P>
 A friend of Schubert's who lives in a rural area of Kern County kept Black 
Jack until Lancaster officials allowed him to return home.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; AUTHORITIES SEEK MORE VICTIMS OF ANTELOPE 
VALLEY RENT SCAM; CRIME: QUAKE-DISPLACED FAMILY AND A BLIND WOMAN ARE AMONG 
THOSE TRICKED INTO PAYING ON FORECLOSED HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Authorities are searching for more victims of an Antelope Valley ring that 
allegedly tricked Southern California residents into paying thousands of 
dollars in rent on homes in foreclosure by out-of-town banks. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unknown how many people were taken in by the scam. People who lost their 
homes in the Northridge earthquake and low-income residents in the San Fernando 
Valley, riot-torn areas and San Bernardino were apparently targeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparent victims so far include an earthquake-displaced family and a legally 
blind woman who was told she had purchased a home using her life savings of 
$7,300 as a deposit. The woman, who is raising a blind child, has no money and 
now faces eviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Louise Johnson of Palmdale, thought to be the front woman for a fraud 
ring involving an undetermined number of associates, pleaded not guilty last 
week to three counts of grand theft by false pretense. She is in custody in 
lieu of $500,000 bail. Her preliminary hearing is scheduled for Tuesday in 
Antelope Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who also goes by the name Mary Thedford, represented herself as the 
owner of several foreclosed homes and rented them to people, said Detective Jan 
Carroll of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's forgery-fraud detail. 
A search warrant was served July 8 at Johnson's Oxford Drive home, where 
deputies found documents pertaining to several residences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a couple of milk crates full of files on homes, each of which we have 
to look into," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson would canvass communities for information about abandoned homes and 
learn from neighbors which houses had absentee landlords and had been 
foreclosed by faraway banks, Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this valley, there are hundreds of homes empty due to foreclosure because 
of the departure of the aircraft industry," Carroll said, calling the area "a 
cherry patch for fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the scam, Carroll said, Johnson would pay the former owner $1,000 
for a quit-claim, allowing her to take over the deed and restart utility 
services, and would change the locks on the residence. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the name of BYOA Properties, a nonexistent real estate operation, 
Johnson advertised for renters after making minor improvements such as painting 
the abandoned buildings, Carroll said. Homes were rented at competitive prices 
and applicants were told to fill out credit forms and lease agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants paid a security deposit and rent for several months. Early eviction 
notices they received were explained as oversights by the bank, Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of dollars were usually collected before the fraud was discovered -- 
sometimes only when sheriff's deputies arrived and told tenants their rental 
agreement was invalid. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate officials say renters have few ways to avoid such a scam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what they could have looked for," admitted Carlene Lampela, vice 
president of the Antelope Valley Board of Realtors. "We're basically pretty 
trusting. You try the best you can and sometimes you can still get (swindled)." 
</P>
<P>
 Lampela said renters should talk to neighbors to determine who owns a home and 
if it has been either vacant for a long time or rundown. They can also ask a 
title company for a property profile, which would show if a home has a large, 
outstanding mortgage from a foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these people are so slick, there's not much you can do," Lampela 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's detectives certainly consider Johnson slick. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who is in her 50s, told renters she attends a prominent San Fernando 
Valley church, even featuring an icthys -- the Christian fish symbol -- on her 
business cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "The woman is very good," said a relative of an alleged victim. "She had all 
the right answers. It wasn't until the very end when she was backed into a 
corner that she came out fighting." 
</P>
<P>
 When Johnson's bail was set at $100,000 following her arrest July 8, she 
posted the money two days later through a bail bonds agency. The collateral for 
the bond was a deed for a home Johnson doesn't own, Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the bail bonds agency brought Johnson back into custody 
July 13 with a ruse, telling the woman she would be released on her own 
recognizance and could collect the $5,000 posted for the bond.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: CALIFORNIA'S CHANGING BANKING SCENE; BANKS' EARNINGS 
BODE WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having confounded the doomsayers who thought California's deep recession would 
exact a much more painful toll, the state's major banks and S&Ls are rolling in 
black ink again. 
</P>
<P>
 In a flurry of second-quarter earnings announcements Tuesday, Wells Fargo & 
Co., First Interstate Bancorp and H.F. Ahmanson & Co. all reported strong 
year-over-year gains. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers are important for more than just the companies' shareholders. 
Rising bank earnings, at a time when the California economy overall still is 
struggling, provide those lenders with greater wherewithal -- and incentive -- 
to make local loans and thus help underwrite the economy's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The banks' gains also reflect, in part, the fact that a recovery is occurring 
-- even though it may be tenuous in some regions of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl E. Reichardt, Wells Fargo's chief, said that "a weak recovery appears to 
have taken hold in the California economy." While Wells' loans outstanding at 
June 30 were $34.17 billion, down slightly from $34.35 billion a year ago, 
Reichardt noted that the total rose 2% in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 At First Interstate, the numbers look considerably better on the lending side, 
even allowing for the growth that has occurred through the company's many 
acquisitions of smaller banks. Corporate-wide, which includes operations in 13 
western states, First Interstate said its net loans rose 7.8% in the second 
quarter from the first quarter, to $27.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In California alone, commercial lending grew at a double-digit rate in the 
second quarter, the company said. "We're seeing terrific growth on the 
commercial side," asserted David Holman, head of First Interstate's corporate 
banking department in California. 
</P>
<P>
 At San Francisco-based Union Bank, the state's fourth-largest commercial bank, 
President Kanetaka Yoshida said commercial, industrial and consumer lending 
rose in the second quarter, while real estate construction lending declined. 
Overall, he said, the bank is seeing a "gradual recovery of the economic 
environment in California." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time that the banks are benefiting from rising loan demand, their 
bottom lines are improving for another reason: Fewer existing loans are going 
bad -- another indication that the state economy is getting better. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells Fargo, for example, said total non-performing and restructured loans 
fell to $717 million at June 30, compared to $900 million at March 31 and $1.91 
billion on June 30, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmanson, parent of Home Savings, said its non-performing assets slipped $14 
million in the second quarter to $943 million, the lowest level since 1990. 
Ahmanson last year sold off $1.2 billion in bad loans, which helped clear its 
books but also raised fears that more problem loans had yet to surface. So far 
this year, however, the quality of Ahmanson's portfolio has continued to 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest surprise for California banks in the first half of this 
year has been their ability to weather the sharp rise in short-term interest 
rates, as the Federal Reserve Board has tightened credit for the first time in 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Fed boosts short rates, banks' cost of funds -- mainly in the form of 
deposits -- is supposed to rise. Though banks also tend to increase loan rates 
as well in times like this, the spread between deposit costs and loan rates 
often narrows significantly as the economy expands -- with the net effect of 
squeezing profits. 
</P>
<P>
 But that hasn't been a major problem for many California banks this year. 
First Interstate's net interest margin actually rose in the second quarter, to 
5.10% from 4.99% in the second quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells Fargo's net interest margin was 5.56% in the first half of this year, 
off only marginally from 5.81% in the first half of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For California's big banks and some S&Ls, the relative strength in their net 
interest margins is a gift from a lot of mom and pop savers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Californians left surprisingly large sums of money in low-yielding bank 
savings accounts and CDs over the past three years, even as short-term interest 
rates fell to 30-year lows. That provided the banks with a core of cheap money 
with which to fund themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "First Interstate has had the lowest core deposit costs in the industry for at 
least 10 years," marvels Mark Lynch, analyst at Lehman Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, even as interest rates on short-term U.S. Treasury bills have 
surged with the Fed's tightening, some California banks have managed to retain 
deposits with only minor increases in CD yields. Wells Fargo, for example, now 
pays 3.7% on a one-year CD, far below the 4.3% average yield of 30 major 
California institutions tracked by RateGram newsletter. Yet Wells' total 
deposits have held steady at $40 billion for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 So long as their deposits stay put, most California banks and S&Ls have little 
incentive to engage in a price war for funds that would drive up CD yields. The 
end result is that the biggest institutions are in stronger control of their 
own destinies: They can compete aggressively for loans to boost income, without 
fear of the cost side of the equation coming back to haunt them. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, says Lynch, the banks "are making money off their depositors and 
giving it to the borrowers" in the form of loan incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 For investors, all of this means there's still potential to make money in some 
of the best-known California bank and S&L stocks, many analysts say. Even 
though most of the stocks have jumped over the past two years, anticipating the 
current earnings recovery, the bulls argue that the surprise could be in the 
magnitude of California bank and S&L earnings gains in 1994 and 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Those gains should beat what companies in many other industries are capable 
of, the bulls say. At the same time, high dividend yields on the bank and S&L 
stocks (often 3.5% or better) and low price-to-earnings ratios should increase 
their allure for investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, for example, believes that First Interstate shares, now $78, could 
reach $100 in 12 months as earnings expand. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Gordon, analyst at Paine Webber, sees 20% capital gains potential in 
shares of Ahmanson and Great Western Financial from current levels. And don't 
forget that those California lenders, and others, also could be takeover 
targets, Gordon says: As the California recovery gains steam, more out-of-state 
banking giants are likely to buy their way into the Golden State. The 
Californians

TURNER STILL HAS HIS EYES SET ON OWNING CBS; TELEVISION: CABLE MOGUL WOULD HAVE 
TO GIVE UP SOME ASSETS; EXPERTS DOUBT HE WILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN LIPPMAN and KATHRYN HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1985, cable mogul Ted Turner mounted a hostile $5.4-billion bid for CBS 
Inc., only to be foiled after the network countered by putting a costly 
refinancing plan into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 But Turner's appetite for a broadcast network has never abated. He recently 
made an effort to buy NBC, but he encountered opposition from some of his own 
board members as well as NBC's owners at General Electric. Now, in the wake of 
the failed CBS-QVC merger, Turner is re-examining his options. And in typical 
Turner style, he's done little to hide his ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 During a retreat for top cable industry executives last week on Cape Cod, the 
Turner Broadcasting System chief kept excusing himself from meetings to dash 
into another room, where he could be overheard bellowing into the phone: "With 
(QVC Chairman) Barry (Diller) out, we've got to go in there! . . . I can hold 
the TV stations in my own name!" 
</P>
<P>
 The startled cable executives quickly realized that Turner had his sights set 
again on CBS and was rushing to get some answers from his advisers before 
leaving on a chartered jet for St. Petersburg, Fla., and the Turner-sponsored 
Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although CBS Chief Executive Laurence A. Tisch said Tuesday at a news 
conference that his network is not for sale, that stance is viewed skeptically 
because last month he agreed to the QVC merger and new management. In making a 
play for CBS, however, Turner could face even greater opposition from his two 
largest shareholders, Denver-based cable TV giant Tele-Communications Inc. and 
entertainment colossus Time Warner Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 As cable TV system operators, TCI and Time Warner would be forced to reduce 
their stake if Turner acquired a network of TV stations, because federal rules 
severely restrict cross-ownership of cable and broadcast properties. Analysts 
agree that neither Time Warner nor TCI would reduce its position in Turner -- a 
vital programming supplier -- without extracting big concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner, for example, has indicated that it would give up its 19% stake in 
exchange for certain Turner programming assets. Cash wouldn't do, sources say, 
because Time Warner would have to pay onerous taxes on its original investment 
in Turner. So far, Turner has not been willing to part with any assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Turner and Time Warner reached an agreement, no one's sure that TCI 
Chief Executive John C. Malone would go along with the plan unless TCI also 
received some programming asset. "I can't believe he's going to let Time Warner 
walk away without his getting something too," one executive said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Turner assets include the CNN and Headline News services and four 
entertainment networks: TBS, TNT, The Cartoon Network and Turner Classic 
Movies. Since 1985, Turner has owned the MGM and pre-1948 Warner Bros. film 
libraries; last year the company acquired Castle Rock Entertainment and New 
Line Cinema, two leading independent production companies. 
</P>
<P>
 If Turner pursues a traditional network, it would make no sense to part with 
CNN or Headline News because Turner could merge his news operation with that of 
the more established network. Such a combination would save $400 million, by 
one analyst's estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 So any negotiation would likely center on Turner's entertainment assets -- 
which would be painful, since these programming services are growing faster 
than the older news operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1993, for example, the Wall Street firm of Gerard Klauer Mattison & 
Co. hypothesized that Time Warner could swap its Turner stock for the two film 
libraries and Cartoon Network in a deal worth roughly $1.25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nandita Parker, the firm's entertainment analyst, noted Tuesday that the 
Cartoon Network alone could be worth as much as $2 billion because it has 
tremendous untapped potential as a mass-appeal network. So far, it has had 
limited distribution because older cable TV systems don't have enough channel 
capacity for newer services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Parker is one of the analysts who thinks Turner yearns for a network. 
"If there's a time to do it, it's now," she said, "But how do you do it at this 
stock price? (Turner) shares are undervalued and CBS is near its high." 
</P>
<P>
 On the American Stock Exchange, Turner Class A shares closed Tuesday at 
$18.25, up 25 cents but still near the 52-week low of $17. CBS shares fell $5 
to $307 on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock's 1994 high was $323.75.  
</P>
<P>
 Although their chief executive pines for a network, some Turner executives are 
divided about the desirability and feasibility of owning one, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, at an Allen & Co. conference in Sun Valley, Ida., some Turner 
executives expressed the view that a network acquisition would be untenable 
because of regulatory problems and the likely opposition of key Turner 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'd love to do it, but (Time Warner Chief Executive) Gerry Levin is not 
going to let him do it," said one person close to the Turner board. "It's clear 
it's creating a big level of frustration with Ted." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ted is an idea a day, but he's got to solve his corporate governance problems 
first," added another knowledgeable source. "And giving up one of his crown 
jewels would be very painful." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Wolzien, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. who recently met with 
Turner executives, said company officials were exploring ways in which TBS' 
cable owners might shift to non-voting stock and move off the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a difficult process," Wolzien said. "Either Time Warner has to have a 
reason to agree to do it, or there's a Draconian process by which one 
shareholder can be forced to buy out the other. It's risky, too, because the 
first guy who's making the offer can be bought out himself."

NEWS ANALYSIS; U.S. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK BETTER THAN IT SEEMS?; TRADE: NEW FIGURES 
INDICATE LARGEST TRADE DEFICIT IN SEVEN YEARS, BUT AMERICAN EXPORTS ARE SEEN AS 
POISED FOR HUGE RALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN PETERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The trade deficit ballooned in May to $9.2 billion, in what could be lamented 
as the latest U.S. setback in a hostile world economy. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the news might seem bleak: The 1994 trade gap is on track to 
be the largest in seven years, and imports flooded in at record levels, 
according to Commerce Department figures released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But high anxiety over the trade gap and the dollar's recent assault in 
currency markets is distracting attention from a much more positive reality, 
economists say. U.S. exports are finally poised for a rally, one that could 
provide a crucial boost to the aging national recovery in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 The key: a fortuitous turn of the economic cycle, with major overseas 
economies in Japan and Western Europe starting to recover -- just when the U.S. 
recovery may be slipping past its prime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're counting on exports to help keep the expansion going in 1995 and 1996," 
said Robert F. Wescott, chief economist at the White House Council of Economic 
Advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 Such hopes might sound surprising in light of the recent evidence. The trade 
gap -- the difference between how much the nation buys from abroad and how much 
it sells -- surged almost 8% in May, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit in goods is headed beyond $140 billion this year, the worst 
performance since 1987. Overall trade with Western Europe stands out as a weak 
spot, economists said, with last year's U.S. surplus sinking to a $1.5-billion 
deficit so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, "the real story is that the United States is becoming more 
competitive," said economist David B. Bostian Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the U.S. recovery's life span and vitality could be influenced heavily 
by this little-understood reality. In a new blue chip survey of 50 economists, 
American exports to foreign customers topped the list of forces seen as 
strengthening the national economy next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say an unusual confluence of forces could magnify the significance of 
foreign consumers to America's recovery in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, U.S. makers of cars, chemicals, paper goods and other products are 
enjoying a rising demand for their products, following a notably weak 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Gulf of Mexico, Union Carbide factories have stepped up sales of 
specialty petrochemicals used for paint solvents to meet European demand that 
has increased about 5% in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a gradual but noticeable improvement since the beginning of the 
year," said Irv H. Agard, Union Carbide's director of financial planning and 
analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, executives at paper maker Georgia-Pacific Corp. noticed a jump 
in demand from their customers in Italy and Britain. As the pickup spread to 
Germany and France, it has tested the limits of their U.S. mills, already 
straining near capacity.  
</P>
<P>
 "The demand from customers is beyond what we can supply," company spokesman 
Ken Haldin said. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its seeming gloom, at least a few clues to the shifting picture can be 
found in the fine print of Tuesday's trade report. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, U.S. exports of industrial engines are up 20% over the first 
five months of 1993, for example. Exports of computers are up 13%, 
semiconductors 30% and telecommunications equipment 21%.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're increasingly competitive in the areas that are important to us," said 
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.  
</P>
<P>
 Overall, U.S. merchandise exports are up 5.7%, according to the latest data; 
that is somewhat higher than last year's rise of 3.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 The gains, while limited, encourage those who are searching for continued 
sources of U.S. growth. The peak levels of housing and auto sales, for example, 
may already be over, many believe, factors that could slow the economy in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "That leaves you one thing: exports," Bostian said. "It's a critical bright 
spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Optimists also cite a somewhat crumpled dollar as a sign of trade gains to 
come. 
</P>
<P>
 The greenback's recent travails in the global currency markets have inspired 
disturbing headlines and been explained as a rebuke to U.S. leadership in the 
world. But when it comes to exports, the reality of the slide is benign. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: A cheaper dollar may translate to cheaper prices against products 
from America's strong-currency rivals, notably Japan and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some experts believe that a much more intriguing phenomenon is 
taking place than a mere shift in the exchange rate or turn in the business 
cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent progress in U.S. technology, quality and manufacturing efficiency are 
increasingly being rewarded in the global marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something at work other than economic growth and changes in the 
dollar," said Ross C. DeVol, an economist with WEFA Group in suburban 
Philadelphia. "Our underlying competitiveness has improved." 
</P>
<P>
 DeVol believes he sees evidence of the fundamental change in America's recent 
trade performance with Britain and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of those nations emerged from recession by 1992. And in both cases, U.S. 
exports soared beyond trends established in previous overseas recoveries, he 
calculates. Exports to Britain shot up by more than 17% last year -- six 
percentage points more than past history would suggest -- and they surged by 
more than 12% to Canada, possibly three percentage points above past trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that holds true for Japan and Germany, we could be looking at an export 
boom" in the near future, he predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this means that a swollen trade deficit, indefinitely maintained, is 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 It can encourage foreign investors to unload their holdings in a country as 
the nation's currency drops. The United States has experienced some of this 
effect this year, as Japanese have slashed purchases of U.S. assets.  
</P>
<P>
 Nor does it mean that the trade deficit is going to narrow swiftly.  
</P>
<P>
 Rising interest rates threaten to have a party-pooping effect on Europe's 
nascent recoveries by limiting their ability to pull in U.S. goods. Americans, 
meanwhile, are expected to maintain their appetite for foreign products -- 
ensuring a tremendous monthly import bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising economies overseas "should give us a nice boost in exports," said 
economist David Wyss at DRI-McGraw Hill in Lexington, Mass. "But they're not 
going to solve all our problems."  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. expansion is still expected to outpace those of its major trading 
partners until mid-1995, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At about that time, the trade gap is forecast to narrow, helped along by 
growing U.S. exports, declining imports in a weaker U.S. economy and the 
dollar's favorable, relatively low exchange rate.  
</P>
<P>
 In May, U.S. goods exports edged up 0.2% to $40.4 billion, paced by sales of 
office equipment. The goods deficit with Japan declined to $4.4 billion from 
$5.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising oil prices pushed America's foreign-oil bill up by $339 million. 
Imports of clothing, iron and steel and telecommunications equipment also 
contributed to the nation's $54.5-billion tab for merchandise imports.  
</P>
<P>
 The total deficit in goods was $14.1 billion, $700 million higher than April. 
Services -- a category that includes tourism, education and health care -- 
registered a $4.9-billion surplus, up slightly from April. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the improving outlook, "we have such a long way to go, it gives you 
pause," said Laurence H. Meyer, a private economic forecaster in St. Louis.

JAMES FLANIGAN: CALIFORNIA'S FINANCIAL ILLS CALL FOR DRASTIC MEDICINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What should California do to end its chronic budget crises? It should change 
rather than raise many of its taxes -- lower the rate, broaden the base and 
amend Proposition 13. It should change its Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Its citizens -- all of us -- should come to a consensus about what kind of 
state this is to be and then pursue serious policies to achieve those goals. 
</P>
<P>
 California should repent and reform, in short. If some recommendations being 
made by citizens groups and credit experts sound like a 12-step program to 
fiscal health, that's understandable. To the world that lends California money, 
the state these days looks like a credit card junkie whose word and good 
intentions are no longer trusted. 
</P>
<P>
 The state tries to borrow $4 billion today, partly to roll over some of the 
chronic budget deficits it has run since 1990. The notes, called revenue 
anticipation warrants, will probably sell briskly because a consortium of banks 
led by Bank of America -- itself a survivor of near-bankruptcy in the mid-1980s 
-- is acting as co-signer. 
</P>
<P>
 For a fee of about $30 million, the banks are guaranteeing Sacramento's 
credit, and the state has also pledged that if it doesn't meet budget targets 
in the next two years, across-the-board cuts in spending will be imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Such terms are more fitting to a less developed country than a state of 30 
million people with an advanced economy larger than that of most nations. But 
California's economic standing ain't what it used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The major credit-rating agencies, Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch 
Investors, lowered California's bond rating again last week. In three years, 
the rating has fallen from AAA, the highest, to A, the rank above speculation. 
That may add $30 million in interest to the state's yearly bill for servicing 
$9 billion in general obligation debt. 
</P>
<P>
 So, along with the banks' fee, the lack of budget discipline will cost 
California taxpayers an extra $60 million this fiscal year, even though the 
state's economy is improving. 
</P>
<P>
 That's just the point. "The fact that the economy is improving underscored the 
state's lack of willingness to address critical budget issues, which is the 
real reason for downgrading," says George Leung, vice president of Moody's 
Investors Service. 
</P>
<P>
 But darkest before dawn may be the applicable cliche here. We should keep in 
mind that the state's problems can be solved with good sense and good will. So 
it's encouraging that citizens groups working on well-reasoned remedies are a 
statewide phenomenon right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Several suggestions would raise revenues to cover this year's $3-billion 
deficit -- in a $40-billion budget -- and the accumulated deficits from recent 
years, which total more than $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 A leading suggestion is that the state extend the sales tax to services, where 
now it is imposed only on merchandise. That could raise $1.7 billion a year and 
makes good sense. It's goofy to tax payments for the mops and brooms people buy 
to clean their own houses but not to tax payments made for housecleaning 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An even better idea than simply raising a tax would be to broaden the sales 
tax to include services but lower the tax rate to give a break to merchandise, 
and be revenue-neutral. That way the budget would get not just a quick fix, but 
more intelligent and equable financing long-term. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar approach could reform Proposition 13, which has limited property 
taxes since 1978. "It's a profound disincentive to new business," says Stephen 
Levy, chief economist of the Center for the Continuing Study of the California 
Economy in Palo Alto. "New business owners must pay higher property taxes than 
competitors who are grandfathered in." 
</P>
<P>
 A solution would be to change Proposition 13's limits on property tax 
increases but broaden the base by reassessing taxes on old properties. Such a 
reform could spur real estate activity as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Current and past deficits are not the thorniest problem. With political will, 
cuts can be made in some Medicaid services that go beyond federal requirements, 
or in prison expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Citizens Budget Commission, a bipartisan group, will suggest later this 
month that the accumulated deficit be financed with a onetime, long-term 
municipal bond. That way costs of the recent recession can be paid over a 
decade or so. 
</P>
<P>
 But dealing with the so-called future deficit is harder. That's the estimated 
$2 billion that California has been underspending on infrastructure and higher 
education -- so that its once proud university system is now frayed and 
crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to come up with public money for such purposes -- despite 
support from the business community -- because there is no consensus among 
people and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are unwilling to vote any money to the politicians, because they don't 
trust the government," says Eugene Smolensky, dean of the school of public 
policy at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 To break that impasse, a state commission is deliberating constitutional 
revision. It is taking up such questions as whether a two-thirds legislative 
majority should be required for all tax measures, whether to amend Proposition 
13 and how to adapt California's initiative system to the needs of a 
contemporary economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In place of debate about what kind of California its people want, the state 
right now is receiving demagoguery, as in Gov. Pete Wilson's attacks on 
immigrants. Nobody can be for illegal immigration -- the border must be 
controlled. But some recognition is needed that the children of immigrants are 
a resource to be educated for the state's future. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That's not sentiment. When the credit-rating agencies see political escapism, 
they get nervous and downgrade the state's bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 When they see decision making and policy, they raise a state's ratings. 
Massachusetts, which went through a severe recession and made significant 
budget cuts, has come back to an A rating from Baa. New Mexico, which suffered 
in the energy downturn and as a result diversified its economy, has recovered a 
bond rating higher than California's. 
</P>
<P>
 What should California do? Get serious, or get poorer.

 Saturn Reins In Price Hikes: In an aggressive move to re-establish its value 
image, the General Motors Corp. unit said it is raising 1995 sticker prices by 
an average of only 1.5%, or $170 a car, which is below the hikes announced by 
GM's other North American vehicle units and Ford Motor Co.Saturn's increases 
include the cost of a standard passenger air bag and other new items. Saturn 
kept the prices of its base SL sedan and SW1 wagon unchanged at $9,995 and 
$11,695, respectively. Saturn's biggest base price increase was $200, or 1.9%, 
on the SL1 sedan, to $10,995.

 Infant Teethers Recalled: The Consumer Product Safety Commission announced the 
action on about 9,000 teethers, either pink or blue, that are scented and were 
sold mainly at Dollar Bill Stores nationwide.The teethers, imported from China 
and distributed by Remco Toys Co./Azrak International Inc., contain a toxic 
substance that can irritate children's eyes, the commission said. No illnesses 
have been reported. The teethers should be returned to the stores where they 
were bought for refunds.

BIG CALIFORNIA LENDERS REPORT RISE IN PROFIT; BANKS: WELLS FARGO, FIRST 
INTERSTATE, GREAT WESTERN AND H.F. AHMANSON POST GAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports

<P>
 Four of California's biggest lending institutions reported higher 
second-quarter earnings Tuesday, as the state's fledgling recovery helped boost 
their new business and reduce losses from loans made during the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bank, 
Chatsworth-based Great Western Financial and Irwindale-based H.F. Ahmanson were 
among the lenders who posted higher profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, New York-based Citicorp -- the nation's largest financial 
institution -- led a group of five huge New York banks that also said their 
second-quarter earnings climbed. The gains came even though many of them 
continued to be pounded by trading losses in financial derivatives. But despite 
the earnings gains, most banking stocks fell after Chase Manhattan Corp. warned 
that heavy competition for loans and credit cards could push its profit lower 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lower loss provisions boosted earnings at Wells Fargo, which posted a 
second-quarter net of $206 million, or $3.57 a share. It earned $149 million, 
or $2.46 a share, a year ago. Provisions for losses dropped to $60 million from 
$140 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the company announced that its chief executive, Carl E. Reichardt, 
will retire by the end of this year but will remain a board member. It also 
said it will buy back up to 5.4 million shares of its common stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * First Interstate said its second-quarter profit jumped 53% to $208.2 
million, or $2.38 a share. It earned $136 million, or $1.60 a share, in the 
second quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank credited the gains to greater loan volume, higher consumer banking 
fees and a declining number of bad loans. It did not set aside any funds to 
cover loan losses in this year's second quarter, compared to a provision of 
$26.1 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * H.F. Ahmanson, parent of Home Savings of America, said it earned $73.54 
million in the second quarter, or 51 cents a share. A year ago, it lost nearly 
$291 million, or $2.55 a share, after making a bulk sale of $1.2 billion in bad 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 * Great Western Financial, parent of Great Western Bank, eked out a small 
earnings gain. The company's second-quarter earnings totaled $55.86 million, or 
38 cents a share, compared to a year-earlier $52.59 million, or 35 cents a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 Great Western set aside $52.9 million for loan losses in the second quarter of 
this year, compared to $85.5 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * Citicorp, the nation's largest bank, said its earnings nearly doubled to 
$877 million, or $1.83 a share, from $446 million, or 88 cents a share, a year 
ago. This year's results included $150 million in tax benefits and $74 million 
in gains from asset sales. 
</P>
<P>
 The gain came despite a sharp plunge in its trading revenue, to $159 million 
in this year's second quarter from $572 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chemical Bank Corp. said its second-quarter earnings rose 9%. The nation's 
No. 3 banking company had net income of $357 million, or $1.28 a share, 
compared to a year-earlier operating profit of $327 million, or $1.14 a share. 
In last year's second quarter, a $54-million tax benefit made net income $381 
million, or $1.35 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chase Manhattan Corp., the nation's No. 6 bank, said its second-quarter 
earnings climbed 32% to $307 million, or $1.46 a share, from $233 million, or 
$1.20 a share, a year ago. Lower loss reserves and higher fee revenue offset a 
sharp drop in trading revenue, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the earnings reports released Tuesday were in line with 
analysts' expectations, many banking stocks fell after Chase Manhattan said its 
second-half profit could be hurt as lenders come under increasing pressure by 
consumers to lower their loan and credit card rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Many financial institutions have been forced to slash their rates to get new 
customers and keep existing ones, Chase Manhattan said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Banc One Corp. said its second-quarter earnings climbed to $316 million, or 
81 cents a share, from $282 million, or 73 cents a share, in the second quarter 
of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ohio-based bank said it also had its share of bad derivative investments 
in this year's second quarter but that those losses were offset by lower 
provisions for loan losses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mellon Bank Corp. of Pittsburgh said its second-quarter net jumped 35% to 
$134 million, or $1.80 a share, from $99 million, or $1.32 a share, in the same 
period a year ago. It credited much of the gain from higher fees at its Boston 
Co. operations and last year's acquisition of Afco Credit Corp.

 Nigerian Strike Shuts Second Chevron Field: A Chevron Corp. representative 
would not identify the field, which is in the Escravos region of Nigeria, or 
give production figures. Chevron's operations in Nigeria "are continuing, but 
we are obviously impacted by the strike activity," spokeswoman Jan Golon said. 
Some 60,000 oil and gas workers from two unions are on strike, demanding that 
the military regime pay off $500 million owed to joint-venture partners and 
release jailed leaders, among them Mashood Abiola, who is believed to have won 
the presidency last year before the military annulled the elections.

HONDA PLANS MAJOR EXPANSION IN U.S., CANADA; AUTOS: NEW PRODUCTION GOALS MEAN 
MORE THAN 1,000 JOBS. CURRENCY VALUES FIGURE IN THE MOVE.

 Honda Motor Co. said Tuesday that it will hire 1,100 workers and invest $310 
million to expand its automobile manufacturing, research and development and 
export activities in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 The action gives Honda's top officials in Torrance more autonomy in decisions 
affecting the North American market. It also gives those officials control over 
the development of markets in Central and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honda in North America will expand its capabilities to become a self-reliant, 
globally integrated company," Koichi Amemiya, president of American Honda Motor 
Co., told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion comes as Japanese auto makers have been hurt by the rise of the 
yen against the dollar. By moving more manufacturing to North America, Honda 
can minimize the impact of currency fluctuations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes a lot of sense for Honda," said Chris Cedergren, an analyst with 
Auto Pacific Group, a Santa Ana-based consultant. "Other Japanese manufacturers 
are following the same plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Honda's North American expansion is part of a broader reorganization, 
announced in May, that focuses the company's operations on four regions: North 
and South America, Europe and Africa, Asia and the Pacific and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is the largest investment Honda has made in North America since 1987, when 
the auto maker decided to build a second assembly plant in Ohio and expand its 
U.S. research and development efforts.  
</P>
<P>
 Honda plans to expand the capacity of assembly plants in Ohio and Canada by 
18% to 720,000 vehicles a year. It will also increase the capacity of its Ohio 
engine factory by 50% to 750,000 units annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the expansion will take place at Honda's East Liberty plant in Ohio, 
which turns out Civic sedans and coupes. The plant's capacity will be raised to 
230,000 vehicles a year from 150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be done without (enlarging) the physical plant," said Takeski 
Yamada, president of Honda's U.S. manufacturing unit. However, about 400 
workers will be added, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Production capacity will be increased by 20,000 vehicles yearly at both the 
Marysville plant in Ohio and the Alliston facility in Ontario, Canada. 
Marysville can turn out 360,000 cars annually now; Alliston's capacity is 
100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda also plans to increase the capacity of its engine plant in Anna, Ohio, 
by 50% by 1998. The plant will be able to produce 750,000 engines a year, among 
them a new V-6 to be produced beginning in 1996. The expansion will cost $200 
million and require 200 additional employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In research and development, the company will greatly increase its ability to 
design vehicles for North America and other markets. Its research and 
development effort is to be expanded to 750 employees from 500 in the next five 
years.  
</P>
<P>
 This will allow the company to develop two Acura models for production in 1996 
-- one for the U.S. and Canadian markets and one solely for Canada. The new 
Acuras will be the first Japanese luxury cars built in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda also plans to step up exports of U.S. and Canadian vehicles to more than 
150,000 vehicles a year, including components sent to other countries for 
assembly. The company said it expects to export about 75,000 vehicles, 
excluding the component kits, to 35 countries this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cedergren said that with Honda's partnership with British-based Rover Group 
(acquired by BMW earlier this year) coming to an end, the Japanese auto maker 
is looking to export cars from North America to Europe and South America. With 
the Rover link dissolving, he said, Honda will not be building an assembly 
plant in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will leverage what they have in North America," he said. "That means 
exporting to Europe and South America."

THOUSANDS IN QUEST TO GET REAL COOL JOB; MARKETING: BEN & JERRY'S SEARCH TO 
FILL ITS TOP EXECUTIVE POST DRAWS A HUGE RESPONSE, SOME OF IT SUPERHUMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A medical librarian bared all in her application. Superman said he'd give up 
his day job. And a variety of children and pets have nominated their parents, 
masters and themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc., the decidedly unconventional maker of premium ice 
cream, is on the hunt for a chief executive to replace co-founder Ben Cohen. He 
plans to let someone with a stronger business background lead the growing 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 By last Friday, 19,352 adults, children, super-heroes and animals had sent in 
applications. More were waiting to be counted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Help! I'm stuck with 'Mr. and Mrs. Fast Track' in California," one toddler 
crayoned on the back of a poster-size photograph of himself next to a Holstein 
cow. "They need new careers and I need a real back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 It all started when Cohen said he planned to get out of day-to-day management 
in favor of marketing and other pursuits. But in typical Ben & Jerry's style, 
Cohen and co-founder Jerry Greenfield turned the search into a marketing event. 
</P>
<P>
 The two unveiled their "Yo! I Want to Be CEO" campaign a month ago, asking 
anyone interested in becoming chief executive to send a 100-word essay and a 
lid from their favorite Ben & Jerry's flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben & Jerry's is hedging its bets, though: It hired an executive search firm 
to supplement the contest. But that hasn't kept the applications, both serious 
and tongue-in-cheek, from flowing in. 
</P>
<P>
 An office in Ben & Jerry's headquarters that was converted into "CEO Command 
Center" is stuffed with applications from all over the country and at least a 
dozen other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some are three-dimensional, some are two-dimensional, some are in a dimension 
beyond this universe," company spokesman Rob Michalak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the medical librarian, for example. Her resume and 100-word essay have 
already been recorded and filed away. But her photo is getting lasting 
attention. In it, she lies surrounded by strategically stacked piles of medical 
textbooks and references. 
</P>
<P>
 She's not wearing a stitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're discovering people of incredible talents," Michalak said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Superhuman talents too. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superman suit sent by Jack Ross Williams of Santa Barbara dangles from the 
ceiling in one corner of the cramped command center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to recent layoffs at a major metropolitan newspaper, I am looking to 
replace my day job," Williams wrote. "After hours I spend my time fighting to 
protect truth, justice and the American Way. Even when I'm not using my powers 
I love to work hard and have a great time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, I seek a position which allows me the opportunity to provide super 
premium ice cream products with maximum value and satisfaction to a deserving 
planet." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, 42, says he has the skills to be CEO and is serious about landing a 
job at the $150-million company. He's an executive at a temporary employment 
company in California and has undergraduate and graduate degrees in business 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Other applicants included dogs and cats. Some wanted the job themselves; 
others suggested their owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Their only incentive to apply, according to a poster promoting the search: "A 
rejection suitable for framing." 
</P>
<P>
 But the burning question remains: Will someone really land the job through the 
contest? Or is this just more Ben & Jerry's hype? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, somebody could actually be included in the process that comes to us by 
way of the poster campaign essay contest," Michalak said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's far from a practical way to land a leader, said James Kennedy, 
publisher of "The Directory of Executive Recruiters" in Fitzwilliam, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a publicity-driven way," he said, "and they're masters at 
publicity."

 Arco Expects Gain From Vastar Sale: The Los Angeles-based oil company said it 
will realize an after-tax profit of about $270 million from selling 17.7% of 
its Houston gas subsidiary, Vastar Resources Inc. Atlantic Richfield Co. sold 
17.25 million shares of Vastar earlier this month for $28 each. The proceeds, 
to be reflected in third-quarter accounts, are to be used for general corporate 
purposes but not to pay debt. The company is also planning a $1-billion sale of 
debt tied to Lyondell Petrochemical Co., of which it owns 49.9%.

defrauding the Transportation Department and concealing assets from the 
airline's creditors. If the defendants, Jeffrey Chodorow, a former Braniff 
chairman, and Scot Spencer, a former president, are convicted of all counts, 
they each face a possible maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and $1 million 
in fines. Braniff stopped operating in July, 1992.

 Three Flight Attendants Charge Co-Workers: The attendants at American Airlines 
filed internal union charges against about 440 fellow members of the Assn. of 
Professional Flight Attendants for crossing the picket line during a five-day 
strike in November. Those named in the charges could be fined or expelled from 
the union if an arbitrator finds them guilty of strike-breaking activities, an 
APFA spokesman said. A company spokesman said the airline will pay for the 
attendants' defense.

FIRST BOSTON DERIVATIVES LOSS TIP OF ICEBERG?; INVESTMENT: FIRM'S $40-MILLION 
DEFICIT COULD BE REPEATED BY ANY ASSET MANAGER, ANALYSTS WARN. 
</P>

 CS First Boston Investment Management's losses on derivatives may be only the 
tip of the iceberg for institutional money managers. 
</P>
<P>
 The asset-management firm lost $40 million on derivatives linked mostly to 
currency rates and reimbursed the accounts of three big institutional investors 
for the loss, people familiar with the firm's actions said Tuesday. They 
declined to be identified. First Boston also recently fired the portfolio 
manager responsible for trading the derivatives and accepted the resignation of 
several senior executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that for months somebody wasn't telling somebody else that 
they were using derivatives," said Eileen Sanders, an analyst at Morningstar 
Inc., a Chicago firm that tracks fund managers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a situation that may soon be repeated elsewhere in the asset-management 
business. "There are bound to be more problems emerging in the next couple of 
months" at other firms, Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives have been under scrutiny lately because of losses suffered by 
corporations, hedge funds and money market funds that invested in them. 
BankAmerica Corp. last month said it spent $67.9 million to cover losses in its 
Pacific Horizon Prime Money Market Fund and its Pacific Horizon Government 
Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Partly as a result, regulators and lawmakers have been looking closely at the 
$14-trillion derivatives market this year. There are two bills pending in the 
Senate and another two in the House, all of which would boost oversight of the 
largely unregulated market. 
</P>
<P>
 First Boston's loss came on a variety of derivatives, some of which were tied 
to the price of currencies, said sources familiar with the situation. A First 
Boston spokesman declined to comment on the investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Walsh, a portfolio manager who was fired by the unit of Swiss bank CS 
Holdings, used derivatives to boost the amount his investments would gain for 
every change in the value of certain currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street firms can concoct customized derivatives that gain, or lose, money 
much faster than the asset to which their value is tied. Walsh could not be 
reached for comment.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; THE PARCHMENT-LESS 
OFFICE COMES TO THE MONASTERY VIA COMPUTER; ENTERPRISE: DATA-ENTRY WORK IS IN 
KEEPING WITH THEIR MEDIEVAL TRADITION OF TRANSCRIPTION. 
</P>

<P>
 When the monks at Holy Cross Abbey in Berryville, Va., need guidance, they 
usually turn to God. But no amount of prayer could help them decipher the 
computer system a donor had given them to improve their fruitcake sales. 
</P>
<P>
 For that help, the Cistercians turned to computer specialist Ed Leonard, an 
acquaintance from Loudoun County. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months, Leonard had streamlined the production and sale of the 
mail-order cakes. But, seeing how easily the monks adapted to using computers 
made him wonder whether the keyboard -- not the kitchen -- might be their most 
promising source of income. 
</P>
<P>
 So Leonard started a much more ambitious project: He quit his job as an 
executive for a computer equipment maker and two years ago founded the 
Electronic Scriptorium, a Sterling, Va.-based business that farms out 
data-entry work to monasteries across the country. Most of the work involves 
creating electronic card catalogues for school and university libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response has been overwhelming," Leonard said. "The monastic community 
has embraced us. Right now, I have more monks than projects for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Several monks say such work not only helps pay their monastery's bills but 
also fits monastic tradition. They point out that monks were the first 
librarians, responsible for the manuscript transcriptions by which important 
writings were copied and distributed in medieval times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our work with the Scriptorium is very much in line with the tradition that 
made monasteries communication centers," said Brother Benedict Simmonds of the 
Berryville monastery, who has served as its liaison with Leonard's company. 
"This work is part of the evolution of monastic usefulness. . . . It's an idea 
that's so right it goes on like a light bulb." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard expects to handle 40 to 50 projects this year. Some monasteries have 
bought computer systems just to work on those jobs; others had already been 
using computers for tasks such as typesetting and stained glass designs. Some 
monks find data-entry work more compatible with their structured lifestyle than 
previous forms of employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Thomas Baxter, who runs the Monastery of the Holy Cross of Jerusalem in 
Chicago, said the monks enter the data at their own pace, between song and 
prayer, and now have more time than they used to for meditation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Leonard's enterprise has not been without controversy. Some monasteries 
have ruled that such work is not in keeping with their austere regimens. Others 
have balked at working with certain companies, such as military contractor 
Martin Marietta Corp., on moral grounds.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; LIVERMORE PORN STORY 
DRAWS FIRE ON INTERNET; THE TIMES SOLICITS READER FEEDBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On July 12, The Times published a story about how a computer at Lawrence 
Livermore National Laboratory was being used to store pornographic photographs 
and distribute them over the Internet. The porn database, which contained more 
than 1,000 images, was discovered by a Times reporter in the course of 
examining illicit activity on the Internet. The article also included details 
about Internet-linked computers at other institutions that were being used to 
distribute stolen computer software. 
</P>
<P>
 The story drew considerable attention from other media organizations around 
the country. It was also the target of vociferous criticism on some Internet 
news groups and computer bulletin boards. Here is a sampling of some of the 
responses from the Internet, most coming under the discussion heading LA Times 
Yellow Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The article, of which I have read only excerpts, is a journalistic hack." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Journalism! I love it. I would probably cancel my subscription except that 
they do have a decent sports section." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Without defending the L.A. Times in general, I think this article was quite 
reasonably written. Sure, some sensational possibilities were brought up, but 
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING ELSEWHERE. . . . Bad stuff is happening on 
the Internet, and people need to know about it." 
</P>
<P>
 * "I found the article to be misleading. It presented far too simplistic a 
view of what is taking place on the net, and therefore failed to be 
informative. . . . The other claim about this being one of the more serious 
breaches of security at the lab is laughable. It's unfortunate that it 
happened, but it had nothing to do with hackers and everything to do with an 
employee misusing lab equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 * "One can only assume that, since the Simpson case is no longer occupying the 
front page, something equally provocative must take its place." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Frankly, why doesn't the idiot media discover that the net is free-form and 
not run by idealistic almost communist sounding writers?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The following electronic mail messages were sent to the reporter who wrote the 
story. (The reporter is now the target of a barrage of electronic junk mail as 
a result of Internet users' ire.):  
</P>
<P>
 * "Your E-Mail address is being widely disseminated on the USENET. Did you 
really write the article? Was it intentional, or are you kinda stoopid? See ya, 
wouldn't want to be ya. The above opinions were formed while under the 
influence of mind-expanding drugs." reptile@kaiwan.com 
</P>
<P>
 * "I did not read your article, but I hear you on NPR. . . . What the heck 
were you doing snooping around on the internet, anyway? . . . I just wish 
somebody would complain that the L.A. Times is hooked to the 
Internet."mmorgan@solar.ee.stcloud.msus.edu 
</P>
<P>
 While some messages criticized particular aspects of the story, the overall 
on-line reaction appeared to reflect: 
</P>
<P>
 * A feeling that the mainstream media do not understand the Internet and the 
on-line world and poke their noses in only to be sensationalistic. 
</P>
<P>
 * The belief that the Internet must remain entirely free of any kind of 
supervision or security procedures lest its very nature be compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 * The resentment members of some communities often feel when the media 
simplify and generalize their activities in order to tell a story that will be 
comprehensible to the world at large. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The story itself and the controversy it has engendered touch on some important 
issues about the Internet, computer security and the role of the media. We 
invite your comments on these issues, with responses to be printed in future 
Cutting Edge sections. Specifically, we are interested in your thoughts on how 
unethical or illegal activity on the Internet can or should be addressed and 
what the news media might do to improve coverage of this complex set of issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The original story is posted on The Well in the Media conference and on the 
Internet in the alt.internet.media-coverage newsgroup. Please keep your 
comments as concise as possible and include a telephone number or some other

 Lou Levinson, a color specialist at MCA/Universal Inc., recalls with little

 "If you're working with a good movie, that's fine, but a bad movie is

film to video -- must scan the same film up to eight times to make it available 
in all of the television formats now used around the world. It's painfully 
repetitive -- and expensive. The first pass can take 30 hours or more, at up to 
$500 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 But with new European, American and Japanese high-definition television 
systems threatening to create the need for even more of the same, film studio 
engineers have joined forces to create a method for transforming film negatives 
to the ones and zeros of the Information Age. 
</P>
<P>
 Their goal: to create an electronic workhorse for the industry called the 
"digital film master," or DFM. If successful, the effort will not only make 
life easier for post-production workers, it will also result in a digital film 
standard that could revolutionize the way Hollywood film archives are managed. 
</P>
<P>
 With a digital duplicate of a film's original negative, a computer workstation 
can be used to transform the images, quickly and economically, into virtually 
any viewing format. Thousands of formatted master tapes that now need to be 
stored and maintained -- and are vulnerable to fading, fires and other dangers 
-- would no longer need such vigilant protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studios feel possibly if they can get a digital representation of the film 
more akin to a computer data storage tape, it might allow them a more secure 
and pristine representation of their investment," says M. Michael D'Amore, vice 
president of business development at Simi Valley-based BTS Broadcast Television 
Systems Inc., one of the key technology companies involved in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The digital film master could help film maintain its position as the 
industry's production standard of choice in an era of steadily improving video 
technology and increasing use of computerized special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Such effects must be reproduced on optical film before they can be edited into 
a motion picture, resulting in a loss of picture quality. With the DFM, 
however, movie makers could potentially create effects directly on the digital 
duplicate, thus gaining better resolution -- and saving time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought if we could find a resolution high enough to capture everything 
that's on the film, we should be able to take that one digital recording and 
make all the other versions we need," says Christopher J. Cookson, senior vice 
president of technical operations for Warner Bros. "It's just a matter of 
putting together the science that already exists with a different set of 
assumptions." 
</P>
<P>
 With current technology, the process for converting a film into multiple video 
formats requires that a work negative, or "interpositive," be struck from the 
original. It is then scanned through a telecine system that translates the 
picture into a digital recording. The telecine can output the image according 
to various specifications. 
</P>
<P>
 The process is repeated to conform to domestic and foreign transmission 
standards as well as the popular viewing formats: a "pan-scan" version that 
selectively frames a film's wider image for TV; a "letterbox," or smaller 
image, that retains a film's original dimensions; and a wide-screen version for 
a new, increasingly popular type of European TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The Film Technology Council of the Motion Picture-Television Industry Assn., 
which is leading the effort, wants to streamline the process to a single scan. 
It believes this will be possible by stretching the limits of high-definition 
television. With an HDTV telecine system that corresponds closely to film's 
35-millimeter screen dimensions, high-resolution images can be scanned to a 
data storage system resembling a large videocassette. 
</P>
<P>
 But creation of a digital film master requires a recording unit with even more 
memory than an HDTV videocassette -- no small challenge. So far, the only 
machine that comes close is an existing HDTV cassette recorder jointly 
developed by BTS and Toshiba Corp. of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 After several months of testing by Warners' Cookson and his team, the recorder 
is now being modified to expand its data storage capacity.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll get there within two years," says D'Amore of BTS. There is no 
question in the minds of its innovators that DFM technology can work. But once 
it does, the group will face another challenge: making the system affordable by 
promoting its adoption as an industry standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to bring down equipment costs, we would probably need the DFM to be 
accepted by film libraries industrywide," says Richard Stumpf, Universal's 
senior vice president of engineering and development. He estimates that each 
library will need to spend about $1.5 million to get the system up and running. 
"But some could share the same facility, and the post-production community 
might even want to offer this as a service," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 To address those and other issues, the technology council invited 
representatives from 10 major film libraries to meet last year. According to 
Update, the trade group's newsletter, the idea was met with "general 
enthusiasm." Creating a Digital Master 
</P>
<P>
 With the advent of high definition television and the proliferation of other 
new television formats around the world, film engineers are searching for a way 
to simplify the process of transferring film images to video. The creation of a 
Digital Film Master would eliminate the need to scan the film negative 
separately for each different video format, and could also be used to build 
secure and versatile digital film archives. CREATING THE DIGITAL FILM MASTER

TEXACO AGREES TO TONE DOWN AD CLAIMS; ENERGY: ARBITRATORS SAY GASOLINE ADDITIVE 
WASN'T TESTED AGAINST RESULTS FROM CHEVRON PRODUCT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under attack by rival Chevron Corp., Texaco agreed Tuesday to change millions 
of dollars' worth of advertising for its much-vaunted new gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 Following recommendations by an advertising industry arbitration group, Texaco 
said it will remove wording that suggests that a new gasoline additive is 
uniquely capable of removing deposits in the engine combustion chamber. Such 
deposits can cause rough idling, poor acceleration and power loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad group found that Texaco failed to test its compound against an existing 
Chevron additive, also used by other unnamed major brands, that could provide 
roughly the same benefit to many drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texaco product, called CleanSystem3, was introduced in March as the first 
gasoline to clean up existing combustion chamber deposits -- a prime objective 
of auto fuel researchers in recent years. Texaco has gained at least 5% in 
gasoline market share since introducing the new additive. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they have shown that it does what they claim . . . but because they did 
not test against this 22% of the market (that uses Chevron's additive), they 
can't make a claim against the whole market," said Robin Rae Kravitz, who 
directed the investigation for the National Advertising Division of the Council 
of Better Business Bureaus, an alternative dispute-resolution organization.  
</P>
<P>
 Though legally non-binding, NAD decisions are generally accepted by companies 
seeking to avoid cumbersome legal challenges from competitors under federal 
false-advertising law. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad group ruled "acceptable hyperbole" ads describing Texaco's fuel as a 
"new generation of gasoline." But it called for dropping such "open-ended 
superlatives" as those claiming that the gasoline offers the "highest" 
performance or "best" mileage -- which it wants changed to "higher" or 
"improved." 
</P>
<P>
 "Texaco is gratified that NAD has confirmed the truthfulness of the core of 
Texaco's advertising claims," the company said in a statement. Though it 
disagreed with the decision, the company said it "will not take issue with the 
modifications proposed by NAD." 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron has used a different additive for 14 years that it claims also cleans 
up combustion chamber deposits. Chevron said it had not made the claim in any 
of its trade literature or retail advertising because the additive 
concentration in gasoline sold at the pump is so low that it takes a long time 
for the fuel to improve the car's performance.  
</P>
<P>
 However, Chevron does advertise that its bottled concentrate sold separately 
at service stations cleans combustion chamber deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a policy not to make cleanup claims (for gasoline) unless a consumer 
can see it in one or two tankfuls," said Carl C. Thut , manager of product 
engineering, for Chevron U.S.A. Products Co.

ILLINOIS CENTRAL TO MERGE WITH K.C. SOUTHERN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Illinois Central Corp. said Tuesday that it agreed to buy Kansas City Southern 
Industries Inc. in a $700-million stock deal, creating a rail network that 
would serve 14 Southern and Midwestern states. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger comes just weeks after Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Pacific, 
two of the largest railroads in the nation, said they would merge in a 
$2.8-billion deal that would create the biggest rail network in the country, 
spanning from the Midwest to the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Illinois Central deal, Kansas City Southern shareholders would 
receive, on a tax-free basis, approximately 21.2 million shares of Illinois 
Central common stock and stock of a company that would hold shares of Kansas 
City Southern's non-rail operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Illinois Central's current trading price of $33 a share, the deal is 
valued at about $700 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Illinois Central said it will assume about $929 million of Kansas 
City Southern debt and provide $6 million to purchase its preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City, Mo.-based Kansas City Southern said it plans to spin off to 
shareholders its non-rail assets, which include DST Systems Inc. and Janus 
Capital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger of the two rail lines would link the geographical markets of 
Chicago; New Orleans; Memphis, Tenn.; Kansas City; Dallas, and Birmingham, Ala. 
The combined railroads would have revenue of more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois Central said it expects a non-cash charge against earnings of 20 
cents to 25 cents a share in the first year from its proposed merger. 
</P>
<P>
 The charge is the result of amortizing about $600 million in good will, 
Illinois Central Chairman Gilbert Lamphere said. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois Central expects growth in its earnings per share starting in the 
second 12 months after the deal is completed, he said, adding that this 
earnings growth should continue for at least two additional years.  
</P>
<P>
 Illinois Central officials said they plan to cut significantly the operating 
ratio at Kansas City Southern while continuing to improve their company's 
ratio. Together, officials said, the railroads will achieve greater efficiency 
than they could separately. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois Central said it has set a goal to reduce its operating ratio, a 
measure of its efficiency, to the mid-60s from about 68.9% currently. Kansas 
City Southern's ratio is roughly 73% to 74%, it said.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials said they see no significant labor reduction occurring 
with the merger. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal requires the approval of the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the 
railroads said they expect approval within a year of submission of the 
application. 
</P>
<P>
 Illinois Central's stock fell 87.5 cents to $32.375 a share, and Kansas City 
Southern's fell $2.50 to close at $40.50, both on the New York Stock Exchange.

PROFITS FALL AT MAJOR WALL STREET FIRMS; EARNINGS: MERRILL LYNCH, LEHMAN BROS. 
REPORT STEEP DROPS IN SECOND-QUARTER INCOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch & Co., the nation's largest brokerage, and Lehman Bros. Holdings 
Inc., the investment banking firm, reported sharp drops in quarterly profit 
Tuesday due to this year's financial market plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokerage analysts said the results continued the recent trend of depressed 
earnings at major Wall Street firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market turned out to be more difficult than many people expected," said 
Raphael Soifer, an industry analyst at Brown Bros. Harriman & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch said its profit dropped by 27% to $251.8 million in the second 
quarter partly due to a sharp drop in global underwriting volume, which cut 
investment banking revenues by 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the 1994 spike in interest rates and volatile currency markets 
eroded revenues from stock, bond and foreign exchange trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch's quarterly profit amounted to $1.18 per share, down from $345 
million, or $1.52 per share, in the same period a year earlier. Revenues were 
$4.48 billion, up 13% from $3.96 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Depressed markets also hurt Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc., the investment banking 
firm that was spun off from American Express Co. this year. Lehman posted a 84% 
net income drop in the second quarter, its first period as an independent 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman Bros. said second-quarter profit dropped to $13 million, or 11 cents 
per share, compared to $83 million for comparable Lehman businesses in the 
year-ago period, when the firm was still owned by American Express. There were 
no per-share figures for the 1993 second quarter because the company was not 
yet public. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenues rose to $2.34 billion from $2.19 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other Wall Street firms, Lehman's underwriting of new stock and bond 
issues declined as a result of the financial market turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland-based TRW Inc. reported a nearly 57% increase in second-quarter 
earnings, chiefly because of strong profit performance from its air bag 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The company reported net income of $86.6 million, or $1.33 per share, on sales 
of $2.32 billion in the second quarter. That's up from earnings of $55.2 
million, or 85 cents per share, on sales of $2.01 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW, which makes parts for the automotive and aerospace industries and 
operates a credit-reporting service, said its air bag business was the 
strongest performer in the quarter. Auto parts sales were up by more than 25% 
and operating profit for the division rose 51% to $119.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales rose slightly in its space and defense segment, but operating profit 
dipped about 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 General Electric Co., boosted by strong gains in nine of its 12 businesses 
reported a 14% jump in second quarter profit. 
</P>
<P>
 The company earned $1.52 billion, or 89 cents a share, in the quarter that 
ended June 30. It earned $1.33 billion, or 78 cents a share, in the second 
quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fairfield, Conn., firm reported revenues of $16.2 billion, a 10% increase 
from $14.8 billion in last year's second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The conglomerate's businesses range from aircraft engines and household 
appliances to broadcasting and financial services. 
</P>
<P>
 Profit from operations at GE Capital Services rose 12% to $463 million, with 
strong results in insurance and equipment management more than offsetting the 
previously announced $29 million loss at its Kidder, Peabody & Co. brokerage 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Results were lower at NBC and GE Aircraft Engines. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE Corp., the nation's largest local phone company, said its second-quarter 
profit rose 8% before gains and charges are figured in. 
</P>
<P>
 Including the special items, profit rose about 35%. The company's net income 
in the quarter that ended June 30 was $595 million, or 62 cents per share. A 
year earlier, GTE earned $438 million, or 46 cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
 During the latest quarter, GTE recorded $71 million in after-tax gains from 
the sale of telephone properties it didn't need. And a year ago, it had a 
special charge of $46 million for employee buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue was $4.96 billion, up from $4.92 billion a year ago, the first 
quarterly increase for GTE in nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamford, Conn-based GTE operating income for its core telephone operations 
business was $1.06 billion, up 6% from a year ago. The number of lines 
increased 5% and usage was up nearly 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint Corp., the third-largest long distance company, reported a 40% increase 
in net income for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint earned $220 million, or 63 cents a share, in the quarter that ended 
June 30. It earned $157 million, or 46 cents a share, in the same period last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue was $3.2 billion, up from $2.8 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kansas City-based company said long-distance operating income increased 
30% from $121 million a year ago to $158 million. Revenue was up 12% from $1.5 
billion to $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer maker Unisys Corp. posted a 51% drop in second-quarter earnings 
chiefly due to weakness in European markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Unisys earned $49.9 million, or 12 cents a share, in the three months ended 
June 30, compared to $103.0 million, or 39 cents a share, during the same 
period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenue declined 7% to $1.80 billion from $1.93 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska Air Group Inc., parent company of Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air, 
reversed last year's second-quarter loss as revenues rose 19% while expenses 
were held to an 11% rise, the company said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Net income for the three months ended June 30 was $9.7 million, or 72 cents 
per share, compared to last year's second-quarter loss of $3.6 million, or 33 
cents per share. Revenues rose to $330.5 million from $277.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska Airlines passenger traffic increased 42% on a capacity increase of 31%. 
The airline's operating costs declined from 10.1 cents to 8.6 cents per 
available seat mile.

STAY-AT-HOME SPOUSES MAY FACE FINANCIAL RISKS; PLANNING: SAFEGUARDS CAN EASE 
EFFECTS OF DEATH OF A WAGE-EARNER, DIVORCE, OR PROFESSIONAL DORMANCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the well-publicized flow of women into the job market, about 4 of 
every 10 mothers of children under age 6 do not work outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22 million American women who are currently non-wage-earning spouses face 
financial hazards their employed counterparts (and their husbands) don't. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, those hazards -- death, divorce and professional dormancy -- 
can be overcome through family financial planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Other safeguards would take acts of Congress to fix. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some financial considerations for families who have assigned one 
spouse (and yes, it's almost always the woman) to stay home with the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retirement planning. People who don't earn wages don't have access to 
retirement savings vehicles. No company pensions, no 401(k) plans, and 
practically speaking, no Individual Retirement Accounts. Wage earners can put 
up to $2,000 a year in deductible or non-deductible IRAs; non-wage earners are 
limited to $250. One possibility is for the stay-at-home spouse to make a point 
of earning $2,000 a year and then designating that total for an annual IRA 
contribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility (but don't hold your breath) is for Congress to pass the 
"IRA Equity Act," a bill that would give housewives and househusbands equal IRA 
access. Modern divorce theory holds that non-working spouses are entitled to 
share in the pension funds accumulated by their working spouses in the event of 
a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 But practically speaking, this doesn't always work out. In order to split the 
funds, couples often must remove them from their tax-deferred shelter, an event 
that frequently leaves the wife with a fraction of the real retirement spending 
power left in her husband's account. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples serious about retirement-fund equality may find it worth buying an 
inexpensive tax-deferred annuity in the wife's name to balance pension savings 
of the husband. 
</P>
<P>
 * Replacement value. An unemployed mother of a 2-year-old can expect to put in 
about $20,000 a year in household labor, according to Cornell University 
researchers W. Keith Bryant and Cathleen Zick. That includes the grunge portion 
of household work -- cleaning, driving, baby-sitting, cooking and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't include the value added by a mother -- serious homework help, 
summer camp selection and the like. How much would it really cost to replace 
all that a mother does if you were buying an insurance policy on her life? 
You're looking at very close to half a million dollars, says Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples in which one spouse earns all the money ought to beef up their term 
coverage for both members during the period when the stay-at-home spouse is 
staying at home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keeping a hand in. Today's stay-at-home mother doesn't look forward to a 
time when her kids are grown and she has time to clean out closets and can 
peaches. She looks forward to going back to work as soon as she's done the bulk 
of her child rearing. To that end, she should keep a hand in her profession, 
even if it requires hiring child care assistance one morning a week to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunches with former co-workers, subscriptions to trade magazines, classes in 
languages or accounting or desktop publishing, high-level volunteer organizing 
and temporary work assignments are all means to that end.

 They are the invisible victims -- peering eyes and straining ears -- watching 
and listening in horror to the kicks and punches and shouts. They are the 
children who witness one parent brutalizing another. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually it is a father savaging a mother with fists or words or both. Usually 
it is a mess -- loud, ugly and vulgar. Sometimes there is blood. Always there 
is unfathomable anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year at least 3 million American children 3 to 17 are exposed to this 
at-home violence, according to Richard Gellis, a University of Rhode Island 
professor who has spent 25 years researching domestic violence. This sometimes 
daily shattering of the family order is a betrayal by the very people they 
depend on for security. Most kids never recover. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 1,421 women died at the hands of their husbands or partners, Gellis 
says. In three-quarters of those cases, a child was watching. 
</P>
<P>
 The children of O.J. and Nicole Brown Simpson have been out of the public eye 
for the six weeks since their mother was murdered and their father accused of 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Sydney, 9, and Justin, 6, who were supposedly asleep during the fatal attack, 
are coping well, according to family reports. 
</P>
<P>
 But if reports of domestic violence in the Simpson household are true, these 
children, like others in similar situations, may face problems in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 At least they have the means to get counseling. Most kids don't have a chance 
to unravel the complicated trauma that results from observing violence. Instead 
they must spend years under the specter of a violent father and demoralized 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts -- psychologists, researchers, sociologists and child advocates -- 
fault "the system" for not rescuing these children. 
</P>
<P>
 There are shelters and programs to protect battered women; the legal system is 
supposed to chase the battering man. But unless children are themselves abused, 
they are frequently left to shuffle behind a shellshocked mother on her road to 
assistance or simply live amid violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people rush in to help a family caught up in violence, the children are 
too often forgotten, " says Deanne Tilton Durfee, executive director of the Los 
Angeles County Inter-Agency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect. There may be 
action to remove custody of the children from the father, but across the 
country there will be no special attention to their emotional needs, adds 
Durfee, who is also chair of the U.S. Advisory Board on Child Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "In L.A. County, we are just beginning to put together a list of therapists 
and grief counselors," she says. "But I fear for all those children quietly 
living a lie." 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the problem is that laws involving child abuse, battered women and 
child abduction evolved separately during the late 1970s and 1980s. And 
advocates for the various groups often compete for the same government dollars, 
which means children's needs often are lost in the competitive shuffle. 
</P>
<P>
 "These problems are all of a piece but unfortunately the laws were all made 
like chopped liver," says Kathryn Turman, a child advocate in Virginia working 
for a nonprofit group there. "If legislators would give up their committee 
chairmanships and work together, we could have a coherent strategy to help 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 In an experimental program to coordinate services for victimized children in 
the Tampa, Fla., area, police are being trained to at least be aware if there 
are children home when they respond to domestic abuse calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cops are among the few public officials to regularly make house calls," 
Turman says. "They should know if there are kids home." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Turman went along with two sheriff's deputies responding to a beating 
complaint. The deputies, who had been to this home several times, said they 
didn't know if the couple had children. This time, while one deputy was 
subduing the fuming man, the other noticed a spelling book on a coffee table 
and began to search. Finally, in the master bedroom, she heard a noise coming 
from the closet. Inside, three small children were huddled together. The older 
brother had a gun. Whenever a fight broke out, he would grab the gun and hide 
the other children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Tampa police, the sheriff's department, any number of people had been in 
that house without paying any attention to those kids," Turman says. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of this project a new question was added to the police incident 
report: "Is a Child Present?" If that box is checked, several other questions 
are asked and the information about the children is fed into a computer that 
draws reports from other agencies that deal with children.  
</P>
<P>
 "The ultimate goal is to identify kids who are victims of abuse or 
maltreatment and deal with them," Turman says. 
</P>
<P>
 About half the children who witness their mothers being beaten are also abused 
themselves, numerous studies confirm. But Gellis says it's actually much worse 
for the children to watch abuse than to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The learning experience is stronger," he says. "There are more suicide 
attempts, more dysfunction in school, more likelihood of violence later in 
life, more withdrawal. More everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnessing domestic violence affects children of different ages in different 
ways. The problems can start in the womb. 
</P>
<P>
 Several studies suggest that mothers who report high levels of stress during 
pregnancy, such as from violence, tend to have babies who are hyperactive and 
developmentally delayed. Very young children often have the worst physical 
reactions. One psychologist recalled treating a toddler who would spontaneously 
get diarrhea every time his parents started fighting. More typically the 
younger children exhibit a type of social autism: They speak very little, show 
self-destructive behavior, cling to their caretakers and suffer short-term 
depression, sleep disorders and heavy separation anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 Gellis says he has seen children as young as 4 show signs of post-traumatic 
stress syndrome, usually associated with rape victims or Vietnam veterans. 
"It's very scary to see this in one so young," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Older children and teen-agers tend to try to get in between their parents in 
what has been dubbed "the Bill Clinton phenomenon." As a young teen, Clinton 
reportedly stood up to his mother's second husband several times, but on one 
pivotal occasion in 1960 grabbed his stepfather by the arm, looked him in the 
eye and said "Hear me. Never ever touch my mother again." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a dramatic stand can be physically risky, but sometimes the child is 
emboldened by an emotional need to make things "right." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The children who seem to suffer the most are ages 5 to 10, according to most 
experts. They know what's going on but they're too little and too weak to do 
anything about it. They experience hopelessness and sometimes thoughts of 
suicide; they often get headaches and stomachaches; they can become utterly 
passive and numb, or uncontrollably violent. 
</P>
<P>
 To recover, a child needs careful counseling -- or at least a special 
relationship with an empathetic person. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Clinton talks about his grandmother," Gellis says. "She was his anchor. 
But it didn't work for young Roger (who is 10 years younger). He is, as we in 
the profession call it, the 'clinical symptom carrier' for that household. He 
was the troubled one." Roger Clinton, according to a biography by his mother 
Virginia Kelley, lost his anchor when older brother Bill went away to school 
and he was left alone to witness his father's drunken rages against his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the age of the child, the solutions are the same: therapy, a mother 
who gets help for herself, a caretaker who is nurturing, sympathetic day care 
and schools that offer a stable environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge for school officials and day-care workers is often excavating 
the truth about what's going on at home. One barrier is that it's just so 
embarrassing and confusing to children that their parents' anger can escalate 
out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Betsy McAlister Groves, a social worker in Boston City Hospital's Children 
Witness to Violence project, says she treated a 7-year-old boy who one week 
described horrific scenes between his parents and how angry he was at his 
father. Oddly, though, the very next week he talked about what his father did 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children are very loyal -- particularly the young ones who, in terms of their 
moral development, believe might makes right," Groves says. "This little boy 
had to be told that his father could both be good and bad." 
</P>
<P>
 She says that so many of these children walk around with an overwhelming sense 
of shame that as they grow older, they believe they are defective people. 
</P>
<P>
 While these child witnesses have a greater chance of being in violent 
relationships -- about 40% repeat the behavior of their parents -- as many are 
in danger of becoming numb, desensitized adults who have no relationships at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Turman and others believe that the movement in family courts to keep families 
together at all costs is based on a myth that enough therapy can make the 
violence and pain go away. Instead, these people believe that the best thing 
for the children is to get them away from the violent parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only a certain proportion of families can be fixed," Turman says. "Do we have 
three or four or five years to experiment with a family? Not when the children 
are being damaged." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it's not unusual for children traumatized by domestic violence to 
cope well initially -- to make it through school and college and to get jobs -- 
but then later experience depression and other symptoms. 
</P>

 At 42, Barbara Corry runs a private consulting company in Alhambra to educate 
groups about domestic abuse. But telling her life story is her real work. For 
it provides compelling testimony of the ugly legacy of domestic abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 After all the therapy, after all her studying to earn a master's degree in 
sociology, after all the work to unravel her ugly past, Corry's voice still 
shakes at the mention of what she survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came along I was supposed to make things better," she says in a phone 
interview. "But all my birth did was bring another person into a not-good 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Corry says her father was an alcoholic who would return home from work drunk 
two and three times a week and scream at her mother. He would charge at her 
with a fist in her face; yell at her; keep her awake for hours raging that the 
lettuce on his sandwich was limp or that she hadn't sewn his shirt right. Once 
or twice he punched her, but mostly he restrained himself physically -- which 
only seemed to increase the intensity of his verbal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother was raised very traditionally, so when she couldn't take it anymore 
she went to see the priest," says Corry, referring to a time before she was 
born and her brother was 7. "The priest told her to pray for my father and try 
to be a better wife. He instructed her to have another baby to make things 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 As Corry got a little older, she would try to intervene between her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "My cries and my pleas would distract my father or somehow cut the circuits. 
But it never stopped him." 
</P>
<P>
 When her older brother was 16, he got into a fistfight with his father and was 
sent to live with an uncle in Indiana. "I didn't want to be sent away," Corry 
says. "My strategy was to shrink back and to be sweet and cute."  
</P>
<P>
 As Corry describes her family during an interview, she keeps switching into 
the third person as if to distance herself from such a horrific tale. 
</P>
<P>
 "My anger was directed inward," she continues. "I developed a serious eating 
disorder. I was very shutdown, you know, on automatic pilot. I think I was 
stuffing anger, stuffing pain, stuffing myself." 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't move away from home until she was 25 and received counseling after 
that. But her brother and mother died -- he of AIDS, she of cancer -- before 
they could get any emotional help. 
</P>
<P>
 Corry, who moved to Los Angeles 12 years ago, wrote her father a long letter 
explaining her feelings. He never wrote back. Their only contact is a Christmas 
card each year. "Hope all is well," says the card. "Love, Dad." 
</P>
<P>
 As she describes the card, Corry chokes and starts talking clinically about 
"people who are that monstrous." Later she explains that although she has 
conquered her compulsive eating problems and made great strides in 
understanding her family, she has been unable to have a relationship of her 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw that it is possible to devastate a person's personality and spirit," 
she says, her voice again halting and shaky. "You've got to prove to me you're 
not a (jerk) before I get involved. It's all terror-based."

HE'S NOT JUST TALKING THROUGH HIS HAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did you ever have a space helmet as a kid? One you could put on and suddenly 
become invincible, impervious to the forces aligned against you? 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Walt Netschert. Although well into his 60s, he has a spacey helmet he 
dons when beset by foes. But unlike kids and their imaginary villains, 
Netschert -- aided by a sense of humor -- is dead serious about feeling 
oppressed by very real villains. 
</P>
<P>
 They are FAFs, the people he calls Fresh Air Freaks. He calls his helmet the 
E-7 Equalizer Ecology Hat, and, like all good superheroes, has a name for 
himself as well: Capt. Huff-and-Puff. He derives his powers from cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Netschert smokes, and has since he was an engineering student in college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't start to look smart or be part of a group," he explained. "In my 
junior year, the dean of engineering called me in and said, 'The instructors 
have all been talking about you because you're puzzling to us. Your class 
participation is fine; your homework, reports and lab stuff are super-good, but 
you get a test and you struggle to get a C-minus. Why?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, 'My head goes faster than my hand.' I'd work a problem through, 
but my hand wouldn't keep up, and I'd have to start over, and it made me 
nervous. He said, 'Well, your head has to have patience for your hand to catch 
up. Try either a glass of wine or a cigarette before a test.' It made all the 
difference in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Netschert, who lives in Orange, chosen differently, he might now be trying 
to market the Ecology Wine Hat. But cigarettes it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find them highly beneficial to my way of performing," he said. "With 
tobacco I can settle my nerves down and think methodically and in order, and 
without it . . . 15 minutes is OK, but then my thoughts lose focus on what's 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years he found that onetime clients wouldn't hire him if he smoked 
at their facilities. Favorite restaurants would no longer seat him. He can't 
even light up at an Angel game anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 So the engineer turned inventor and made his special hat. A clear plastic 
shield forms an isolation zone in front of the smoker's face, complete with 
ashtray and a clip that will hold either a cigarette or a cigar. As long as the 
smoker keeps his lit cigarette in that zone, and is careful to exhale upward, 
Netschert claims the smoke won't be a problem to anyone else.  
</P>
<P>
 A fan pulls the smoke up and through two filters, and there's even an optional 
perfumed scent packet. The fan is reversible, so the hat can conversely serve 
as an air filter for smoke- or pollen-sensitive persons. It runs on batteries, 
off a wall socket or a car cigarette lighter. Netschert refers to his invention 
as a "peace pipe for the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting a reporter at an Anaheim coffee shop, in the smoking section, he 
demonstrated his E-7 hat. It appeared to work. He contentedly puffed away on 
his long More cigarette behind his plastic shield, accompanied by the whine of 
the fan, and there was no outward-bound smoke or smell to speak of. 
</P>
<P>
 He designed the hat in 1989 while doing an in-house engineering project for 
Disney Imagineering. He had already found a way to smoke on the job by setting 
up his office in a custodian's closet beneath a stairwell, but he was going 
nuts not being able to smoke at a four-hour weekly meeting. So he devised the 
hat and was then allowed to puff and whir away at the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 So far the only Ecology hats extant are 10 prototypes, some of formed 
cardboard and a couple of plastic. He has been trying to interest investors and 
has charts predicting 250,000 sales of the projected $79.95 hat in its first 
year of manufacture. He thinks it's a conservative estimate that one in 250 of 
the nation's estimated 42 million smokers will buy one. 
</P>
<P>
 When he exhibited the hat at a 1989 invention exhibition, Netschert said a 
prominent Japanese inventor told him that he'd do well with his product in 
Japan. About the only American interest he has received, though, was an 
invitation to appear on "The Tonight Show," which he did in November, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 He has tried to interest domestic manufacturers to no avail, and his appeals 
to the tobacco industry have been similarly ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks that is because smokers are vocally outnumbered 4 to 1 in the United 
States, and because the tobacco industry is so busy racking up export sales 
that it has abandoned smokers in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 There may be yet another reason though, one right in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 His hat may work wonderfully, saving smokers from being ostracized and saving 
others from the smoke, but it looks utterly ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the generally gracious Johnny Carson told Netschert, "You look very 
silly. You know that, don't you?" 
</P>
<P>
 He does know that, conceding that his hats are "uglier than sin." But so, he 
argues, was the Volkswagen Bug, and people came to love it. 
</P>
<P>
 Netschert doesn't encourage others to smoke and says he saw to it that his two 
sons didn't smoke. But he does . He likes to, and feels he has to in order to 
function. And everywhere he turns he sees his preferred pleasure being denied 
-- needlessly, he thinks. 
</P>
<P>
 So he blows smoke in his hat in places where smoking isn't allowed, wearing 
the E-7 in restaurants, malls and even airplanes, without hearing complaints, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal is to form Puffin' Posses, where he, under the name Capt. 
Huff-and-Puff, and others will target certain no-smoking venues (not, he said, 
ones where smoking is a fire-code violation) by going there en masse and 
lighting up under his hats. If the venues refuse to let them smoke even if the 
hats filter all particulates and odors from the air, then Netschert will 
publicly dub them Fresh Air Freaks. He's even sent invitations to smoking 
celebrities he hopes will join him under the E-7. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ideal world, if smokers were in the minority in a workplace, they'd 
wear the hats. If nonsmokers were the minority, they'd wear the hats, having 
reversed the fan so it would filter the smoky air. Peace would reign. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he worry that by removing some of the social stigma from smoking, he 
might encourage others to smoke? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the intent at all. It's just to support the rights of smokers. 
Don't make them stand outside where they can't do their work. Don't let them 
get kicked out of a profession as I was, and others are." 
</P>
<P>
 He has yet to develop any smoking-related illnesses and said that's an 
individual risk. He discounts the risks of secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good gosh, the Good Lord put those killer bones in fish too, and it's up to 
the individual whether they want to eat fish. I know a guy who has ingested a 
couple of decent shots of cyanide and lived though it. I think our maker gave 
us a system that rejects reasonable amounts of impurities, and secondary smoke 
I think is a reasonable amount." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he is particularly incensed with the cold shoulder his entreaties have 
gotten from the tobacco industry. He thought it would be in the industry's best 
interest to see his product on the market and to advertise it, for a royalty, 
on their cigarette cartons. He said he may have to turn to Japan to get his 
product manufactured. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so politically charged here. Nonsmokers don't want anything to interfere 
with their thinking that it's bad, bad, bad. And they sure don't want to 
approve of someone and their right to smoke. Then the tobacco industry is so 
content with the way they're making bucks with their exports they won't get 
embroiled in this domestic folderol. So two major block factions stand in the 
way in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Netschert soldiers on with his remaining Equalizer Ecology 
Hat prototypes -- he sent one to a nephew with allergies and another to a woman 
he saw on Oprah whose smoking was an issue in her custody battle -- hoping to 
win back his place at the table of American life.

'90S FAMILY; ADOPTION GIVES NEW MEANING TO FAMILIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY JO KOCHAKIAN, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the spectacle of the Baby Jessica-Anna Schmidt fight to the adoptions 
that peacefully take place every day, adoption today is doing more than forming 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 What used to be a secretive affair is forcing Americans to redefine the idea 
of family, says Judith S. Modell of Carnegie Mellon University in her book 
"Kinship With Strangers" (University of California Press, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 Modell, an associate professor of anthropology and an adoptive parent, used 
anthropological fieldwork methods to study families who have adopted children, 
people who have been adopted and birth parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happened to adoptive families is that they have moved from a position 
in American society where they were barely identified, since adoption was kept 
a secret, to a position where they are at once very active in claiming their 
rights, and to some extent both heroic and villainous," Modell says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've become figures in the American imagination of people who are both 
noble and wonderful to take children, and quite the opposite at the same time 
-- people who are selfish and greedy because they take children who belong to 
other people," she says. "The adoptive family, as it becomes more public and 
active, also develops a much more polarized perception on the part of the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's quite different from what was true years ago -- the power of the image 
of the adoptive family is very, very strong compared to what it once was," 
Modell says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's partly because it puzzles families who are not adoptive. What 
does it mean to really want a child badly -- which is what the adoptive family 
represents? I think it's an issue people don't like to face about themselves. 
When it's not easy (to have a baby), you have to face what that desire means, 
whether this is a selfish or altruistic desire." 
</P>
<P>
 The move toward greater openness in adoption resulted from activism by three 
groups, Modell says. 
</P>
<P>
 Birth parents, with the formation in 1976 of the national group Concerned 
United Birthparents, began to fight their "invisible" status and demand 
information about children relinquished for adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints from adoptive parents about the process of obtaining a child from 
an agency -- that the process was unfairly judgmental and arbitrary -- brought 
changes beginning in the late 1970s, Modell says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Questionnaires and interviews gave way to group meetings and parent-training 
classes. . . . Becoming an adoptive parent was a matter of self-searching." 
Others turned to private adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 Adopted children who wanted to find out more about their birth parents and 
background led to the search movement, which clearly has influenced adoption 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The demise of secrecy may be a relief. For adoptive families, though, it also 
adds to the difficulty of what is "already a very self-conscious parenthood," 
Modell says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's probably to the good. It brings that all very forward, so that 
it's not just a matter of having to answer questions of a social worker -- it's 
being able to address a wider public than that, so it becomes less scrutiny and 
more of a discussion of what it means to be a parent . . . and that is a 
positive thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of evolving changes in the concept of kinship, Modell says, "people 
will not think of families as absolutely inevitable, but much more a matter of 
choice and fluidity. And when it's a biological child, it's going to be less 
thought of as 'Well, this just happened,' and it's natural. It will be much 
more in terms of a positive choice, a relationship that has to be worked on, a 
relationship that is much more of a process than we would have thought. The 
understanding of the nature of the relationship with the child will change."

'90S FAMILY; REAL LIFE; TRAVELING PARENTS NEED NOT PACK GUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When attorney Penny Nagler goes on a business trip, she almost always takes 
her 2-year-old son, Robby, with her. 
</P>
<P>
 As a deputy state attorney general in Los Angeles, Nagler, 41, travels as far 
as San Luis Obispo and San Diego two to three times a month. She usually stays 
in hotels and finds a sitter to watch Robby. 
</P>
<P>
 She knows it would be easier to leave him at home, as most of her friends who 
travel for work do with their children. But, she said, "When I think about not 
having him with me, I just feel like it would be upsetting for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I would feel very guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's face it: Guilt is often part of your baggage if you're a parent who has 
to travel on business. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, it increases in direct proportion to how much support there is for 
the person taking care of the children at home, said Susan Ginsberg, an 
educational consultant in New York who edits the monthly Work and Family Life 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the level of guilt has to do with how alone the person is going to be 
who's left with the kids and how difficult it will be for the person," she 
said. Because mothers typically have more extensive support systems in place, 
"fathers have a much harder time summoning up the guilt gene." 
</P>
<P>
 Those with dependable sitters and nannies to maintain routines and ensure 
safety have much lower anxiety levels, Ginsberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a recent Gallup survey of 563 parents who also belong to frequent 
flier clubs, 60% said they had missed a child's birthday or special event, such 
as a school play or athletic event. They may feel bad, but if they had to go, 
they don't have to feel guilty, Ginsberg said. "They can say, 'Can I get 
somebody else to go to this event? Can I get somebody to take a picture for 
me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, there's a purpose to guilt, and those on a persistent guilt 
trip should evaluate their child-care arrangements, Ginsberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she offered some tips for business travelers. Before leaving, they 
can show children on a map where they will be and can hide notes in backpacks 
or lunch boxes. When away, they can send cards with child-centered messages, 
such as: "When I was here, you were at Jimmy's party." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling home can be a Catch-22, Ginsberg said. "You need to call, but you need 
to be prepared to have a few tears or a little upset sometimes. If you're away 
and something bad happens -- that pushes everybody's buttons." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than a general "How are you? I'm fine" call, it's better to ask 
specific questions and close with any special goodby family ritual.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to be wonderful, this phone call," Ginsberg said. "But that's 
OK. You said I'm thinking about you and I miss you. That's the bottom line 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Nagler said one of her friends faxed a picture home for her child to color. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagler said most of her friends feel guilty when they travel. "They miss their 
kids, they like them. The solution I've heard most often is having a nanny at 
home who takes care of the kids or a spouse who carries a bigger load." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she was inspired by a co-worker who took her mother along on trips as 
a baby-sitter: "Her mother enjoyed it." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all business travelers are destined for guilt. "Sometimes it's a 
relief to get away from your child," Nagler said. "It's also nice to take a 
little break."

'90S FAMILY; THE TRAVEL NIGHTMARE; WHEN ONE PARENT HAS TO TAKE A TRIP, IT CAN 
BE HELL ON EARTH FOR THOSE LEFT BEHIND. HERE'S HOW TO COPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Every couple of months, actor Scott Baker hits the road to participate in 
charity events and promotions for the daytime drama "The Bold and The 
Beautiful." Baker, who plays Connor Davis, is a veteran of daytime TV and knows 
that making appearances across the country is important to his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Baker doesn't relish the idea of leaving his wife, Leilani, and their 
3-year-old son, Thane, behind in their Granada Hills home, like so many working 
parents he knows that travel is part of the job. 
</P>
<P>
 And like many parents, Leilani has devised strategies for coping with those 
times when her spouse is away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to make those days fun for (Thane) because it's lonelier at home and 
you're trying to fill that time up," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minimizing changes in the daily routine is another way to keep the family on 
an even keel when one parent is away, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Established boundaries and structure allow children to perceive themselves as 
having some control within the family," said family counselor Karen 
Renshaw-Joslin of Bellevue, Wash., author of the book "Positive Parenting From 
A to Z" (Ballantine, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 "The routine (at home) should be such that when one parent leaves town for 
work, the other parent can pick up and continue on without much disruption," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman Carroll of Chatsworth finds that sticking to the daily routine helps her 
deal with husband Larry's erratic work schedule as an NBC News reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "His work hours change all the time, so I try to concentrate on making the 
children feel secure, and having a routine does that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since January's earthquake, Roman has found that her daughter, Yenea, 7, and 
son, Larry Jr., 4, feel more edgy when their dad goes on assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I let the kids sleep in my bed and tell my neighbors and friends we are 
alone," she said. "If the children seem especially panicky we say a prayer and 
that makes them feel better." 
</P>
<P>
 Creating an extra-secure environment should be a primary concern for the 
parent left home with the children, said Dr. Stanley I. Greenspan, a clinical 
professor at the George Washington University Medical School in Washington, 
D.C., and author of several books, including "Playground Politics" 
(Addison-Wesley, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 "With one parent gone there may be increased insecurities, increased anger or 
scary feelings," Greenspan said. "You want to help them with those feelings by 
making yourself more available. Allow your child to express their feelings and 
then act out their feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan advises using a technique described in his book as "floor time," in 
which a parent spends at least 30 minutes a day on the floor engaged in pretend 
play, with the child choosing the direction of that play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Floor time is as important for school-age children as it is for 
preschoolers," Greenspan said. "Children need a way of relating to the parent 
who is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan suggests helping children cope by pretending with dolls or props in 
the play area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep a picture of Mom or Dad there, too," he said. "Have the parent who is 
gone call every day if possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever your child's reaction to a parent's absence, Greenspan said, allow 
him or her to express those feelings -- then offer comfort. Let your child act 
on his feelings through something constructive, such as writing a letter or 
drawing a picture. The worst thing a parent can do, he said, is to ignore the 
change. 
</P>

 Even at the tender age of 2, Ryan Manor knows all about when and why his daddy 
has to leave town for work. As a port captain and offshore salesman for a 
marine transportation company in New Orleans, Steve Manor is used to packing up 
regularly on a moment's notice. He prepares Ryan by involving him in the 
departure process. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ryan knows if Daddy's going to the boat he packs a certain suitcase and needs 
certain items," mom Kim Manor said. "Then Ryan will help him carry the suitcase 
to the car. Steve tells him goodby and that Daddy will return in a few days. 
It's a routine that's as important to Steve as it is to Ryan," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 For families like the Manors, in which business travel is a way of life, being 
prepared is as important as maintaining a routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before Steve leaves, I try to take care of all the errands that would be 
harder to handle with Ryan in tow," Kim Manor said. 
</P>
<P>
 She finds that finishing housework and other time-consuming responsibilities 
are best taken care of before her husband leaves or after Ryan goes to bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're trying to make more time for your child, keeping up with the 
house isn't a priority," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arlinda Henderson, a flight attendant living in Malibu, prepares lists for her 
husband, John Ronge, and lays out clothes for their three sons -- Brian, 9, and 
Michael and Robert, 7 -- before she leaves twice a month for New Zealand or 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do it to help remind them of what's happening each day while I'm gone. It 
can get rather hectic for John, especially when he has to help all three of 
them with their homework each night," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronge and the boys survive with a fair amount of fast food and car-pooling, 
but being a self-employed accountant has made the biggest difference of all. 
Ronge finds the flexibility of his job makes life less hectic when he and the 
boys are on their own. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Other significant factors in surviving temporary single parenthood include 
making time for yourself and establishing a support network of family and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Roma Hobbs of Calabasas accomplished both when she and her husband, Wes, a 
commercial helicopter pilot, lived overseas nearly 10 years ago with their two 
daughters, now 16 and 11.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was gone for two out of every six weeks," Hobbs said. "I spent a lot of 
time reading, catching up on correspondence and knitting, but going back to 
school was my biggest release," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobbs also found strength in a family she could lean on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Family members always rallied around us, especially on weekends when it was 
very difficult. We were very fortunate to have my family around. The girls had 
uncles, aunts and cousins to help balance things out when their father was 
gone," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also essential is consistent discipline. Hobbs said her girls knew the rules 
stayed the same regardless of who was at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never wanted them to fear when their dad came home," Hobbs said. "I never 
tattled on them and anything that happened before he got there had already been 
dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
 Child psychiatrist Greenspan advises keeping your boundaries wide and 
enforcing them: "It's better to win one battle than lose lots of little ones 
out of sheer exhaustion."

 Climbing the walls and your spouse hasn't even left yet? Check out these 
guidelines from some experts on the home front. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be prepared.Stock up on groceries, medications and keep extra cash stashed 
for emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take care of errands that might be harder to handle with children in tow. 
</P>
<P>
 * Younger children need constant tangible reminders of when your spouse will 
return. Keep a calendar and let them mark off the days with stickers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Show kids on the map where Mom or Dad is going and learn about those 
destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep a daily family journal to share when the away parent comes home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Break up the monotony with easy, non-stressful outings everyone will enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 * After your spouse leaves, stick with the normal daily routine -- but be 
flexible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give your child added security with more one-on-one time. Allow children to 
express their feelings about the parent who is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be consistent about discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't tattle on your child when your spouse gets home. By doing so you're 
breaking your child's trust and showing him you can't handle it alone. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't spend valuable phone time with your spouse complaining about trivial 
daily problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stay calm and find small ways to treat yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have a network of family, friends and neighbors who can lend their support 
while your spouse is away. Ask for help if your need it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Make homecomings special for everyone. KATHLEEN O. RYAN

YOUNGSTERS MOURN THE HERO THEY NEVER KNEW 
</P>

 Joshua said he'd had enough of the televised O.J. Simpson preliminary hearing 
by the time it reached closing arguments, but the frowning face of the famous 
defendant was still on Joshua's mind when he hit the beach that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for him," said the tanned 10-year-old, dragging his body board 
through the sand near the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks so sad. . . . He's in big trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Added his 9-year-old buddy, Brian, also of Huntington Beach: "He's a nice guy. 
He's on TV. They wouldn't let him be on TV if he killed someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as adult America has been obsessed with the Simpson affair, so has young 
America been fixated -- in their case on a sports hero they never saw play. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been largely overlooked in the media rush to interview anybody with 
an opinion on the case. Yet today's kids are every bit as opinionated, 
passionate and conflicted as their parents and older siblings about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The hordes of news crews have left the courthouse for now, but legal experts 
aren't the only ones raising questions since Simpson was arrested in the 
double-homicide of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald 
Goldman. Experts say the confusion felt by youth is more pronounced because 
they are the part of our population most affected by violence, yet they lack 
the tools of maturity to sort it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he did do it, he wasn't himself," declared 14-year-old Angie del la Torre. 
"He just lost it. . . . Something's wrong; he was possessed." 
</P>
<P>
 Angie and her friends were still reeling from the preliminary hearing, every 
minute of which they say they watched with interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's watching it," said 13-year-old Lisa Long. "My mom taped the whole 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The boys said they knew Simpson from trading sports cards, while the girls 
knew him as "the Hertz guy" and from the "Naked Gun" movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wish he didn't do it," said Ryan Myers, 13. "Yeah," added Joey Maletic, 
also 13, "he was like a sports hero." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While kids like Angie and her friends are able to weigh the facts in the case, 
younger children have a tougher time, Brea psychotherapist Toni Aquino says.  
</P>
<P>
 The confusion, fueled by unrelenting media coverage and gavel-to-gavel 
broadcast of the courtroom events, has children weighing such factors as 
celebrity and consequence, gaping wounds and bloodstains -- true-life topics 
far more graphic than your basic schoolyard discussions of right versus wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Aquino and other experts in child psychology agree that because the double 
slaying and the high-profile circumstances surrounding it have dominated adult 
conversation, kids naturally soak it in. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that it's not just how they take it in, it's that we are 
presenting children with a plethora of violence, day in and day out, and it's 
taking on the tenor of normalcy," she said. "The far-ranging ramification of it 
is yet to be known." 
</P>
<P>
 Home environment and the way parents present the events surrounding the 
Simpson case also play a big part in its lasting effect on America's children, 
Aquino said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are affected by it in terms of how their parents deal with it," Aquino 
said. She added that children from stable families tend to be left more 
confused by the possibility of a likable personality such as Simpson committing 
such a heinous crime, while children in a violent environment are more cynical 
and simply become even less trusting of adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Peg, a telephone counselor at the Hotline Help Center in Orange, said she 
advises any parent faced with troubling questions to hear their children out 
and focus on their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest advice is to listen and reflect on how sad the whole situation 
is," she said. "I would ask the child what (he was) feeling and respond to 
those feelings. I would tell them that the facts aren't important, that it's in 
the court. No one knows what happened, but I would reflect on the pain of not 
only O.J., but also of his kids, and the families of Nicole and of Ron 
Goldman." 
</P>
<P>
 Aquino agreed, adding that parents should reassure their children, reinforcing 
that it won't happen to them, and that they are loved and secure in their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to know that their world is safe," she said. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Youth minister Jim Burns said he witnessed firsthand how emotionally affected 
even 17-year-olds have been with the situation from its unpredictable start. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving at a scheduled graduation speech at the Crystal Cathedral on June 17, 
he expected to be greeted with smiles and laughter. What he didn't expect was 
the nearly hysterical cluster of teen-age girls that met him before his 
address. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to kill himself," one of them sobbed. "And it's going to ruin my 
graduation." 
</P>
<P>
 It was their day, but, unfortunately, they were competing with history in the 
making. The group of Valley Christian High School graduates had just traveled 
the same freeway as the infamous Ford Bronco that chauffeured Simpson on the 
low-speed pursuit that had scores of millions transfixed to the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 Modifying his speech for the uneasy crowd gathered at the Crystal Cathedral, 
Burns began: "This is a day you'll never forget -- for several reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns, president of the San Clemente-based National Institute of Youth 
Ministry, said the kids he's talked to don't have the same understanding of the 
case, noting that they don't really know the same O.J. grown-ups do. Just as 
the theories and judgments vary, the name "O.J. Simpson" seems to have changed 
with time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was with a group of kids, and they had to explain to one girl who he was," 
Burns said. "And she still had a blank look." 
</P>
<P>
 The touchdowns that brought the young athlete to glory were never witnessed 
firsthand by today's youth, nor do they know much of his rags-to-riches tale. 
Yet because everyone else is obsessed, they also talk at the beach, in malls 
and summer school classrooms of the defendant they've always known as "the 
Juice," the part-time actor who dashed through airports and acted as 
commentator for NFL games on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recent statements from children on the Simpson case range from confused to 
judgmental. Playing a true-life game of Clue, some had theories, some had 
questions, some even made angry declarations of the Juice's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was framed," said Jordan Turner, 13, of Lake Forest. "It bothers me that 
they're not asking if anybody else murdered them." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Lieber, of Huntington Beach, had a similar reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for him because of all he's had to go through," said the blond 
and freckled 11-year-old. "And he's innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieber, chomping on popcorn with his father in the Westminster Mall, says he's 
gotten into arguments with at least one friend about the case, adding that "the 
news (media) has made up everything they can" to make Simpson look guilty. He 
added, however, that he had only tuned in "a couple of times" to the 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe someone's trying to get revenge on him for something he did a long time 
ago," Lieber said, "but he didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond's father, James Lieber, said he's concerned not only with the Simpson 
case, but also with the excessive violence in general that saturates the 
childhoods of today's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it rips at their innocence, being exposed to these violent episodes," 
he said. "And it seems to come up on a regular basis."

TACO BELL TO HIRE GUARDS AT OUTLETS STAYING OPEN LATE; CRIME: THE ORANGE 
COUNTY-BASED CHAIN SAYS SECURITY COSTS WILL BE SUBSTANTIAL BUT ARE NONETHELESS 
NECESSARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In recognition that "it's a nasty world out there," Taco Bell Corp. Chairman 
John Martin said Tuesday he has authorized the hiring of security guards at 
company-owned stores that stay open late at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to bolster security was driven in part by the January slaying of 
four employees at a Taco Bell restaurant in Clarksville, Tenn. Police reported 
that the restaurant's safe was open and cash registers were empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell, which has 4,500 locations, will spend "several million dollars per 
quarter" to post off-duty police officers and security guards at an unspecified 
number of restaurants that keep late hours. "It's a very substantial expense 
for us," Martin said. "But we've come to the conclusion that it's a nasty world 
out there."  
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant and retail industry observers applauded Taco Bell's decision to 
help safeguard employees and customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "All restaurants have to face security costs these days," said Michael Rhodes, 
president of Orange-based Frontier Restaurants and president of the Orange 
County chapter of the California Restaurant Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "You run the risk of robbery and break-ins at closing time," Rhodes said. "You 
don't even want employees leaving alone at night. You want them to leave in 
groups of two or three." 
</P>
<P>
 Security guards are less common at fast-food restaurants than at bars and 
grills, which typically stay open later. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be a scary thing at late hours," Rhodes said. "People have been out at 
parties or whatnot, they can be feeling boisterous, and tempers can flare. You 
don't want (employees) trying to restore law and order." 
</P>
<P>
 Most consumers welcome the added sense of security, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It translates as someone is looking out for their safety after dark," said 
Anna Northcutt, a former FBI agent who directs security at San Diego-based Hahn 
Co.'s 45 shopping malls. "I know that when I pull into a fast-food place at 11 
or 12 o'clock at night, I feel more comfortable with an off-duty policeman 
standing there." 
</P>
<P>
 Most fast-food restaurants close early, negating the need for -- and expense 
of -- late-night security. Operators who do remain open late at night say that 
the cost of hiring guards can be prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Most fast-food restaurants "don't typically do that much business at night 
anyway, and now you have to cover the added cost of security," said one 
hamburger chain franchisee who asked not to be identified. "The result is that 
many places that need security at night simply close earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 Separately Tuesday, Taco Bell reported a 5% decline in operating profit for 
its latest fiscal quarter, despite a 19% increase in revenue.  
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine-based fast-food company, a subsidiary of soft-drink giant Pepsico 
Inc., said it earned $54.6 million for the quarter, down from a profit of $57.4 
million for the same period a year earlier. Revenue for the company's second 
quarter, which ended June 11, rose to $767.1 million from $643.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said the drop in operating profit was driven by one-time expenses and 
that "the business is still healthy." Same-store sales -- those at locations 
open for more than a year -- were up 3%, he said, "which is still very 
dynamic." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was just one quarter where everything came together on the cost side," 
Martin said. "We're still within our plan."

 Home Financing: Mortgage bankers, hurting from the near halt in refinancings 
caused by higher interest rates, are now betting that home values have nowhere 
to go but up. So they're offering 100% financing for customers buying homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The new package of loans, combinations of first and second trust deeds, is 
risky because property values must increase for lenders to get their money back 
in cases of defaults and foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Roof, president of RPM Mortgage in Laguna Niguel, said the new loans show 
the confidence that mortgage bankers have in the resurrection of Southern 
California home values. "Lenders wouldn't be doing this unless they thought 
we've reached the bottom of the market," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But mortgage bankers, who lured loan customers from savings and loans and 
banks over the last few years, have seen their market share dwindle with the 
higher rates. The 100% financing is one of their methods for attracting 
customers again. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowers could get a conventional mortgage loan -- one that is 80% of the 
sale price -- from a bank, S&L or mortgage banker, and then could obtain a home 
equity loan the next day from a mortgage banker for up to the remaining 20% of 
the sale price. The same mortgage banker also could fund both loans, Roof said. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowers can use the home equity loan to pay off car loans, put children 
through school or pay medical bills, Roof said. But customers can't use the 
package as a way of borrowing the down payment, he said. Even so, he 
acknowledged, some customers probably will try to borrow the down payment 
secretly from a relative and repay the amount with the home equity loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of banks and S&Ls consider it unsafe to make loans that equal the 
value of the homes. Such 100% financing helped cause a number of Southern 
California banks to fail in the early 1980s.

WESTERN DIGITAL TURNS THINGS AROUND IN BIG WAY; EARNINGS: THE IRVINE-BASED 
COMPUTER FIRM REPORTS FISCAL-YEAR EARNINGS OF $73.1 MILLION AFTER THREE YEARS 
OF LOSSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a stunning reversal after three years of losses, Western Digital Corp. 
reported record annual earnings and revenue Tuesday on the strength of 
continued heavy demand for its high-capacity disk drives. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fiscal year ended June 30, the Irvine-based computer products company 
posted a profit of $73.1 million, or $1.77 a share. That compared to a loss of 
$25.1 million, or 79 cents a share, for the previous year. Annual revenue was 
$1.5 billion, a 26% increase from $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we surprised analysts," said Chuck Haggerty, Western Digital's 
chairman. "Higher-capacity hard drives are driving the market, and we are 
seeing that increase at a much faster rate than anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
 Computer users are replacing their hard drives to get more storage capacity. 
The average hard drive made by Western Digital during the latest year had a 
capacity of 330 megabytes, compared to 200 megabytes for the previous 12 
months, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haggerty also pointed to gains in the company's computer chip business, which 
became profitable for the first time in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Western Digital has benefited from blossoming demand for 
advanced CD-ROM and high-capacity hard disk drives and also capitalized on its 
advantages through cost-cutting and shrewd management. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have done a very good job," said John M. Garaghty, analyst for the 
brokerage First Boston Corp. in New York. "The first thing was, they 
concentrated their product line in the high end of the disk drive business. 
They had excellent financial management, and to some degree they were helped by 
the market. . . . They were smart enough to take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Haggerty, who became chairman when Roger Johnson left for Washington last year 
to head the General Accounting Office, continued to reduce the company's work 
force from 7,700 two years ago to 6,400 now. "We had to cut five layers out of 
the total management structure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the company has standardized parts in many of its products 
to achieve sharp productivity gains. It also sold off a semiconductor plant 
that was a drag on earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, the turnaround is phenomenal," said Roxanne Googin, Los 
Angeles-based analyst for the brokerage Gruntal & Co. "Chuck understands cost 
controls. There was a lot of focus on that for the first time. Even under Roger 
Johnson, the drive business had improved all the while the company was losing 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 For its fourth fiscal quarter, Western Digital had earnings of $37.3 million, 
or 79 cents a share, compared to a loss of $37.8 million, or $1.07 a share, for 
the same period a year earlier. Three-month revenue was $462.2 million, a 62% 
increase from $285.2 million for the comparable period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Western Digital closed at 
$14.50 a share, down 87 cents. The financial results were released after the 
market closed. Western Digital's 4th Quarter

BRIEFCASE: FINANCE; INVESTMENT BANKING FIRMS CONTINUE JOINT VENTURE BUT GIVE UP 
ON MERGER 
</P>

<P>
 Two Orange County investment banking companies that acted for awhile as if 
they wanted to merge now say they will continue to work together through a 
joint venture but have no intention of becoming one company. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Friend and Michael Danzi said their companies will work on major deals, 
like the effort to sell a minority shareholder's stock in the Irvine Co., 
through a division of L.H. Friend, Weinress & Frankson Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friend and Danzi said each company will continue to operate separately. 
Danzi, whose Danzi Capital Group rents space in L.H. Friend's Irvine office, 
manages the ongoing joint venture, called L.H. Friend-Danzi Capital Partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "There probably was an intent that down the road we might merge, but who 
knows," Friend said. "As we work together, we find that it's better this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Danzi said that any merger idea is "not going to happen." He said the industry 
may have started talking after he changed the name of his index of Orange 
County companies from the Friend-Danzi Index back to the Danzi Index. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry wanted to get involved with the index, so I added his name to the 
index," Danzi said. "But he decided later he didn't want to stay involved. So I 
took his name off." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Friend-Danzi Partners is continuing to peddle the 5% stake in the 
Irvine Co. owned by Howard P. Marguleas. The stock is believed to be worth $94 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 A deal is expected to be announced by the end of summer, but the partners 
would not confirm anything. "The last time we said anything, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission came in and asked us why we were in the newspaper," Danzi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he stood by an earlier statement that the deal should be completed by 
the end of the year.

GUILTY PLEA IN HONDA KICKBACK SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former American Honda regional sales manager from New York pleaded guilty 
Tuesday to federal charges of conspiring to obstruct justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry C. Finley, 49, the Torrance-based auto importer's eastern Regional sales 
manager until he resigned in April, admitted accepting nearly $300,000 in 
kickbacks for preferential treatment of Honda dealers in Florida, Indiana, New 
Jersey, New York and Maine during his 19-year tenure with the company.Finley 
became the 13th executive to plead guilty to felony charges in an ongoing 
Justice Department investigation of bribery and racketeering among American 
Honda managers. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 16 former top sales executives, including three from Orange County, 
have been charged, and Justice Department officials say more charges are 
anticipated. The abuses reportedly took place during the 1980s and early 1990s, 
when Honda dealers in the United States often could not get enough cars from 
Japan to satisfy consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-ranking former executive to be indicted is Stanley James Cardiges, a 
Laguna Niguel resident who was American Honda's senior vice president for sales 
until he resigned in 1992. Cardiges has denied the charges. Trial in his case 
is scheduled to begin in U.S. District Court in New Hampshire on Nov. 1.

IRVINE BROKERAGE LOSES THREE OF ITS TOP EXECUTIVES; PERSONNEL: CRUTTENDEN & CO. 
WAS HIT LAST MONTH BY A $4.5-MILLION COMPLAINT FROM AN EX-EMPLOYEE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County brokerage Cruttenden & Co., subject of a $4.5-million complaint 
filed last month with the National Assn. of Securities Dealers, said Tuesday 
that three of its top employees have left the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick J. Allen, who joined Cruttenden in May as chief operating officer, 
said that Jeffrey Gottfredson, who was chief financial officer, has resigned, 
along with William Howard, vice president of trading, and Mike Perez, a vice 
president and equities trader. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard and Perez both said that they left the firm, which has about 80 
employees in its Irvine office, to pursue other opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, who handled Cruttenden's institutional clients, said he has accepted an 
offer to join Texas Capital Securities, a Houston brokerage that plans to open 
an Orange County office. Howard said he is weighing several job offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottfredson could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the complaint filed June 6 with the NASD, Bradley C. Weddon, former head of 
retail sales, alleged that he was fired from Cruttenden for refusing to violate 
securities rules. Weddon's complaint states that company founder Walter W. 
Cruttenden III knowingly sold low-quality stocks in order to generate large 
fees on private stock offerings, many of them for small Southern California 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint further alleges that Weddon, hired in August, 1990, was fired 
earlier this year because he "refused to participate in and tolerate the 
flagrant violation of NASD and (Securities and Exchange Commission) regulations 
by Cruttenden's management." 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Cruttenden has denied all the charges in the complaint, calling them 
"ridiculous" and characterizing Weddon, who left the firm in February, as a 
disgruntled former employee. 
</P>
<P>
 No arbitration date for hearing the case has been set, said Weddon, who is 
seeking $4.5 million in lost wages and punitive damages. Lani Woltmann, an NASD 
director based in Los Angeles, said Tuesday that the federal agency is 
examining Cruttenden as part of its regular review of practices at local 
securities firms. The examination began in March, she said.

SKATING TOWARD IN-LINE SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE EMMONS and SHARI ROAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hardly anyone doubts that in-line skating is due for another huge jump in 
popularity this year. If the sport's booming growth holds steady, there will be 
more than 17 million skaters in the United States alone. 
</P>
<P>
 And hardly anyone doubts that there will be growth in emergency room business, 
too, also thanks to in-line skating's popularity. A parade of fractured wrists 
and battered heads is expected to increase along with the number of novices 
strapping on the skates, then losing control of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this because the sport is inherently dangerous? For the first time, someone 
with some clout is saying yes. The federal Consumer Product Safety Commission, 
conceding that its investigators have found nothing wrong with the skates' 
manufacture or design, nonetheless labeled the sport "dangerous" in a recent 
press release. 
</P>
<P>
 An accompanying report stated that there were twice as many in-line skate 
injuries through May of this year than in the same period last year. The report 
estimates that by the end of the year, emergency rooms will have treated 83,000 
such injuries, a one-year increase of 124%. The report has alarmed the industry 
and skaters alike, who fear that government regulation may be in store. The 
commission is doing little to ease that anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've said so far is we haven't found anything specifically wrong with 
the skate," says George Rutherford, an injury statistician for the commission. 
"Don't read anything more than that into it. It doesn't mean we believe all the 
skates are safe. Obviously, it is a dangerous activity." 
</P>
<P>
 The industry's trade association has countered that the commission report is 
misleading and distorts the actual dangers involved. Traditional skates or 
skateboards produce more injuries, a spokesman says, a contention confirmed 
recently in a study released by the federal Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention. But none of the statistics include the rate of injury -- how many 
injuries occur per individual outing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, both the industry and the commission tend to agree on the major 
cause of in-line skate injuries: inexperience and lack of training. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not completed a detailed analysis yet," says Rutherford, "but my 
impression is that stunting or hotdogging or outrageous behavior are not big 
contributors to the number of injuries. . . . One of the biggest contributors 
was the inexperience factor." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more of a behavior issue," says Maureen O'Neill, spokeswoman for 
Rollerblade Inc., developers of the modern in-line skate. "With any action 
sport, you really need to take a lesson first so you can control the skates. 
You can't just go out there and start skating. You need to be educated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What sets in-line skates apart is their four (and sometimes five) wheels set 
in single file from toe to heel, making them resemble ice skates more than 
traditional roller skates. Because the wheels are much narrower than roller 
skate wheels, in-line skates create less friction against the pavement, which 
means more speed. Some skaters have been clocked at faster than 30 m.p.h., and 
good skaters can smoothly sustain speeds around 15 m.p.h., about as fast as a 
cruising bicycle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's overly simplistic, but the fact is, you've got wheels on your feet," 
Rutherford says. "You can expect to fall down at some time. The question is how 
badly you fall down." 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take much to suffer significant injury, says Philip Macneil, an 
occasional in-line skater and an emergency-room doctor at UCI Medical Center in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Many injuries occur when skaters are going slow, not fast, he says. "They're 
trying to stop or are nearly stopped, and they klutz out, fall on their butts 
with their hands at their sides and fracture their wrists." 
</P>
<P>
 The safety commission's statistics show that fractured wrists are the most 
common injury, a fourth of all injuries. They occur because people who are 
falling forward or backward instinctively hold out their arms, hands bent back, 
to break the fall. Instead, they break the forearm bones just below the wrist 
joint. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Head injuries are less common -- about 18% of all injuries -- but much more 
serious, Macneil says. "Big deal, you break a wrist. No one dies of that. But 
head injuries, they can result in significant, permanent disability." 
</P>
<P>
 Skaters who fall instinctively extend their arms to prevent their heads from 
hitting the pavement, but if moving at high speed, arm strength will not be 
sufficient, Macneil says. Under those circumstances, "if you go down, your head 
is going to hit the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 What leads to these falls is the nature of in-line skating itself, Macneil 
says. "You're pretending that your center of mass is at your feet, because 
that's where all the action is going on, but it's at your hips." So when 
something like a crack or hole in the sidewalk suddenly stops or slows down the 
skates, your body continues forward, rotating around your hips like a falling 
propeller. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where protective equipment comes in, and it is recommended by 
manufacturers, instructors, physicians and the safety commission. Those who 
need it most, however -- young teens and preteens who compose the majority of 
in-line skaters -- are most susceptible to peer pressure to look "cool." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the vanity issue," Rutherford says. "It's not an injury issue to them. 
It's whether it looks dorky. They weigh it this way: 'I did this once, and I 
didn't fall down.' Probably a person who falls down the first time and bumps 
the head wears a helmet the rest of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Macneil rates the helmet as the most important item of safety equipment. Wrist 
guards help prevent wrist fractures. Elbow and knee guards probably do little 
to prevent fractures but will protect against abrasion of the soft tissues, the 
"road rash" notorious among skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 But probably the most neglected safety device is an introductory skating 
lesson, Macneil says. Manufacturers and the industry's trade association, the 
International In-Line Skating Assn., are pushing hard to persuade both novice 
skaters to take a lesson and retailers to offer them free. Many do. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing we try to get across is this is a new sport and practically 
everyone is a beginner," says Dave Cooper, who overseas instructor 
certification for the trade association. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no daddy to hold you up and run down the sidewalk with you. You 
started on an 'easy' bike, but people go out and get good skates, fast skates, 
and they get past their abilities, especially downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lesson with a woman tomorrow. She was going slightly downhill, saw a 
car coming that she had not anticipated, and she didn't have enough confidence 
to apply the heel brake. She landed on her tailbone. Not hurt bad, but she 
scared herself. Now she's coming in for a lesson." 
</P>
<P>
 A lesson teaches the very basics -- starting, turning and stopping, with the 
emphasis on stopping, Cooper says, "because it seems to be what most people are 
anxious about." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everything about in-line skating is easier than traditional roller skating, 
Cooper says. But using the brake pad attached to an in-line skate's heel seems 
alien to the beginner, and few learn to use it properly, he says. Consequently, 
it has a poor reputation among skaters when, in fact, "it's perfectly 
effective. It's no problem for people who have had real practice to stop in the 
same distance as a bicycle." 
</P>
<P>
 The technique, he says, is "pretty simple" and is the same for any speed. 
Weight is transferred to one foot and the other foot is thrust forward, then 
tipped back on the rear wheel, thereby levering the brake pad against the 
pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 Other methods of speed control are the tight turn, which is difficult to do at 
high speeds; the "snowplow," that is, turning the toes slightly inward, which 
slows you down, and the "T-stop," that is, dragging one skate sideways behind 
you, which chews up wheels but is the closest skaters get to a panic stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are all sorts of brake designs out there to address the fear that the 
current brakes don't work, but I haven't seen a design that's better than the 
standard heel brake," Cooper says. 
</P>
<P>
 All seem to agree that there are virtues to in-line skating. It is a good 
aerobic exercise, helps tone the major muscles of the lower body and, when the 
skater remains upright, is easy on the joints. Conclusions about its safety, 
however, must wait for the next generation of research, says Dr. Richard A. 
Schieber of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Henry Zuver, executive director of the skating association, 
says he is confident about in-line skating's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Done in the proper manner, this is a good activity. I think future studies 
will bear that out." The Wheel Thing 
</P>
<P>
 In-line skating, a warm-weather alternative to ice skating, has taken to the 
streets with a vengeance. Witness the dramatically increasing popularity of 
this latest fitness trend: The estimated 12.6 million skaters in the U.S. last 
year represented a 37% increase over the previous year. And nearly half of all 
skaters consider themselves beginners. The lowdown on getting in-line: 
</P>
<P>
 * Evolution Shoe skate: Popularized in the 1950s and 1960s, a key adjusted 
skate length Roller skate: 1960s saw advent of rubberized wheels and roller 
rinks; wooden wheels were the rage starting as far back as the 1770s In-line 
skates: Popularity boomed in early 1980s after the founding of Rollerblade Inc. 
* Major Brake-Through 
</P>
<P>
 The new Rollerblade brake system increases control while cornering or 
stopping. Byconnecting an adjustable brake to a hinged cuff on the shoe, 
skaters stop without lifting wheels off the ground. Baby Steps: Once standing 
is mastered, skaters can work on basics. Striding: Start by standing with toes 
pointed out. Push inside edge of one skate whileshifting weight to opposite 
foot. Glide. Repeat by shifting weight onto other foot and pushing off. New 
way: With adjustable brakes, roll skate forward and straighten leg until brake 
pad touches ground. Old way: Lift toe until brake pad touches pavement. * Pad 
Your Assets 
</P>
<P>
 Use protective gear designed with flexibility and extra padding. And make sure 
to try on everything before buying. Wrist guard: Thick rubber; locking feature 
prevents wrist hyperextension Elbow pad: Molded to fit contour and movement 
Knee pad: Lightweight foam; fits snugly Helmet: Vented, light plastic * Buyer's 
Guide * Savvy questions for in-line skate shoppers: * How does the braking 
system work? * Can you rent before purchasing and apply rental fees to the cost 
of the skate? * Is there a comparable, less expensive model? * Are repairs 
performed at shop or sent to manufacturer? * Will skate be on sale soon? 
(Prices can range from $40 to $350.) * Rules of the Road 
</P>
<P>
 Abide by basic traffic tenets, including passing on the left and reducing 
speed under unsafe conditions. * Always wear protective gear. * Watch for 
water, oil or sand in your path. * Before passing others, call out, "On your 
left." * Slow to 5 m.p.h. whenever there is heavy pedestrian traffic. * Avoid 
side-by-side skating when path is crowded. * Slim Facts 
</P>

 In-line skating works the lower body, toning thighs, hips and buttocks. As 
with other aerobic exercises, benefits include improved heart rate and weight 
loss: Activity: Calories burned** In-line skating: 400-800 Cross-country

 In-line skating is still mainly a young person's activity. About two-thirds of 
the 12.6 million skaters in the United States last year were younger than 18. 
Between January, 1993, and May, 1994, more than half the injuries occurred to 
skaters 14 and younger. The most common injuries were fractures, most often of 
the wrists: * Age Profile Under 12: 39% 12-17: 26 18-24: 12 25-34: 15 35 and 
older: 8 * Injuries 14 and younger: 54% 15-24: 20 25-44: 22 45 and older: 4 
</P>
<P>
 * INJURY REPORT 
</P>
<P>
 From head to toe, skaters suffered more than 65,000 injuries between January, 
1993, and May, 1994. The arms are most at risk, with 46% of wounds affecting 
either the wrist or lower arm elbow. Fractures are by far the most common kind 
of injury, about 43%. * Body Parts Injured While Skating Wrist: 16,212 Lower 
arm/elbow: 13,387 Knee/lower leg/ankle: 10,296 Head/face: 8,650 Hand/finger:

O.C. MUSIC; LIU ROSE TO OCCASION -- AND STARDOM

 It was just like in the movies. Andre Watts was all set to play a piano 
recital last year at Philadelphia's Academy of Music when the flu bug bit him. 
Hard. Feeling miserable, Watts stopped his afternoon rehearsal and begged off. 
Three hours later, a 21-year-old pianist just about to graduate from the Curtis 
Institute of Music stepped on stage in Watts' place. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, a review appeared by Lesley Valdes, music critic for the 
Philadelphia Inquirer: "It's not very often you get to witness the birth of a 
career." Meng-Chieh Liu, Valdes added, had "proved himself a young artist of 
considerable grace -- and guts." 
</P>
<P>
 Career doors started swinging open. Liu was all set to make his debut with the 
prestigious Philadelphia Orchestra last Thursday at the Mann Music Center, an 
outdoor venue. And then the sky seemed to break wide open. It rained. It 
poured. "It flooded the whole city," Liu recalled the next day from his home in 
the City of Brotherly Love. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was to have played the Chopin Second. We had had a rehearsal. It started to 
rain, and then it really came down. Nobody could get there. So they called the 
musicians at 6:45 in the evening and canceled the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't upset that I didn't play. I probably wasn't meant to play it. I felt 
really lucky that I was called. I had a wonderful rehearsal with the orchestra. 
That's what made me happy, bringing a performance off. That's what's important. 
But I'm hoping the weather will be better next time." 
</P>
<P>
 Rain isn't predicted for Saturday when Liu is scheduled to play the 
Rachmaninoff Second Concerto with Carl St.Clair and the Pacific Symphony at 
Irvine Meadows. (The program will be repeated the following day at the Pearson 
Park Amphitheatre in Anaheim.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Liu, who turns 23 on Thursday, was born in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, to a musical 
family. His mother taught piano and was his first teacher. Liu studied the 
violin as well because "in Taiwan you had to take up two instruments. I was 
pretty good with the violin too; I was concertmaster of a youth orchestra. But 
the violin never quite became part of my expression. The piano was always 
something I could dig into much more." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Liu pursued the piano with a singular vengeance. At 11, he decided he 
had to go study in Taipei "because Kaohsiung is not exactly a great 
environment. My parents were very reluctant to let me leave home at such a 
young age. But I was very firm on getting a good education." 
</P>
<P>
 He studied in Taipei for two years. His teacher pondered whether Liu should 
continue in Vienna or the United States. The teacher decided on the U.S., and 
Liu came to Curtis in 1985 to study with Jorge Bolet, Eleanor Sokoloff and 
Claude Frank successively. He planned further studies at Yale, where he'd been 
accepted on full scholarship, when fate intervened in the form of the Watts' 
cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It totally changed my life," Liu said. Big-league Columbia Artists put him on 
its roster. Meanwhile, Curtis director Gary Graffman, himself a distinguished 
pianist, cautioned Liu that the first year with a management company can be 
slow. Mindful that Liu might need a supplemental form of work to tide him over, 
Graffman offered him the chance to fill an opening on the Curtis faculty. Liu 
became the youngest teacher on the school's staff. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Artistically, Liu says that he is "still in the process of maturing. I pretty 
much know what kind of style I'm more suited to and what sort of repertory I'm 
more suited to. I'm much more suited to the Romantics and from the Romantics 
on, up to Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I never want to avoid a certain style, or for people think I have a 
deficiency of any kind. I'm always willing to open my mind (to try) just about 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Building repertory is "not an aspect I'm worried about," he said. "Right now, 
I'm much more (interested in) performance itself, the way of communication. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to become competitive with other people. I just want to compete 
with myself artistically. It's definitely depressing to look into (the 
international directory) Musical America to see so many names and so many 
managements. But I really think if you have great substance in your playing and 
have great potential, just solidifying what you have inside you will make you 
shine, no matter what." 
</P>
<P>
 * Meng-Chieh Liu will join Carl St.Clair and the Pacific Symphony in the 
Rachmaninoff Second Piano Concerto Saturday at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre, 
8808 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine (8 p.m. $14 to $48. (714) 740-2000 
(TicketMaster)) and Sunday at the Pearson Park Amphitheatre, Harbor Boulevard 
and Cypress Avenue, Anaheim (7 p.m. $15. (714) 755-5799). Each program also 
will include the orchestra playing works by Beethoven. *
