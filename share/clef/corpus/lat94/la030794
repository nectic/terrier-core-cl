ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH / SPECIAL REPORT: DRAG RACING 
</P>

 HOT DRIVERS: Orange County doesn't have its own racetrack -- the closest is in 
Pomona -- but it is nonetheless a center of interest in drag racing, the motor 
sport in which winners are decided in a matter of seconds over a quarter-mile 
track. About 1,000 of the National Hot Rod Assn.'s 78,000 national members live 
here, according to spokeswoman Billie West. . . . West says the county has one 
of the biggest concentrations in California; U.S. hotbeds are in the East and 
South. 
</P>
<P>
 CORY MAC: Yorba Linda's Cory McClenathan turned in the fastest time in the 
history of Top Fuel -- the nitromethane-burning machines that are the NHRA's 
top professional attraction -- in October when he covered a quarter mile in 
4.762 seconds. He is also the only driver with four runs of at least 300 m.p.h. 
McClenathan went from owning Mac Attack racing to driving for McDonald's. "I'm 
very pleased the way our team has jelled," he said. "I think one of the reasons 
was that we . . . got to work with each other before testing." 
</P>
<P>
 FORCE-FED: John Force, also of Yorba Linda, is coming off one of the best 
seasons in the sport's history. In 1993, he won a record-setting 11 final 
events in his Castrol GTX Funny Car -- a class in which fiberglass 
reproductions of street cars are placed on top of frames capable of reaching 
300 m.p.h. Force was so dominant, winning five in a row, that he clinched the 
overall title with three races to go. . . . It was the third series title of 
his career; Force also won in 1990 and 1991 and was second in 1992. Said Force: 
"People say I'm crazy, but I'm in love with my race car." 
</P>
<P>
 OFF TRACK: The county once was home to one of the most popular stops on the 
circuit. The Orange County International Raceway, which played host to events 
including the Super Bowl of Drag Racing, was in Irvine along the Santa Ana 
Freeway near the Sand Canyon exit. It flourished for 17 years before being shut 
down in 1983 because of the land's value for other uses. "When I drive by where 
it was, I have tears in my eyes," Force said. "It was the place to be with your 
family and friends on Saturday night."

 STATION STUDY: Simi Valley's police station was already ailing, but the Jan. 
17 earthquake pushed the deteriorating facility onto the critical list. . . . 
The city will decide tonight whether to fund a study on replacing police 
headquarters, which received about $200,000 in quake damage (B5). A new station 
could cost up to $11.3 million. . . . The city has patched up much of the 
damage."Who's to say what would happen if we had another earthquake," Detective 
Gene Hostetler said. 
</P>
<P>
 BUGGED OUT: James Fujita is only 12, but when it comes to bugs, he's bright 
beyond his years (B1). . . . The Oxnard youngster, obsessed with insects since 
he was a toddler, has taken his passion to the lecture circuit, speaking at 
Ventura County schools. . . . He has worked with some of the top entomologists 
in the field. But at school, his parents have refused to let him skip grades. 
"We don't want to rob him of his childhood," said his father, David. 
</P>
<P>
 HIS HONOR: Ventura County Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III has won a 
national award for his volunteer efforts in the community. . . . Curtis was 
honored by the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives for 
helping such groups as the Boys and Girls Club, the local Boy Scouts of America 
and the Ventura County Symphony Assn. . . . The former civics teacher said he 
particularly enjoys helping young people. "It's a way to return some of the 
great memories and experiences I've had here in the county," said Curtis, 46. 
</P>
<P>
 HOME FRONT: Once, their main concern was whether neighbors painted their 
houses the proper shade of beige. . . . But increasingly, Thousand Oaks 
homeowners groups have become a political force, taking on everything from 
lobbying City Hall to monitoring development (B5).

CORNELIUS COFFEY; TRAINED TUSKEGEE AIRMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cornelius Coffey, 91, a self-taught aviator who trained many of the Tuskegee 
Airmen after a commercial flying school refused to accept him because he was 
black. Coffey and John Robinson, a fellow black mechanic, built a one-seat 
airplane powered by a motorcycle engine and taught themselves to fly.They were 
accepted in a mechanics training program at the Curtiss Wright School of 
Aeronautics in Chicago, but the school wanted to return their tuition when it 
learned they were black. Emil Mack, a white man who ran the auto dealership 
where the two worked as mechanics, threatened to sue and the school relented. 
Two years later, Coffey and Johnson graduated at the top of their class. Coffey 
was the first black man to hold both a pilot's and a mechanic's license. He 
established the Coffey School of Aeronautics and trained more than 1,000 pilots 
from 1938 to 1945, including many of the Tuskegee Airmen, the black pilots who 
flew combat missions in World War II. In Chicago on Wednesday.

ABDULLAH SALLAL; FIRST PRESIDENT OF NORTH YEMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Field Marshal Abdullah Sallal, 74, the first president of former North Yemen. 
Sallal had led a 1962 revolution against the rule of the Imams and proclaimed a 
republic in North Yemen.He was in power in Yemen in 1967 with the backing of 
Egyptian troops that rushed to his aid to defend the new republic against 
royalist forces backed by Saudi Arabia. After Cairo and Riyadh reached 
agreement, Sallal lived in exile in Egypt until the early 1980s, when he was 
invited by President Ali Abdullah Saleh to return home. In 1990, North Yemen 
united with former Marxist South Yemen in an uneasy merger. Several months ago, 
Sallal stepped in to try to mediate a political dispute that surfaced between 
Saleh and his estranged deputy, Vice President Ali Salem Baidh, who ruled South 
Yemen before the merger. But a reconciliation accord has failed to end the 
crisis in impoverished Yemen. In Sanaa, Yemen, on Saturday of a heart attack.

GEORGE RAMOS: A PAINFUL CHOICE BETWEEN A PARISH AND A CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE RAMOS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under any other circumstance, Eddie Ramirez would be Cardinal Roger M. 
Mahony's kind of Roman Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
 Since an early age, when he prayed to be cured of tuberculosis, the 
71-year-old Ramirez has been a faithful churchgoer who accepts Rome's authority 
on matters of faith without question. He's taught his seven children to accept 
the Lord and to do His work on Earth. He's a leader of his local parish as well 
as being a regular financial contributor. 
</P>
<P>
 He refers to Mahony as "our beloved archbishop" and speaks glowingly of the 
prelate's ability to speak Spanish and his concern for Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 But these aren't ordinary times. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez is boiling mad because the archdiocese wants to turn his neighborhood 
church in Monterey Park, St. Thomas Aquinas, into an evangelical center aimed 
at converting the area's burgeoning Asian population to Catholicism. The only 
priest who speaks some Spanish at the parish, where 80% of the parishioners are 
Mexican American, is being transferred after 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, a retired East L.A. pharmacist, accuses the church of pulling a 
"corporate takeover" in search of wealthy Asians. He accuses the Los Angeles 
archdiocese of abandoning the faithful Latinos who have been the parish's 
pillars for more than 30 years. He accuses Mahony of allowing himself to be 
maneuvered by subordinates into supporting St. Thomas' conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very hurt and angry," Ramirez says. "My kids had their first Holy 
Communion in that church. They were confirmed there. Some were married there. 
The people in the archdiocese didn't come over and ask us about it. They told 
us we had to live with it. It was cut and dry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez isn't the first Catholic to question church authority. A lot of them 
have questioned the Vatican on any number of issues -- abortion, a priest's 
right to marry or the demand by some that women be allowed to become priests. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the Reformation? 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever controversy occurs, the church's reaction has been to keep its 
course. There's no room for debate. Along the way, it has made enemies but it 
continues on its unyielding way because, after all, the church of St. Peter has 
lasted for this long. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a shame because it doesn't have to make an enemy of Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 He's the kind of Catholic the archdiocese wants. He isn't some wild-eyed 
rabble-rouser; he's a law-abiding man who wants what's right for himself and 
others who worship at St. Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't want to talk to reporters but he feels he must because of the 
archdiocese's arrogant refusal to take into account the feelings of St. Thomas' 
parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hurt when he read the predictable comment by archdiocese spokesman 
Father Gregory Coiro, who told Times reporter Denise Hamilton: 
</P>
<P>
 "The church has never been democratic in that things are put for a vote. The 
church is a hierarchy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never do to the archdiocese what it is doing to us," Ramirez said 
when I spoke with him. "There's not been one encouraging word from the 
archdiocese on this. I keep praying for help." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez even went to see Mahony last month to seek an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cardinal Mahony gave me one minute," he recalls. "We weren't ready to 
protest. We don't want to embarrass the cardinal." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez emphasized that St. Thomas' parishioners -- Latino, white and Asian -- 
believe they will become strangers in the reconstituted parish. This is 
especially true for Latinos because they make up more than half of the 3.5 
million Catholics in the archdiocese. Also, 197 of the archdiocese's 284 
parishes celebrate Spanish-language Masses. 
</P>
<P>
 The archbishop listened but was unmoved. He later announced St. Thomas' 
conversion to a center for Chinese American evangelism. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Ramirez and others staged a protest march at the archdiocese 
headquarters in Downtown L.A. They say they will no longer give money to the 
church. They talk of involving local Latino political leaders, such as County 
Supervisor Gloria Molina, in the squabble. 
</P>
<P>
 And they continue to pray. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, you know Ramirez will lose. Dissenters always lose in the church. 
</P>
<P>
 In his shoes, I would have told the archdiocese where it could stick its 
arrogant view of its flock. But not Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody said he knew how we could win this," he says. "Get about 25 people 
from St. Thomas, call a news conference and say they're turning into 
Protestants. I said, 'Cut it out.' We still want to be obedient. I still want 
to be a righteous man even if our enemy is not righteous. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Jesus' help, we will confront them."

'THINGS I THOUGHT WERE A MINUS BECAME A PLUS'

<P>
 This 30-year-old tax accountant emigrated from Poland in 1983 and has been 
working at Ernst and Young since 1991, at present in the Century City office. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as jobs are concerned, I have done just about anything you can think of 
-- a shop here, a shop there, selling jeans. I got this job a year before I 
graduated. Cal State Northridge has one of the best accounting programs, and 
almost all of the accounting firms recruit out of my school. The competition is 
incredible because of the limited possibility of getting a job. And because I 
was older and from Poland, I never really thought I would get any offers. 
</P>
<P>
 All the things I thought were a minus became a plus because employers were 
looking for people who were older, who had done things in their lives. They 
were very impressed with the fact that I was bilingual and that I pretty much 
put myself through school without anybody's help. The fact that I come from a 
different culture was very important to them because that made them think my 
interests were broader than other people.  
</P>
<P>
 We often work 70 to 80 hours a week. It has been a little disappointing 
because I don't seem to be able to keep any kind of a steady schedule outside 
of work. I am grateful that I have the job, of course. And I still have about 
500 (hours of auditing work) to complete to become a Certified Public 
Accountant.  
</P>
<P>
 I came to the United States because I thought the opportunities were much 
greater here than in Poland. At that time the family left, we had martial law. 
There was nothing to do there and the economic situation was horrible. There 
was so much I wanted to do with my life and so much I could accomplish here. 
The myth of coming to America and being the best you can be -- the cliched 
sayings -- appealed to me. And in a way, it's true. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course it required a good deal of work. And often I was given a second 
look. When I was compared to American-born students, they always expected me to 
be not as good as them, and if I was better than they were, that was kind of 
surprising. I hate people coming up with an impression that because you're an 
immigrant and don't have any family here, you're supposed to be working at a 
fast-food place.

OTHER MEDIA; LA OPINION; MAKING THE IMMIGRATION DEBATE A RATIONAL ONE

 In times of difficulty, immigrants are always blamed for the problems in this 
country. They are accused of taking jobs and of taking advantage of social 
services.They are blamed for delinquency and for the problems in the schools. 
The negative debate about immigration is based on stereotypes. It's simplistic 
and stirs feelings of rejection among the native population, including 
immigrants who are now established here. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a debate that exploits the malaise of the public during difficult times 
and, because of that, it finds fertile soil to give it credibility. It is a 
politically costly debate. 
</P>
<P>
 It is obvious that the debate over immigration has left the rational path and 
that it can become a case of collective hysteria stimulated by politicians and 
opportunists. It is necessary to create the conditions for a rational debate. 
This means putting the phenomenon of immigration in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants are not responsible for the recession or for unemployment. On the 
contrary, they are entrepreneurs, yearning to participate and to be 
incorporated completely in the building of the country that they have chosen as 
their home and the homeland of their children.

 As they struggle to maintain basic services, local governments throughout 
California are coming with innovations to enhance them as well. Five cities in 
south Orange County that contract with the Sheriff's Department have mobilized 
senior citizen volunteers to assist law enforcement in routine public safety 
duties. Volunteers between the ages of 50 and 80 who are in good health and 
have no criminal record are trained to perform a variety of nonhazardous 
duties. They are supplied with uniforms, vehicles and tools like cellular 
phones. The teams free up full-time officers for other law enforcement 
activities, help cities to augment police service without significant 
additional spending and offer seniors a chance to get involved in their 
communities. More than 130 senior volunteers contribute about 75,000 hours to 
police-related services throughout south Orange County each year. RANGE OF 
DUTIES 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department works with each city to determine a senior volunteer 
team's duties, which may include:

<P>
 68, Dana Point resident since 1985 and coordinator of Bicycle Patrol for the 
city's Volunteer Interest Program for Seniors, retired in 1984 after working as 
a Rockwell International spacecraft test engineer for 37 years 
</P>
<P>
 I got acquainted with the program from a couple of deputies I met through the 
Neighborhood Watch program. I donate between 8 and 12 hours a week. We're asked 
to donate six hours each week. We received classroom training that included 
police procedures, radio communications, CPR and first aid, and how to 
communicate with the public. We're continually retrained and trained in other 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 We always go out in pairs. We patrol the entire harbor area -- beaches, 
businesses, parking lots -- and try to be visible.  
</P>
<P>
 We don't enforce the rules. We advise people of the rules. If people give us 
an argument, we immediately get on the radio and call for assistance and a 
deputy will show up and take care of things from there. We're there to observe 
and report. We try not to get involved in discussions that might lead to a 
confrontation. And we're trained to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
 When I read that somebody robbed a bank and got away I feel terrible because 
he's getting away with something and shouldn't, and I like the good guys to 
win. If I can contribute in any way, observe something that is helpful to the 
police, I'll feel that I've done a good deed. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior teams do a lot of chores that the city would normally have to pay 
for. I'd rather think that we're not really saving the city money, but that 
we're providing services that might not be offered at all. QUOTE 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing better we could have provided to the community. We could tell 
our residents that we caught every ax murderer in the world, and they'd say, 
'That's nice, thanks, and could you have the senior volunteers help with 
traffic control at that intersection near my house where all that construction 
is going on?' "  
</P>

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: MODEST PROPOSAL; 
'DESPAIR DRIVES THEM TO CRIME'; PRISONERS PREDICT THE "THREE STRIKES" PLAN WILL 
FAIL BECAUSE THE ROOT CAUSE OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR IS BEING IGNORED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Iranian Hedayat Eslaminia in the Billionaire Boys Club case. His case is under 
appeal.

 If Gov. Pete Wilson's "three strikes" anti-crime plan, which the Legislature 
sent to the governor's desk last week, is made law in its current form, the 
giant sucking sound everyone will hear is $2 billion being flushed down the 
proverbial drain. 
</P>
<P>
 As an inmate serving a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of 
parole, I find the measures in the crime plan ignorant and inadequate. This 
comes from one who once believed -- before entering the prison system -- that 
"prisoner rights" was an oxymoron and subscribed to much of the punitive 
rhetoric about penal justice and crime in general. 
</P>
<P>
 During six years of incarceration mostly at California State 
Prison-Sacramento, a maximum security facility, I've met a great number of men 
who would be considered among the most dangerous, violent felons in the state. 
Here is what I have found to be the thinking among felons, many serving 
sentences of life without parole, regarding the proposed crime package: 
</P>
<P>
 * For the majority, neither prison sentence nor the penalty was a factor when 
deciding to commit a crime. Therefore, increasing the length of prison 
sentences or penalties -- even the death penalty -- will not act as a deterrent 
whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the minority career criminal with two strikes against him, the penalty 
for murder and armed robbery would be the same: life without parole. Therefore, 
he would be inclined to murder any witnesses to reduce the chance of being 
caught. 
</P>
<P>
 What is abundantly clear from my discussions with men at Folsom Prison is that 
the measures in the anti-crime proposal will not work. They will neither deter 
nor reduce violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 So what then? In order to come up with a meaningful crime bill, the cause of 
most violent crimes must be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why they committed their crimes, most told me that despair drove 
them to it -- an abject despair so profound that most people could not begin to 
contemplate its depth. The unanimity of their responses was alarming. Each 
believed that when they were on the streets their immediate future held only 
two choices: death or prison. Therefore, they would do whatever was necessary 
to get whatever they could before meeting either fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Understanding this despair is the key to reducing violent crime. The greatest 
concentration of people suffering from this condition are in prisons and the 
nation's inner cities. Therefore, resources should be marshaled in these two 
areas to make viable alternatives available. 
</P>
<P>
 For prisons, I suggest we: 
</P>
<P>
 * Change the emphasis from the warehousing of prisoners to the rehabilitation 
of inmates through mandatory education programs, both vocational and academic. 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide intensive counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide greater aid to parolees. The state spends up to $30,000 a year for 
incarceration, but offers only $200 for a parolee to start a new life. 
</P>
<P>
 In the inner cities, I suggest: 
</P>
<P>
 * Entrepreneur workshops to foster community business ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tax breaks to businesses operating in these areas, so more jobs will be 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vocational and apprenticeship programs in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a research task force should be established to create a meaningful 
anti-crime bill and should include input from a variety of untapped sources: 
</P>
<P>
 * Inmate advisory committees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prison teachers and chaplains. 
</P>
<P>
 * Appellate lawyers who have knowledge of the penal system and contact with 
prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug-rehab counselors. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent crime will escalate if the crime plan becomes law. The measures needed 
to reduce crime belong to neither a liberal nor conservative agenda. Only 
bipartisan political will can make a difference.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: COMMUNITY COMMENT; 
ZAGREB HAS LESSONS FOR RAVAGED L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL VINER, Michael Viner is president of Dove Audio Inc. in Beverly 
Hills.

<P>
 If Los Angeles were to have a new sister city, Zagreb, Croatia, might be a 
more appropriate nominee than one might at first suspect. I spent the beginning 
of January in Zagreb, a city that has been forced to provide shelter for more 
than 500,000 homeless people amid one of the most savage conflicts affecting 
Europe since the World War II. The last three years there have been horrific. 
At first, the city itself was under direct fire. Today, its problem is to 
absorb the refugees, the overwhelming majority of whom are women, children, the 
elderly and the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in about the same time frame, Los Angeles has been devastated by 
riots, fires, mudslides and earthquakes, as well as economic recession. 
</P>
<P>
 In Zagreb, they have coped amazingly well. Virtually all of the homeless have 
been given shelter and basic food. There are no homeless people walking on the 
streets, no beggars. The crime rate per capita is less than 1% of the crime 
rate in Los Angeles. There are no drive-by shootings. A woman can still walk 
the streets in any neighborhood at any hour without fearing for her safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, where the federal government started passing out food stamps, 
hundreds and probably thousands of people abused this helping hand. Many of 
them were not among those affected by the earthquake. In Zagreb, there weren't 
any cases of price-gouging for necessities by local merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, like other people I have spoken with, I have strong attachments to the 
Los Angeles area and would not live elsewhere. But, like the people I have 
talked to, I do not live in the inner city. The closest many of us come to the 
inner city is watching the evening news and hearing about the latest victims of 
gang violence. The fact is, there are (at least) two very different cities of 
Los Angeles: one for the privileged, the other for the racial and financial 
minorities who haven't been given -- or achieved -- a way out of the ghetto. 
Some may be there by choice; perhaps they don't know any other way to live.  
</P>
<P>
 Like the people in war-ravaged Croatia, they too are victims. Many have not 
had any real family life or a chance at a good education. They have grown up, 
in many cases, in a climate in which social and moral values are not shown and 
not taught. Our social system is broken. I don't pretend I know how we can fix 
it, but I do know we cannot start until we admit the seriousness and truth of 
the situation. In Zagreb, in the refugee camps I visited, I was moved by the 
closeness and caring among the surviving family members. We too need to care 
for every member of our society. This won't be easy, but we must always be 
aware that every child is our future. If every child isn't given the 
opportunity to be free of terror and have their human needs addressed, the 
future of Los Angeles, as well as many other major U.S. cities with similar 
problems, looks bleak indeed. In Zagreb today, no matter how bad the 
circumstances, virtually every child has school lessons to learn and someone to 
study with -- so unlike many of the children in Los Angeles -- and one day the 
war will be over for them.  
</P>
<P>
 It is time for residents of the Los Angeles area to realize that we are also 
at war with inferior education, parental neglect, poverty and other serious 
social problems. It is time for us to pull together as a city and nation to 
defeat these foes.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES: THE NEXT LOS ANGELES 
/ REINVENTING OUR FUTURE; READERS RESPOND 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On Sunday, Feb. 13, The Times published "The Next Los Angeles: Reinventing Our 
Future," a special section intended to spur debate about what residents of Los 
Angeles and the region can do to shape their future. The public was invited to 
help in this search for new ways of doing things by calling TimesLink, the 
Times' telephone news and information service. Today, Voices publishes the 
final reader responses to issues examined in the special. Health Care

 I found the premise that one could even reach the hospital or emergency care 
by dialing 911 to be interesting in as much as we didn't have any telephones 
during the quake. Therefore you can't call anybody in that situation. And 
except for extreme emergencies, hospitals are not the answer. Perhaps 
Neighborhood Watch should incorporate people in the community who have some 
health care experience. For example, I am a registered nurse and I'm sure there 
are people around here who are probably physicians, people who might be able to 
assess minor injuries. It is going to have to be done on a very local level and 
be addressed consistently, not put on the shelf once the aftershocks stop.

 Health care is a right; it should be provided for everyone. And I feel that 
health care is being marketed as a product like someone was selling cars. You 
really don't need a salesperson to come out and sell you a plan, all you need 
is the literature on the various plans available to make an intelligent 
decision. The point I am driving at is that the commissions being paid -- 
anywhere from 10% to 15% of the average health-care premium -- are actually 
being delivered into the pocket of the salesperson, the salesperson's district 
manager, the broker, the regional manager. These people should be salaried. I 
know of health-care executives that are making $80,000 to $100,000 a year, and 
that is coming every month out of the premiums. For health care reform to work, 
somehow this should be eliminated. Governing

 Santa Monica has established computer communication between city hall and its

some forum on America Online or CompuServe or another computer service to 
discuss this issue.

 Two quick comments: One is that the Sim City video game publicized so 
effectively in first part of the section should really be augmented by a copy 
of Paul Jacobs' report in The Times about lobbyists' role in the process, which 
is probably more significant. The other fact is that the multiplicity of local 
governments and governmental agencies are part of the problem. In olden times, 
we heard the theory that you ought to put all your eggs in one basket and then 
watch the basket very closely. That might help make more sense out of all the 
government organizations and agencies we have to watch these days. Workplace

 I have personal experience in working with overworked and undervalued 
employees as an employee assistance programs (EAP) representative. I have three 
things that I believe we need to address. First, EAPs are usually for the 
clerks and lower-echelon people in large companies. We need to have a 
managerial or directors' assistance program to educate supervisors and middle 
management on up on how to increase human values. Secondly, we should have flex 
time whenever possible, particularly for women who have children. We also 
should have more benefits for part-time workers.

 I'm commenting on the reluctance some businesses have for telecommuting, 
especially large firms that have satellite offices out in different areas of 
L.A. It would save on actual time on the job, commuting and help air quality. 
It would also improve the morale of the employees. I'm a long-time employee -- 
14 years -- on the job, seven in my present position. I basically work on my 
own. From all the articles I've read, I would be a prime candidate, but I've 
been told that I'm ahead of my time. I'm moving to the Ventura County area for 
the betterment of my children, but my commute will be twice as long, 50 miles 
each way. Community

 What I have come across, being an immigrant myself, is that immigrants provide 
community support to their own: Koreans to Koreans, Japanese to the Japanese, 
the Iranians to the Iranians, Asian to Asian. When you have this kind of a 
support group, you really don't need to get involved with the larger community. 
One way to overcome that is to have more community-based government. Everything 
is very impersonal here. Whatever you need you can get from so-and-so, who 
migrated from your country three years ago and can help you around. There's 
really no need for you as an immigrant to reach to an outside source. With a 
smaller government, community-based, immigrants would be less scared of 
approaching whoever they need for help and thus get to know their neighbors and 
their community. Preparedness

 Legislation should be passed requiring all apartment complexes with more than 
20 units and all office buildings to have emergency supplies on hand, including 
water, generators and especially equipment for medical emergencies. This 
earthquake has shown us that it is impossible to handle all of the people who 
showed up at disaster relief centers. They should have tents and lists of 
people who live in the building who are old or handicapped. They should have 
monitors go door to door to find out if people are safe. If each apartment 
building had people trained in emergency medical procedures by the Red Cross, 
it would help a great deal to alleviate major strain on a lot of our facilities 
in the community at large.

 I am concerned that we are spending a great deal of money on cleanup when we 
should be spending a great deal of money on getting prepared for the next one. 
I recommend that we look to more concrete methods of testing non-structural and 
structural components of buildings. I think that in the long run we are looking 
for things to be earthquake resistant, not earthquake proof. The goal would be 
for people to survive and walk away from a major disaster. We should fund this 
through some kind of tax or bond. I certainly think the state should be 
involved since we are one of the areas of greatest seismic activity in the 
United States. Habitat

 There is a tremendous problem with people picking up cans and plastic and

own house -- stabbed and beaten. If they would take the shopping carts away, 
these people would not be able to pick up these things and it would probably 
cut down 70% of the crime that they commit. They're stealing these shopping 
carts and also stealing the recycling materials that rightfully belong to the

 I support the reduction of coastal development. The constant erosion and 
development is reducing the availability of it for both the public and the 
creatures that inhabit the coastline. I also would refuse to allow building on 
hillsides subject to flooding or erosion. I think we've got to accept the fact 
that Los Angeles is reaching capacity and we have to plan accordingly. We 
should no longer grant, automatically, permits for large apartment buildings, 
shopping malls and commercial buildings until the vacancy rate is much lower. 
It is ludicrous that everybody thinks that anybody can come to Los Angeles and 
we will provide the means to live here. We have to accept the fact that we have 
reached capacity.

TWIN DEPARTURES THICKEN THE GLOOM; NUSSBAUM AND MITCHELL: EQUAL BLOWS TO 
CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suddenly a sadness is settling over the Clinton presidency. It is the sadness 
that comes from opportunities missed, wrong roads taken and the departures of 
problem friends and close allies alike. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few days, the President has lost two such men -- one a close 
friend, the other a valuable ally. It is hard to tell which of the two 
departures will cause more problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The resignation of White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum was inevitable and 
appropriate. The triggering events were related to the Whitewater controversy; 
the need now is to fill the sudden vacancy with an attorney whose competence is 
above question and whose past association with the Clintons is minimal. Another 
FOB -- Friend of Bill -- should not be selected. As Niccolo Machiavelli warned, 
the Prince is held responsible for the behavior of a chosen close adviser, 
especially if that adviser is a friend, far more than the adviser is held 
responsible for the behavior of the Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same category of disruption as the Nussbaum resignation was Senate 
Majority Leader George Mitchell's decision not to run for reelection this fall. 
The immediate effect of that was to throw wide open the competition for who is 
to be the next majority leader. Until Senate Democrats make that decision, the 
intelligent and accomplished Mitchell is a lame duck in the leadership post and 
the White House is without a key, powerful Senate ally. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no one has worked harder or more successfully than Sen. Mitchell to 
keep the White House boat from rocking needlessly. His steadying hand will be 
missed, especially now that the Clinton presidency is at a crossroads. 
</P>
<P>
 Some kind of congressional hearing on Whitewater seems less and less 
avoidable. The fear is that it will be an absolute circus, with the net effect 
of immunizing testimony that should not be protected, thus making the 
prosecutorial task even harder. Now subpoenas are flying and dozens of top 
advisers and officials have been served, which may mean nothing -- or 
everything. The office of the special counsel, which came into being at a 
stroke of the pen of Atty. Gen. Janet Reno last month, is in high gear even at 
this early date. That should help reassure the nation that the investigation 
will be thorough and honest. 
</P>
<P>
 Proper and absolutely necessary though it is, the probe by Special Counsel 
Robert Fiske casts a cloud over an Administration that seemed finally to be 
getting its presidential act together. One does not have to be a Democrat to 
hope that the nation will not be put through a debilitating agony, and the 
presidency through another slow and eventually fatal torture. Thus the sadness 
over the White House bodes to hang over Washington itself.

PROTEST WATCH; CLINIC DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This time, fortunately, it was an easy call. A jury in Pensacola, Fla., 
deliberated less than three hours Saturday before convicting Michael F. 
Griffin, 32, of first-degree murder for the slaying of Dr. David Gunn. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunn was shot three times in the back last year when he arrived for work at a 
clinic to perform abortions. Police officers testified that Griffin, an 
anti-abortion activist, confessed to the crime immediately after the shooting. 
Right after the verdict, a Florida circuit judge sentenced Griffin, a former 
chemical worker, to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin's act was unconscionable. Yet the intimidation of patients and 
incidents of violence against clinic physicians and nurses continue; many of 
these acts stop just short of murder. Indeed, following Griffin's conviction, 
the leader of Defensive Action, an anti-abortion group that does advocate 
violence against doctors who perform the procedure, said that the verdict did 
not change his position that killing those physicians is acceptable. Strong 
condemnations from President Clinton and Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, among others, 
have apparently not persuaded extremists that such violence is in no way 
protected by the First Amendment's guarantees of freedom of speech and 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court recently upheld use of federal anti-racketeering laws 
against individuals who conspire to incite violence at abortion clinics. But 
Congress needs to go further and complete work on a bill giving broad federal 
protection, ensuring freedom of access to clinic entrances.

CAR-POOL LANES ON FREEWAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Car-Pool Lanes Get a Push," Feb. 18: 
</P>
<P>
 Leave it to Caltrans to make hay out of the misery caused by the Northridge 
earthquake. If this agency's social engineers are allowed to bring back the 
diamond lane on the Santa Monica Freeway, the result will be at least as bad 
and probably worse than it was in 1976: three lanes of traffic moving at a 
snail's pace while a minuscule number of cars zip blithely along the diamond 
lane. 
</P>
<P>
 It's bad enough to deny use of newly constructed freeway lanes to people who 
don't find it feasible to car-pool. It's downright despicable to take away an 
existing lane of the busiest freeway in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of Citizens Against Diamond Lanes in 1976, I went to Sacramento to 
protest the Santa Monica diamond lane. I can still recall Adriana Gianturco 
telling the Assembly Transportation Committee how well the diamond lane would 
work "if the people in L.A. would get their act together." Will Caltrans ever 
learn that we aren't marionettes who exist only for the purpose of taking 
direction from Gianturco and her successors? 
</P>
<P>
 RICHARD F. ROPER 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica 
</P>
<P>
 For the past several years Caltrans has chosen to build, build, build new 
freeway lanes instead of enhancing the quality and strength of the freeways we 
already have. And what a mess we're in because of it! 
</P>
<P>
 Now that people are heavily relying on car-pool and bus priority travel 
routes, Caltrans is reluctant to continue to use existing traffic lanes for 
car-pools and buses when the I-10 is restored. Instead, Caltrans (again) wants 
to build, build, build new lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Like its seismic standards, the Caltrans attitude is based on facts of 18 
years ago. Things have changed. Traffic congestion, economics and this region's 
inability to meet air quality standards all dictate that we use our present 
resources more efficiently. Ride-sharing lanes are more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, both U.S. Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena and Mayor 
Richard Riordan are wise enough to see that. They support solving the problems 
now by dedicating ride-sharing lanes on the present freeway system. Let's hope 
they can wise up the "build, build, build" bureaucracy.

JUSTICE BLACKMUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Violence and vengeance are as American as apple pie. Why else do we have this 
love affair with the death penalty? I commend Supreme Court Justice Harry A. 
Blackmun for his stand in opposition to capital punishment (Feb. 23).The death 
penalty has no place in civilized society. It has been proven not to be a 
deterrent. It is more expensive than keeping a person in prison for life when 
all the costs of trials, retrials and petitions are considered. It is 
discriminatory. We reserve the death penalty for poor people, for minorities, 
and for the mentally ill and mentally retarded. Rich people are never executed. 
</P>
<P>
 Murderers should be kept behind bars. No opponent of capital punishment wants 
them free in society.

 * Blackmun is a supreme hypocrite! Here we have a man that is personally 
responsible for the death of over 30 million pre-born humans via the Roe vs. 
Wade declaring that he is opposed to capital punishment! To say that it is OK 
to take the life of an innocent, defenseless human beings while at the same 
time mass murderers have the right to live is absolutely beyond comprehension.

<P>
 * Hurrah for Blackmun's rejection of our inhuman and unconstitutional death 
penalty! By contrast, Justice Antonin Scalia rationalizes his conviction in 
favor of that system with its vengeful and premeditated killings.  
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the likelihood that it will cause an innocent person to be killed, 
capital punishment is unnecessary and, for that reason alone, is cruel and 
unusual.

ANYBODY IN CHARGE THERE?; CIA BUNGLING OF THE ALDRICH AMES SPY CASE STILL IS 
HARD TO FATHOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Congress that in the last few years made some deep cuts in the nation's 
intelligence budget may be tempted to cut deeper still during the coming budget 
battle, with the Central Intelligence Agency being a special target because of 
simmering congressional ire over the Aldrich Ames spy case. The anger is 
understandable; for now it remains inexplicable if not inexcusable that someone 
like Ames could have gone undetected for so long as he allegedly pursued a 
highly lucrative spying career on behalf of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Congress is right to demand a full and verifiable accounting from 
the CIA about its monumental internal security failures, and right to insist on 
much tighter procedures for monitoring employees of the intelligence services, 
enacting an indiscriminately punitive cut in intelligence spending is not the 
way to go. The case for maintaining a strong intelligence gathering capability 
-- and an alert and effective counterintelligence arm -- seems self-evident. 
What has to be drastically altered, certainly in the CIA, is the mind-boggling 
bureaucratic ineptitude that allowed betrayal to go on for so long, and so 
visibly. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, says the government, collected more than $2.5 million from Moscow for 
the secrets he allegedly began selling in 1985. He was not a bit shy about 
spending it ostentatiously, during a period when one major CIA operation after 
another in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe was going bad. Yet it seems to 
have taken five or six years before the CIA, at last working cooperatively with 
the FBI, drew any connections between Ames' grand and even showy lifestyle (on 
a $70,000 salary) and the near-certain knowledge that the CIA had been 
penetrated. The overwhelming question is why it took so long. 
</P>
<P>
 It's clear that Congress doesn't intend to leave it up to the CIA to clean its 
house unaided; look for legislation to tighten up monitoring of the 
intelligence services. It's also clear, if the government's allegations are 
correct, that Moscow's ace mole provided information easily worth the 
astonishingly high payments he received. The terrible thing is not just that he 
was so successful, but that the CIA made it so easy for him.

ARMENIA'S ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former foreign minister of Armenia describes that country as a "buffer 
state" and advises the Clinton Administration to achieve an American vision of 
peace in the area through a "political and economic commitment" to Armenia 
(Commentary, Feb. 25). 
</P>
<P>
 Armenia, in return, he thinks, can help stop potential Russian imperial 
aspirations in the region, and help balance pan-turanist impulses within 
Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenia will not be a valuable partner for regional peace with the United 
States if Armenian politicians try to sell Armenia to U.S. administrations as 
some kind of chess piece destined to counterbalance geopolitical forces and 
regional powers in the Transcaucasus. 
</P>
<P>
 Armenia should not be viewed simply as a military base against Russian 
imperial impulses or as a roadblock against Turkish interests in Central Asia. 
Instead, Armenia should be seen as a great mediator of regional peace, a 
facilitator of international communication and a catalyst for economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 This represents the position of the current government in Armenia and this is 
also why Raffi K. Hovannisian is no longer a member in it.

A SINATRA-BONO SUMMIT?; INDUSTRY SHOULD ENCOURAGE MUSICIANS TO REACH BEYOND 
CATEGORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The high point in last Tuesday's Grammy Awards was neither played nor sung. It 
was rock star Bono's rhetorically dazzling presentation of the Grammy Legend 
Award to Frank Sinatra. The leader of the Irish band U2 honored the onstage and 
the offstage Sinatra equally: the pop-jazz vocalist with the uncannily perfect 
phrasing and the cocksure strutter with "attitude" to spare. In his acceptance 
speech, Sinatra, who did not hail, hail rock 'n' roll on its emergence, told 
the assembled music makers that he wanted to get to know them better. Indeed he 
seemed on the verge of seizing the moment to talk a little shop. His "people," 
however, reportedly "felt that he would have talked for about an hour" and they 
gave him the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad: If Sinatra had talked for an hour, Bono, you may count on it, would 
not have kept silent, and what a conversation might have resulted! Bono praised 
Sinatra as a singer who turns songwriters into poets. But Bono himself has 
pursued the same end with different means. Each has surely thought about the 
evolution of the diction, the verbal music, of song. Why not let them talk 
about it? 
</P>
<P>
 Conversations across musical borders can be exhilarating. On Wednesday night, 
Ambassador Auditorium's "Guitar Summit" brought together Pepe Romero and Paco 
Pena, representing the classical and the flamenco guitar traditions of Spain, 
and Joe Pass and Leo Kottke, representing the jazz and (roughly) the blues 
traditions of the United States. Think of flamenco as Spanish blues and of 
blues as American flamenco and you start hearing them afresh. But to the 
visibly diverse and rapt capacity crowd, the two intramural art music-folk 
music dialogues were at least as revealing as the overarching Spanish-American 
one.  
</P>
<P>
 Next year, National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, will you consider 
pre-recording a cross-border conversation or two -- whether in words or in 
music or, ideally, in both -- for your big show? Music, American music in 
particular, has a captivating history. Give your audience a taste of that 
history and it will come back eagerly for more.

BAD SCIENCE, EVOLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While I commend you for your editorial, "Why Bad Science Can't Be Good 
Education" (Feb. 27), on the threat to science education by pseudoscience from 
the left and right, I must take issue with your statement that " . . . 
evolution has been proven beyond any doubt . . . " The problem with this 
well-meaning but misleading sentence is that a scientific theory (in contrast 
to a mathematical theorem) can never be proved. We scientists prefer to use the 
term confirm. We confirm theories, we don't prove them. 
</P>
<P>
 A scientific theory must always be testable and falsifiable. This sets a 
scientific theory apart from a religious belief, which is neither testable nor 
falsifiable because it is based on the faith of the believer. A theory is 
testable if it can be questioned by experimentation or observation. It is 
falsifiable if an experiment could conceivably provide evidence against the 
theory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the history of science, many important theories (the Earth-centered 
universe, for example) have had to be discarded or modified as a result of new 
evidence. An enormous body of evidence has accumulated for hundreds of years 
(evolution is older than Darwin) that serves to confirm the theory, and there 
are precious few scientists who doubt that evolution of living things has 
occurred. Nevertheless, evolution remains testable and falsifiable; it has 
never been, and can never be, proved.

 I applaud The Times' desire to see dogma removed from the science education 
our children receive. However, within the very editorial arguing for this, The 
Times decided to parade its own dogmatic view: "Although science continues to 
debate the fine points, evolution has been proven beyond any doubt, no more 
open to question than whether the Earth is round." While that position squares 
nicely with the position of many people, especially those who hold secular 
philosophies, it is not a true statement from a scientific viewpoint. I suggest 
that the writer of that editorial spend a little time with Michael Denton's 
book, "Evolution: A Theory In Crisis." Denton's book is just one example of the 
debate raging among legitimate scientists who are taking a stand against 
politically correct science. Evolution remains an interesting theory. It is far 
from "proven beyond any doubt."

 Was it an accident that you featured an article on Francis Crick on your front 
page the day after your editorial about bad science (Feb. 28)? Crick's 
assertions on dreams, memories, joys, sorrows, ambition, identity and free will 
are the product of the "belief" that our behavior can be reduced to genes, 
chemistry and ultimately physics. This is reductionism of the first order. It 
produces quackery just as does the bad science you condemn in your editorial. 
You assert that evolution has been proven beyond a doubt; according to science 
it took at least 11 billion years for life to occur on Earth, consciousness was 
a later development, and human consciousness much later still. 
</P>
<P>
 To ignore the meaningful differences between the inorganic, life, 
consciousness and human awareness, as Crick and most neuroscientists do, is to 
take us backward to a time before life made a difference on Earth. I call that 
very bad science.

PERSPECTIVE ON SPYING; HERE'S A RED HERRING TO CHEW ON; A FORMER KGB COLONEL 
TIES INTO A PACKAGE THE SPECTACULAR 1985 UN-DEFECTION OF VITALY YURCHENKO AND 
THE ALDRICH AMES CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKHAIL P. LYUBIMOV, Retired KGB colonel Mikhail P. Lyubimov served as an 
intelligence officer in London, 1961-65, in Moscow, 1964-76, and was KGB 
resident in Copenhagen from 1976-80. He now writes novels. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a spring morning in 1985, Gen. Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, the head of the KGB 
foreign intelligence directorate and future chief of the spy agency, was roused 
from his sleep for some sensational information: The head of the Central 
Intelligence Agency's Soviet and Eastern Europe counterintelligence department, 
Aldrich H. Ames, had offered his services to the KGB. Ames had already 
identified the first batch of American agents in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 I am sure Ames willingly offered his services and was not recruited. No one in 
the KGB would have approached such a big shot. Never in KGB history had such a 
high-ranking foreign official been recruited, though others had also offered 
their services voluntarily. I suspect Ames showed up at a Soviet official 
representation somewhere abroad (definitely not in America) and simply offered 
to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 The news of Ames' willingness to work aroused mixed feelings in Kryuchkov. All 
the agents Ames betrayed held high-level positions in the KGB. Their exposure 
would call down accusations of corruption in the KGB from the very top of the 
Communist Party.  
</P>
<P>
 Ames was well known to the KGB through a former CIA agent, Edward Lee Howard, 
who had worked for the CIA from 1981 to 1983 but was sacked for alcoholism and 
drug use. Shortly after his dismissal, an embittered Howard left for Vienna and 
began to cooperate with the KGB there. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ames' proposal, the KGB was faced with two tasks: to eliminate enemy 
agents and to hide Ames as the principal source of their discoveries. Among the 
agents that the KGB wanted to silence was the newly appointed KGB resident in 
London, Oleg Gordievsky. 
</P>
<P>
 To help hide Ames' information, the KGB used so-called "long-leash" tactics -- 
reducing the secret information that some suspect agents were given on 
plausible pretexts, while keeping the agents under surveillance. As a result of 
this treatment, Gordievsky was recalled from London on a false pretext and 
brought to Moscow for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 The KGB was not in a hurry to arrest Gordievsky because that would have made 
American and British intelligence look for the cause of the leak, which could 
have eventually led to Ames.  
</P>
<P>
 However, an extraordinary thing happened: With the help of MI-6, the British 
intelligence service, Gordievsky boldly fled to the West. The KGB's adversaries 
got a chance to analyze the situation with the help of Gordievsky, an 
experienced intelligence officer, and this could have jeopardized Ames.  
</P>
<P>
 And I think it was then, after Gordievsky's escape, that a highly elaborate 
and daring operation, aimed at misinforming American intelligence, was quickly 
planned and implemented. America was to be convinced that it was Howard, 
already considered a traitor, who had disclosed agents in the Soviet Union. By 
that time, Howard was of little practical use to the KGB anyway. The operation 
was daring and unprecedented in the KGB's history. Before then, the idea of a 
double defection had simply been fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is how it worked: On Aug. 1, 1985, the deputy head of the KGB's U.S. 
department, Vitaly Yurchenko, flew on a business trip to Rome. There, Yurchenko 
defected, offered his services to the CIA and was transported to the United 
States.  
</P>
<P>
 Yurchenko revealed incredibly valuable information. He told the CIA that 
Howard had been a KGB agent. He also betrayed a National Security Agency 
official, Ronald Pelton, who had offered his services to the KGB. He spoke 
about the use of special chemical "spy dust" which the KGB applied during 
cleaning to the suits of American diplomats in Moscow, enabling the KGB to 
track them wherever they went. His admissions left no doubt with the CIA that 
Yurchenko's defection was genuine. 
</P>
<P>
 This was an unprecedented operation: Never before had the KGB gone so far as 
to deliberately reveal secrets to its adversary. Moreover, it had always been 
considered immoral in the KGB to give away such agents as Howard. But more 
vital interests were at stake this time, and a smoke screen with Howard at its 
center was put up.  
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 19, Howard was interrogated in Santa Fe, N. M. But he did not give 
any evidence and the FBI had no legal grounds to arrest him. Two days later, 
Howard evaded his watchers and -- with the help of the KGB -- fled to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 2, Yurchenko redefected to the Soviet Embassy in Washington and 
returned to the Soviet Union. He gave a Cold War-type press conference at which 
he claimed he had been kidnaped by the CIA in Rome and sent to the United 
States under the influence of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yurchenko played his role excellently. Soon, not without the KGB's help, the 
world press started saying that the CIA had mistreated Yurchenko and that he 
took offense, deciding to return to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the CIA believed Yurchenko was that the agency had burned itself 
once before. In the 1960s, a KGB official named Yuri Nosenko defected to the 
CIA and disclosed the entire eavesdropping system inside the U.S. Embassy in 
Moscow. The Americans wouldn't believe him, thinking he had KGB orders to 
infiltrate the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIA interrogated Nosenko, treated him roughly and kept him in jail for 
several months. Finally, they must have realized that Nosenko was sincere, but 
precious time had been lost. Ever since, the CIA had felt guilty. And their 
guilt helped in the case of Yurchenko. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, a huge red herring was let loose into U.S. waters. The KGB could start 
chasing the agents betrayed by Ames while the Americans were supposedly tricked 
into believing that it was Howard who was responsible for the leak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yurchenko defection / redefection was staged so brilliantly that most 
people in the KGB were surprised to see that Yurchenko not only was not put in 
jail or executed for having disclosed the agents, but was put back to work. He 
quietly finished out his career and is now enjoying his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 What is more, both Yurchenko and Howard met American journalists in Moscow and 
kept the red herring afloat with the help of the media, misleading the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian intelligence service conducted a brilliant operation, to which 
there are no equals in the entire history of the Cold War.

RADIOACTIVE WASTE DUMP HAS TO BE IN WARD VALLEY; ENVIRONMENT: 'BENIGN' 
LOW-LEVEL MATERIAL CAN HAVE A HALF-LIFE OF 5,730 YEARS -- IT'S NOT FOR LOCAL 
LANDFILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL S. MARCUS, Dr. Carol S. Marcus is director of the nuclear medicine 
outpatient clinic at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Times Column One story in January, "Caught in Fallout of Waste War," aptly 
depicted the plight of hospital, academic and biomedical industry low-level 
radioactive waste producers. However, the legitimacy of calls for an 
alternative to the now-licensed Ward Valley disposal site requires full 
examination. 
</P>
<P>
 The crux of the argument surrounding Ward Valley is whether waste disposal at 
an arid desert site is preferable to other means of managing such radioactive 
waste. Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a vocal opponent of the Ward Valley site 
in eastern San Bernardino County, proposes construction of an above-ground, 
temporary holding facility for radioactive waste produced by biotechnology, 
medical and academic institutions, The senator bases her suggestion on the 
belief that such waste is, essentially, benign and can therefore be stored for 
"decay" before disposing of it at a normal sanitary landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an alternative ignores two indisputable realities. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there is significant radioactivity in "low-level" waste. Prime examples 
include cesium-137, a workhorse in the treatment of cancer (half-life: 30.2 
years) and carbon-14, an invaluable laboratory research tool (half-life: 5,730 
years). How will these long-lived wastes be handled (that is, stored and 
managed) at a temporary facility? Will employees there be as protected against 
exposure to radioactivity as they would if the waste were permanently 
underground, in a stable, desert setting? Moreover, who will absorb the costs 
associated with constructing such a facility? Where will it be located? What 
laws and regulations will govern it? 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these considerations has, in accordance with the Low-Level Radioactive 
Waste Policy Act of 1980, been painstakingly incorporated into the Ward Valley 
plan, whereas all remain completely unanswered by Boxer. Also, given the 
damaging Jan. 17 earthquake in Los Angeles, what makes more sense: a 
geologically tested and remote desert location, or an expensive concrete 
mausoleum, possibly in your back yard? 
</P>
<P>
 Second, waste is waste. Low-level radioactive waste produced by academic, 
medical and biotechnology sources is not fundamentally different from such 
waste produced by utilities. In fact, reactors produce nearly all our medical 
isotopes. If Boxer's holding facility is to exclude waste from power reactors, 
one must assume that it would prohibit waste from medical isotope production 
reactors as well. In the meantime, the utilities' disposal needs would also 
remain unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission has previously considered and addressed 
the use of temporary holding facilities in managing low-level waste. Its 
conclusion: Temporary storage should, as the name implies, be of very short 
duration. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the issue of long-lived medical radionuclides, there is still the 
problem of radioactive animal carcasses and human tissue used in medical 
research and testing. Such waste must be disposed of in a manner that properly 
addresses the problem of decomposition and infection. In a temporary holding 
facility, huge freezers would be needed and a power failure would provide a new 
and pungent definition of a nuclear "meltdown." 
</P>
<P>
 The most ironic aspect of the temporary-holding-facility-vs.-Ward Valley 
argument is Boxer's contention that the latter, if built, could become a 
national depository for low-level radioactive waste. In reality, the temporary 
facility would be subject to the interstate commerce clause of the 
Constitution, and would therefore not benefit from access limitations provided 
by the Low level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985. Therefore, it 
is Boxer's alternative siting that would become a national waste depository. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's get real. The Ward Valley site-selection process began in early 1986. 
The state of California then conducted an extensive, four-year review of the 
Ward Valley site before licensing it. Boxer would have us scrap that entire 
process in favor of siting and constructing an alternative facility for which 
there is no legal framework, no funding source and no site. It can't possibly 
produce a solution in time to accommodate the already existing disposal needs 
of biotechnology companies and medical and academic institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Boxer wakes up to this reality, our biotechnology industry -- now 
the world's leader -- will have fled to neighboring states, along with some of 
our academic talent. Meanwhile, waste stored in hundreds of urban locations 
throughout the state will be waiting for the next earthquake or fire, instead 
of resting safely in Ward Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the Low Level Radioactive Waste Act was to place the 
responsibility of managing waste in the hands of individual states. Sen. 
Boxer's ill-conceived "alternative" abandons nuclear power-plant waste, cannot 
possibly serve significant quantities of biomedical waste and does not even 
address common commercial waste such as most sealed sources. The only 
responsible alternative to Ward Valley now is Ward Valley soon.

L.A. MUST DO MORE TO HELP BUSINESS RECOUP; QUAKE RECOVERY: EVEN BEFORE JAN. 17 
IT WAS HARD TO DO BUSINESS HERE; WE NEED SPECIAL-ASSISTANCE TEAMS TO CUT THE 
HASSLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK TUTTLE, Rick Tuttle is Los Angeles city controller. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In spite of all that has been done to speed recovery from the Northridge 
earthquake, there is a missing element that will stifle recovery unless tackled 
immediately: the need to provide damaged businesses with the same level of 
attention given to displaced renters and homeowners. While many homeowners and 
renters have yet to find replacement housing, at least there is a clear sense 
that people in high places are working on realistic solutions. The same cannot 
be said about disrupted and displaced businesses -- which total at least 
80,000, the number that had applied for assistance from the Small Business 
Administration as of the end of February. 
</P>
<P>
 What we need is no less than the creation of business assurance and assistance 
teams to reach out affirmatively to every business impacted by the quake. 
Obviously, to be effective these teams would require different skills and a 
much greater level of sophistication than those who went into the parks, but 
without a such a mechanism I fear that the pattern of "business as usual" will 
creep into the dealings that damaged businesses have with city departments and 
other governmental agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Business assurance and assistance teams would be charged with the task of 
contacting and interviewing every major employer who has suffered damages from 
the quake, or whose business has been hurt indirectly from damages to other 
businesses or infrastructure. The goal would be to determine what obstacles 
exist to their reopening or return to full operations; the teams would use all 
city powers to attempt to overcome those obstacles. This would include, but not 
be limited to, intervention with individual departments or governmental 
agencies, seeking new legislation or helping with financing. From what I've 
seen from other governmental agencies, we would have their full cooperation if 
leadership was provided by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan could establish a business-liaison section within his 
office to serve in an ombudsman's role and to provide the necessary leadership 
and oversight of the business assurance and assistance teams. The teams 
themselves could be taken from the existing deployment of civil servants and 
contractors hired to make our recovery a success. Undoubtedly some new skills 
and resources would be needed, but that should be covered by the already 
authorized emergency-aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
 As city controller, my immediate concern is the losses in revenue caused by 
the closed shopping malls, business centers and stores. But the plain fact is 
that even before the earthquake, it was hard to do business in Los Angeles and 
harder yet to start a business in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that thousands of firms are in the position of deciding whether to restart 
a business interrupted on Jan. 17, the danger is that those in marginal 
positions will opt out without extraordinary efforts by us in government to 
provide the assistance and assurance necessary for them to rebuild and reopen. 
Inertia in our system is daunting, and the obstacles to rebuilding are higher 
than we may believe, if our post-riots experience is any guide. But the risk to 
the city it too great do anything less than I've outlined.  
</P>
<P>
 In the days and weeks since Jan. 17, the city has done much under the 
leadership of our new mayor to restore confidence and normalcy after the most 
costly natural disaster in U.S. history. But while we have tried to rebuild and 
rehouse tens of thousands of our citizens, other cities have been trying to 
persuade our businesses to relocate in other counties and states. These 
pitchmen usually claim that people should leave Los Angeles because they will 
find a more cooperative government elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
 We need to keep these businesses here, easing the path to recovery by 
marshaling resources for assistance, as Mayor Riordan has been doing. Toward 
that end, I know that the mayor and his staff are seriously considering my 
proposals for special business-aid teams. 
</P>
<P>
 When we look back on 1994, I predict it will be seen as a turning point for 
the City of Angels. It remains to be seen which way we turn. We still have time 
to take the right direction and come -- as Cal State Northridge says in its new 
motto -- "Not just back, better."

NHL ROUNDUP; NEW FLYER LAMB FITS RIGHT IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Lamb, traded to Philadelphia by Ottawa on Saturday, filled in for ailing 
Eric Lindros and scored a third-period goal that helped the Flyers beat the 
Tampa Bay Lightning, 3-1, at St. Petersburg, Fla., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindros suffered back spasms after being struck by a puck during pregame 
warm-ups and the Flyers managed little offense until goals from Lamb and Mark 
Recchi broke the game open. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors said Lindros' status is day to day. Lindros had a knee injury earlier 
in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary 4, Washington 4 -- The Flames, trailing by 3-0 after the first period, 
were in danger of losing for the fourth time in a row Sunday at Landover, Md. 
But the Flames came back to tie on Trent Yawney's goal at 11:04 of the third 
period. It came about six minutes after Sylvain Cote put the Capitals ahead, 
4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo 3, Detroit 2 -- Goaltender Dominik Hasek, who left the game briefly in 
the first period to have a broken skate fixed, made 43 saves as the Sabres won 
at Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 5, Winnipeg 3 -- Doug Brown and Ron Francis each scored two goals 
as the Penguins won at Winnipeg, the Jets' first loss in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 2, Montreal 2 -- Dave Gagner's third-period goal capped a rally from a 
2-0 deficit for the Stars at Dallas.

SHARKS TAKE BIGGEST BITE OUT OF DUCKS; HOCKEY: SAN JOSE MAKES IT 6-0 AGAINST 
ANAHEIM THIS SEASON WITH 6-0 VICTORY, DAMAGING PLAYOFF HOPES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Mighty Ducks' spot in the Stanley Cup playoffs ends up being their 
La-Z-Boys, this is the game they will remember. 
</P>
<P>
 They came into their final game of the season against the San Jose Sharks 
saying it was probably their biggest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 They left with their worst defeat of the season, a 6-0 loss at San Jose Arena 
in front of a sellout crowd of 17,190 that started a jubilant "Playoffs! 
Playoffs!" chant in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
 It was basically over in 20 minutes, and the margin of defeat was a 
club-record -- one goal worse than their 7-2 opening-night loss to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were ready," Coach Ron Wilson said. "I think the players thought 
we were ready. San Jose was just more ready, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks left knowing they have gone 0-6 against the conference rival they 
would have been voted most likely to beat.  
</P>
<P>
 Win this one, and they would have trailed the Sharks by one point with 17 
games remaining in the race for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff 
spot. Instead they left trailing by five, with the Kings another point behind 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going into the game, we were looking at it as a life-or-death thing," forward 
Garry Valk said. "After the game, you like to look for positives. There are 17 
games left. We're not written off yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty minutes after this game started, the Ducks trailed, 3-0. San Jose 
hadn't scored three goals in the first period all season. Wilson responded by 
pulling goalie Guy Hebert for Mikhail Shtalenkov at the start of the second 
period in a futile attempt to change the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty minutes later, they were behind, 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks got scorched by the line of Igor Larionov, Sergei Makarov and Johan 
Garpenlov. Makarov and defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh each scored two goals, and 
those two and Larionov each had a club-record four points -- a feat Larionov 
and Makarov had duplicated in a victory over the Ducks in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing with the defense pair of Jeff Norton and Ozolinsh, another former 
Soviet, the line gives San Jose a fearsome fivesome who can win a game by 
themselves. They basically did that Sunday, with a little help from goalie 
Arturs Irbe, a Latvian who made 25 saves to record the fourth shutout of his 
career and his second this season against the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Ducks are left to ponder playoff hopes that are growing dimmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only five points back. It's not like it's 30," Wilson said. "I'm not 
going to put that much weight on this. We've still got 17 games left, and I'm 
sure we're going to bounce back. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Sharks) haven't shaken us off all year, and they've beat us six times. 
They've beaten us, but now they've got to beat other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Corkum, one of the players who was supposed to try to slow down Larionov, 
was trying to see the positive side too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough loss, no doubt about it. The reality is we have 17 games left. 
I don't consider us out of the playoff picture just yet. We've just got to pull 
up our pants and shake this one off and be ready Tuesday against Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Terry Yake agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost six to these guys and four to L.A. and we're still right in the 
hunt," he said. "I predict, give us five or eight games and we'll be right back 
within a point of them. The bottom line is we've got to beat more other teams 
because that all we've got left."

HUSTON PLAYS ALONE AND STANDS ALONE IN THE END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Playing by himself after Fred Couples withdrew because of a back injury, John 
Huston came from four shots behind Sunday to shoot a six-under 66 and win the 
Doral Open by three strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Huston was alone over the first 11 holes at Doral's Blue Monster course after 
Couples -- his scheduled playing partner -- withdrew before teeing off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hit one ball (in practice) and it felt like my back exploded," said 
Couples. "I stood there and absolutely could not move." 
</P>
<P>
 Huston had only a walking scorer and the gallery for company until the 12th 
hole, when Brian Claar, who had completed play, came out to join him. "It 
worked out OK," Huston said. "When Brian came out, it kind of helped me pace 
myself coming home." 
</P>
<P>
 Huston finished at 14-under 274 in his third victory -- all in Florida -- in 
seven years on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Andrade and Brad Bryant shared second at 277.

WCC BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; PEPPERDINE WINS; SAN DIEGO SURPRISES GONZAGA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pepperdine needed a strong finish. San Francisco could have used a better 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 What resulted was familiar to both teams as Pepperdine defeated the Dons, 
82-79, in the semifinals of the West Coast Conference tournament Sunday night 
at Santa Clara's Toso Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the fourth consecutive year that the Waves reached the final at San 
Francisco's expense. Second-seeded Pepperdine (18-10) will seek its third NCAA 
tournament berth in four seasons when it meets fourth-seeded San Diego (18-10) 
in the title game at 9 tonight. The Toreros upset Gonzaga, 83-75, in the other 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco lost its leading scorer, Gerald Walker, five minutes into the 
game. The sophomore guard suffered a broken right fibula when he landed 
awkwardly after being fouled from behind by Pepperdine guard Bryan Parker on a 
breakaway dunk attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not bitter," said Don Coach Jim Brovelli, whose team finished 17-11. "I'm 
really disappointed. We would have liked to be at full strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't place the blame on anyone. It was a hard foul. It was an intentional 
foul, no doubt about it. Gerald got injured, and that's unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury defended Parker, who appeared to be going for the 
ball when he hit Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel bad for Gerald, but anybody who knows Bryan Parker knows he didn't do 
that on purpose," Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three years ago we lost Doug Christie to torn knee ligaments in this same 
tournament in this same gym. These things just happen. (Parker's foul) wasn't a 
cheap shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Without Walker, San Francisco stayed even with Pepperdine until the Waves made 
a move with five minutes left. A basket by forward Dana Jones gave the Waves 
the lead for good, 70-68, with 4:55 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine increased its advantage to 76-70 on a three-pointer by guard Damin 
Lopez with two minutes left and led by at least four until San Francisco's 
Wilson Stephens made a free throw with three seconds remaining to account for 
the final score. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones led the Waves with 22 points and 13 rebounds, and Lopez had 20 points 
with four three-pointers. Reserve forward Clark James added 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Orlando Smart paced the Dons with 21 points and 10 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 83, Gonzaga 75 -- The Toreros took an 18-point halftime lead and 
held off the top-seeded Bulldogs to reach their first tournament final. 
</P>
<P>
 Conference champion Gonzaga (21-7) made several runs in the second half, 
getting as close as five points with 7:17 to play, but San Diego answered every 
challenge before pulling away by making 13 of 18 free throws in the last 3:11. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew they were going to come back," San Diego Coach Hank Egan said. "What 
was important was that we kept our poise. For the most part, we did that." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Doug Harris led San Diego (18-10) with 25 points.  
</P>
<P>
 Forward Matt Stanford led Gonzaga with 25 points. Gonzaga shot 39%, San Diego 
51%.

HOFSTRA MAKES NCAA FIELD AS 9-20 TEAM

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his final college season, former Laker coach Butch Van Breda Kolff is 
poised to go out with a team that defines Cinderella. 
</P>
<P>
 James Shaffer scored 20 points and led five players in double figures as 
Hofstra (9-20) outlasted Northeastern Illinois (17-11) for an 88-86 
double-overtime victory in the championship game of the East Coast Conference 
tournament Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Breda Kolff has announced his retirement as Hofstra's coach at the end of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The game saw 13 ties and 20 lead changes before Shaffer's go-ahead basket put 
the Flying Dutchmen ahead to stay, 85-83, with 30 seconds to play in the second 
overtime. Ulysses Moran had tied it with a layup 12 seconds earlier.

 Glenn Robinson capped yet another great performance with a driving jumper from 
just inside the foul line with 6.5 seconds left Sunday to give No. 9 Purdue a 
95-94 victory over No. 3 Michigan at Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moved the Boilermakers (25-4, 13-4) into first place in the Big 
Ten. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, a junior forward who leads the nation in scoring, finished with 37 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue trailed, 94-87, with 1:37 to play before going on an 8-0 run that was 
capped by Robinson's big basket. Robinson, who came in averaging 29.4 points 
per game, spun past Jalen Rose to get the shot off. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan (20-6, 12-4) would have clinched a tie for the conference title with 
a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuonzo Martin, who had 21 points for Purdue, made four three-pointers in the 
second half. Purdue made 12 of 25 three-pointers in the game.

the Orangemen to a Big East victory at Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Adrian Autry, who had 21 points, and Moten each made a pair of free throws in

NBA ROUNDUP; BULLS CAUGHT OFF GUARD, LOSE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 The whistle blew, and neither the Cleveland Cavaliers nor the Chicago Bulls 
knew why. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know. I thought maybe it was an inadvertent whistle or something," 
the Bulls' B.J. Armstrong said Sunday after he was called for a critical 
10-second violation in the Cavaliers' 99-95 victory at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers won their 10th in a row, one away from the team record. The 
Bulls have lost five in a row, their longest skid since they dropped six in a 
row in April 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers, leading 94-93, knocked the ball out of bounds with 28 seconds 
left after Chicago's Horace Grant rebounded a Cleveland shot. Armstrong didn't 
realize that five seconds had already ticked off, leaving him just five seconds 
to get the ball past half court. With Mark Price applying modest pressure, 
Armstrong brought the ball upcourt too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland then made its last five points on foul shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody was really aware of the situation," Price said. 
"Apparently they got the rebound, and then there was a scuffle for the ball, so 
some time ran off the shot clock." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Armstrong: "That's the first time it's happened to me in five years in 
this league. It was just a funny situation that happened at the wrong time for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 San Antonio 111, Orlando 103 -- David Robinson won the battle with Shaquille 
O'Neal, especially in the fourth quarter. Robinson had 36 points, 13 rebounds, 
seven assists and six blocked shots as the Spurs rallied late in the game for a 
victory at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson had 12 of his points in the fourth quarter as the Spurs outscored the 
Magic, 37-17, to come back from an 86-74 deficit after three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal finished with 32 points and 11 rebounds, but he scored only three 
points in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 126, Philadelphia 99 -- Derrick Coleman had his second career 
triple-double with 13 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists and the Nets set a 
team record with nine three-pointers at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 13th consecutive loss for the 76ers, their longest streak since the 
1972-73 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 103, Phoenix 92 -- John Stockton had 18 points and 20 assists, many of 
which helped Karl Malone score 30 points, as the Jazz defeated the Suns at 
Phoenix. The Jazz, winning its ninth in a row, ended the Suns' 10-game 
homecourt winning streak. It was Utah's first victory at Phoenix since March 7, 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 102, Sacramento 85 -- Gary Payton scored 24 points and Vincent Askew 
added a career-high 19 as the SuperSonics won at Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 117, Minnesota 97 -- Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf scored 21 points and Dikembe 
Mutombo had nine blocked shots in the Nuggets' victory at Denver. Chris Smith 
scored 25 for the Timberwolves.

MOTOR RACING; IRVAN GETS FAST HELP IN RICHMOND WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Early in the race, Rusty Wallace's crew was getting his Ford out of the pits 
fastest. 
</P>
<P>
 Near day's end, Ernie Irvan's crew got faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Pit stops were the difference Sunday when Irvan outdueled Wallace to win the 
Pontiac Excitement 400 at Richmond, Va., by 1.7 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys did just a tremendous job in the pits," said Irvan, who also drove a 
Ford Thunderbird. "All I hear about is how fast Rusty's crew is in the pits. 
I'll tell you what, I'll lay these guys up against his any day. They showed it 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan won for the first time this season and gave the Robert Yates team its 
second consecutive victory in this race over a three-quarter mile track. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's race was won by Davey Allison, who died in a helicopter crash in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan made it look easy Sunday, leading six times for 189 of the 400 laps -- 
including the final 21 -- in his third short-track victory among 10 wins in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Irvan, who earned $66,175 and averaged 98.334 m.p.h., and Wallace, coming 
off a victory at Rockingham, led from Lap 153 on, and Wallace kept alive his 
streak of finishing no worse than second in nine events on ovals shorter than 
one mile, dating to last season. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Don Prudhomme of Granada Hills, in his final drag racing season, won the top 
fuel title in the Slick 50 Nationals at Baytown, Tex., driving the quarter mile 
in 4.881 seconds at 294.50 n.p.h. to beat Scott Kalitta. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalitta had recorded the quickest time in drag racing history, 4.726 seconds, 
earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudhomme had not won in 27 events, dating back to August 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an emotional win for me," said Prudhomme. "In January, our race shop 
was heavily damaged by the Southern California earthquake and, less than two 
months later, we were able to win. It's one of the best thrills of my 30-year 
racing career." 
</P>
<P>
 He was joined in the winner's circle by Al Hofmann of Umatilla, Fla., in the 
Funny Car division and Warren Johnson of Duluth, Ga., in the Pro Stock class.

PASEANA WINS THE SANTA MARGARITA, HER FIRST VICTORY AS A 7-YEAR-OLD 
</P>

<P>
 Paseana won her first race as a 7-year-old and moved from seventh to fifth 
place on the female money list Sunday with a 2 3/4-length victory in the 
$300,000 Santa Margarita Handicap, a stake that the Argentine-bred mare also 
won in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying 123 pounds, four to nine pounds more than her opponents, Paseana and 
jockey Chris McCarron came from fourth to overtake Stalcreek in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning for the 17th time in 29 starts, the two-time Eclipse Award winner 
earned $180,000, increasing her total to $2.8 million. Dance Smartly, Lady's 
Secret, All Along and Bayakoa, all retired, are ahead of her in purses, with 
Dance Smartly No. 1 at $3.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Ron McAnally said that Paseana will run in the $500,000 Apple Blossom 
Handicap at Oaklawn Park on April 2. She is the only horse to win the Apple 
Blossom twice. BILL CHRISTINE

SANTA ANITA; TABASCO CAT OUTDUELS FLY'N J. BRYAN, WINS THE SAN RAFAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In recent years, horsemen connected with Kentucky Derby winners -- owners Paul 
Mellon, Cal Partee and Frances Genter, and trainers Mack Miller and Charlie 
Whittingham -- have been on the other side of 70, and in 1988 owner Gene Klein 
won his only Derby with Winning Colors two years before he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Wayne Lukas, who scored his only Derby victory with Winning Colors, 
said he thought about this last year after Sea Hero gave Mellon, 85, and 
Miller, 71, their first Derby winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get the feeling that people are winning this race for a special reason," 
Lukas said. "That whoever's in control of these things is taking care of the 
people that deserve it." 
</P>
<P>
 If there's anything to that theory, Tabasco Cat, Lukas' top 3-year-old, might 
wind up in the winner's circle after this year's Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat won by one length over Powis Castle in the $157,200 San Rafael 
Stakes at Santa Anita on Sunday, and not long after the victory, Lukas said: 
"Nothing would make me happier than standing there in the winner's circle with 
this horse on May 7. And there are lots of reasons: Jeff, the owners of this 
horse and the less-than-kind reporting that was done about a certain issue last 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Lukas, the trainer's son and No. 1 assistant, was stomped by a runaway 
Tabasco Cat outside the Lukas barn at Santa Anita on Dec. 15. He suffered 
multiple skull fractures, might lose the vision in one eye and was hospitalized 
for about 10 weeks before being moved to a facility in Pomona for a long 
rehabilitation period. 
</P>
<P>
 The breeders and owners of Tabasco Cat are William T. Young and David P. 
Reynolds, both in their 70s, who flew in from Miami for the San Rafael, but 
missed the stake because they believed it would be the eighth race on the card 
instead of the fourth. Young owned Union City, the colt who broke down in last 
year's Preakness and was destroyed. Several published accounts about the 
incident impugned Wayne Lukas' qualifications as a horseman and his scars 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas said that his son would watch Tabasco Cat's victory on Santa Anita's 
replay show Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody around the barn has brought up what this horse did to Jeff," Lukas 
said. "It was just a case of a frightened horse running off. Because of what 
happened, we're careful now in bathing him and unbridling him. But we don't 
want to put any kind of a yoke around him for the rest of his career." 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas has had at least one horse in the Derby every year since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tabasco Cat has more of an upside than any Derby horse I've had since Winning 
Colors," he said. "I think he's as grooved in as any 3-year-old in the country 
this year. He's won a race in January, he's won a race in March and I like the 
30-day spacing that we've got for the Santa Anita Derby (on April 9)." 
</P>
<P>
 Fly'n J. Bryan, the 7-10 favorite after two victories in two starts, battled 
Tabasco Cat for the lead through the first six furlongs, with Powis Castle 
trailing in the five-horse field. Powis Castle finished 18 lengths ahead of 
Shepherd's Field, who ran third, with Fly'n J. Bryan and Fumo Di Londra at the 
rear. Tabasco Cat paid $5.80, running a mile in 1:36 1/5 over a fast track that 
was damp from overnight rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat, a son of Storm Cat and Barbicue Sauce, has been ridden by Pat Day 
for the last four races, which have included a minor stakes victory at 
Keeneland last year and a third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Santa Anita 
last year, then a victory in the El Camino Real Derby at Bay Meadows. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse has done everything we've asked of him at this point," Day said 
before heading back to Oaklawn Park in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He surprised me when he broke like a shot. He was entertaining that other 
horse, but he relaxed while he was doing it. We're not to the bottom with this 
horse yet. Maybe we can build from here." 
</P>
<P>
 Tabasco Cat gave Lukas his first stakes victory in Southern California since 
October of 1992. Day is scheduled to ride Chimes Band, another of Lukas' Derby 
hopefuls, in the Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn on Saturday.

NORTHRIDGE JUST TICKLED AFTER COMPLETING SWEEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jason Shanahan looks like he just ate a pile of barbecued ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 Loaded with sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 And then forgot to wipe his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a trendy deal that you stick with when you get hot," he said with a 
grin. 
</P>
<P>
 Make that torrid. Shanahan belted two homers Sunday to lead Cal State 
Northridge to a 5-4 nonconference victory over UC Santa Barbara at Caesar 
Uyesaka Stadium, capping a three-game weekend sweep for the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 This stuff of scruff is definitely in vogue. Catcher Josh Smaler started a 
similar beard a week ago and has since hit safely in four consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Sunday's other long-ball hero, right fielder Kevin Howard, also 
was sporting a couple of days' growth. 
</P>
<P>
 But Howard's two-run homer in the eighth was a razor-sharp rip -- and he ought 
to know, since he watched every second of the ball's 400-foot flight over the 
left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "About time," Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard, the clean-up hitter, hadn't homered since Feb. 13. Yet his shot erased 
a 4-3 Santa Barbara margin and gave Northridge the lead for the first time -- 
and for good.  
</P>
<P>
 Right-hander Aaron D'Aoust (3-0) pitched three innings of scoreless relief to 
earn his second victory in a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan single-handedly kept the Matadors (9-9) in the game offensively. When 
Santa Barbara (4-16) jumped to a 1-0 lead in the fourth, he homered in the top 
of the fifth. When the Gauchos took a 3-1 lead in the sixth, he hit a two-run 
homer in the seventh to tie it again. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's exactly what we need out of Shanahan and Howard," Coach Bill Kernen 
said. "It definitely came at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Matadors, who have won five of the past six games, reached the .500 
plateau for the first time since Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara had the potential tying run on second base in both the eighth 
and ninth, but D'Aoust emerged unscathed. He hasn't allowed a run over the past 
11 1/3 innings to reduce his earned-run average to a team-low 1.72. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge (12-2) swept a nonconference softball doubleheader from 
UC Santa Barbara in what was a double shutout. Kathy Blake pitched a 
three-hitter in the 3-0 opener and Amy Windmiller held the host Gauchos to one 
hit in the 10-0 second game. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake (4-1) had one strikeout and one walk. Windmiller (5-1) struck out six 
batters and did not give up a walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Tamara Ivie and Shannon Jones led the Northridge offense which had a combined 
total of 20 hits.

 Cal Lutheran will play Greensboro (N.C.) in a NCAA Division III sectional 
semifinal at the University of St. Thomas (Minn.) on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the No. 1-ranked team in the West Region, Cal Lutheran made a vain bid to 
play host to the four-team sectional at Oxnard High. Its home court does not 
meet Division III specifications for playoff sites.

 The Rebels slipped somewhat after a good season in 1992. Savanna won 10 of its 
final 13 games that year and made a strong run in the postseason. Mitchell 
believes the Rebels will enjoy success again. Savanna, however, will need some 
help -- and luck -- if things are to fall in place this season. "I think 
Brea-Olinda and Valencia are the teams to beat this year," Mitchell said. 
"They're each bringing back some pretty strong people, but we might be able to 
do some things, too, because we will have a pretty good defensive club." 
Delgadillo is one of the defensive leaders. He has an exceptionally strong arm; 
opponents do not test him often. Larsen has a good arm and instincts to match. 
Francis and Vasquez will track down most balls, and Mitchell is expecting a 
major contribution from Nava. On the pitching front, Monzon and Manley are 
being counted on to provide many quality innings. "They have live arms," 
Mitchell said. Now for the bad news: "I'm not sure where our offense will come 
from," Mitchell said. "I'm optimistic because we look good in practice, but we 
don't have a lot of experienced hitters. Scoring runs could be a problems for 
us."

 Traditionally one of the league's stronger teams, the Colonists struggled last 
season and finished last. Anaheim failed to qualify for the postseason after 
making five trips in the previous six seasons. Torres is confident things will 
improve. "We played a lot of the younger kids last season," Torres said. "That 
should be a big help." Chwan is the most talented of Anaheim's 14 returning 
players. A three-year starter, Chawn batted .333 with 21 runs batted in and six 
doubles. Also a defensive standout, Chawn was a second-team all-league 
selection. "He made big improvements from his sophomore year," Torres said. 
"He's very confident out there and he knows his job." Carlos (.324) anchors the 
infield. He has good range and a strong enough arm to make difficult plays. 
Torres expects Moreno to provide the Colonists with several quality innings as 
their No. 1 starter. Moreno, primarily a reliever as a junior, was 2-2 with a 
3.46 earned-run average. Jimenez, Mejia and Navarrette should help make up a 
quality pitching staff. "We'll have to scrap for our runs," Torres said, "but 
we should be strong in terms of defense and pitching."

 Harrison takes over for Jeff Broussely, who led Western for two seasons. But 
Harrison is no stranger to Pioneer baseball: He coached the frosh-soph team 
last season. Harrison is counting on his familiarity with the players to help 
create a smooth transition. "We're going to have a lot of sophomores in key 
spots," he said. "We should be able to surprise some people if they fill in as 
well as I think they can." Montgomery and Isaiah Cadena are the most talented 
of the Pioneers' returners. Montgomery, a member of the varsity for three 
seasons, had a standout season as a junior, batting .400 with 32 runs batted in 
and 24 runs scored. Isaiah Cadena (4-4), who has played his entire career on 
the varsity, is a talented left-hander whom Harrison expects to have a strong 
season. Robinson and Starkey have good speed and should help form a quality 
outfield. Halbert was too much for most batters to handle at the lower levels 
and might earn a starting spot. Frembling was solid behind the plate last 
season.

 Valencia won its second straight league championship. Five Tigers were 
selected first-team all-league and two made the second team. Valencia won a 
wild game in the opening round of the Southern Section Division II playoffs, 
defeating Burbank Burroughs, 13-10. . . . Brea-Olinda was the league's most 
surprising team, finishing second with a roster devoid of varsity experience. 
Senior outfielder Dan Miller was selected the league's MVP after batting .500 
with two home runs and 21 runs batted in. Junior catcher Mike Brambilla tied 
for fifth place in the county in home runs with six. . . . Western improved 
from fifth the previous season. The Pioneers played a wild-card game in the 
Division II playoffs, losing to Sunny Hills, 4-1. Junior left-hander Isaiah 
Cadena pitched one of the county's five no-hitters in a 4-1 league victory over 
Anaheim. Cadena (4-4) allowed only four baserunners. Junior outfielder Matt 
Montgomery was selected first-team all-league. Montgomery batted .400 and 
finished fourth in the county in RBIs with 32. . . . Under first-year Coach 
John Hangartner, Magnolia won five more league games than in the previous 
season. Magnolia remained in contention for a possible playoff berth until it 
lost to Valencia, 7-1, on the season's final day. Junior outfielder Jason 
Dangler was selected first-team all-league after batting .483 in league play. . 
. . Savanna split its final two games to tie Magnolia's league record. . . . 
Anaheim, which started 0-8 in league play, won four of its final seven league 
games.

 Hiskey did an outstanding job leading inexperienced Brea-Olinda to a 
second-place finish in league play last season. He lost his entire varsity 
roster of the previous season to graduation. Before 1993, the Tigers won or 
shared the championship three consecutive seasons. Brea-Olinda, which has eight 
returning starters, is poised to make another run at the league title. "Unlike 
last season, our experience is our biggest asset this year," Hiskey said. 
"We've got to replace some people, but we have young guys who should help." 
Brambilla, a first-team, all-league selection, batted .375 with six home runs 
and 23 runs batted in. Theis and Stoddard are strong defensively, and Hiskey 
believes they will also make big contributions at the plate. "We've got a lot 
of guys who have been through battles before," Hiskey said. "That's a lot more 
than we could say last year."

 Hangartner did a good job in his first season, guiding the Sentinels to a 
fourth-place finish after a season in the cellar. The former standout Sentinel 
shortstop said he expects continued improvement. "We have a lot of talented 
guys, and I am looking forward to a very successful year," Hangartner said. "We 
have a strong pitching staff and a very sound defense. Barring injuries, I feel 
there is no reason we shouldn't take the Orange League title." The Sentinels 
have experienced success. They finished a half game behind league champion 
Brea-Olinda in 1990 and a game behind the Wildcats in '91. A title this season, 
however, is unlikely. Many coaches have picked Brea-Olinda and Valencia to 
battle for the top spot because of their returning talent. If Magnolia is to 
achieve its goal, however, it will need strong, consistent play from Dangler 
and Nester. Dangler, a swift fielder, batted .483 in league play and is a 
two-time all-league selection. Nester (.333) is expected to be the Sentinels' 
top pitcher. Ortiz (.308) is a leader in the infield. Reding could make a major 
impact. He moves with ease from shortstop to second base and he can pitch. 
Several positions, however, are unsettled. Hangartner is considering many 
options at first base and catcher. Jobs also are open on the pitching staff.

MET LIFE MAY BE FINED, ASKED TO REFUND POLICYHOLDERS UP TO $76 MILLION; 
INSURANCE: MULTISTATE PROPOSAL ATTEMPTS TO SETTLE A FIVE-MONTH INVESTIGATION OF 
THE COMPANY'S SALES TACTICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. would be fined $20 million and asked to refund 
policyholders up to $76 million under a multistate proposal to settle an 
investigation of the company's sales practices, Florida Insurance Commissioner 
Tom Gallagher said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Florida investigative report released Sunday said the New York-based insurer 
willfully ignored its agents' widespread use of misleading sales tactics that 
violated many states' laws. The methods included the use of millions of sales 
letters that touted a retirement plan without identifying life insurance as the 
product for sale, Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Met Life spokesman Charles Sahner said the amount of the proposed fine is 
"excessive." 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the priority should be on protecting policyholders, not on punitive 
measures," Sahner said. But he added that Met Life, the nation's second-largest 
insurer, will try to decide in the next few days what course to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 Met Life representatives are scheduled to meet with a group of state insurance 
regulators in Denver today to discuss the proposed fine. Sahner said Saturday 
that the company is considering scrapping the comprehensive settlement 
framework and reverting to state-by-state solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher said Met Life has agreed to offer refunds to as many as 60,000 
policyholders across the country. While Gallagher has estimated the amount of 
refunds to be as high as $76 million, Met Life has estimated the probable 
figure at about $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher said the company also has agreed to set up a new ethics and 
compliance unit consisting of about two dozen employees, to be headed by Vice 
President Donald Stadler. 
</P>
<P>
 A $20-million fine "is a tremendously big number" by insurance regulatory 
standards, Gallagher said. It reflects the states' consensus that Met Life 
committed "totally unacceptable, horrendous acts, which hurt the smallest 
people that could be hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher headed a multistate task force that investigated Met Life's sales 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed fine was agreed to Sunday by 47 states and the District of 
Columbia at a National Assn. of Insurance Commissioners meeting in Denver, he 
said. Pennsylvania, Georgia and Massachusetts were not part of the agreement 
because they have already imposed fines totaling $2 million on Met Life. 
</P>
<P>
 The states agreed that $12.5 million of the fine should be paid in cash to all 
the states based on the number of policyholders affected, Gallagher said. 
Regulators haven't yet agreed on how the remaining $7.5 million would be used, 
he said. Among the options are additional restitution to policyholders, a fund 
to ensure Met Life's compliance with state laws, and a consumer education fund, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida would receive the biggest chunk of the cash fine because it has the 
most affected policyholders, Gallagher said. The state would receive $2.2 
million for these 10,172 customers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's investigative report by Thomas Tew, special counsel to the Florida 
Department of Insurance and the Florida attorney general, faulted the upper 
ranks of Met Life's management. 
</P>
<P>
 Tew's report, which capped a five-month investigation, faulted Met Life's 
management for "tacit approval" of questionable sales tactics and failure to 
act on numerous indications of sales abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The abuses occurred in virtually every area of the country, said the Miami 
attorney's report. 
</P>
<P>
 Tew's findings were immediately disputed by the New York-based insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a series of efforts over a period of time to enforce company policy," 
said Met Life's Sahner. "They weren't as effective as we would have wished." 
</P>
<P>
 Sahner said the number of policyholders affected by the improper tactics "are 
relatively small" in comparison with the 20 million customers who own Met 
Life's life insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tew's report specifically cited Met Life's Executive Vice President Robert 
Crimmins, who heads the company's 13,000-agent sales force, and the legal 
department, which is responsible for reviewing sales materials. These 
executives failed to halt millions of misleading sales letters sent by the 
company's Tampa, Fla., office under the supervision of Daniel (Rick) Urso, the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Met's management style (is) that of ignoring the problem in the hope that it 
will disappear, like an ostrich burying its head in the sand," said the 57-page 
report. "It is difficult to conceive of a scenario whereby the knowledge of the 
Urso activities could have been more widespread than it was at Met."

 MARKING TIME? Former Defense Secretary Les Aspin is about to get one of those 
Washington jobs that has the cachet of big political plum and will allow him to 
fulfill his wish to remain involved in the national security arena. President 
Clinton is preparing to appoint him as head of the President's Foreign 
Intelligence Advisory Board, replacing retired Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., who 
will become the United States' ambassador to Britain. Although the 
once-important panel has become little more than a repository for outer-circle 
politicos -- Clinton's other recent appointments have included Vernon E. Jordan 
Jr., who headed the President's transition but was not given a job in the 
Administration, and Zoe Baird, a onetime nominee for attorney general who ran 
afoul of immigration and tax laws affecting nannies -- it can provide a 
platform for defense buffs such as Aspin who want to make more serious use of 
it. Friends say the 55-year-old Aspin eventually hopes to become the president 
of a major university. For now, however, the appointment will enable him to 
stay in Washington -- and keep abreast of key issues.

 DEEP POCKETS: Ross Perot did it, even Reps. Michael Huffington (R-Santa 
Barbara) and Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) did it -- spent piles of their own 
wealth prospecting for public office two years ago. They were part of an 
unprecedented outburst of personal check-writing by federal candidates, a trend 
that seems to be intensifying in this year's House and Senate campaigns. . . . 
The phenomenon is most evident in California, where six House candidates rank 
among the top 25 nationally in dipping into their own deep pockets. Harman -- 
who personally financed nearly half of her $1.6-million campaign in 1992 -- 
likely will face a Republican moneybags in her bid for reelection. Latest 
records show that Torrance psychiatrist Irwin Savodnik has put up $286,400 of 
his own funds, and former Palos Verdes Estates Councilman Ronald Florance has 
spent $150,650 of his money. Harman, a lawyer and the spouse of an electronics 
magnate, can be expected to match dollar for dollar whichever GOP nominee 
emerges. . . . Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) is also being 
targeted by two well-heeled Republicans: Richard Sybert, a Woodland Hills 
attorney and former top aide to Gov. Pete Wilson who has spent $430,000 of his 
own money, and Newbury Park banking consultant Robert Hammer, who has invested 
$51,900 from his own wallet. Beilenson recently had only $69,000 in his 
campaign war chest.

 JUSTICE MITCHELL? Look for Sen. George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) to be the leading 
candidate for the next Supreme Court vacancy, possibly as early as this spring. 
A former federal judge, Mitchell was at the top of President Clinton's list of 
Supreme Court candidates last spring, along with New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. 
Clinton told aides that he was eager to appoint a prominent political figure to 
the high court, but Mitchell's name was scratched because the White House could 
not afford to lose him as Senate majority leader. Justice Harry A. Blackmun is 
expected to announce his retirement soon.

 L.A. ON THE VOLGA? Some congressional Republicans from other states are 
wearying of the Clinton Administration's frequent requests for aid to 
California. Rep. Sonny Callahan (R-Ala.) quips that some of his colleagues have 
suggested asking Russia's ultranationalist leader Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky to 
drop his demand for the return of Alaska -- "but we might consider giving him 
California." PAUL HOUSTON and ART PINE

KILLERS STAKED OUT SHOP OF THE VICTIM, WITNESSES BELIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The day after a 50-year-old mother of three was slain in a brazen, daylight 
shooting inside her family's music store, witnesses said Sunday they believe 
her killing is linked to two men who seemed to be staking out the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have so far made no arrests in the death of Piedad Preciado, who was 
gunned down in her family's Spanish-language music store near the busy Alpha 
Beta shopping center on South Bristol Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators say two men armed with a handgun walked into the Discoteca 
Guadalajara at about 10 a.m. Saturday, shot Preciado in the head during an 
apparent robbery, then fled. After the shooting, Preciado staggered from the 
store and collapsed in front of Mr. Mel's barbershop next door in full view of 
several witnesses. She was taken to Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach where she 
was pronounced dead, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some witnesses told police that they saw two men running from the store, which 
has been repeatedly hit by crime in recent years, about the time Preciado was 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews Sunday, the same witnesses said they had seen the same two men 
parked outside the music shop the day before the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Barber Mel Scafferty, who was washing a customer's hair when Preciado crumpled 
against his window, said the men appeared to be staking out the businesses in 
the strip mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Scafferty said he grew suspicious when he spotted the two men loitering near a 
trash bin behind his shop Friday morning. He asked his son, Mark, to 
investigate.  
</P>
<P>
 The men eventually left, and Scafferty said he didn't bother to call the 
police because the men weren't doing anything illegal.

<P>
 The next day, Saturday, at about 9:15 a.m. he said he recognized the same car 
-- a cream-colored hatchback, a late 1960s or early 1970s model, parked out 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was such a sweet, strong worker," Mel Scafferty said. "I don't think she 
ever took a day off." 
</P>
<P>
 The Preciados owned a video store in the same strip mall and another music 
store downtown, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the Discoteca Guadalajara that seemed to attract criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "She (Piedad Preciado) was starting to get more and more afraid," said one 
woman who said she had known Preciado for several years. "Nowadays, you never 
know. People will shoot you over $1." 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, according to Scafferty, thieves sawed a hole through the roof 
of the shop and made off with all of the guitars inside. On another occasion, 
burglars blew a hole in the wall and cleaned out the inventory. 
</P>
<P>
 Then once last year, he said, a man robbed one of the clerks at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they have had problems tracing suspects, mainly because the 
physical description of the loiterers varies widely. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout much of the day Sunday, Preciado's husband, Ruben, and their three 
adult children sought spiritual comfort at the Preciado's Catholic church in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Family friends labored somberly at the shop, scrubbing blood-splattered walls 
and countertops with ammonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members could not be reached Sunday at their Santa Ana home.

ANTI-CRIME MEASURES TOP LEGISLATORS' AGENDA; GOVERNMENT: THE TYPICALLY 
CONSERVATIVE BILLS BY O.C. LAWMAKERS ALSO TARGET ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, FAVOR 
BUSINESS, SEEK REGULATORY REFORM.

<P>
 If Orange County's legislators have their way this year, California would 
become a far different place in ways both large and small. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses would reel in hefty tax breaks. The traditional school janitor 
would be a thing of the past. Reform schools would experience a revival. 
Illegal immigrants might want to pack their bags. Organized labor would absorb 
a sizable salary cut for work on public projects. School-aged gangbangers would 
be well-advised to clean up their acts. 
</P>
<P>
 With scores of bills unfurled for the 1994 legislative year, Orange County's 
delegation in the state Capitol has mapped out the sort of conservative agenda 
that has always been its forte. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes the hard part of actually getting the proposals through the 
Democrat-controlled Legislature, a tough task for a delegation dominated by 
Republicans. But many of the county's lawmakers remain optimistic that at least 
a few of their ideas will be embraced -- particularly those dealing with 
law-and-order issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Legislature reflects the mood of the people and the people are fed up 
with crime," said Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove). "All these bills 
affecting crime have a better chance than they had in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to keep young offenders from becoming career criminals, Assemblyman Gil 
Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) is pushing a bill that would revive reform schools. 
Under Ferguson's proposal, youthful criminals, habitual truants and those 
expelled from traditional schools would be sent for a prolonged stay in special 
"military style" schools run by the state Department of Education, where they 
would complete their educations and train for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 With more and more students packing guns on campus, Assemblywoman Doris Allen 
(R-Cypress) wants to improve school safety. She has offered three bills, 
including legislation requiring immediate expulsion of any student found with a 
weapon. Another bill would make areas around schools "gun-free zones." The 
third proposal would toughen the state's trespassing laws for campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside), whose district includes a large swath 
of South Orange County, has proposed several anti-crime bills that could prove 
controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 One would allow school boards to expel students who publicly profess 
membership in a street gang or are caught spreading graffiti on or off campus, 
an idea sure to raise the ire of civil libertarians and constitutional 
scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 Such expulsions "probably won't discourage people from joining a gang," said 
Erwin Chemerinsky, a USC professor of constitutional law. "If this were 
enacted, it would probably be quickly declared unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce court costs, Morrow has legislation that would lower the number of 
jurors in a criminal trial from the current dozen to eight. Instead of 
unanimous decisions, it would allow verdicts when two-thirds of the jury agree. 
</P>
<P>
 But the criminal defense bar is expected to oppose the proposal, arguing that 
such fundamental changes would more frequently yield unjust verdicts. "It might 
make it faster," said Santa Ana attorney William J. Kopeny, "but it wouldn't 
make it better." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) is offering a measure that would 
suspend the driving privileges of graffiti vandals and make their parents 
liable for the damage they cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Bergeson bill would require that child molesters be sentenced to life 
in prison for a first conviction. While the measure could face stiff opposition 
in light of several well-publicized cases involving accused molesters later 
declared innocent, Bergeson remains resolute. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Legislature has a responsibility to protect children from sexual 
predators," she said. "Three chances is far too many. One strike and they 
should be in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange), meanwhile, is sponsoring legislation 
that would require that children of any age who use firearms be tried as 
adults. Another piece of legislation would force police to release the names of 
juvenile offenders age 16 or older; currently, police can make public the 
identities of only those 18 or older. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because tougher sentencing requirements are expected to flood the state's 
prisons with more inmates, state Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) wants to cut 
the cost of prison construction by lowering workers' wages. Hurtt has already 
met with resistance from Democrats opposed to the idea, which is an offshoot of 
wage-cutting efforts that have consistently been rebuffed by organized labor 
through the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson, meanwhile, wants to attack the jail overcrowding issue in Orange 
County. She has authored a bill that would establish a pilot project in Orange 
County to create a detoxification center where drunk drivers would be taken, 
freeing up needed jail space. 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the delegation champion gun owner rights, Umberg is on an 
opposite tack. The delegation's lone Democrat has offered a bill that would 
extend a parent's liability if his or her child is caught with a gun taken from 
home. It also would prohibit anyone under the age of 18 from possessing a rifle 
or shotgun without the supervision of a parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Several lawmakers are also tackling illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy has a bill that would forbid illegal immigrants from attending state 
colleges and universities. Morrow plans to introduce bills that would attempt 
to measure the impact of illegal immigrants on health, welfare, law enforcement 
and colleges, thus giving the state more ammunition in its fight with the 
federal government for reimbursement dollars. Umberg is carrying a bill that 
would allow law enforcement officials to seize any business found guilty of 
hiring illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove) wants to take the "three strikes" 
movement in a different direction, to curb welfare cheats. He has a bill that 
increases penalties for welfare fraud, with persons serving a life sentence for 
a third conviction. Meanwhile, state Sen. John R. Lewis (R-Orange) has a 
measure that would prohibit welfare recipients from collecting worker's 
compensation if they are injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis also has a bill that would encourage adoptions by offering prospective 
parents a tax credit for the costly process. 
</P>
<P>
 On the home front, several lawmakers plan to introduce legislation to directly 
benefit voters in Orange County. Pringle has a bill to contract out more county 
government jobs, an idea long sought by Orange County officials eager to save 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson is sponsoring a measure that would give Orange County and other 
Southland areas ravaged by the fall firestorms bailout tax relief from the 
state. Ferguson is carrying a similar bill. Assemblyman Ross Johnson 
(R-Fullerton) has proposed tough new penalties for arsonists, an idea that has 
been embraced by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy, meanwhile, has a post-earthquake bill that would require that Caltrans 
not spend any more money on highway landscaping and beautification projects 
until retrofit and repair work is completed on bridges and overpasses. Hurtt 
has a measure that would cut wages for work on freeways and other public 
projects damaged in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Several lawmakers are sponsoring political reforms. Johnson has legislation 
that would prohibit state employees from lobbying for one year after they leave 
their jobs. A Pringle bill would ban state employees from politicking while on 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, regulatory reform is a hot topic. Lewis, Johnson, Hurtt and Pringle 
are pressing ahead with their efforts to strip power from the South Coast Air 
Quality Management District, the tough regional agency they contend is hurting 
business with its strict anti-smog regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to wield a meat cleaver on bureaucratic fat, Pringle wants to abolish 
the state Commission on Economic Development. Conroy, meanwhile, has a bill 
proposing abolishment of the California Energy Commission. Hurtt, owner of a 
Garden Grove manufacturing plant, wants to help free enterprise by easing 
business taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 On the education front, Lewis has two bills planned. One would allow schools 
to save money by contracting out janitorial services, cafeteria work and other 
non-instructional jobs, thus freeing up more money for the classroom. The 
second bill would make it easier for districts to create "charter schools," 
thus freeing them of many state educational requirements and allowing educators 
to design curriculum better suited to local needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson also wants to help charter schools. Suggesting that some school 
districts have jealously hoarded money intended for charter schools under their 
auspices, Ferguson wants to require they get funded directly from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson is also weighing in on the battle over health care reform. His 
measure would establish a savings account for employees to use for medical 
insurance costs and give them a 100% tax credit. State Legislation From O.C.

WHERE SWALLOWS RETURN; THEY, OTHER BIRDS CAN BE FOUND AT SAN JUAN CREEK, NOT 
MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When crowds gather in front of Mission San Juan Capistrano every March 19, 
vainly searching for the mythical swarm of swallows coming home, Monique Rea 
chuckles to herself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The South Coast Audubon Society member knows where the swallows can be found, 
and it's not on a busy downtown street corner like the one where the mission 
sits. 
</P>
<P>
 Serving as a wilderness hotel for migratory birds, a lush, four-acre area 
along San Juan Creek is where the swallows really return, and since last year 
the local Audubon chapter has been its caretaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you really want to see swallows, come to the creek," Rea said, pointing to 
one of the first swallows of spring, perched on a budding willow tree branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of bird species live year-round in this small avian oasis, tucked 
between a residential community and two schools in east San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 To preserve the natural bird habitat, Audubon volunteers toil throughout the 
year on the city-owned land, tearing out 12-foot-high reeds that choke out 
native creek-side vegetation, pulling man-made rubbish from the creek and 
planting new trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you appreciate nature, you don't want to see it deteriorate," said Ken 
Fortune, a South Coast Audubon board member. "There's a very special 
satisfaction to seeing this creek improve before our eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 San Juan Creek is one of two major waterways in South County. It is fed by the 
rugged hills of Cleveland National Forest and flows for about 20 miles past 
large stretches of grassland before emptying into the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Greedy for water in Southern California's semiarid climate, vegetation grows 
thickly along the creek. Live oak, willow and sycamore trees attract a rich, 
diverse array of wildlife, from raccoons to scrub jays, hawks, grosbeaks and at 
least two varieties of swallow. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent years, all wild things living along the creek have been 
threatened by arundo donax, a non-native reed with explosive growth 
characteristics that dominates most other forms of vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It absolutely engulfs an area," said Orange County Regional Parks Director 
Tim Miller. "It crowds out all the other, native plants, and what happens is 
that the food sources for birds and other animals vanish. This stuff is so 
invasive, it's like a true weed." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the reed eradication will be done by a developer in exchange for the 
city's recent approval of a 400-unit housing project. In partnership with the 
city, the Audubon Society clears off the rest and oversees the overall 
rehabilitation of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the type of public/private partnership we love to accommodate in San 
Juan," said Ron Sievers, city director of public lands. "It's not just people 
putting trees in holes. Projects like this put stewardship of the land in the 
hands of people. We appreciate the Audubon's work tremendously." 
</P>
<P>
 The work is worth the effort because the wilderness area is accessible to 
people, particularly the two neighboring schools, Rae said. 
</P>
<P>
 A clear, sunny day recently brought Bill Vanlear, a teacher at St. Margaret's 
Episcopal School, and his geometry class to the creek banks, drawing pads in 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to learn about shapes," he said, turning to a student, who added, 
"and nature is a good place to learn geometry." 
</P>
<P>
 Many nearby residents walk through the area on a bike path that follows the 
creek down to the beach. Several residents and an occasional school class come 
by regularly and help Audubon members with their creek rehabilitation projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Bikers passing by will stop and lend a hand. A local nursery specializing in 
native plants sells to South Coast Audubon at a discount. When a recent 
planting was done, elementary school students drew colorful signs to mark the 
area, with slogans such as, "If you tread, I'm dead." 
</P>
<P>
 "Improving an urban habitat like this one is a tremendous benefit to 
everyone," Audubon's Fortune said. "We want to share our joy of nature with the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The project is an offshoot of the Audubon Society's Birds in the Balance 
program, a national effort to re-establish bird habitat by cleaning up the 
country's streams and rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will take a lot of vision and effort," Fortune said. "We're starting right 
here."

3 PROFESSORS DISCUSS MIDEAST PEACE CHALLENGES; ACADEMIA: 'IT'S LIKE THE WILD 
WEST THERE,' ONE OF THE HEBREW UNIVERSITY EDUCATORS TELLS A CROWD OF 150. 
COMPETITION FOR WATER AND POWER SHARING ARE AMONG THE ISSUES ADDRESSED.

 A prominent Israeli professor said Sunday that the massacre of nearly 50 
Muslims by a Jewish settler in a Hebron mosque underscores the need to disarm 
some Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip for 
peace in the region to have a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the Wild West there. The Israeli Army has given arms to the 
settlers and also given them free reign," said Avraham Sela, a visiting 
professor teaching Middle East history at San Diego State University. 
</P>
<P>
 Sela said the "irreversible peace process has begun" and Israel must control 
the violence within its own borders, just as it demands the same from other 
nations such as Jordan, Lebanon and Syria. He said the army should ensure order 
after some settlements are disarmed.  
</P>
<P>
 Speaking to 150 people gathered at a movie theater in Newport Beach, Sela was 
one of three Israeli professors from the Hebrew University in Jerusalem who 
discussed some of the obstacles and offered some solutions to achieve peace in 
the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 The academic conference, titled "The Challenges of Peace," was sponsored by 
the American Friends of the Hebrew University, Pacific Southwest Region. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillel Shuval, a professor of environmental engineering who is a visiting 
professor at Harvard University, told the audience during the two-hour 
conference about an emerging conflict over water in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Israeli farmers have used water from mountain ranges in the West 
Bank that now belong to the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who has rights to the water now? How can an agreement between the two be 
worked out?" Shuval asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Using dams and building waterways, Arabs and Jews together can increase the 
water supply in the region and create a "win-win" situation for both sides to 
avoid further tensions, Shuval said.  
</P>
<P>
 But money for water projects and a willingness to sit down face-to-face are 
required for any progress, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuval said that accommodations must be made for peace to work. "Israel must 
recognize the needs of the Palestinians. And one thing they need is more 
water," Shuval said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shlomo Hasson, a professor of social geography, said the future of peace in 
Israel's capital city, Jerusalem, depends on sharing power among the diverse 
ethnic and religious communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Even within Jerusalem's Jewish population, Hasson said there are vast 
differences among secular, ultra-orthodox and Sephardic Jews who live in 
separate parts of the city and maintain vastly different lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasson said Jerusalem must eventually incorporate all Arabs and Jews into 
government, offering leadership positions within the local power structure. He 
said the steady increase of ultra-orthodox Jews in Jerusalem poses a threat to 
peace because they believe Jewish law must be incorporated into the city's 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during the conference, the audience broke into applause when 
Shuval said Israel desperately needs a bill of rights to protect the freedom of 
religion in Israel similar to the U.S. Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have a bill of rights as protection for everyone," Shuval said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's conference, which included charts and diagrams projected onto the 
large movie screen, was a valuable educational experience for Newport Beach 
resident Kivie Moldave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought today was good because they recognized the needs and aspirations of 
Palestinians in Israel. With innovation and hard work, the differences can be 
resolved as long as both sides are reasonable. It can be done," Moldave said.

STREET SMART: WHEN NEXT HE EXITS FREEWAY, HE'D RATHER SEE A 'THIS EXIT' SIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROLINE LEMKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I have a problem figuring out a particular sign located at least 100 feet 
before reaching an off-ramp from our California freeways, especially the San 
Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, going north on the San Diego Freeway prior to reaching the 
Bristol Street exit, there is a posted sign that reads, "South Coast Plaza/Art 
Center, Next Exit." What does "Next Exit" mean? "This" exit or the "next" one? 
</P>
<P>
 Even though we know from experience that the next exit refers to Bristol, my 
mind interprets "Next Exit" as Fairview Street. Let's face it: A driver going 
60 m.p.h. needs more warning time than merely 100 feet to exit, especially on 
Bristol, where two more lanes merge onto the San Diego Freeway from the Costa 
Mesa Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 I was very satisfied when vacationing in Kentucky for the holidays I noticed a 
sign on the freeway reading, "XXX Restaurant. This Exit." 
</P>
<P>
 Can you please find a satisfactory explanation from Caltrans for using the 
word next instead of this ? I am afraid that one of these days my mind will 
take me to the "next" exit that reads Fairview Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Crivello 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokeswoman Rose Orem said: "If we were to specify 'this ramp,' it 
might confuse the motorists to look for a ramp in the immediate area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could be misleading, as the sign 'South Coast Plaza/Art Center' is 
placed at least 400 feet before the ramp."  
</P>
<P>
 The short stretch between the Costa Mesa/San Diego freeway interchange and the 
Bristol Street off-ramp provides limited space for necessary warning and guide 
signs, Orem said. The Caltrans traffic manual says that sign cluttering may 
lead to motorist confusion, she said.

WOMAN FOUND DEAD IN FIRE AT FORTIFIED HOUSE; FATALITY: VICTIM APPARENTLY SET 
BLAZE, OFFICIALS SAY. NEIGHBORS HAD OBJECTED TO THE EXTREME SECURITY MEASURES 
SHE HAD TAKEN WITH HER HUSBAND, WHO DIED THE DAY BEFORE THE FIRE.

 Taking a stand against what they saw as a violent world, Billy and Fyrn Davis 
turned their two-story stucco house into a veritable fortress bristling with 
video monitors and infrared alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 They installed barred windows and erected a spiked fence laced with razor 
wire. More than two dozen 500-watt spotlights illuminated the property at 
night, set off by hair-trigger sensors. For a while -- until authorities 
ordered them removed -- lasers encircled the grounds to trip up the intruders 
the couple envisioned in the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors saw them as unnerving eccentrics and complained that the 
over-the-top security measures gave their area a bad name. But the home drew 
widespread attention from the media, which portrayed this Pico Rivera area 
couple as symbolic of the modern-day fear of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the fortress could not save Billy and Fyrn Davis from the ravages 
of illness and, apparently, despair. In fact, neighbors said, all the locks and 
barricades delayed firefighters for half an hour when they responded to a 
report of a fire at the home during the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 After they finally pried through a security gate and two heavily locked doors 
early Saturday morning, firefighters found the badly burned body of a woman in 
the living room. Although her name had not been officially released as of 
Sunday evening, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department detective said 
investigators believe the victim was 68-year-old Fyrn Davis -- and that she 
apparently set the fire by lighting newspapers covered with motor oil. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The day before, her 31-year-old husband died at Presbyterian Intercommunity 
Hospital in Whittier, where he was admitted Feb. 5, a hospital official said. 
The hospital would not release the cause of death, but a family acquaintance 
said Billy Davis suffered from a pancreatic disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an investigation into the fire victim's death is continuing, a 
preliminary inquiry has not turned up any evidence of foul play, according to 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Detective Frank Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the two deaths stunned neighbors in the unincorporated area alongside 
the 605 Freeway, where the Davises moved about five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feared for them before because I wondered, what if a fire came?" said 
Esther Fernandez, standing within a stone's throw of the bars and locks 
surrounding the Davis home. "Them caged like that -- how could they get out?" 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, firefighters responding to a call at 3:56 a.m. Saturday had to break 
through eight deadbolt locks on three doors to get inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The Davises' preoccupation with security had earned them notoriety, first in 
their neighborhood and then beyond. Their home was mentioned in local media 
reports and in an August, 1993, Time magazine article titled "Danger in the 
Safety Zone: As violence spreads into small towns, many Americans barricade 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Some neighbors complained that the bizarre yard damaged property values of 
surrounding homes. And the home generated more controversy when authorities 
declared some of the precautions illegal: The spiked fence extended onto county 
property, the hardware for the laser beams protruded above height limits and 
the spotlights were erected without a permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with zoning restrictions, the Davises removed some of the security 
devices last year, dismantling some poles and the expensive laser alarm system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was still a fortress, but it didn't have the bells going off, and the 
lights," said Billy Davis' former attorney, Neil J. Falley. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his former clients, he said: "I just think they were different people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Davises came to Los Angeles County from Corning, Calif., a tiny town of 
6,000 where Fyrn Davis was well-known. She and her first husband built up a 
major truck stop, gas station and restaurant near Interstate 5. She left her 
second husband, a prosperous rancher, for Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said the Davises were almost hermit-like, though Billy Davis 
sometimes patrolled streets in his car, with only its parking lights on, at 2 
or 3 in the morning. The concern over security bewildered neighbors, who called 
the area relatively safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that something happened to them in the past, and they got fearful," 
said Fernandez, who lives next door to the Davis house. Maybe something ugly 
happened to them." 
</P>
<P>

TOWER OF POWER; ENERGY PLANT'S FORM WINS AWARD, BUT SOME CALL IT UGLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Power plants, to put it kindly, are not usually on the must-see list of 
architectural mavens scanning Southern California for the latest in design. 
</P>
<P>
 New concert halls, libraries, museums, parks, office towers, hillside and 
beachfront homes usually attract in-town visitors and international attention. 
Something named the Central Chiller-Cogeneration Plant With Facilities 
Management Replacement Space would seem destined for obscurity, not 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 But, surprise, surprise. That enormous new energy facility at UCLA's Westwood 
campus has broken stereotypes of industrial buildings as dull-but-necessary or 
monstrous-yet-concealable. To the shock of some neighbors who consider it an 
ugly behemoth, the $188-million project has won a coveted architecture award 
and is expected soon to receive splashy treatment in design publications. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the still-incomplete plant proved its functional worth during the 
Northridge earthquake in January, UCLA officials boast. As surrounding 
neighborhoods remained blacked out, the plant's turbines and coolers provided 
electrical power, steam and chilled water to the sprawling campus and exported 
megawatts to help the beleaguered region. It was as if an unfinished race car 
prematurely entered the Indianapolis 500 and zoomed very fast indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is genuinely a building of the '90s," said John C. Krogstad, a senior 
project manager for UCLA's building programs. "This is a glowing spot in our 
cityscape that says, 'Hey, high-tech is here to stay.' " 
</P>
<P>
 What is most unusual, experts say, is that the project does not conceal its 
true nature even though it is in the midst of a university, just across 
Westwood Plaza Drive from the UCLA Medical Center. Utility stations in Los 
Angeles sometimes were built to resemble Art Deco post offices and most often 
were located in outlying areas because of noise and pollution. Understandably, 
power plants face strong "not-in-my-back-yard" reactions, especially those with 
high smokestacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our attitude was that this stuff wasn't necessarily something to be ashamed 
of. The cliche we used was that you can't hide an elephant under the rug 
anyway," said Wes Jones, the plant's lead architect. "So admit you have an 
elephant there, but make it an attractive elephant," added Jones, who began the 
project for the Holt Hinshaw Pfau and Jones firm in San Francisco and now has 
his own firm there. 
</P>
<P>
 The elephant metaphor actually is too small. A futuristic battleship is more 
apt. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to be finished in a few weeks, the rectangular plant contains 200,000 
square feet of industrial and attached office space on an eight-acre site. From 
the ground, its brown, tan and black brick panel walls are 40 feet high, and 
rooftop equipment and smokestacks rise as much as another 80 feet up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and his colleague Scott Laidlaw are advocates of what they call "boss" 
architecture: "Boss" as in "Hey dude, that's a boss car," meaning a muscular, 
fast but not pretty look. 
</P>
<P>
 In that style, a building's exterior is supposed to reflect what is going on 
inside. In truth, such attempts are not new. The Streamline architects of the 
1930s celebrated motion, speed and machines. In contrast, Jones attempts no 
symmetry or soothing touches. 
</P>
<P>
 At three points along the south wall, brick triangles lean out like wings or 
upside-down car fins to give the impression that the building itself could move 
mechanically, Jones said. On the roof, giant louvered screens -- like Venetian 
blinds in odd, sculptural trapezoid forms -- partially cover some equipment, 
but the big smokestacks are unshielded. On the north facade, similar louvered 
screens partly cover balconies on an attached wing of offices and shops for 
UCLA's facilities management department. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Laidlaw call this partial concealment a hide-and-seek game. "It's 
like the feeling that a little bit of clothing is sexier than pure nudity," 
Jones said. "We thought a little bit of screening would help to make the 
machinery more acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Enough remains visible to make passersby consider the gigantic amounts of 
electricity and water needed to operate an urban university in a desert 
climate, he added. And the glow of the roof machinery at night could evoke 
wonder from passersby or possibly anger from neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 A visit inside the south wing leaves no doubt that the technological efforts 
are immense -- all run from computerized control rooms that resemble sets from 
"Dr. Strangelove." Two natural gas turbines, and a generator that runs on their 
exhaust steam, produce 39 megawatts of electricity to meet nearly all of UCLA's 
needs, said Doug Hisey, a plant manger. In what is called cogeneration, other 
steam-driven machinery creates and sends steam and chilled water in pipelines 
throughout the campus for the heating, cooling, sterilization and 
humidification that are important for the hospital and research laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 Under plans by the lead contractor, Parsons Main Inc. of Pasadena, energy 
efficiencies are expected to be large enough for UCLA to pay off the privately 
issued bonds that financed the plant within 25 years. The construction contains 
the noise inside the building while the steam smoke has so far provoked no 
complaints from Westwood residents or shops, said Thomas H. Carroll, executive 
director of the Westwood Village Management Corp., a merchants group. UCLA's 
older, much smaller and less-efficient energy plant nearby will be demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even before it was built, the new UCLA facility won a citation from 
Progressive Architecture magazine, a design touchstone that praised it as a 
"rapprochement between the campus and the machine." Mark Alden Branch, a senior 
editor of the Connecticut-based journal, said only about a dozen buildings out 
of 700 or so submitted each year have won and that the odds are "quite rare" 
for an industrial structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The location on campus could serve as a model, Branch said. "I think it's 
important for getting infrastructure things built. There's such a NIMBY problem 
out there. Our perception is that architecture and design can help make these 
things more palatable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, no one on the Progressive Architecture jury called it pretty. In 
his judging comments, architect Helmut Jahn said: "That's what I like -- it 
isn't trying to be nice. It is rough, and it's a little ugly, and it has edges. 
It is not a building you ought to like, and need not like." 
</P>
<P>
 That the plant's design is being honored shocks Alvin Milder, chairman of UCLA 
Watch, a coalition of homeowner groups in the Westwood area. "It has met the 
expectation of being an ugly monstrosity in the middle of campus," he said. "It 
may be architecturally better than most energy plants, but certainly in the 
middle of campus, in the middle of Westwood, it just doesn't work from an 
aesthetic point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet more acclaim is on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Architectural Record magazine, whose international coverage is jealously 
sought by architects as a sign of prestige, is to devote at least six pages in 
the June issue to the UCLA facility. "It's really a very big honor," said 
Managing Editor Carolyn De Witt from her New York office. 
</P>
<P>
 In a less formal way, the facility is observed daily by people such as Jarrod 
Williamson, a UCLA chemical engineering graduate student. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students have complained about the facility's look, but they calm down if 
they learn how energy systems save money and cut down on emissions, he said. 
"It's hard to have it both ways. You want a university campus to be the most 
pretty place in the city," Williamson said. "But you sometimes can't make a 
processing plant look like the Taj Mahal."

STREET SMART / NORA ZAMICHOW: CAR-POOL SCOFFLAWS GET SOME COMPANY: A CHP 
OFFICER 
</P>

<P>
 Car-poolers on the Santa Monica Freeway cheer when they see California Highway 
Patrol Officer Michelle Reddick writing a ticket for a solo motorist caught 
zipping along in one of the freeway's new diamond lanes.  
</P>
<P>
 They honk, whoop, and shout -- "Yeah, go get 'em, tiger!" -- at the sight of 
the 5-foot-1 Reddick vigorously waving over a perpetrator. They know from the 
posted signs that any motorist caught illegally slipping into their ranks pays 
a steep price: $271. 
</P>
<P>
 This righteous freeway indignation is found only on the Santa Monica, where 
authorities introduced diamond lanes after the Northridge earthquake, allowing 
car-poolers to easily bypass quake-damaged stretches. Other than a brief failed 
experiment two decades ago, it is the first use of diamond lanes in the 
freeway's history. 
</P>
<P>
 For Reddick, the congratulatory hoopla is embarrassing. She tries not to 
smile; she doesn't want an irate scofflaw to think she is enjoying herself at 
his or her expense. After all, this is not a tough ticket. Snaring 
car-pool-lane violators is like shooting fish in a barrel.  
</P>
<P>
 "With speeding, it's your word against theirs," the 25-year-old officer says. 
"Car-pool-lane violations are written in black and white. You either have 
people in your car or you don't,"  
</P>
<P>
 About 6% of the drivers using the Santa Monica car-pool lanes are scofflaws -- 
about average for freeway car-pool lanes, Caltrans estimates. Despite the hefty 
fine, imposed about 35 times a day, the chance to save as much as 20 minutes 
otherwise lost to a surface street detour is too good to miss for some. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vehicles in car-pool lanes are required by law to carry at least two living 
people. (An officer once gave a ticket to a mortician who counted the corpse in 
his hearse as a passenger.) But motorists determined to flout the law have been 
known to place a mannequin in the passenger seat. Or they would tie a hat on 
their dog, or on a helium balloon.  
</P>
<P>
 No longer. "We're wise to that stuff," Reddick sighs. 
</P>
<P>
 So on the post-earthquake Santa Monica, the diamond lane excuses have reached 
a new plateau of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
 One solo motorist explained that he had to go to the bathroom. Another said he 
was late for work. Another said her kids were sick and waiting to be picked up. 
One woman said she had just gotten her driver's license last week.  
</P>
<P>
 Still another innocently said: "But officer, I'm a resident ." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Fercano, 19, was driving in a blue convertible, her long black hair 
streaming in the wind, when Reddick recently pulled her over. 
</P>
<P>
 Fercano, a nurse, explained to a reporter that she was sick and had left work 
early to go home.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think they should ask you why you are driving on the car-pool lane," she 
said. "I have terrible allergies." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Poise, 25, said he had just returned from Hawaii (well, actually two 
months ago).  
</P>
<P>
 "There are no freeways there so I kind of forgot about stuff like this," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing that this line of reasoning packed no punch, Poise, who installs fire 
protection systems, offered another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took the car-pool lane today because I saw a lot of people by themselves, 
so I figured I could go by myself too," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he tried this: "I work hard all day. I don't make that much. I'll 
lose the money I make in one week in three seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 Unmoved, Reddick handed Poise his ticket. He angrily crumpled it up and tossed 
it on the floor of his car. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Peterson, 22, tried a different tack. He said he was late to see his 
estranged alcoholic father, whom he had not visited for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the only time I'll be able to talk to my father," said Peterson, a 
file clerk. "My father gave me directions. He told me to stay on the Santa 
Monica. I couldn't read the signs. I didn't know the detour meant everybody. " 
</P>
<P>
 "That's his personal life," said Reddick as she cited Peterson not only for 
improperly using the car-pool lane but for a bevy of minor violations, such as 
having illegal window tints and no side-view mirror.  
</P>
<P>
 Only once during that rush hour did a driver apologize for making an error.  
</P>
<P>
 Amanullah Aban, a bewildered 48-year-old businessman, explained to Reddick in 
broken English that he was trying to reach Los Angeles International Airport so 
he could catch his flight home to Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here's what you've gotta do," Reddick told the him: "Take a right on Fairfax, 
a left on Venice, a right on Cadillac, and then a left." 
</P>
<P>
 Aban looked at her blankly. She waved him on without issuing a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not heartless," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Caltrans opened the diamond lanes on the Santa Monica, motorists 
initially were slow to use them. But gradually the lane is gaining popularity: 
More than 1,300 took them during one recent peak morning hour, and about 1,100 
used them during one evening rush hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The lane is a subculture in which car-poolers and lane violators eye each 
other with Hatfield and McCoy disdain. If you shamelessly enter the car-pool 
lane, expect the wrath of the scores of people who weave elaborate plans to 
pick one another up and save precious minutes by commuting in the car-pool 
lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some people who think the law is not written for them," said 
car-pooler Sue Himmelrich. "There are always people who think their agenda is 
more important than everybody else's. Or people who believe order doesn't apply 
to them; these are the people who cut supermarket lines or use the 'Only 10 
Items' line with 20 things. You get some satisfaction when they get nailed." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Joe Lee said: "We are going out of our way to play by the rules and 
we derive a secret, if not sadistic, delight in seeing these violators pulled 
over.  
</P>
<P>
 "A car-pool lane is society's way of encouraging constructive behavior. If you 
want to take the shortcut, you must make the sacrifice. This is a special 
benefit created for those who go through the extra effort. Others who cheat are 
taking it away from us; it's a form of theft of a social benefit."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY COUNCIL RACES RELATIVELY TAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Campaign placards are beginning to sprout up on lawns across the city -- an 
indicator that Election Day is just weeks away. On March 29, residents in three 
of the city's five council districts will go to the polls to select 
representatives. Incumbents are seeking reelection in all three races. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city known for its heated politics, this year's races have so far been 
relatively low key. Unlike the election four years ago, when candidates clashed 
over the proposed Hellman Ranch housing development, this month's vote lacks a 
dominant issue that divides candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 All eight candidates are expected to attend a community forum at 7 p.m. 
Tuesday at City Hall. The forum, sponsored by the League of Women Voters, will 
give residents a chance to pose questions to the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 A likely top issue at the forum is crime. The city saw an increase in the 
number of armed robberies last summer, prompting some residents to call for 
construction of a police substation at Seal Beach Pier. Other residents want 
the city to increase the number of police patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 Several proposed developments in and around the city are also likely to be 
discussed at the forum. Some residents fear that traffic will increase if a 
plan is approved to build more than 1,000 homes near the Bolsa Chica wetlands 
just south of the city. A second large housing and golf course development is 
planned for some land at Lampson Avenue and Seal Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Fund raising by the eight candidates has varied widely. 
</P>
<P>
 In District 1, which covers the Old Town area, Councilwoman Marilyn Bruce 
Hastings has raised $5,130 as of the last contribution filing period, which 
ended Feb. 12. Businessman James J. Klisanin raised $2,791.75 during the same 
period. Charles Antos, a county planner and community activist, reported no 
fund raising as of Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 In District 3, which covers the Marina Hill area, Mayor Gwen Forsythe has 
raised $2,384. Main Street merchant John Baker raised $1,173. Resident Kathleen 
Parker reported no contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither candidate in the District 5 race reported any contributions in their 
February statements. In the race to represent Leisure World residents, 
Councilman William J. Doane is being challenged by engineering manager Richard 
E. Davies.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOARA SENIOR WINS ESSAY CONTEST, $1,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michelle Lynn Kessler of Loara High School in Anaheim has won an essay contest 
and with it a $1,000 scholarship from the American Institute of Aeronautics and 
Astronautics Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old senior wrote the best essay from among 19 applicants.All 
competed by writing about "a day in the life of a Mars explorer." 
</P>
<P>
 She wrote of how she and four other astronauts spent three months on Mars, 
trying to discover if the planet is habitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Mars "is the closest planet to earth," Kessler said. "If anything ever 
happened to Earth, going to Mars would be our only alternative, really, but 
because of its incredibly thin atmosphere and lack of water, it needs to be 
explored." 
</P>
<P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; COACH 'BRIQ' IS A ROCK TO HER TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 La Habra High School girls softball coach Sue Briquelet gets her team ready to 
play ball by working on their their batting, running and fielding techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes her different from other coaches who do the same thing, however, is 
that Briquelet spends countless hours coaching her 13 team members off the 
softball field as well, building self-confidence, camaraderie and trust. 
</P>
<P>
 When the girls need help with homework or advice about boys, peer pressure or 
family problems, they go to Briquelet, whom they affectionately call "Briq." 
</P>
<P>
 Briquelet's style captured the attention of the California Coaches Assn., 
which has named her Softball Coach of the Year for 1994. Being the recipient of 
the award means "you are the best," said John Williams, CCA president. 
</P>
<P>
 Briquelet said she is honored to win the title but that she received the 
recognition only because her team has been successful. Since Briquelet became 
the school's varsity softball coach three years ago, the team has reached 
semi-finals competition in California Interscholastic Federation playoffs and 
has a 48-8 record for the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really humbled by this award," the 32-year-old coach said. "It blows me 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Players say that Briquelet, who also teaches math, is too modest and deserves 
the accolade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always make it to CIF because of Briq," said Aimee Weathers, 16. "She 
knows what it takes to get us there, but she's not just a good coach, she's 
also like a second mom to us. She always goes out of her way for anyone on the 
team and makes each one of us feel special." 
</P>
<P>
 The secret to the team's success, Briquelet said, is that "the kids just 
click, and they do what it takes to be better than the rest. . . . They know 
they are doing their very best." 
</P>
<P>
 Briquelet said that as a high school and college softball player, "I never 
really reached my peak. . . . I'm a frustrated athlete, and so I pour my life 
into this team." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, the coach and her team sat under a tree next to the 
softball field, sharing personal concerns and talking about how to make "good 
life choices." Such "team talks" last about an hour or so, once or twice a 
season, and players walk away feeling they've been heard and with a sense of 
belonging, Briquelet said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pep talks are OK," she said, but becoming a winner means more than just 
scoring a run, according to Briquelet. "It means you always try your best in 
everything you do." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Principal Terry Kent said Briquelet is an "enthusiastic and caring 
person who places a high priority on the students and their individual success, 
not only in sports but in their own lives." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Briquelet's greatest admirers is her assistant coach and father, Mick 
Constuble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I coached Sue from when she was in fourth grade through high school, and 
she's a better coach than I was," he said. "I marvel at her skill in both 
teaching and coaching, and her athletes absolutely love her and hate to 
disappoint her." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Briquelet, three other coaches from Orange County have been named 
coaches of the year by the CCA. They are John Azevedo of Calvary Church High 
School in Anaheim; wrestling; Lance Stewart of Corona del Mar High School, 
girls volleyball, and Sherri Ross of El Toro High School, girls swimming. MIMI

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; SENIOR VOLUNTEERS SET TO GO ON PATROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They take fingerprints, write parking tickets, direct traffic, and they could 
be your grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 And tonight, a group of 10 senior citizens will receive police volunteer 
badges as they graduate from a new training program to expand police service 
and save money. And later this week, members of the unarmed volunteer group, 
known as the Retired Senior Volunteer Patrol, or RSVP, will each begin 
performing a variety of routine police duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's to free up the officers to concentrate on more serious types of 
patrolling," said program coordinator Officer Maureen Flynn. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton RSVP program is tailored after similar efforts in at least 10 
other Orange County cities and reflects an increasing reliance by officials on 
the enthusiasm and energy of volunteers to maintain police service in the face 
of budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Derfler, 62, a retired medical assistant and 30-year Fullerton resident, 
is one of the volunteers. She calls her community relatively safe and said she 
joined RSVP because she wants to help keep it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we have time to give while we're not raising families and (don't) have 
full-time jobs . . . and it's given me kind of a direction to go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will pair up and cruise the streets in a white patrol car equipped 
with a radio and sporting a "Retired Senior Volunteer" logo on the door. The 
Fullerton Neighborhood Watch salvaged the car from a junk yard, fitted it with 
a new engine and donated it to the Police Department, Flynn said. Derfler said 
she is also "looking forward to driving around" in the reconditioned patrol 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer Fern Kruse turns 69 this week and plans to be putting in more than 
the minimum four hours per week for senior volunteers. "They only require 16 
hours a month, and I can do that standing on my head," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The energetic Anaheim grandmother is the only volunteer from outside the city 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The six men and four women who graduate today will wear the typical uniform of 
a police volunteer -- navy blue pants, light blue shirt and a badge that says 
"Volunteer." To qualify for the program, senior volunteers must be at least 60 
years old and retired, Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers do not have the power to make arrests and will concentrate instead 
on routine duties, including checking houses where residents are on vacation, 
placing flares and traffic cones on the highway, entering data in computers, 
developing crime film and preparing the firing range in the basement of police 
headquarters for practice, Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The "baby" of the group, 60-year-old Otto Krebs, said he was particularly 
impressed with the 12 hours of fingerprinting training the group received. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a very intricate and complicated thing," he said. All kinds of 
jobs require fingerprints as part of the application process, from teachers to 
day care workers and real estate agents, he said, and most of it is done by the 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 While Krebs is fascinated with fingerprints, he said, he is open to any task 
handed him. He said he is volunteering for the fun of it and "mainly because I 
think the city needs help." MARY LOU PICKEL

 The Cypress Cultural Arts Commission is seeking nominations for its 
Outstanding Contribution to the Arts Award, which is given to a volunteer who 
has benefited the arts in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominations are due by 5 p.m. March 25, and the award recipient will be

Celebrates the Arts" week, which will take place April 29 through May 
6.Applications are available at the Cypress Community Center, 5700 Orange 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will receive a plaque and a commendation by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's winner, Christine Swain, donated time and her own artwork to 
schools and organizations to raise money for worthwhile local programs, said 
Nancy Bruns, recreation coordinator of the Cypress Recreation and Park 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 The award "honors volunteers who put so much time into the arts and bringing 
the arts to the people of Cypress so they can enjoy all different forms of 
art," Bruns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two to six nominations have been received in each of the six years since the 
award was first bestowed. "There's a lot of work done by volunteers for the 
arts programs in the city," Bruns said, adding that she hopes the panel will 
receive more nominations this year.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA PALMA; CITY OKS FEE HIKES, AMPHITHEATER STEPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council approved a slew of user fee increases last week and also 
decided to install concrete steps for seating at a planned Central Park 
amphitheater, in favor of a grassy slope. 
</P>
<P>
 User fees in the city typically account for 9% of the city's general revenue 
fund, or $430,000 a year.In the past, increases in user fees have generated 
$10,000 to $12,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The increases covered fees on items ranging from impounded vehicles -- from 
$46 to $52 -- to building demolition permits -- from $105 to $107. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the council chose not to raise fees for new business licenses or a 
tiny tots program. It also agreed to subsidize several youth sports programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 2 to pay a Torrance contractor $16,810 to install the 
amphitheater steps as part of a $642,000 park renovation project. The project, 
which is funded partly by the Community Development Commission and urban park 
grants, will include a gazebo and a group picnic area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concrete steps will accommodate more people," Mayor Wallace D. Linn said. 
"And aesthetically, I think the concrete tends to have a more professional 
look."MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; COUNCIL KILLS RUBY'S PATIO DINING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A restaurant's proposal to construct a patio dining area at the end of the 
Seal Beach Pier was killed last week by the City Council. The proposal by 
Ruby's restaurant had raised the ire of some residents who opposed having a 
portion of the pier removed from public use. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission last month rejected Ruby's plan. The state Department 
of Fish and Game had also raised concerns about it. Ruby's hoped to appeal the 
Planning Commission's decision to the City Council. But the council last week 
decided not to hear the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruby's, which operates an indoor restaurant at the pier, proposed using about 
900 square feet of the landmark structure for a patio area accessible only to 
restaurant customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurant owners said the patio would be built in an area infrequently used 
by the public. But fishermen and others who use the pier said the city should 
not remove more of the structure from public use. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was designed for the public," said resident Gordon Shanks at last week's 
council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Wildlife Conservation Board -- a branch of the Department of Fish 
and Game -- also reviewed the proposal and found that Ruby's patio design 
should leave more than the proposed six feet for public use between the dining 
area and the edge of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous attempts to expand the number of buildings or businesses at the pier 
have met stiff public opposition. A plan to build a two-story building at the 
end of the pier was rejected in the mid-1980s.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY TO BUY 3 TRUCKS FOR INSPECTORS, PARKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council last week authorized the purchase of three new trucks for the 
city's parks and code-inspection departments. The trucks will cost about 
$20,000 each and were selected at the end of a bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will buy two mini-trucks from Huntington Beach Dodge that will be 
used by two building inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the inspectors use their own vehicles while on the job and receive 
a monthly allowance from the city. Sometimes, the allowances total $400 a 
month. Officials concluded that it would be more cost-effective if the 
inspectors used city vehicles, City Manager Jerry L. Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also will buy a one-ton stake-bed truck from Tuttle-Click Ford in 
Irvine. The truck will be used by park maintenance personnel and will replace a 
20-year-old vehicle, Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is now seeking bids to buy a 4-by-4 extra-cab truck for the Lifeguard 
Department.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; GRANT TO HELP WITH LEARNING DISABILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CORE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Students with learning disabilities at Irvine Valley College will receive 
greater assistance this fall with reading, writing, math and in other areas as 
a result of a grant recently given to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelcase Foundation donated $24,200 to the college to buy computer 
stations and printers for a new computer center that the college expects to 
open in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Willard, the college's learning disabilities specialist, said she 
originally planned to install about 15 Macintosh computers with the grant 
money. But with rapid changes in the computer hardware market, she is now 
determining how much and what can be bought for the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mainly, what we're looking for is something sophisticated to help students 
word-process and develop computer skills," Willard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new computer center is a joint project of the Irvine Valley College 
Foundation and the IVC Disabled Students Program. In addition to the Steelcase 
grant, the center has received a $20,700 discount on equipment from Apple 
Computer Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The college is matching the Steelcase grant by providing $29,700 in computer 
software, staff time and other equipment that adapts computers for use by 
learning-disabled students. 
</P>
<P>
 About 140 students with learning disabilities are enrolled in the IVC program, 
which assists them in acquiring marketable skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelcase Foundation is the philanthropic arm of Steelcase Inc., a 
producer of office furniture and auxiliary equipment for data processing 
systems. The foundation gives grants in communities where it has manufacturing 
operations. A Steelcase branch is in Tustin. RICHARD CORE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CLASS EXERCISE TO HELP HEART ASSOCIATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 700 students at La Paz Intermediate School will be putting their 
legs, lungs, arms and stomach muscles through their paces this week as they 
prepare for a national fitness test and raise money for the American Heart 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, students will be doing sit-ups and pull-ups at the school on 
Pradera Drive, and on Thursday they will run a mile.Students have been taking 
pledges, and the more exercises they do and the faster they run, the more money 
they will raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the AHA has held such "fitness challenges" before, this is the first 
time it has been brought to an Orange County school, said the organization's 
spokeswoman, Liz Lin. 
</P>
<P>
 Lin said educating children about exercise and fitness has become more 
important as studies have found that the young are becoming more sedentary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1966, there's been a 54% increase in the prevalence of obesity in 
children 6 to 11," Lin said. "We want to start with the kids in the areas of 
awareness and prevention." 
</P>
<P>
 The exercises also are among those the children will be performing for the 
President's Fitness Test in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 If the school is able to raise more than $500, it will receive gift 
certificates for 10% of the amount collected to buy physical education 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Lander, La Paz Intermediate's principal, said she is confident of a 
strong showing among her seventh- and eighth-grade students, who work on 
physical fitness and play team sports in classes each day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actively prepare for the President's Fitness Test anyway," Lander said. 
"So getting ready for the fitness challenge wasn't difficult."

 Scavenging Common Despite Ban by City 
</P>
<P>
 Poking a stick inside a trash can on the curb of a residential street, 
75-year-old Thu rummaged through garbage in hopes of finding recyclables. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a pair of plastic yellow gloves, Thu, who came here four months ago 
from Vietnam, walks neighborhoods in the northwest section of the city during 
early morning hours each Tuesday -- trash collection day -- to look for 
aluminum cans. 
</P>
<P>
 Thu, who gave only his first name and carried a plastic sack filled with 
aluminum cans, said his 68-year-old wife walks another neighborhood. They sell 
the cans to make a few bucks -- together they earn about $35 a month -- to help 
buy food. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple are not the only ones who roam the streets in search of 
recyclables. 
</P>
<P>
 Other men and women have regular neighborhood routes and dig deep inside trash 
cans to retrieve sacks of newspapers and telephone books that residents leave 
out on the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 The scavengers load the goods into their cars, along with aluminum chairs, 
cans, bottles, old bicycles, tires, screen doors and other items they collect 
for resale. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in this city, it is illegal for people to go through residents' garbage 
cans. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do feel sorry for the people who are doing this as a means to make a 
living," said City Councilwoman Laurann Cook, who walks in the mornings and 
often confronts these people to let them know about the city's ordinance 
prohibiting scavenging. 
</P>
<P>
 "We owe it to the citizens of Fountain Valley to have an ordinance that 
protects them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, an older man cruised the streets, a small trailer hitched 
to his car. "I just do it for the heck of it," said the man, whose trailer was 
loaded with some plastic soda bottles, aluminum pieces and a pair of old skis. 
</P>
<P>
 Another man, who spoke only Spanish, said he lost his job and rifles through 
curbside garbage cans about four or five days a week here and in Huntington 
Beach. He makes about $80 a week and needs the money for food and rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The city takes a dim view of the activity. Once residents' trash cans hit the 
curb, what's inside becomes city property, said Mayor John Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 And he said the ordinance is important because of health, safety and crime 
concerns. "People use (recycling as an excuse) to case neighborhoods," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the recyclers often scatter garbage on streets, and besides, a 
person's trash may contain items such as credit card and banking information. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents interviewed at random had a variety of views on the ordinance and 
the scavengers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't especially like them going through my trash -- it's kind of 
personal," agreed 30-year resident Myrna Arledge, who added that she will put 
newspapers aside for scavengers. "At least it would have a chance of being 
recirculated." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Pat Evans also said she doesn't like it. "It's an unsafe feeling," 
Evans said, adding she doesn't place cans on the curb on trash day until late 
morning to discourage people. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Alfonso Ahuero, don't mind. Ahuero puts recyclables on top of 
trash cans so people can easily take them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were providing a service by recycling," he said. "There are a 
lot of people out of work, and they need it." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say there have been few complaints and suppose that is because 
most residents are compassionate and they also don't know that the city 
prohibits scavengers from going through their trash cans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know people go on circuits" of neighborhoods, said Police Chief Elvin 
Miali. "But we try to encourage people to give (police) a call" if they find 
someone hunting through their garbage cans. DEBRA CANO

L.A. SCENE / THE CITY THEN AND NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CECILIA RASMUSSEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Somehow, you always knew it would be too good to last. 
</P>
<P>
 Exotic birds in lush, natural settings. An amusement park that featured sedate 
rides, in a place with easy freeway access, close to the city, with lots of 
parking close by. 
</P>
<P>
 And the piece de resistance that brought thousands from far and near: 
</P>
<P>
 Free beer. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when Busch Gardens in Van Nuys boasted a serpentine lake 
dotted with islands that featured beer-dispensing gazebos and lush tropical 
plants. Of course, the scenery also helped promote the products of 
Anheuser-Busch, brewer of Budweiser, Busch and other beers. 
</P>
<P>
 The gardens began in the 1950s when August A. Busch Jr. -- whom competitors 
called the P. T. Barnum of the beer business -- decided to open a brewery in 
Los Angeles. His family once owned a 30-acre winter home on South Orange Grove 
Boulevard in Pasadena, on a slope of the lower Arroyo Seco. For more than 30 
years it was a popular tourist attraction, with a lake and waterfalls, swans 
and fairy-tale characters, until it closed in the late 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders welcomed the West Coast branch of the St. Louis brewery to Van 
Nuys by providing $130,000 worth of sewer lines for the 65-acre site bounded by 
Roscoe Boulevard, Woodley and Haskell avenues and the railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the brewery opened in 1954, and every Sunday for almost two years 
while their new church was being raised, the congregation of the Prince of 
Peace Lutheran Church held its prayer services in the Budweiser taproom and 
cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Donald P. Schneider concluded his final taproom sermon: "To some 
people it has probably seemed strange that we have worshiped in a brewery, and 
yet the life of Christ is filled with many strange events." 
</P>
<P>
 The brewery became so successful that by 1966 it had taken over a 20-acre 
cabbage patch next door and turned it into a tropical paradise and theme park. 
Busch Gardens soon featured a monorail, boat rides, bumper cars, lagoons, 
waterfalls, 2,000 birds representing 25 rare species from all over the world, 
live entertainment -- and, once again, free beer. Busch's policy stated that 
visitors who were of drinking age could have two 10-ounce glasses of beer at 
each of the five pavilions for an admission price of $1.75 -- a fee that 
tripled over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Free beer remained available to employees until a 1982 incident in which a 
worker who drank beer on his breaks struck and killed a 16-year-old pedestrian 
as he drove out of the parking lot. After four years of negotiations between 
the brewery and the union, the free beer stopped flowing May 1, 1986, in the 
Van Nuys plant. Instead of the traditional beer breaks that had been written 
into union contracts, workers got two free cases to take home each month. 
</P>
<P>
 If beer drew some grown-ups to the gardens, the birds attracted children. 
Thousands of elementary schoolchildren took part over the years in Busch 
Gardens' education program, which included birds on the endangered species 
list. The two-hour program featured a boat tour of the gardens' flora and 
fauna, and behind-the-scenes looks at the bird food kitchen and holding pens 
for new arrivals. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1972, Mayor Sam Yorty opened a $6-million expansion -- and was bitten on 
the hand by a performing otter. He required a tetanus shot. 
</P>
<P>
 There were older students at the brewery too -- professional bartenders who 
sat in a classroom to learn how to put a smart head on a glass of an 
Anheuser-Busch beer. The brewery hosted 100 to 150 would-be bartenders in 
half-day sessions each month and conducted more extensive four-day courses for 
beer wholesalers -- all to boost the sale of beer, preferably that made by 
Anheuser-Busch. 
</P>
<P>
 Every February, university canoe teams from across the country competed in a 
72-hour canoe race along a three-quarter-mile course. College students didn't 
have to stop paddling to get relief; spectators would hand them beers instead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But other, more dazzling, entertainment began to compete for visitors' money. 
In 1976, attendance plummeted to 950,000 from 1.2 million the year before. By 
1977, brewery officials had converted the theme park to the Busch Bird 
Sanctuary. By eliminating many of the rides, insurance, safety and staff costs 
were cut in half. 
</P>
<P>
 The birds had already been boosting the brewery's coffers. For one 3 1/2-year 
period, Uncle Sam paid the company $110,000 in bird-sitting fees related to a 
flock of fugitive parrots. Federal agents had thought the sanctuary a perfect 
nesting place for a seized shipment of 205 noisy and colorful Amazon parrots, 
smuggled in illegally through Mexico. But the government forgot about the 
parrot stash -- until the tab arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 After paying the bill, government officials grumbled that it would have been 
cheaper just to deport the parrots, even if they all flew first class. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1979, the popularity of beer had led the company to move the birds and pave 
over the gardens for more production space. The swans and geese went to the Los 
Angeles Zoo. Migratory birds that had taken up residence upon discovering 
Busch's bird food were taken to other wild habitats. And more than 850 of the 
rarest birds were jetted to Anheuser-Busch's amusement park at Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, a bird in the hand proved to be of lesser value than a Busch in a 
can. CECILIA RASMUSSEN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; COASTLINE OFFICIAL GETS NATIONAL HONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Linda Kuntzman, instructor coordinator and project director at Coastline 
Community College, has received an Outstanding Community College Chair award, 
one of only four given nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The award was announced at the recent Third International Conference of 
Community College Chairs, Deans and Other Instructional Leaders in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastline recognized Kuntzman at an award ceremony and reception Friday at the 
College Center in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuntzman, who has a doctorate in linguistics, was chosen for the award because 
of her commitment to excellence in teaching and for her contributions to the 
college's program in English as a second language, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ESL program was established in response to the need of Orange County's 
growing non-English-speaking population, said Judith Valles, Coastline's 
consultant to the chancellor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program continues to grow because of the dedication and teaching 
excellence of faculty like Linda. She inspires and empowers those who work with 
her," Valles said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 students are enrolled in Coastline's ESL program this 
semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuntzman supervises a staff of 53 instructors and sets the curriculum, which 
includes satellite classes for Vietnamese-speaking residents held in 
Westminster's Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuntzman said the program's reputation is "built on the work of our individual 
instructors." 
</P>
<P>
 "A program like ours wouldn't be possible without consistent administrative 
commitment and support. And we've had that all along," she said.

GARDEN GROVE MAN DISAPPEARS FROM WORK; MISSING: PROPERTY MANAGER WAS LAST SEEN 
WHILE CHECKING A RENTAL COMPLEX IN SANTA ANA ON THURSDAY. FAMILY AND POLICE ARE 
BAFFLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 44-year-old property manager who acquaintances say never missed an 
appointment has disappeared under "suspicious circumstances" and is listed as 
missing, police said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip George Cousins of Garden Grove was last seen inspecting an apartment 
complex at 1330 Bush St. in Santa Ana on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cousins, who managed residential property for a Santa Ana-based real estate 
management company, left the apartments at 12:15 p.m. and has not been heard 
from since. Also missing is his two-door, 1990 silver Honda Accord. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has never done this. He always keeps his business appointments and always 
comes home," said Cousins' wife, Ruth. She said she called police early Friday 
when he still had not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove police Sgt. Joe Johnson said Sunday that police are searching for 
Cousins' car and any evidence of his whereabouts. Based on information provided 
by family and friends, Johnson said he is suspicious because Cousins' 
disappearance appears "out of character." 
</P>
<P>
 He said there is no evidence of foul play. 
</P>
<P>
 A property manager for the last 15 years, Cousins often collects rent and 
sometimes handles cash, his wife said. Johnson said police haven't determined 
whether any money is missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Schaaf, owner of Preferred Real Estate Management where Cousins works, 
said, "He is very dependable and one of the hardest workers we have. He was in 
the office on Thursday and went to a few properties. He told one of the 
managers that he would be back at the office at 1:30 in the afternoon. The next 
morning his wife called us and said he had not returned home." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Cousins has hired a Westminster private investigator to help locate her 
missing husband. The investigator, Bob Leatherman, said he interviewed fellow 
employees and tenants who saw Cousins last Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After "running down rumors" that proved false, Leatherman said, he still has 
no solid leads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philip did not leave a written itinerary of his daily plans and it's 
difficult to piece together his exact trail," Leatherman said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, family and friends posted more than 2,000 flyers in shopping malls 
and on telephone poles in Santa Ana, Anaheim and Garden Grove, Ruth Cousins 
said. She said her husband, who was born in Northridge and has spent the last 
20 years in Orange County, is in fine health. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Cousins was last seen wearing a short-sleeve shirt, tie, slacks and 
work shoes. He is 5 feet 9, 170 pounds, with brown hair that is thinning and 
brown eyes. His California license plate is 2RTR372. Anyone with information is 
asked to call Garden Grove police at (714) 741-5800.

SHOWERS AND HAIL PEPPER THE COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A slow-moving cold front on Sunday dampened some areas of Orange County with 
showers and sporadic hail. 
</P>
<P>
 The showers began early in the morning, and, shortly before noon, residents 
reported that pea-sized hail had peppered parts of Orange and Santa Ana for 
about 10 minutes.The rain stopped in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro, with .29 inch, recorded the most rainfall in the county. Anaheim 
received .16 inch, Santa Ana .14, San Juan Capistrano .12, and Newport Beach 
.10. 
</P>
<P>
 No major incidents were triggered by the rain, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData, which provides forecasts for 
The Times, said the same Arctic storm system that prompted Sunday's 
precipitation might also bring scattered showers today. Highs today were 
expected to be in the 60s.

ANN CONWAY: GETTING WITH THE PROGRAMS; SCR DONORS SHARE MEMORIES AT GALA 
OPENING OF PLAY ON QUIZ-SHOW SCANDALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of theater buffs gathered for the world premiere of "Night and Her 
Stars" -- a play about the network quiz-show scandals of the late '50s -- at 
South Coast Repertory on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors of at least $1,000 to the Tony Award-winning theater mingled al fresco 
under a sprawling, light-studded canopy and feasted on roast turkey and pasta 
before watching the three-act work commissioned by SCR and written by Richard 
Greenberg of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The buzz? Game shows, now and then. 
</P>
<P>
 UC President Jack Peltason recalled that, in the '40s, his father won $64 on 
the old radio show, "The $64 Question." 
</P>
<P>
 "He went to New York and won by correctly answering this question: 'What was 
the name of the wife of Chiang Kai-shek?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was Mai Ling," said Peltason, who was a teen-ager at the time. 
"Anyway, when he came home we asked how it went and he said it was fun, but 
cost him a lot more than $64 because all of his friends expected him to take 
them out to dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 Peltason also had a chum who was a TV game show contestant in the '50s. "He 
got all the way to the top -- this was before the revelation of corruption -- 
and then quit when they began to feed him questions," Peltason said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hickock, dean of fine arts at UCI, has never been a fan of game shows. 
"They don't interest me. I'd rather be studying a score, writing a book or 
reading a book," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Greenberg. "I watch 'Jeopardy' chronically," he confided before ducking 
the pre-theater party to dine at Diva with SCR directors Martin Benson and 
David Emmes. 
</P>
<P>
 "And most of the time I'm pretty good. Oh, I have those weird nights where 
it's all world geography and I can't make any headway," said the 
thirtysomething playwright who received his master of fine arts degree from 
Yale. "But when it's about drama or American literature, I rarely miss one." 
</P>
<P>
 Does he think "Jeopardy," like the "Twenty-One" game show portrayed in his 
play, could be fixed? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Greenberg said. "And if any show is fixed today -- I don't want to know 
about it. I'd be terribly disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Said "Night and Her Stars" director David Warren: "The closest thing to being 
fixed on television today would be talk shows, where everyone is coached to sob 
and fall apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg began to write "Night and Her Stars" after seeing a 10-minute 
segment of a documentary about the '50s quiz-show scandals on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "It fascinated me," he said. "Automatically, those men (Charles Van Doren and 
Herbert Stempel) became my characters. I started writing and never stopped. 
That was two years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren said he hopes the play will get audiences thinking about television's 
potential to shape their lives, influence the way they think. "It's a play 
about people searching for a way to live authentically, not be defined by 
television or by what it tells them about America," he said, "or where they 
fit." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Greenberg: "I was born during the chronology of this play. And that made 
it completely fascinating for me because it became an effort for me to figure 
out what made me ." 
</P>
<P>
 Theater activist Gail Ochs said she loved the game shows of early television. 
"And I can see why we were easily deceived by them," she said. "We were naive; 
television was a new medium and everybody was excited about somebody knowing 
everything about everything. Today, we're far more sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
 SCR supporter Arden Flamson said Friday night's party scene -- with its 
twinkle lights, towering trees and sparkling silver service -- reminded her of 
Tavern on the Green, the Big Apple restaurant located in Central Park. "I love 
that place -- used to go there quite a bit," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said former SCR board President Peter Ochs: "Well, tonight, New York is 
looking at us. In fact, the quality of theater here is so outstanding that New 
York will always be looking at us." 
</P>
<P>
 After the play, guests again mingled in the courtyard, sipping Kenya and 
Sumatra coffee and sampling fruit tarts and Kahlua crunch cheesecake. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a witty, wonderful play," said Orange County Supervisor Harriett Wieder. 
"It sure brought back memories -- reminded my husband, Irv, and I, that, after 
we were married in the '40s, we auditioned for a newlywed show on radio. Those 
were the days." 
</P>
<P>
 Also among guests were Bill and Bobbie Stabler (swaddled in shear beaver); 
Olivia and Andrew Johnson; June Wankier and her daughter, Michele Wankier 
Edwards (who will co-chair SCR's annual gala on Sept. 10); Carl and Margaret 
Karcher; Ralph and Dot Clock; Steward Woodard; Larry and Dee Higby; Lydia Wang 
and Kenneth Himes; Marilyn and Frank Lynch and SCR board President Tom Sutton.

JACK SMITH: EVEN SHORT QUOTATIONS LEAVE A MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In writing recently of Charlton Heston's complaint that Justin Kaplan, editor 
of the 16th edition of Bartlett's "Familiar Quotations," exercised "Draconian 
censorship" in limiting two-term President Ronald Reagan to three quotations, I 
seem to have aroused assorted political passions. 
</P>
<P>
 While agreeing with Heston, I noted that I am not a "political animal," and 
that I had voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election 
since (and including) Roosevelt. Also, I wrote, in the last gubernatorial 
election, I voted for the Peace and Freedom candidate, turning my back on 
Republican and Democrat alike. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if one expresses any political opinion, he is thereby seen as a 
political animal and subject to appropriate abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read your article about not being 'a political person,' " writes Caroline 
Kinkle of San Marino. (I said animal , not person , not that it matters.) 
</P>
<P>
 "When people make that statement," she goes on, "it makes me sad. It is such a 
privilege to live in America and have the opportunity to work for responsible 
government and to preserve the Constitution. It is too bad that citizens of 
this country are so ignorant about decisions that determine their future. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 "I read your column today only because Reagan's name was in the headline," 
writes Marjorie Beacom of Santa Ana. "I found, of course, only another 
Reagan-bashing statement from an unbelievably dull columnist. I'm writing 
because your stupidity appalls me. . . . You vote for Democrats because 'they 
seem to have better personalities.' Whether or not you know it, you are a 
Democrat. Only a Democrat would display such shallow reasoning." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, as President Harry S. Truman said, "If you can't stand the heat stay out 
of the kitchen." 
</P>
<P>
 "You must be pleased with our current president, Slick Willie," Beacom adds. 
"What a personality he is. What a tragedy for all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 All the same, I'll bet Slick Willie gets more than three quotations in the 
next edition of Bartlett's (in 2004). 
</P>
<P>
 Although Reagan may have been slighted in Bartlett's, he was certainly well 
represented in another book of quotes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Heston wants to see Reagan quoted," writes Alyson Ross, "he should get a 
copy of 'The 776 Stupidest Things Ever Said,' by Ross and Kathryn Petras 
(Doubleday). Mr. Reagan is quoted no less than 23 times." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the quotes, "Facts are stupid things," is taken from a speech Reagan 
gave at a Republican convention and is described as "a misquotation from John 
Adams." In fact, what Adams said was "Facts are stubborn things." Well, maybe 
Reagan wasn't misquoting Adams, but making up something stupid on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to change the subject, but it would be a grievous oversight not to note 
that "The 776 Stupidest Things Ever Said" has several quotes from the master of 
turgid non sequiturs, Dan Quayle.  
</P>
<P>
 He once said, "I love California. I grew up in Phoenix." On a visit to Hawaii, 
he said: "Hawaii has always been a very pivotal role in the Pacific. It is in 
the Pacific. It is part of the United States that is an island that is right 
here." Also, "It's a question of whether we're going to go forward into the 
future or past into the back."  
</P>
<P>
 Surely if Quayle had become President, he would have been quoted in Bartlett's 
more than three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Sy Kasoff of North Hollywood comes to the defense of Yogi Berra, the baseball 
player who shares with Samuel Goldwyn the honor of being the most creative 
mangler of the language.  
</P>
<P>
 Kasoff argues that Berra's line, "It ain't over till it's over," makes perfect 
sense when you realize that he is talking about baseball, a game that is 
"open-ended, without time constraints, unlike most other sports. If the score 
is 42-6 in football and there's only three minutes to play, or four or five, 
the game is indeed over. . . . But in baseball, ah, how well I remember a game 
between the old Washington Senators and the Boston Red Sox." 
</P>
<P>
 Kasoff recalls that going into the top of the ninth, the score was 4-3, 
Washington. The Senators proceeded to score 10 runs, making it 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the bottom half of the ninth, the first two batters for the Bosox made 
outs: The game was over. But wait. There was a base hit, and another, a few 
more, and a couple of runs came in. It's 14-6. Then more of the same -- 14-8, 
14-9, and now it's 14-12, the bases are loaded and Jim Pagliaroni, Boston's 
weak-hitting catcher, is at the plate. Pags swings mightily . . . and in no 
time at all the ball sails into the screen atop the left field wall -- a 
grand-slam home run. Final score: Boston, 16-14. And that's what Yogi was 
talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, Yogi, it ain't over till it's over. It was also Yogi who said: "A nickel 
ain't worth a dime anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 How true.

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; SEARCHING FOR LIFE'S DEEPER TRUTHS -- AND FINDING THEM; 
BREATHING WATER BY THOMAS GAVIN ; ARCADE; $19.95, 320 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many a scam has been greased by the words of Scripture, but Thomas Gavin's 
novel about a con man and his 12-year-old accomplice preying on a small Upstate 
New York town works the opposite way: The story's cynical, down-home charm is 
just a ploy to ease us into a serious encounter with religious issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, Paul, and the con man, Everet Dusseau, who draws a comic strip called 
"Deathwind," happen to drift into Rising Sun just as its richest citizen is 
proposing to spend $1 million on a memorial to her grandson, Powell, kidnaped 
nine years ago at age 3 and presumed dead. Paul claims to be Powell -- which, 
if true, would deprive the town of its expected windfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot seems to focus on two questions. Can Paul, whom we know to be an 
impostor, fool the sharp-eyed dowager, Edna Kane, whose daughter ran off to 
Hollywood and committed suicide after the boy's disappearance? And can the 
town's high-minded if alcoholic newspaper editor, Pardon Wilhelm, and his ace 
reporter, Frank Canby, punch holes in Dusseau's story before it's too late? 
</P>
<P>
 We're in no hurry for the answers. Gavin ("Kingkill," "The Last Film of Emile 
Vico") writes in prose as fine-grained and glistening as varnished oak, and 
makes this tale meander through so many classic Faulknerian devices (such as 
telling us about Powell's mother's reaction to the kidnaping via the boozy 
speculations of Wilhelm and Canby years afterward) that we keep checking to 
make sure Rising Sun isn't somewhere in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 For the sheer fun of it, it seems, Gavin lavishes detail on every minor 
character, every stage prop. Dusseau and Paul arrive, for instance, in "a tan 
Chevy van with Vermont plates and rust under the headlight rims and a little 
gob of feathers with what looked like a sparrow wing sticking out of it 
squashed to the grille. . . . A sharp-edged tomahawk was painted with its blade 
angled just behind the passenger door and whitish streaks trailing back the 
length of the van to show it was flying through the air." 
</P>
<P>
 So it seems only incidental, at first, that the cook at the Milky Way Cafe 
speaks in tongues. That Wilhelm is reading the "Confessions" of St. Augustine. 
That Kane's mansion contains a statue of Abraham sacrificing Isaac. That her 
secretary -- Canby's ex-girlfriend and Dusseau's future lover -- is doing 
self-imposed penance for an abortion. And that even Dusseau views his 
violence-drenched art as a kind of religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, however, Paul finds clues that he may be Powell. Dusseau, who has slyly 
kept their relationship undefined, may really be his father -- and his 
kidnaper. 
</P>
<P>
 This brings on a crisis. The boy has been bright enough to master the 
manipulative arsenal of mind-control exercises that Dusseau learned both as an 
abused child and as a Jesuit seminarian; he also is bright enough to see that 
Dusseau's outlook has its limitations. If Kane is his grandmother, shouldn't he 
just tell her the truth? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "True's got nothing to do with facts," Dusseau answers -- the credo of the 
artist, the existentialist. "True is what you can make the one with the belt 
need to believe. True is control . . . so you can put your whole life behind 
the person you made up, and they believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Wilhelm and Canby, in dogged journalistic pursuit of the facts, 
come to wonder whether, indeed, they are irrelevant to life's deeper truths. 
And Kane, although she retains her faith in God, concludes that his love may be 
totally devoid of pity. 
</P>
<P>
 Love does triumph in "Breathing Water." It softens Kane's arrogance. It 
corrupts her secretary, who badly needed corrupting. It exposes the shallowness 
of Wilhelm's ambition to be a "just judge" and Canby's to be a "shark" chasing 
after exposes. It touches even Dusseau's tortured soul. And it could save Paul 
-- if it doesn't kill him first. 
</P>
<P>
 But we may feel, like Kane, that this love is a mixed blessing. The plot 
dives, at the end, into much deeper and colder waters. Gavin takes us into 
Dusseau's mind; the questions dangled in front of us for so long get answered 
with rude abruptness. 
</P>
<P>
 The ending is written, if anything, even more brilliantly than the rest of the 
novel, but it's a bit more than we bargained for, and we miss the fun.

FASHION; THE FALL COLLECTIONS / PARIS; NEW DIRECTIONS; JACKETS ARE LONG, 
SWEATERS ARE SHORT AND KIMONOS ARE EVERYWHERE -- INSIDE AND OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ROURKE, TIMES FASHION EDITOR

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood has come to town, that much is clear the minute anyone in the 
fashion business checks into their hotel. A stack of invitations awaits. This 
season, a separate note explains that director Robert Altman and the cast and 
crew of his latest movie, "Pret-a-Porter," will be in the audience as well.  
</P>
<P>
 This is Altman's film about the fashion business. In it, Sophia Loren plays an 
overdressed widow, Lauren Bacall and Sally Kellerman act as magazine editors 
and Kim Basinger covers fashion for television. They made their first big 
entrance Sunday morning at the Christian Lacroix show. Basinger got whistles, 
Loren got applause. 
</P>
<P>
 What is Hollywood's take on fashion editors? 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping you'd show me," Kellerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, it's easier to say how Hollywood might dress fashion types. 
Loren wore a huge black hat. Bacall had a floral chiffon scarf trailing over 
her shoulders. Kellerman wore clean green sportswear. And Basinger's flashy 
silk jacket was embroidered across the back. Not a bad approximation. 
</P>
<P>
 With all this movie business going on, it's easy to forget the fashion news. 
But for the first time in more than a year, a clear new direction emerged in 
Paris style. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kimono coats are a new look. Some are embroidered or painted silk, to be 
worn under or over traditional wool tweeds. Others are colorful wool jersey to 
wear with long dark dresses or skirts.  
</P>
<P>
 * Jackets are at an all-time long, extending to just inches above the knees. 
Most designers show them with pants or ankle-length skirts, the favored length 
for fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * Skirts tend to be long, but coats and coat dresses look newest at knee 
length. They go with tall boots, or tights and ankle boots. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Baby" sweaters, cropped at the ribs, found a place in almost every show. 
Worn over ankle-length dresses, they offer another fresh look. 
</P>
<P>
 * Colors are dark and in mineral tones. Deep blue, gray, green and brown 
dominated most collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacroix premiered "Bazar," a line to be priced about 50% lower than his main 
collection. Raw-edged leather vests; big, blue denim jackets, and zip-up 
cardigan sweaters, all with a weekend casual feeling, took up the first part of 
his show.  
</P>
<P>
 In his more expensive line, he layered silk kimonos over velvet vests to wear 
with pants or long skirts. His jackets in silk damask or patchwork tweeds 
extended close to the knees. 
</P>
<P>
 In Dries Van Noten's show, dark floral print dresses drifted to ankle-length, 
with baby cardigans on top. Thick-heeled pumps, or chunky oxfords, added to the 
thrift-shop feeling. The clothes captured a new way of romantic dressing that 
several young designers have been working on. Everything in this collection 
appeared to be worn and softened. 
</P>
<P>
 A rising star among newer talents in Paris, Van Noten started his business in 
his native Antwerp in 1985. He came to Paris several years ago, adding his name 
to the list of avant-garde Belgians who show here. Any woman who wears designer 
labels and doesn't like long skirts will find a soul mate in Claude Montana. 
His fall line is filled with short, A-line skirts. Suits in his collection had 
high-waisted wrap skirts and pyramid-shaped jackets, widest at the hem. He 
mixed red and black flannel and completed outfits with over-the-knee boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Left to himself Montana would have been happy showing nothing but white 
clothes this season. White silky parkas with matching minis, white tights and 
off-white chunky boots were one snow-toned idea.  
</P>
<P>
 Yohji Yamamoto's fitted, navy blue coat dresses with double rows of tiny 
buttons were the single best item in his show. His kimono coats in pastel 
layers, worn over long dark dresses, offered an unusual dash of color. 
</P>
<P>
 Rei Kawakubo, for Comme des Garcons, went back to some of her earliest ideas 
in a collection of dark pin-striped jackets and plaid dresses or skirts. She 
mixed very structured and nearly shapeless pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Pin-striped jackets with raw hems were tucked into skirts that looked like 
fabric fresh from the bolt worn wrapped around the body. Pin-striped camp 
shirts tucked into long skirts with waistbands of fabric rolled to a thick wad 
further showed off Kawakubo's idea of playing structured and soft shapes 
against each other. White velvet apron dresses, tied in the back and worn over 
long white velvet skirts, were a graceful evening look. 
</P>
<P>
 Next: The collections of Vivienne Westwood, Karl Lagerfeld and Christian Dior.

PORT HUENEME MAN ARRESTED AS SUSPECT IN SLAYING; CRIME: THE 19-YEAR-OLD IS HELD 
IN THE FATAL SHOOTING OF ANDY LEE ANDERSON OF SIMI VALLEY, WHOSE BODY WAS FOUND 
SUNDAY AT A CAMPGROUND NEAR OJAI.

<P>
 A 24-year-old Simi Valley man reported missing from a fishing trip was found 
shot to death early Sunday at a remote campground north of Ojai, one day after 
police discovered his truck abandoned in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Later Sunday, a 19-year-old Port Hueneme man was arrested on suspicion of 
killing Andy Lee Anderson, whose body was discovered about 6 a.m. by a 
sheriff's search team at the Middle Lion's Campground near the Rose Valley 
Recreation Area, authorities said. The body was partially hidden by tree 
boughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Chrestman was taken into custody around 2:30 p.m. at Zuma Beach in Los 
Angeles County by Ventura County sheriff's deputies, according to Sheriff's Lt. 
Craig Husband. No further details on the arrest or a possible motive were 
available late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, described as an avid outdoorsman and a loyal friend, died of a 
single gunshot wound to the upper body, Husband said. His Australian shepherd 
was also killed and lay a short distance away, along with Anderson's tackle box 
and a few trout apparently caught in Sespe Creek. Husband said investigators 
found no sign of a struggle at the campground. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was last seen early Friday when he left his parents' home in Simi 
Valley to go fishing in the Ojai area. He had planned to return by about 2 p.m. 
and was scheduled to work at his job at Blue Cross of California in Westlake at 
4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members called Simi Valley police that night when he failed to show up 
for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours later, about 2:30 a.m. Saturday, sheriff's deputies in Los Angeles 
discovered Anderson's blue 1987 Toyota pickup truck abandoned near Melrose 
Avenue in West Hollywood. Witnesses told deputies that they saw the truck cut 
off another vehicle in traffic, and that the truck was then chased by that 
vehicle. The chase ended when the truck was abandoned, Husband said, adding 
that two men were seen running from the area of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the truck, investigators found a 20-gauge shotgun and a small-caliber 
rifle that did not belong to Anderson. Husband said ballistics tests were being 
performed to determine if one was used to kill Anderson. An autopsy on 
Anderson's body is scheduled today. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the body was found, Ventura County sheriff's deputies and Anderson's 
relatives spent Saturday scouring the mountainous area north of Ojai by ground 
and helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives and about 50 friends were preparing to resume the search Sunday 
morning, armed with flyers showing Anderson's picture, when they learned that 
his body had been found about 15 miles north of Ojai in Rose Valley, an area 
with a reputation for rowdy parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made the phone call before we started looking," said his sister, Laurie. 
"And they told us they already had some bad news." 
</P>
<P>
 Although several groups of people had stayed overnight at the campground, no 
one reported seeing the body clad in blue jeans, a green and blue shirt, and 
tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would have expected that people would have seen the fish lying there and 
looked around, but that didn't happen," Husband said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was the youngest of three children and lived with his parents, Bobby 
and Carolyn. He worked the swing shift as a customer service representative for 
Blue Cross. Supervisor Sandy Hogsett said he was adept at handling customer 
complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 He graduated from Apollo Continuation High School in Simi Valley and attended 
Moorpark College for about a year before quitting to work full time and pay off 
some bills, said his mother, Carolyn Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday afternoon, more than 50 friends and relatives crowded into the 
Andersons' home to console each other and express anger over the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope they catch the people who did this because they obviously don't 
have a heart," said Lori Quinn, Anderson's girlfriend of three years. "They 
don't know how many lives they've messed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends described Anderson as an independent worker, a protective brother and 
an athlete who enjoyed playing in football and baseball leagues since he was a 
youngster. 
</P>
<P>
 "He liked to do anything that presented a challenge for him," his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Anderson said her brother hoped to make a career of his job at Blue 
Cross and save enough money to marry his girlfriend and move into their own 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 She said he was part of a large circle of friends who had grown up together in 
the subdivision where the family lived. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anybody was in trouble, if anybody needed a friend to talk to, he was 
there," she said.

EGG ART SHOW DELIGHTS EVEN THE HARD-BOILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six-year-old Nathan Anderson of Camarillo looked with wonder at the 
meticulously decorated ostrich egg. 
</P>
<P>
 What was once yolk and membrane had been turned into a tiny carriage, complete 
with hinged doors and turning wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the coach the best, with the door on the carriage and all of the 
moving parts," he said, looking to his mother, Sally Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 But the decorated egg -- one of scores of intricately crafted pieces at the 
California Egg Artistry Show & Sale offered for $100 or more -- was a bit too 
pricey for Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most I ever spent on one is $75," she said. "It was hand-painted and cut. 
I liked the fine, gorgeous pen strokes." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of dealers, suppliers and egg artisans gathered at the Westlake Hyatt 
hotel for the 19th annual egg artistry show, which drew more than 2,500 people 
over the three-day event that ended Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some dealers were bringing in thousands of dollars for hand-dyed eggs and 
other wares that took weeks or months to create. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to make the whole mechanism by hand," said Jay Peterson, a retired 
salesman from Santa Maria who fashioned a working carousel from an 
eight-inch-wide ostrich egg. "It took me a year." 
</P>
<P>
 The carousel won first prize in the mechanical egg category in the 1993 show, 
Peterson said. It is worth between $6,000 and $10,000, he said, but he is 
unwilling to part with it at any price. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'd ever be able to make another one," Peterson said of the 
carousel egg, which features a cassette deck underneath that plays classical 
music while tiny ponies turn and lift up and down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get more enjoyment out of watching it than from the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Benny Cotinola, who has promoted the California event for four years, 
said people have been decorating eggs for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eggs have been around since heaven knows when," said Cotinola, who also 
promotes a national egg event each fall. "There's a meaning behind it, and 
that's the giving of life. It's just an attraction that people have always 
had." 
</P>
<P>
 Lompoc artist Frances-Jane Longley added: "From ancient Chinese times, people 
have always done eggs. The Chinese say the world started from eggs. And how do 
I know, maybe it did." 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Ammann, an Oxnard escrow assistant, said she has been crafting art from 
eggs for more than five years. Her hobby grew from decorating Easter eggs as a 
young girl. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, she had a special reason for attending the show. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother's getting married in June and he wanted me to create a centerpiece 
for the wedding table reception," she said. "That'll be my gift to him and his 
wife." 
</P>
<P>
 Artist Sally Osti, who owns the Eggs Cetera gallery in Sylmar, said the annual 
California Egg Artistry Show is among the most popular on the circuit. "It's 
that time of year for eggs," she said, referring to the upcoming Easter 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Osti feels lucky that more of her eggs were not damaged in the Jan. 17 
earthquake that was centered just miles from her shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "My store looked like a salt-and-pepper shaker, but most of the eggs 
survived," she said. "Three boxes of unpainted eggs crashed into a wall but 
prevented more of the eggs from getting broken." 
</P>
<P>
 Osti said she works mainly with quail, ostrich, goose and duck eggs, painting 
detailed images of penguins, giraffes and other animals onto the waxed 
surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, wolves are very in," said Osti, who attends between 15 and 20 egg 
shows a year but has steady clients in gift shops at Disneyland and Sea World. 
</P>
<P>
 At Mary and Tommy Pruett's table, unpainted green emu eggs were selling for 
$25 each. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're pretty hard to come by," said Tommy Pruett, who traveled with his 
wife from Austin, Tex., to attend the show. "They're from Australia, and there 
aren't that many breeders and hatchers here in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 As Pruett spoke, Anderson ambled by his table with her son, Nathan. This time, 
she could not resist plunking down $25 for the olive-green emu egg from Down 
Under. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's from Australia," she said. "And this is as close as I'll ever get to 
there."

STREET SMART: SOLUTION TO UNCOMFORTABLE DIP IN ROAD IS ON THE LEVEL 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: There is an annoying dip in the road at the intersection of 
Victoria Avenue and Hemlock Street in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 When empty truck trailers hit this dip at maximum speeds, they create a 
rattling sound that can be heard for blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since this side of Victoria Avenue is scheduled to be resurfaced, the 
residents of Leeward Estates would appreciate a more level roadway at this 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane E. Totten, Oxnard 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 Your request will be granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard transportation manager Samia Maximous confirms that there is indeed an 
uncomfortable dip at Victoria and Hemlock. 
</P>
<P>
 When the city resurfaces the road in late spring, Maximous says street workers 
will take special care to level out the dip. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 I'm concerned about bumps at the Pleasant Valley Road exit of the Ventura 
Freeway in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 When you exit the freeway and turn right onto Pleasant Valley, there is a 
large concentration of relatively deep bumps that could easily throw a car 
off-track. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is responsible for this area, and can these bumps be removed? 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Madsen, Camarillo 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 The bumps are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Camarillo is in charge of maintaining Pleasant Valley Road. Last 
week, the city completed a repaving project that included smoothing out bumps 
on the roadway, says Tom Fox, city engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are the bumps gone, but the road is entirely repaved to Ridge View 
Street. 
</P>

 Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
 There needs to be a stop sign installed on Lakeview Canyon Road at Falling 
Star Avenue in the North Ranch area of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers speed down Lakeview at breakneck rates and do not even look for cars 
turning left from Falling Star. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, there are no sidewalks on Lakeview or Falling Star, making it extremely 
dangerous for pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 Can stop signs be installed? 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Leap, Westlake Village 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Reader: 
</P>
<P>
 It is not likely that stop signs will be installed on Lakeview Canyon Road any 
time soon -- and, if they were, they might make the intersection more 
dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 It might seem to you like there's a lot of traffic on Lakeview, but it's not 
enough to meet state stop-sign standards, says Roy Myers, assistant traffic 
engineer for Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Myers says, installing stop signs to force motorists to slow down 
does not work, especially when there is no cross traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a person is speeding and doesn't see any cars on the side street, you're 
lucky if they slow down at all," Myers said. "If they do slow down, they are 
just going to try and make up the lost time when they start up again." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers says the city has proven this theory at Calle Bouganvilla and Avenida de 
los Arboles. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a nine-year period when there were no stop signs at the intersection, 
there was one accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Six years ago, a stop sign was installed and, Myers says, as a direct result, 
the accident rate increased to about one a year. 
</P>
<P>
 And little can be done to address your concern for pedestrians who have no 
sidewalks to run to for safety when motorists zoom by. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents desiring to maintain the rural atmosphere of North Ranch have fought 
to keep sidewalks out of their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, a rural atmosphere does not prevent the existence of speeding 
cars.

CITY COUNCIL ASKED TO BAN STREET VENDORS; OXNARD: NEIGHBORHOOD LEADERS WANT 
OFFICIALS TO CONSIDER OUTLAWING DOZENS OF PEDDLERS. THE THREAT TO HEALTH AND 
UNFAIR BUSINESS COMPETITION ARE CITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Neighborhood leaders are seeking to push peddlers off the streets of Oxnard, 
saying that most are unlicensed, pose a health threat and unfairly undercut 
established businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Inter-Neighborhood Council Committee has asked the Oxnard City Council to 
consider outlawing vendors from public roads and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a concern about the quality of the product that is being sold," said 
Eleanor Branthoover, chairwoman of the neighborhood council coalition. "The 
city doesn't have enough police officers or code inspectors to catch everyone 
who is operating illegally." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of peddlers hit the streets each day in Oxnard, hawking everything from 
ice cream to tamales to corn on the cob. 
</P>
<P>
 They are enthusiastically welcomed in some neighborhoods, keeping alive a 
longstanding tradition of street sales common in Mexico and other countries 
south of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything wrong with these people who are trying to earn an honest 
living and stay off the welfare rolls," said Carlos Aguilera, chairman of La 
Colonia's Neighborhood Council. "The only people complaining about street 
vendors are those who don't buy their products." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Branthoover and other neighborhood leaders are asking officials 
to craft a law patterned after those enacted by other Ventura County cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme and Camarillo have adopted ordinances outlawing street vendors. 
In Thousand Oaks, street peddlers were required to pay a $250 annual fee and 
carry insurance after merchants complained that the vendors undercut their 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Moorpark, street vendors are required to pay $50 for a license and $35 
for a photo identification card. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, street vendors pay a $393 annual licensing fee and must obey a 
myriad regulations that include limits on areas and hours of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard now licenses 28 street vendors. But many more hit the streets without 
city permission, code enforcement officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 And neighborhood leaders say that increasingly, the sidewalk salesmen are 
hawking more than just frozen fruit bars. Some lug vats of corn or tamales, 
selling their goods without regard for health laws. Others sell sliced fruit 
without properly cleaning their hands and knives, neighborhood representatives 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhood leaders also say some vendors urinate in public and then fail to 
wash their hands before continuing their rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a great possibility for spreading disease or infection," said Rose 
Zachowski, chairwoman of the Bartolo Square South Neighborhood Council. "I know 
they are trying to make a buck, but there needs to be some control of these 
unsanitary conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard code enforcement chief Richard McIntosh said residents throughout the 
city have become increasingly concerned about street vendors as their numbers 
have swelled in recent years, driven by a wave of peddlers from outside the 
city and the county. 
</P>
<P>
 McIntosh said he would support a ban on street vendors. He said it's just a 
matter of time before someone becomes seriously ill from sampling their wares. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these folks are peddling stuff that, if I put it in my system, would 
probably put me in an outpatient clinic," McIntosh said. "I hate to take 
anything from anybody who makes their livelihood this way, but we don't have 
the time or the manpower to sort it all out." 
</P>
<P>
 Upon receiving the request last week from the neighborhood council 
representatives, council members ordered city staff to review the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But further restrictions on street vendors are not something that should be 
rushed into and may not even be desirable, City Atty. Gary Gillig said. 
</P>
<P>
 "An argument can be made that they are legitimate businesses trying to make a 
living," Gillig said. "If they are properly licensed, and if they obey the 
conditions of their license, at this point in time, there isn't much we can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo Ortiz -- a 53-year-old Pacoima resident who sells fruit, dried pork 
rinds and warm soda from the back of his pickup in Oxnard -- said he feels that 
the city should continue to allow street sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are we supposed to go?" asked Ortiz, an admittedly unlicensed vendor 
hawking his goods on the roadside last week. "If we had money for a license, 
would we be selling fruit for a dollar? All we're trying to do is earn a 
living." 
</P>
<P>
 But even if street peddlers are outlawed, Ortiz said he will continue to come 
to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where I live, there are too many salesmen," he said. "Here, the people want 
to buy what I have to sell."

CITY COUNCIL TO CONSIDER STUDY ON NEW POLICE STATION; SIMI VALLEY: IF IT IS 
APPROVED, THE CITY WOULD PAY CONSULTANT UP TO $35,000 FOR WORK ON REPLACING 
EXISTING FACILITY. QUAKE CAUSED $200,000 IN DAMAGE. 
</P>

<P>
 Lacking both the money to pay for a new Simi Valley police station and a place 
to build it, the City Council today will decide whether to pay for a study to 
replace quarters whose deterioration was hastened by the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the city would pay a consultant up to $35,000 to scrutinize 
funding and site possibilities, and assemble a budget for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the study would come from the city's Community Development Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is it's about time," Councilwoman Barbara Williamson said. "The 
sooner we get this thing going, the sooner we'll have a station we can be proud 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 A report released by the city in mid-February said the station could be 
replaced within four years at a cost of up to $11.3 million, if the city could 
find the money to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 That estimate does not include the cost of buying land if the city decided to 
build the station on property it does not already own. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Gene Hostetler welcomed the plan. "Right now, the station is still 
functioning," he said. "But we've had some damage and who's to say what would 
happen if we had another earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 The department's existing headquarters on Cochran Street was designed as 
temporary structures, built in three stages between 1968 and 1973. They were 
remodeled for the Police Department in the 1980s at a cost to the city of $1.21 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake caused about $200,000 in damage. A floor sank six inches, walls 
split at their seams, ceiling tiles crashed to the floor and broken water lines 
flooded the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs to the station, which the city hopes to pay for out of Federal 
Emergency Management Agency funds, are under way and should be completed by 
late spring. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials agree that the repairs are merely a temporary fix. 
</P>
<P>
 The city report pointed out that the department would soon outgrow its 
quarters. In 10 years, the report said, the department will need up to 43,500 
square feet of working space, nearly twice the area of the station on Cochran. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at the point where we need to start planning for the next station," 
Councilwoman Judy Mikels said. "And this time, we're going to build it for the 
long run." 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan is approved, the city would ask consulting companies to submit 
proposals for the project, and the council would select a firm at its April 11 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with a team of police officers and city officials, the firm would have 
until January to complete its report, the first of a five-phase construction 
plan outlined by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city would then decide whether to conduct an environmental review and hire 
a construction manager. 
</P>
<P>
 If a suitable site is found and the money is assembled to pay for it, the city 
could have a new police station by late 1997.

FOR OXNARD BOY, BUG COLLECTING IS NOT JUST A HOBBY; INSECTS: JAMES FUJITA HAS 
BEEN FASCINATED WITH THE CRITTERS SINCE HE WAS 3. TODAY, AT 12, HE'S A BONA 
FIDE AUTHORITY, LECTURING CLASSES AND WINNING AWARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 James Fujita's fascination with insects began on a sunny spring day when he 
was 3 years old and ran outside his home to greet a fluttering cloud of 
butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would catch them and put them in a jar," James said. "I could do that all 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the sixth-grader at Oxnard's Rose Avenue School has become a genuine 
authority on bugs, lecturing in classrooms from preschool to college throughout 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a massive collection of insects, both dead and alive. And his talks 
around the county range from lectures on insect anatomy to collecting 
techniques and the values of bugs in society. 
</P>
<P>
 "James is an outstanding teacher and speaker who manages to keep a classroom 
really enthralled (with) his presentation," said Anne Benson, a coordinator 
with the Oxnard Elementary School District for gifted and talented education. 
</P>
<P>
 For a 12-year-old, James' accomplishments are many. Just three months ago, he 
was named the 1993 Young Entomologist of the Year by the Los Angeles chapter of 
the international Lorquin Entomological Society. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also worked with professional organizations including the Insect Zoo of 
the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum, and has documented insects for 
the states of Arizona and California. 
</P>
<P>
 A death-head moth -- similar to those collected by the serial killer in 
"Silence of the Lambs" -- is part of James' enormous bug collection. The 
family's home is decorated with brown-orange cockroaches collected in Hawaii, 
and exotic spiders and moths. He also boasts a type of cricket, never 
identified before, that was destroying strawberries at Oxnard farms. 
</P>
<P>
 But James' many achievements are not all in entomology. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the family's home, certificates for his outstanding achievements in 
math and reading are displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 James also has a love for literature. Of the books in his library, James said 
he loves to read children's novels, particularly Beverly Cleary's books. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he could be in a high school-level class, James said he wants to stay 
with his peers, a desire that his parents share. 
</P>
<P>
 James' teachers have recommended several times that he skip grades. But his 
parents, who themselves are high school teachers, have refused to push their 
only child. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to rob him of his childhood," David Fujita said. "You can only 
goof off once." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fujitas said they have supported James' interest in insects by buying him 
books and taking him to museums. 
</P>
<P>
 James' first book on insects took the place of a teddy bear, his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to sleep with his bug book," Carol Fujita said. "He was only 3 years 
old." 
</P>
<P>
 James said he decided to study insects so he could learn about their habits. 
After the butterflies, James found a potato bug, which bit him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not know it would bite me. So I began to observe them and learn about 
their behavior," he said. "That's how it started." 
</P>
<P>
 His involvement with entomology, or the study of insects, has continued ever 
since. He has helped in the inventory of insects at nine Nature Conservancy 
preserves. He has helped farmers in Ventura County identify insects and has 
donated insects to Los Angeles County's Natural History Museum and the Santa 
Barbara Natural History Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know James say his motivation and perseverance distinguish him from 
other children. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sets his own standards," said his teacher, Jerry Schuler. "He does not 
need any pushing, prodding or cajoling." 
</P>
<P>
 Other teachers agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of kids develop a passion for something, but then they get involved 
with something else," Benson said. "But James has stuck with his interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers like having James speaking to their classes not only because of his 
knowledge, but also because of his enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He shows the kids how much he loves to learn and that is important for the 
students," said Joanne Black, Hueneme High School principal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past nine years, bug hunting has become the Fujita family vacation 
activity. His parents have taken James insect hunting both in the United States 
and abroad. They have gone bug hunting in Japan and hope to get permission to 
collect insects in the Costa Rica rain forest in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fujitas have spent more than $5,000 on James' mini-zoo, but it is an 
activity that they all enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of fun," said David Fujita, recalling the time when the three 
of them ran through people's back yards in Hawaii chasing a butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase began after James spotted a white monarch butterfly on Hawaii's main 
island. "That type of butterfly had been found only on Oahu. So I was really 
excited," James said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-mile chase, they caught the butterfly, which is now part of 
James' collection. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to tennis shoes, sleeping bags and hats, the Fujitas' traveling 
gear includes nets, jars and a generator. "We use the generator lights to 
attract insects at night," David Fujita said. Besides hands-on experience, 
James has acquired much of his expertise through books. An avid reader, James 
returned all of his Toys R Us presents one Christmas to the store and used the 
money to buy books, his father said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of fun reading and I learn a lot," James said. 
</P>
<P>
 James has also learned about people from observing insects. "I learned 
teamwork from the leaf-cutter ants," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After they collect tiny pieces of leaves, the older ants hold the baby ants in 
their jaws so the babies can spit a kind of glue-like substance that attaches 
the pieces of leaves together. They use the attached leaves to grow their food, 
a kind of fungus, James explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of cool," he said. "Insects have interesting habits." 
</P>
<P>
 But James is not the quiet and studious kid that one may expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not an aloof kid who just spends a lot of time studying," Schuler said. 
"He has a lot of friends and it is easy to talk to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing the piano and swimming are some of James' other interests. Lately, he 
began to lift weights. "I am trying to get in better shape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A polite and friendly child, James said he has not experienced any pressure 
from his classmates and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friends show a lot of support," James said. "Often, they come back from a 
trip with bugs for me." 
</P>
<P>
 But does this young scientist want to be an entomologist when he grows up? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not necessarily," he said. "There are many possibilities, and I will play it 
by ear."

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Job Training Policy Council of Ventura County is conducting interviews to 
determine who will get about 1,200 minimum-wage jobs up for grabs this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the temporary jobs will not be available until July, prospective 
workers must apply now to be considered, said Dennis Holloway, a job-training 
recruitment specialist."It's first-come, first-served," he said. "People need 
to make appointments now." 
</P>
<P>
 Council staff will be accepting appointments for interviews for the next two 
months, he said. To make an appointment, call 981-8530. 
</P>
<P>
 The full-time jobs will last six to eight weeks and pay $4.25 an hour, 
Holloway said. They are funded through a federal jobs program and are available 
primarily to youths from poor families, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The positions include jobs in city and school district offices, parks and 
recreation departments and public libraries. KAY SAILLANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER EXPANDED BOUNDARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a proposal to help fast-track a development of 330 townhouses in western 
Ventura, the City Council today will consider a plan to significantly stretch 
the downtown boundaries to include the Ventura Avenue area. 
</P>
<P>
 A City Council subcommittee is recommending expanding the boundaries of 
downtown more than 20 blocks north of West Park Row Avenue to Delaware Drive, 
which would encompass the entire upper Avenue neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But a majority of council members say they want downtown housing to be a 
priority over the Avenue and are worried that the committee's proposal would 
siphon away housing allocations for downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the new boundaries would permit developers in the upper Avenue 
area to immediately apply for and receive housing allocations. Developers must 
receive housing allocations before they are permitted to build. Developers 
outside the downtown and Avenue area must wait until April to apply and must 
compete against each other for limited allocations. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal by the Neel and Huntsinger families of Ventura, along with the 
possible expansion of Kinko's copy service's headquarters, would dramatically 
change the character of the upper Avenue industrial neighborhood north of 
Stanley Avenue and west of Ventura Avenue. The proposed development would have 
330 townhouses and business offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing committee is also recommending adding 200 housing units to the 500 
units already allocated for the city's downtown area. City leaders, who plan to 
revitalize downtown, want to encourage developers to build apartments and 
condominiums in the area. PEGGY Y. LEE

<P>
 A scientist from Jet Propulsion Laboratory will give a free talk at Ventura 
College today on the predicted collision later this year of a large comet with 
Jupiter. 
</P>
<P>
 Comet Shoemaker-Levy was identified a year ago and is expected to hit Jupiter 
in July, college officials said.At the forum, scheduled to start at 7 p.m. in 
the college theater, Paul Weissman will discuss the predicted resulting blast 
and what astronomers will look for. 
</P>
<P>
 Weissman will show pictures of the comet and describe how it came into being, 
said David Doreo, an associate professor in physics and astronomy. 
</P>
<P>
 As a scientist at Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Pasadena offices, Weissman has 
done considerable research into the origin and evolution of comets in the solar 
system. KAY SAILLANT

<P>
 A 43-year-old Silver Strand man has been arrested on suspicion of kidnaping, 
child molestation, false imprisonment and producing child pornography in a case 
involving two children, authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators arrested Jack Steven Sobonya at his home in the 
unincorporated beach community Saturday after the children's parents contacted 
deputies, Senior Deputy Joe Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said Sobonya allegedly befriended the children, ages 12 and 9, in 
February by offering to take them fishing, with the permission of their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 He is accused of later molesting one of the youngsters and videotaping the 
children for pornographic films. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said one of the children told a parent about the alleged encounters 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The child's parents then contacted sheriff's deputies, who took Sobonya into 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said Sobonya remained in custody Sunday at Ventura County Jail in lieu 
of $50,000 bail. J. E. MITCHELL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VOLUNTEERS HELP MONITOR NURSING HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary White chats easily with the 20 or so elderly women gathered in a 
recreation room at Maywood Acres Healthcare Center, but her trained eyes are 
always alert for signs of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the women's clothes clean? Is their hair groomed? Any unexplained bruises 
or injuries? Does someone seem upset about something? 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is anything wrong, they will tell me because I'm their friend," said 
White, who was been making weekly visits to the Oxnard nursing home for five 
years. "They might not want to complain to an administrator." 
</P>
<P>
 White is one of 28 volunteers with Long Term Care Services of Ventura County, 
a watchdog group empowered by the state to monitor and investigate complaints 
of abuse in nursing and senior residential care homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ombudsmen such as White meet with nursing home administrators when a complaint 
is made and try to resolve the problem, said Susan Miller, coordinator for the 
program. Most complaints are minor. Food may be cold or medicines delivered 
late. 
</P>
<P>
 Program volunteers also make sure that the seniors' privacy rights are adhered 
to and that they are properly groomed. On rare occasions, the problems are more 
serious, such as malnutrition or untreated medical conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Most often, though, White says she spends most of her time simply talking to 
residents for a few minutes each. White visits four residential care homes once 
a month, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every one of the seniors I've met are special in their own way," she said. 
"They have become my friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County has about 90 facilities that serve the elderly, Miller said, 
and the need for volunteer ombudsmen is growing as the county's senior 
population swells. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are supervised during 36 hours of training and then are assigned to 
make regular visits to the care facilities, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides receiving and investigating complaints, Long Term Care Services offers 
counseling to help families deal with the emotional issue of putting a family 
member in a home and to explain what they can expect, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 White, who declined to give her age, said she decided to become an ombudsmen 
in 1989 after selling houses for a living for many years. Betty Merrifield, 73, 
has been an ombudsman for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Both said they gain tremendous satisfaction from aiding the elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's a terribly important program," said Merrifield, who is a retired 
social service worker. "A lot of these people don't have anyone who cares." KAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES EXPECTED BY MIDDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A slow-moving storm that dropped just enough rain Sunday to muss Ventura 
County drivers' windshields and thwart outdoor plans is expected to give way to 
clearing, partly cloudy skies today, forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
 But during today's early morning hours, commuters may still encounter some 
light drizzle or rain with an occasional thundershower before the system moves 
out of the county, according to Bruce Thoren, a meteorologist with WeatherData, 
a firm that provides forecasts to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fairly small system that broke off from a larger storm system out over 
the Pacific," Thoren said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why it's somewhat weak and pretty slow-moving. Most of Ventura County 
should be experiencing partly cloudy skies by the time lunch rolls around." 
</P>
<P>
 Thoren said today's daytime temperatures will hover in the low to mid-60s in 
most parts of the county, with nighttime lows dropping to the upper 40s. 
Daytime winds will remain mostly calm but will carry occasional gusts of up to 
15 m.p.h. in the late afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-range forecasts call for a dry period at least until the weekend. Another 
storm may move into the area Sunday or Monday, Thoren said. J. E. MITCHELL

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: APPLICATIONS SOUGHT FOR GRAND JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials of the Ventura County jury services office are now soliciting 
applications from people who want to serve on the 1994-95 Ventura County grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury services Supervisor Sandy Hatmaker said her department is behind in the 
number of qualified applicants it usually has by this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need lots of applicants," she said Thursday. "We have about 40 at this 
time. We've just now started advertising to accumulate the pool for this year. 
But we will need at least 150 to 200 applicants to draw from." 
</P>
<P>
 Hatmaker said people interested in serving on next year's grand jury should be 
willing to spend about 40 hours a week working on the panel, which is charged 
with investigating government services as well as indicting suspects in felony 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors receive a daily $20 stipend, plus 15 cents a mile for travel costs. 
Most of their work is performed at the County Government Center in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications for service on the grand jury must be received by the jury 
services office before the end of March, Hatmaker said. For more information, 
call 654-5025. 
</P>
<P>
 After background checks by investigators from the district attorney's office, 
a panel of judges will whittle down the applicants to a pool of 30. The new 
grand jury will be impaneled on July 1. JEFF McDONALD

<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council today will consider applying for $53,000 in state 
funds to extend a city bicycle trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would be used to extend the Arroyo Simi Bicycle Trail from the 
Metrolink station on Los Angeles Avenue east to Corriganville Park. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the council, the application will be considered by the Ventura 
County Transportation Commission, which will dole out about $271,000 in state 
funds next year for pedestrian and bike projects throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past several years, Simi Valley has used state funds for bike paths 
along the Arroyo Simi and the Kadota Fig Drain. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; REZONING FOR ARTS CENTER TO BE DECIDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council will decide today whether to rezone land at 
Church and School streets to allow a cultural arts center project to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 The land, now planned in part for residential use, would have to be rezoned 
for commercial use to allow conversion of an aging church into a 300-seat 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission in February approved the rezoning, and Councilwoman 
Judy Mikels said she expected the council to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just to make sure we've got the right zoning," Mikels said. "We're 
already moving forward on this project." 
</P>
<P>
 Initial approval to design and plan the center was granted by the council in 
August. Renovation is expected to cost the city $2.8 million. When completed, 
the center will include a theater, banquet hall and 78-space parking lot. SARA

DUCKS LOSE MORE THAN JUST A GAME; HOCKEY: THEY ALSO GIVE UP MORE GROUND IN 
PLAYOFF RACE, AS THEY FALL, 6-0, TO SHARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Mighty Ducks' berth in the Stanley Cup playoffs ends up being their 
La-Z-Boys, this is the game they will remember. 
</P>
<P>
 They came into their final game against the San Jose Sharks this season saying 
it was probably their biggest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 They left with their worst defeat yet, a 6-0 loss at San Jose Arena in front 
of a sellout-crowd of 17,190 that started a jubilant "Playoffs! Playoffs!" 
chant in the final minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was basically over in 20 minutes, and the margin of defeat was a club 
record -- one goal worse than their 7-2 opening-night loss to the Detroit Red 
Wings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were ready," Coach Ron Wilson said. "I think the players thought 
we were ready. San Jose was just more ready, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 Win this one, and the Ducks would have trailed the Sharks by one point with 17 
games remaining in the race for the eighth and final Western Conference playoff 
spot. Instead they trail by five, with the Kings another point behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have gone 0-6 against the conference rival they would have been 
voted most likely to beat -- and they are 0-10 against the Sharks and Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Going into the game, we were looking at it as a life-or-death thing," forward 
Garry Valk said. "After the game, you like to look for positives. There are 17 
games left. We're not written off yet." 
</P>
<P>
 They didn't get the game they said they had to have. Now they're looking for 
hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost six to these guys and four to L.A., and we're still right in the 
hunt," Terry Yake said. "I predict, give us five or eight games and we'll be 
right back within a point of them." 
</P>
<P>
 But he knows the math is catching up to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're down to 17 games. If we win 10 of them, that's 20 points. That means 
they've got to win seven of 18. They've got a game in hand. It makes it a 
tougher road for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty minutes after the game started, the Ducks trailed, 3-0. Wilson 
responded by pulling goalie Guy Hebert for Mikhail Shtalenkov at the start of 
the second period in a futile attempt to change the momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty minutes later, they were behind, 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks got scorched by the line of Igor Larionov and Sergei Makarov -- two 
aging former Soviet superstars -- and Johan Garpenlov, who is Swedish. Makarov 
and defenseman Sandis Ozolinsh each scored two goals, and those two and 
Larionov each had a club-record four points -- a feat Larionov and Makarov had 
duplicated in a victory over the Ducks in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing with the defense pair of Ozolinsh, another former Soviet, and Jeff 
Norton, the line gives San Jose a fearsome fivesome that can win a game alone. 
The unit basically did that Sunday, with a little help from goalie Arturs Irbe, 
a Latvian who made 25 saves to record the fourth shutout of his career and his 
second this season against the Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 One statistic gives ample testimony to how much Larionov means to the Sharks. 
He has missed 35 games this season, and the Sharks won only two of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks were focusing on the Larionov line, but it didn't make any 
difference. The Europeans' playmaking and passing finesse left the Ducks 
looking helpless, and the Sharks took advantage of the Ducks' excitement by 
burning them with faked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "All our players were afraid of them tonight," Wilson said. "They were 
intimidated by Larionov and Makarov, who are two great hockey players, but we 
still haven't figured out a way to play against them." 
</P>
<P>
 A victory would have made the world look a lot different. 
</P>
<P>
 "It definitely would have been a big boost," center Bob Corkum said. "It was a 
tough loss, no doubt about it. The reality is we have 17 games left. We've just 
got to pull up our pants and shake this one off and be ready Tuesday against 
Chicago."

MIKE PENNER: MIGHTY DUCKS ARE DEFINITELY LACKING OV-ERALL 
</P>

<P>
 The last time this happened -- Duck pate on ice, served as a tasty Shark 
hors-d'oeuvre -- San Jose assistant coach Drew Remenda shook his head in 
sympathy for old friend, old boss and current Mighty Ducks general manager, 
Jack Ferreira. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poor Jack," Remenda muttered. He knew how much these games meant to Ferreira, 
who was fired in San Jose two years ago, and how it had to be killing Ferreira 
to watch his new team fall to 0-5 against the Sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 That was seven weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was the word Sunday after San Jose made the scoreboard and the season 
series read the same -- Sharks 6, Ducks 0? 
</P>
<P>
 How about lucky Jack? 
</P>
<P>
 Ferreira never saw this one, by the grace of his travel agent. By the time the 
puck was dropped inside here, soon to wind up in the netting behind Ducks 
goalie Guy Hebert, Ferreira was half a world away, somewhere in Russia, 
scouting a bunch of players who -- if Ferreira knows what's best for his team 
-- have last names that end in ov.  
</P>
<P>
 Makarov. 
</P>
<P>
 Larionov. 
</P>
<P>
 Garpenlov. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're looking for reasons why the Ducks will finish their first season 
winless against the Sharks, and why the Sharks now lead the Ducks by five 
points in the race for the playoffs, those are three pretty good ones. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you're looking for another? Arturs Irbe, San Jose goalie by way of 
Riga, Latvia, who shut out the Ducks for the second time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 One more? How about Sandis Ozolinsh, also from Riga, whose two goals Sunday 
made him the first Shark defenseman to score 20 goals in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks call their opulent new home, rather blandly, "San Jose Arena." "The 
Russia House" is more to the point, what with all the former Red Army soldiers 
zipping around the place in teal and silver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm covering the Moscow Dynamo," cracked one Bay Area reporter, 
trying not to get trampled by the foreign syllables. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei Makarov, the Gretzky of 1980s Soviet hockey, scored the first goal 
Sunday, assisted on the second and third and drove home the fifth -- all within 
the game's opening 27 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Igor Larionov, the Voskresensk Flash (easy for him to say), assisted on three 
goals and Johan Garpenlov, who further confuses the issue, contributed a goal 
and an assist. Garpenlov sounds like a Russian name but his media-guide bio 
insists that his birthplace is Stockholm, Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Or at least that's the word according to Garpenlov. 
</P>
<P>
 So if you want to know what's holding back the Ducks, there you have it: A 
serious lack of ovs.  
</P>
<P>
 Might Alexei Kasatonov, the Ducks' injured all-star defenseman, have helped 
the cause? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh no," Ducks Coach Ron Wilson said. "Kasatonov actually plays worse against 
them. He's afraid of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson did, however, try Mikhail Shtalenkov, his backup goaltender, after 
Hebert skated off the ice seeing flashes. Red flashes, three of them, coming 
one right after another in the game's first 17 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Shtalenkov knew the language, but that's about it. Soon, he, too, was studying 
frozen rubber. Ozolinsh scored on him five minutes into the second period, 
followed by Makarov two minutes later, followed by Todd Elik -- a rarity among 
Sharks; he's from Canada -- in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-0 loss was the worst of the Ducks' season, in margin of defeat and 
timing. Wilson had called this game the most important of the year, but before 
the first period was over, he could begin formulating his postgame spin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just one game," Wilson said in the hall outside the visiting dressing room. 
"A big game, sure, but just a game. . . . I mean, we're still only five points 
back. It's not like we're 30 points back." 
</P>
<P>
 No, but take a gander at this math, Ducks: 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose's 6-0 season sweep of the Ducks represents a 24-point swing in the 
standings. Twenty-four points -- as many as the 1992-93 Sharks managed all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Duck Quotient has transformed the Sharks from the worst outfit this side 
of Ottawa to playoff contenders. Take away the Ducks and those six victories 
and San Jose has 48 points -- fewer than Hartford and Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, suppose the Ducks had gone 2-4 instead of 0-6 against San Jose. Not an 
outlandish thought; the first four games were decided by one goal. Had the 
Ducks beaten the Sharks just twice, they today would hold the eighth playoff 
spot in the Western Conference with 59 points. San Jose would be three points 
behind at 56. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if, what if," Ducks captain Troy Loney grumbled as he tried to pedal off 
the frustration on an exercise bicycle. "What if we won all the games we've 
lost by one goal, too? We could talk about that forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The teams are more evenly matched, Loney claimed, than 0-6 would suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like that one line kills us all the time," Loney said, referring to 
the Makarov-Larionov-Garpenlov line. "When you play against a line like that, 
all five of your guys have to be on the same page. I think we just lack a 
little confidence when that line's out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert had to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their other lines have some scorers, but they're mainly just hard-nosed 
workers, similar to most of our lines," Hebert said. "But when that one line 
gets on the ice, everyone in the arena is aware. They're the ones who make the 
big plays. The stat sheet reads the same every night." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Sharks play the Ducks, it does. That's why Ferreira is dragging his 
suitcase around in a different hemisphere, looking for some big names, some 
long names, to rectify this ov ful situation.

SAMPRAS TAKES THE FIFTH, WINS VERDICT FROM KORDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A less-than-stellar performance was good enough for Pete Sampras to win the 
Newsweek Champions Cup on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under threatening skies and being threatened by Petr Korda, the world's No. 1 
player came from behind for a 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory, before 10,036 at 
Hyatt Grand Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 The title was the third of the year for Sampras, who earned $245,000 to boost 
his 1994 earnings to more than $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the affable Korda addressed the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really deserves to be No. 1 in the world right now," he said, nodding 
toward Sampras. "I tried my best today, but it wasn't enough. Pete, for sure 
I'm going to be around when you have a bad day." 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't the day, but Sampras wasn't at his best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played well all week and didn't play quite so well today," Sampras said, 
"but I managed to get through it." 
</P>
<P>
 The longer it went, the more confident Sampras felt. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order for him to beat me, he was going to have to play three really good 
sets because I wasn't going to give it to him, even though I was making quite a 
bit of errors," Sampras said. "When I got into the fifth set, I felt like I had 
him because he got a little down on himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could just see the way he was carrying himself in the first couple of 
games. He was a little down and he was going for some really, really 
low-percentage shots. I just knew that if I could get on top of him early in 
the fifth. . . . He's not going to fold, but I liked my chances." 
</P>
<P>
 So did Korda. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that if I wanted to beat him, I have to beat him in straight sets, or 
in four sets, because I felt tired," Korda said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10th-seeded Korda, from the Czech Republic, gave it his best shot as 
Sampras started slowly, losing his serve in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't hitting the ball that well in the first set," Sampras said. "I 
really felt like he was dictating the play. I didn't really have a great read 
on his serve, and when I got his serve back, he was on top of me. And that's 
not really the way I want to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Against Petr, you just have to hang in there and hopefully, he can miss the 
shots. And that's what he did." 
</P>
<P>
 But not until after he won two of the first three sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't make the break points in the beginning of the fourth set," said 
Korda, who squandered two break points each in the first and third games, "and 
after that time, he started to hit balls much better. He hit a couple winners 
and he was on a roll at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "And in the fifth set, he was just better than I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras broke Korda in the eighth game of the fourth set and in the first and 
fifth games of the fifth to finally take control. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got your highs and lows in a long match like that, but I don't mind," 
said Sampras, who needed 3 hours 8 minutes to finish it. "I feel that in a 
longer match, the better player should win." 
</P>
<P>
 As he did on this day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy that I hung in there and didn't quit," Sampras said. "This is good 
for me, because I didn't play nearly as well as I did against Stefan (Edberg, 
in the semifinals). It was an off-day that turned better and better as the 
match wore on." 
</P>
<P>
 It ended with Sampras winning his first Champions Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good comeback," he said. "It's not the best comeback I've had in my 
career, but it's definitely up there." Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Petr Korda earned $129,000. . . . Pete Sampras had 71 aces in the tournament, 
23 in the final. . . . Sampras has played in five tournaments this year, 
winning three and being eliminated in the first round in Qatar and 
Philadelphia. . . . Patrick Galbraith and Grant Connell upset the top-seeded 
pair of Byron Black and Jonathan Stark, 7-5, 6-3, to win the doubles title. The 
winners split $98,000, the losers $52,000. . . . Attendance for the tournament 
was a record 103,057. Average attendance was 10,155 for seven day sessions and 
6,395 for five night sessions.

WASTE MAKES WANT FOR KINGS AFTER 3-3 TIE WITH CHICAGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even hours before he learned the San Jose Sharks' score, King goaltender Kelly 
Hrudey was talking about lost opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings are desperately seeking points anywhere they can find them. And one 
was snatched away on Sunday afternoon in the final 2:04 of regulation when 
Chicago's Jocelyn Lemieux scored on a rebound as he was parked near the crease, 
pulling the Blackhawks to a 3-3 tie with the Kings before 18,472 at Chicago 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of heading back to Los Angeles with two points from a victory, the 
Kings lost ground in the race for the final playoff spot in the Western 
Conference. Eighth-place San Jose, which beat the Mighty Ducks on Sunday, 
opened up a six-point lead on the 10th-place Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all realize the seriousness of our position," said Hrudey, who faced 45 
shots. "But there are two schools of thought. One is it's a tough building and 
we tied. The second, which it should be, is we lost one point we desperately 
needed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the other quest, Wayne Gretzky remained three goals from tying Gordie 
Howe's NHL record of 801. Gretzky was pointless and had only one shot on goal, 
in the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 He has never scored against Chicago goaltender Ed Belfour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strength of my career is I've always taken what's thrown at me," Gretzky 
said. "They came at me hard -- (Chris) Chelios and (Brent) Sutter. When they 
did (come at me), someone else would be open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had one good chance early in the third, and Belfour made the save. Other 
than that, they did a pretty good job on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Chicago Coach Darryl Sutter: "He got a lot of ice time. He's a dangerous 
guy out there. He's responsible for half of their offense. I'm just glad we 
only have to play him two more times this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky's teammates didn't start quickly, either. These days, the Kings seem 
incapable of stringing together three solid periods of hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, the opening period was the big stumbling block. They managed only five 
shots, and the fourth didn't come until 3:44 remained in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago outshot the Kings, 44-22, in regulation and finished with a 45-24 
lead. The Kings' best line was left wing Luc Robitaille (one goal, one assist), 
center Robert Lang (one goal, one assist) and right wing John Druce (one 
assist). Defenseman Charlie Huddy scored the other King goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky has not scored in consecutive games, and it appears he might pass Howe 
during a three-game home stand at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that his excitement over the record might be making him press 
a bit on the ice. His father, Walter, called him last week to tell him to quit 
dragging it out. 
</P>
<P>
 This hasn't been the easiest week for Gretzky. His business partner and 
friend, comic actor John Candy, died on Friday. Gretzky, Candy and King owner 
Bruce McNall had purchased the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football 
League in 1991, and the three were often spotted on the sideline at games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very sad day," Gretzky said. "John was John. He was a genuinely nice 
man. My thoughts are with his family." King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Among those in attendance were prospective owner Joe Cohen, who was on the 
Wayne Gretzky watch during the three-game trip. King owner Bruce McNall, who 
attended a couple of coin auctions last week in Europe, joined the team in 
Chicago on Saturday.

MIKE DOWNEY: BRUINS NEVER LUGE, ER, LOSE IF HE'S THERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's see. Last time I checked in on UCLA, I had the gall to write that the 
Bruins should be ranked No. 1 in all of college basketball, for which I was 
roundly hooted and ridiculed. Yeah, you know us media jerks, always being so 
damned positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I left the country for a month to watch Tonya post up Nancy. And UCLA 
lost, and lost, and lost and lost. Only nobody noticed in Norway, because over 
there they don't know the Wizard of Westwood from the Wizard of Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, by the time I got home, people here in California were doing so much 
trashing of Jim Harrick's players, I thought they might need to be recycled. I 
was led to believe that UCLA had been beaten by everybody but Cal State 
Bakersfield and the Jamaican bobsled team. Number 1 in the country?!?! Downey, 
you dummy! They can't even beat Notre Dame!  
</P>
<P>
 So, I had no clue what to expect Sunday when the 10th-ranked-and-climbing 
Louisville Cardinals came flapping into town to play the 15th-and-falling 
Bruins. Imagine my surprise when David Boyle and Rodney Zimmerman took the 
floor for the opening tipoff. I turned to the guy next to me and said, "Man, 
Harrick really did shake up his lineup, didn't he?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Nah," the guy said. "Senior day." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahhh. Senior day. This is a sweet and traditional gesture on many a college 
campus, the NCAA equivalent of letting every Little Leaguer spend at least one 
inning in right field. I like senior day. Senior day is a nice idea. Senior day 
is a day when somebody pins a corsage on Mom and strolls arm-in-arm onto the 
court with Dad, and then everybody in the crowd gets to stand and applaud. It's 
so corny, even Nancy Kerrigan would like it. 
</P>
<P>
 The only potential downside of senior day is when the other team runs out and 
mops up the floor with your seniors before you can give them the hook back to 
the bench. Which is pretty much what happened to Harrick when he got that "why 
me?" look on his face and saw on the scoreboard that his team was getting the 
stuffing kicked out of it by Denny Crum's bunch, 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyle is a nice young man whom I hadn't seen since he was hustled into the 
Michigan game at last year's NCAA regionals with one tick of the clock left in 
overtime, so he could hurl the basketball as far as he knew how to Ed O'Bannon 
from out of bounds. He is probably one of those college players who could have 
averaged about 31 points per game for Bakersfield and gone on to play CBA ball 
for the Rapid City Rapid Transits or the Albany Cartoons, or whatever they're 
called. The young man does have ability. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, he missed a breakaway layup to open Sunday's game, and by the 
time his coach was able to hurry George Zidek and Charles O'Bannon over to the 
scorer's table, UCLA was in big trouble. When Boyle and Zimmerman went to the 
bench, 2:38 into the game, the Bruins still did not have a point. After 3:48, 
the Bruins still did not have a basket. After nearly 5 1/2 minutes, the Bruins 
had a total of five points.  
</P>
<P>
 "You know what?" I said to the guy next to me. "I think I hate senior day." 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, everything turned out OK. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon, who is one fine player, let me tell you, led a big, big comeback. 
Brother Charles was in there, too, chucking in 17 points and 11 boards. Shon 
Tarver, who got off exactly as many shots before halftime as David Boyle, 
contributed a much better second half. Zidek drew a big, big foul with 40 
seconds remaining and put the game on ice with a free throw and a rebound. And 
UCLA was a winner, same as I remember from January, 75-72. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, all the idiots who got on UCLA's case were called, pretty 
appropriately, I thought, "idiotic" by Louisville's Crum, who seemed more 
annoyed about that than he did about losing. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you people that are knocking the Bruins, you don't know anything about 
basketball," went Denny's grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
 "SC on the road, Cal on the road, Arizona on the road . . . to be critical of 
UCLA losing to those kind of teams is idiotic." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. So support UCLA and don't be an idiot. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick had his own way of putting it. 
</P>
<P>
 He said, "The road is ugly and nasty."  
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. More food for thought, you critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Critics are only in the mind of the beholder," Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. So let me close by saying that UCLA still looks to me like it might be 
the No. 1 team in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I don't spend all that much time in this country.

LOS ANGELES MARATHON; 'RABBIT' SIMPLY KEEPS GOING, AND GOING . . .; RUNNING: 
UTAH'S PILKINGTON WAS EXPECTED TO SET THE PACE AND THEN DROP OUT. BUT HE 
COULDN'T FIND A REASON TO STOP. 
</P>

<P>
 He was paid to run fast, but not too fast. 
</P>
<P>
 He was paid to run far, but not too far. 
</P>
<P>
 Quick but harmless, Paul Pilkington was known to Los Angeles Marathon runners 
Sunday as the "rabbit." 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody else was supposed to win. For $3,000, Pilkington was supposed to 
quit. 
</P>
<P>
 But with nearly a two-minute lead and 10 miles remaining, Pilkington's legs 
had other ideas. Or was that his pride? 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever, the rabbit pulled a marathon out of his hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Delighting spectators and shocking elite runners by refusing to quit as 
expected after 15.5 miles, American Pilkington led from the start and hung on 
to win the ninth annual race by 39 seconds over Italy's Luca Barzaghi. 
</P>
<P>
 On a cool, cloudy morning, Pilkington led the 19,000 competitors over the 
26.2-mile course in 2 hours 12 minutes 13 seconds, the fourth-fastest winning 
time in race history. 
</P>
<P>
 He was joined in front of the Coliseum about 16 minutes later by an emotional 
Olga Appell. 
</P>
<P>
 Running only nine days after becoming a United States citizen, Appell won the 
women's race by nearly nine minutes to chants of "Go U.S.A." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in nine years that the men's and women's winners in one 
of the big three marathons -- New York, Boston, Los Angeles -- were U.S. 
citizens at the time of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the first time in recent memory that the second-place finisher was 
convinced he had finished first. 
</P>
<P>
 Barzaghi, a pre-race favorite, fell so far behind Pilkington during the final 
miles that he could no longer see him. He figured Pilkington had dropped out of 
the race -- as promised, according to Barzaghi -- so he slowed. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Barzaghi crossed the finish line, he had already chosen the color 
of his new car. He raised his arms. He smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 He was wondering where all the cameras were when a silver medal was draped 
around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 He then learned that the athlete who is paid only to set a fast pace and block 
the wind for the better runners actually kept running. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the rabbit had dropped out; nobody told me he was still running. I 
thought I won," Barzaghi said angrily through an interpreter. "I was keeping my 
own pace. I was not running against him." 
</P>
<P>
 So began one of the more bizarre post-race chapters in this marathon's 
history. By the time the participants had finally gone home, there were more 
strained jaw muscles than hamstrings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians derided Pilkington: 
</P>
<P>
 "The rabbit is supposed to drop out of the race, it's not fair, and we're 
going to do something about it," said Eugene Colombo of Pasadena, who served as 
Barzaghi's interpreter. "Luca had no idea what was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pilkington's agent, Bob Wood: 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be smart enough to know you aren't in first place. Hey, man, 
get a brain. I know they give split times at this race. What, these guys can't 
read, either? Those comments are bush league." 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians, in the middle of a news conference, also criticized Anne 
Roberts, coordinator of marathon elite athletes: 
</P>
<P>
 "Anne told us before the race that the rabbit would be dropping out after 25K 
(kilometers), absolutely," Colombo said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the back of the room, Roberts responded: "I never said that." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Colombo: "Yes, you said it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Roberts: "I never said it. It's not true." 
</P>
<P>
 However, third-place finisher Andrzej Krzyscin of Poland and 11th-place 
finisher Danny Gonzales of Anaheim, both of whom ran in the pack with Barzaghi, 
agreed with the Italian. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a technical meeting (Saturday), we were told that the rabbit was going to 
drop at 25K," Gonzales said. "I'm thrilled for Paul, but that is what we were 
told." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts claimed that she would never have made that promise, and Pilkington 
said he never would have signed a contract containing that promise. 
</P>
<P>
 "In every race, the rabbit always has the option of staying in the race," 
Pilkington said. "It doesn't happen very much, but it's always possible." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Pilkington, 35, acknowledged that he has dropped out of each of the 
five previous marathons he has run as a rabbit, including twice in New York and 
last year here. 
</P>
<P>
 "But today, after I did my job by getting out fast, nobody came after me," 
said Pilkington, who won his first marathon in four years. "I couldn't believe 
nobody closed the gap. I figured as long as I was out there and feeling good, 
why stop?" 
</P>
<P>
 He was buoyed by the knowledge that for the first time, this race was 
considered the U.S. Track and Field men's marathon championship. 
</P>
<P>
 When running partner Ed Eyestone suffered a groin injury Friday, Pilkington 
knew he had a chance at the $12,000 bonus for winning the national title in 
addition to $15,000 prize money and the car. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I did what I was paid to do, I knew I had a chance at more," he said. "I 
just got more and more relaxed. And nobody seemed to be able to go with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he has any regrets about being a rabbit, nor will this controversy 
cause him to retire from that strange duty. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, for those runners who live on the outskirts of fame or who are 
training for other races, it is a nice way to make a buck. 
</P>
<P>
 "You serve a purpose, races can use you," he said of his role. "It's all part 
of my trying to make a living as an athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 Pilkington, who lives in northern Utah, also makes a living teaching troubled 
teen-agers. He walked away from the Coliseum on Sunday worrying about making an 
8:30 a.m. writing class at Washington High in Roy, Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Unusual for winners of this race, he will keep the luxury car. It will replace 
a van that has nearly 100,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 And about that white glove he wore on his left hand, his only apparent 
concession to fashion? He wears it not because of Michael Jackson, but because 
of asthma. An inhaler is stuck inside the glove. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he needed it Sunday. Leading from start to finish, one tends to 
breath easy. 
</P>
<P>
 On another dizzying day in marathon history, he was the only one. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the race, the photographers kept wanting to drive back from Paul and 
shoot the real runners," said Bill Burke, marathon president, describing the 
scene on the course. "By the 20-mile mark, it was great fun to find them and 
say, 'Hey, guys, guess what -- the winner is really up there!' "

LIGHTS, CAMERAS AND UCLA ACTION AT LAST; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: BRUINS FEELING 
GOOD AFTER BEATING LOUISVILLE ON NATIONAL TELEVISION, 75-72. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At Pauley Pavilion on Sunday afternoon, a loud, harmonic tone resonated inside 
the bald head of Ed O'Bannon, who identified it quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Positive vibes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Good vibrations being what they are, it was a bunch of giddy Bruins who 
accepted a 75-72 victory over 10th-ranked Louisville, then started thinking 
about what it all meant. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it keep the critics off Coach Jim Harrick's back? Would it keep them in 
the West Regional? Would it keep them from having to take a trip to Oregon for 
two games this week? 
</P>
<P>
 No is the answer to all the questions, but for UCLA, there is no bad news. The 
result of one game is that the Bruins are now actually digging those good 
vibrations. Who knows, maybe the Beach Boys will show up and sit on the bench 
in Corvallis. 
</P>
<P>
 After Oregon State and Oregon comes the NCAA tournament, which suddenly 
doesn't look like such a bad idea for UCLA, 20-5 and feeling good about itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a really big win," Tyus Edney said. "It's good for our confidence to 
know we can beat a good team." 
</P>
<P>
 In their recent style, the Bruins did it the hard way. They fell behind, 11-1, 
in less than four minutes, trailed by four at the half, came from behind in the 
last two minutes and needed Greg Minor to miss a potential game-tying 
three-pointer with four seconds left to win. 
</P>
<P>
 However anyone else looked at it, it was beautiful to Harrick. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the defense and emotion we had early in the year," said Harrick, who 
added that he thinks the Bruins could nail down a No. 3 or No. 4 seeding in 
some region if they sweep the Oregon schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon isn't sure where UCLA is going to play at tournament time, but he 
is certain of one thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I do know is, I'm going to get on a plane and go somewhere to play," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a sellout crowd of 12,243 in UCLA's final home game, O'Bannon and his 
brother Charles clearly came to Pauley to play. First, it was Ed's turn. He 
kept the Bruins close with 15 points and seven rebounds in the first half, 
which ended with a 38-34 Louisville lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was Charles. He had 11 of his 17 points and eight of his 11 rebounds 
in the second half and made the biggest play of the game in the stretch run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals, with 6-foot-9 Clifford Rozier continuing to be a major irritant 
inside, scored on five consecutive possessions to take a 68-63 lead with 7:19 
to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville (24-5) was still ahead, 72-71, when Edney got the ball to Charles 
O'Bannon for a dunk with 1:49 left. Then, after Rozier threw the ball away, he 
fouled George Zidek, who made the first of two free throws for a 74-72 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Zidek missed the second one, but O'Bannon slipped inside the lane and got a 
hand on the ball, batting it to Zidek. Edney made one of two free throws for a 
three-point UCLA lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny Crum called a timeout with 16 seconds left and drew up a play, but with 
Shon Tarver close by, Minor missed his three-point attempt and the ball bounced 
away as the clock ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Crum: "That's just what happens sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar things have been happening on occasion to the Bruins, and Ed O'Bannon 
said he thought he might be seeing it again when Louisville took a 16-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was scared," he said. "I thought, 'Here we are on national TV, and we're 
going to get blown out again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But these were negative vibes, not at all acceptable. Rozier, who scored 24 
points but wasn't nearly as effective when UCLA put a defender in front of him, 
said the Bruins are better than he thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "They surprised me, especially how hard they hit the boards," he said. "When 
both O'Bannons are playing like they did this time, they'll be tough to beat. 
Come tournament time, I think they'll be all right."

KERRIGAN PASSING UP BIG MEET; SKATING: ASSOCIATION BEMOANS MOVE BY OLYMPIC 
SILVER MEDALIST TO WITHDRAW FROM WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS IN JAPAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nancy Kerrigan will withdraw from this month's World Figure Skating 
Championships, forfeiting her berth to first alternate Michelle Kwan of 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has been pretty exhausted and she just felt that she's had a good 
Olympics," Kerrigan's coach, Evy Scotvold, told the Associated Press. "And I 
think we all thought she deserved a rest if she wanted to. And I think it's 
hard to get up for another competition so soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan has informed U.S. Figure Skating Assn. officials of her intention, 
but the group is waiting for written notification before announcing it, sources 
told The Times Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Another had said that Kerrigan might change her mind about the March 22-27 
competition in Chiba, Japan, if she believed dropping out would further damage 
her image -- which has suffered because of a series of public relations gaffes 
since she won the silver medal in the Winter Olympics 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those was her leaving Norway before the closing ceremony and appearing 
at Disney World on the same day the flame was extinguished at Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 At a parade to honor her Sunday in Stoneham, Mass., her mother, Brenda 
Kerrigan, said security considerations led the family to leave early. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some threats on her life," she said. "(Nancy) did not know about 
it until last night. . . . We made the decision because the closing ceremonies 
are filled with so many people, to leave early, not to have more of a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 When they learned during the Olympics that Kerrigan was leaning toward 
withdrawing from the World Championships, USFSA officials were dismayed because 
of the potential impact that could have on the development of women's figure 
skating in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 They consider Kerrigan their best hope for a women's medal, which the United 
States needs in order to be able to send three women to the 1995 World 
Championships in Birmingham, England. 
</P>
<P>
 If no U.S. woman finishes among the top three in Chiba, the United States will 
be limited to two competitors next year. That was the situation this year for 
both the Olympics and the World Championships after the United States' best 
finish in the 1993 World Championships was Kerrigan's fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy is under no obligation because she has taken no USFSA money this year," 
USFSA President Claire Ferguson said during the Olympics. "But we would hope 
that she would feel some responsibility to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan's agent, Jerry Solomon, was not available for comment Sunday, but he 
said recently that his client has been under physical and emotional stress 
since suffering knee injuries in a Jan. 6 assault. He also referred to her busy 
schedule, including the appearance at Disney World and this week as host of 
NBC's "Saturday Night Live," but emphasized that her decision is not be based 
on commercial factors. 
</P>
<P>
 The other U.S. entrant in the World Championships is national champion Tonya 
Harding, but her participation in Chiba is uncertain, pending a disciplinary 
hearing scheduled to begin Thursday in Colorado Springs, Colo., to determine 
whether she can retain her USFSA membership. 
</P>
<P>
 A USFSA hearing panel concluded before the Olympics that there were 
"reasonable grounds" to believe Harding was aware of or involved in the plot 
that resulted in the assault on Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 An appeal by Harding's lawyers to postpone the hearing until after the World 
Championships was denied Friday by the USFSA. 
</P>
<P>
 If neither Kerrigan nor Harding competes in Chiba, the United States would be 
represented by two untested teen-agers, Kwan, 13, and Nicole Bobek, 16, of 
Colorado Springs, Colo.

LOS ANGELES MARATHON; NOTEBOOK; SUPPORTERS NEARLY TOO MUCH FOR APPELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Olga Appell felt her first pride in U.S. citizenship on Thursday, when she was 
introduced for the first time as a U.S. runner. Even reporters at that news 
conference cheered. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was really affected by that, she realized what she had done," said her 
husband, Brian. 
</P>
<P>
 But only three days later, she felt her first annoyance. It happened Sunday in 
the Los Angeles Marathon, which Appell eventually won with a personal best time 
of 2 hours 28 minutes 12 seconds. It was the fastest time by a U.S. woman in 
almost three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the race, which she won by nearly nine minutes over Emma Scaunich of 
Italy, Appell, formerly of Mexico, found herself surrounded by Latino runners. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted to give her encouragement. Worse, they wanted to break marathon 
rules and give her a drink of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to tell them to please back off, that I needed to run," said Appell, 
who became a U.S. citizen Feb. 25. "I understand that they wanted to help, but 
I needed more room." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband expects that these displays of affection will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has already become something important to many Latinos, which is good," 
Brian said. "We just can't let it affect her running." 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing that affected Appell's running on Sunday was, predictably, 
boredom. By the second half of the race, she was so far ahead, she said became 
confused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't read my watch, I was wondering where I was, then I heard somebody 
say I was headed for a 2:30 finish," she said. "I wanted to do better than 
that, so I got it going." 
</P>
<P>
 By bettering her previous best time of 2:28:56 in last year's New York City 
Marathon, in which she finished second, Appell returns to her Albuquerque home 
with one thought in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're already looking forward to Atlanta and the Olympics," Brian said. "It's 
a long way away, but that's the goal." 
</P>

 While teammate and friend Paul Pilkington was winning his first Los Angeles 
Marathon, Ed Eyestone was achieving another, more dubious landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in "13 or 14" career marathons, Eyestone did not finish the 
race. He dropped out at Mile 24 because of a groin injury that friends thought 
would prevent him from even starting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gets points in my book for even being out there," said Bob Wood, 
Eyestone's agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyestone, the pre-race American favorite from northern Utah, suffered the 
injury Friday during a workout and photo shoot at Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the rest of that day and Saturday undergoing treatment in an attempt 
to heal it in time for a shot at defending his U.S Track and Field marathon 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I took my first steps of the race, I felt it again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why didn't he quit earlier? 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go far enough so I could get back easily and celebrate with 
Paul," he said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jerry Dunn, who ran a record 104 marathons last year, ran in his second Los 
Angeles Marathon Sunday and gave it this review. 
</P>
<P>
 The good: The medals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This race really improved the medals this year," he said, fingering the piece 
of engraved glass hanging from his neck. "That is why most of us run, for the 
medals, and these are really nice." 
</P>
<P>
 The bad: The crowds were smaller than last year, and his running partner, 
Elaine Gillaspie of Spoonfish, N.D., tripped over a protruding manhole cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why the crowd wasn't as big as the past, maybe it was the rain," 
said Dunn, a massage therapist from Indianapolis. "But I tell you what, after I 
yelled a little bit, they were just as loud." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The award for the most unusual runner who finished -- a different category 
from the most unusual runner who goes four blocks for the TV cameras and drops 
out -- goes to Mark Millington of London. 
</P>
<P>
 Millington, 34, ran the entire race inside a rubber rhinoceros outfit, 
complete with a huge snout. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he wasn't doing it for laughs, but for Save the Rhino International, a 
group attempting to stop the poaching of rhinos worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The costume weighed 30 pounds, and Millington said he was burdened by "sexual 
jokes" about his snout, but he nonetheless finished the race in 4 hours 57 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 That's faster than about 5,000 humans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmed Salah of Djibouti entered the race with the fastest time -- 2:07:07 -- 
but at 37, his best days are behind him. Salah challenged Pilkington for five 
miles before dropping off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished 13th in 2:15:04, struggling at the finish with severe cramps. 
After crossing the finish line, Salah had trouble standing without support. He 
was taken to a medical tent in a wheelchair and was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Callahan, 35, of Northridge, was one of the many Angelenos determined to 
finish the marathon despite the Jan. 17 earthquake, which has disrupted his 
life. Callahan, whose residence was condemned, was unable to train for the past 
month. Still, he managed to finish in 7:23:08, walking the final 10 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a while, you wonder if you'll be swept off the streets," said Callahan, 
who was trying to finish in 6 1/2 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The dialysis technician worked 12 hours Saturday, which might have contributed 
to his slower pace. He has a 16-hour shift scheduled today.

LOS ANGELES MARATHON; A TEAM, TO THE END; WHEELCHAIR MARATHONERS COUPRIE AND 
WIGGINS WORK, THEN DECIDE TO WIN TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Both are in wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were disabled in motorcycle accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Both compete in marathons. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are members of the same racing team. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, it should come as no surprise that Philippe Couprie and Paul Wiggins 
decided to add one more bond to the many ties that unite them by crossing the 
finish line together as co-winners of the men's wheelchair competition in 
Sunday's Los Angeles Marathon, timed in 1:34:52, the only dead heat in the 
nine-year history of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Couprie, who comes from Pontoise, France, has been in a wheelchair since 1980. 
He finished 18th in the 1992 Barcelona Paralympics Marathon and was third in 
last year's L.A. Marathon. His best previous finish was a second in last year's 
Oita Marathon in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiggins, who comes from Tasmania, was disabled in 1985. He started racing in 
1988 and had competed in 10 marathons before Sunday. Wiggins had two previous 
first-place finishes -- the Oz Day 10K and the Gasparilla 15K -- both earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about his accident, Wiggins said: "I used to ride too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 But even in a wheelchair, he can't get enough of racing. Wiggins works out six 
days a week, covering 80-100 miles in that span. He is supposed to take one 
month a year off, but acknowledges sneaking off even during his rest period to 
log a few miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Couprie and Wiggins spent most of Sunday working together, trying to shake 
John Briggs, Scot Hollonbeck and Jan Mattern, last year's wheelchair winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "We swap positions," Wiggins said, explaining how he and Couprie alternated in 
the lead spot, the front man taking the full brunt of the elements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other guy is behind where he can sit in the draft and get a rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty tough for a guy (racing) alone. He doesn't have a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Briggs' chances for victory ended when he got a flat tire at the 12-mile mark. 
Briggs continued, he and Hollonbeck leading for the first 20 miles, but, in the 
end, they were unable to hold off Couprie and Wiggins. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Knaub, 37, of Long Beach, a three-time winner of this race and a winner in 
five of 10 Boston Marathons in which he has competed, also struggled Sunday 
after switching to a bigger hand rim. 
</P>
<P>
 "While everybody else was wheeling around in fourth gear," Knaub said, "I'm in 
third gear. It was kind of a rookie mistake, but I'll be back." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until the last downhill stretch that Couprie and Wiggins were 
finally alone with the finish line ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 They looked at each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you want to finish this together?" Wiggins asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fine, let's do it," Couprie said. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's what they did, clasping hands to the cheers of the crowd as they 
wheeled in front of the Coliseum and across the finish line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided to walk together. We decided to finish together," Couprie said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either one of us could have won it," Wiggins said, "but so what? It's no big 
deal. This isn't only about winning."

OWNER OF THE WICKED NORTH TO APPEAL RULING; BIG 'CAP: HERSH SAYS HE WILL GO TO 
COURT IF NECESSARY IN ATTEMPT TO OVERTURN DISQUALIFICATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the language of the racetrack, the owner of The Wicked North is prepared to 
go the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go all the way with this," Phil Hersh said Sunday of an appeal of a 
stewards' disqualification that cost his horse a $550,000 victory in the 
$1-million Santa Anita Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wicked North, after finishing first by 1 1/2 lengths, was disqualified to 
fourth place for interfering with Myrakalu, who tried to go between two horses 
at the top of the stretch. Stuka, not involved in the traffic jam, was moved up 
to first place and the three Santa Anita stewards also moved Myrakalu from 
fourth to third. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that 99% of the people who watched the race would have appealed," 
said Hersh, 75, a retired plumbing contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersh's appeal goes to the California Horse Racing Board, which will schedule 
a hearing presided over by a referee. The referee's recommendation to the board 
is not binding. Should his appeal be unsuccessful, Hersh could also pursue the 
matter in the courts, and on Sunday he seemed determined to fight the 
disqualification that far if he had to. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unusual for a judgment call by the stewards to be overturned. What is 
believed to be the only example in California came after Tight Spot won the Del 
Mar Derby in 1990. The stewards disqualified Tight Spot and gave the victory to 
Itsallgreektome, but both the racing board and a court judge restored Tight 
Spot's victory. That battle went on for almost a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the horse on the inside (Hill Pass) bothered Myrakalu, not my horse," 
said David Bernstein, who trains The Wicked North. "My horse came over four or 
five inches at the most. My horse is so big that he gave the illusion that he 
blocked Myrakalu's path more than he did." 
</P>
<P>
 The stewards said they were obligated to disqualify The Wicked North because 
his interference might have prevented Myrakalu from finishing third. He was a 
nose behind Bien Bien in the battle for that position. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Myrakalu had still finished third, we might have looked at the situation 
differently," steward Pete Pedersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersh was critical of Allen Paulson, the owner of Stuka. Speaking 
sarcastically, Hersh said: "He came down and told me to get out of the winner's 
circle. He showed a lot of class, and you can quote me." 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the race Sunday with Kent Desormeaux, The Wicked North's 
jockey, the stewards suspended him for five racing days, starting Thursday. 
Unofficially, there have been 14 disqualifications at the meet, leading to 13 
jockey suspensions.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; PIAZZA WILL SPEAK UP IN CLUBHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are still a couple of pieces missing for the Dodgers, but a certain 
element of pride exists in the clubhouse that wasn't there last spring. Most of 
it stems from the emergence of youth, with Mike Piazza showing the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday at Vero Beach, Fla., Piazza hit two home runs in the Dodgers' 12-11 
loss to the Florida Marlins. That gives him five hits in eight at-bats, with 
four runs batted in, during the three spring games. 
</P>
<P>
 With Darryl Strawberry sidelined because of a stomach virus, Manager Tom 
Lasorda batted Piazza fourth. Also hitting home runs were Eric Karros and Dave 
Hansen, whose came as a pinch-hitter in the seventh inning. Henry Rodriguez, 
playing left field in place of Strawberry, knocked in three runs on two hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eric and I have talked about it, and we think we can step up and be a little 
bit of a leading presence on this club because we have established that we can 
play on this level," Piazza said. "But on the same note, we have a lot of 
respect for the veterans on this club. We just have to go out and play hard 
right now. Maybe five, six years down the line we can take more of a presence 
in the clubhouse, but we still owe a tremendous amount of respect to Darryl, 
Tim Wallach, Orel (Hershiser), Kevin Gross and guys like that, guys who have 
that clubhouse presence, and Reggie Smith, who has come back on the staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza said that Smith, the Dodgers' former right fielder and new hitting 
instructor, is also helping. "Just having a Reggie Smith presence in the 
clubhouse has given us a little bit of an attitude -- not a cocky thing, just a 
quiet self-confidence that we will be able to go out and hit some guys hard and 
intimidate a little this year," Piazza said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There were 10 pitchers used and eight home runs hit -- four by each team. . . 
. Park Chan Ho will make his first major league appearance today as a starter 
when the Dodgers travel to Port St. Lucie to play the New York Mets. Kevin 
Gross, who still has a little tenderness in his shoulder, was originally 
scheduled to pitch, but, instead, will follow Park. . . . Delino DeShields will 
have outpatient surgery today on his fractured cheekbone. MARYANN HUDSON

ONE OF BEST COACHING JOBS AROUND; TENNIS: GULLIKSON IS PROUD OF SAMPRAS, WHO 
KEEPS HIS SUCCESS IN PERSPECTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN CHADERJIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pete Sampras has already all but received the coronation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the semifinals of the Newsweek Champions Cup, no less than Pancho 
Gonzales was saying he had never seen a player with all the weapons Sampras 
has. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Pasarell called Sampras the most complete tennis player he had ever 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
 A loss in the final Sunday at Hyatt Grand Champions wasn't going to change 
anyone's mind. A come-from-behind 4-6, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-2 victory merely added 
to the reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sampras is on a rare ride these days, scaling a ladder that has everything 
to do with Grand Slam tournament results and very little to do with an Indian 
Wells final -- regardless of how sweet this title was. 
</P>
<P>
 So forgive Sampras' coach, Tim Gullikson, if he was honest before the final, 
when asked what a loss would have meant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing," Gullikson said. "He'd be disappointed for a while, but he gets over 
it really quickly.  
</P>
<P>
 "He wants to win this tournament, but if he doesn't win it -- and this is a 
point that I'd like to make about Pete, it's one of the reasons why I think 
he's so good -- he's very even-keeled emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
 He's very good, period. 
</P>
<P>
 So is it really work to coach Pete Sampras? 
</P>
<P>
 Gullikson's friends don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're always kidding me that I don't have a job yet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever he's doing, it's working. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Gullikson joined him on Jan. 1, 1992, Sampras has moved from No. 3 to 
No. 1 in the world, winning the last three Grand Slam events. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gullikson would be the first to say that Sampras' success is the 
23-year-old's own doing. In fact, Gullikson, who has coached Martina 
Navratilova, Mary Joe Fernandez and Aaron Krickstein, says he has never had it 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pete is by far the easiest person I've ever coached," Gullikson said Sunday. 
"When I coached Martina, she wanted me to really direct everything that she was 
doing. It's good for a coach to have input, but I don't want my players to be 
like that. I don't know where the other player is going to hit every ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can help them in certain ways, but I want them to know what they're doing 
and to have it come from them, not from me. That's the way I like to operate. 
And that's the way Pete is, he's very independent. But he still is coachable." 
</P>
<P>
 As coaches do, Gullikson still sees some room for improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras' return, especially against the second serve, is one area. So are 
staying aggressive and being consistent on the service toss. But those are 
minor, Gullikson said, and the step up Sampras has taken is undeniable. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of players have a comfort zone. When the pressure is on, they play one 
way," Gullikson said. "Pete has the ability to go way outside of that because 
he has faith in himself and he has the ability to carry that off." 
</P>
<P>
 The next major hurdle is winning the French Open, the Grand Slam tournament on 
clay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe strongly that he's going to win it at some point," Gullikson said. 
"It may not be this year, but he will win it for sure -- because he really 
wants to win it."

 Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott made her first appearance on the field 
since her suspension and came away happy when Lenny Harris doubled home the 
decisive runs in the Reds' 6-4 exhibition victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates 
at Plant City, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Schott, suspended last March for using racial and ethnic slurs, had a pregame 
birthday party on the field for mascot Schottzie 02.She scooped some icing off 
the cake with her finger, let the dog lick it, then stuck the finger in her 
mouth and licked the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reds won the game with three hits and a walk in the eighth off Jeff 
McCurry. R.J. Reynolds walked, Thomas Howard singled and Harris doubled to left 
with one out to break a 4-4 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 In other games: San Francisco's Barry Bonds hit a two-run triple in the first 
inning and a homer in the fourth in a 7-4 victory over the Colorado Rockies at 
Scottsdale, Ariz. . . . Rick Sutcliffe started for St. Louis and pitched three 
innings, allowing six hits and three runs against his former team in an 8-3 
victory over the Baltimore Orioles at St. Petersburg, Fla. . . . Michael Jordan 
spent the day with Chicago hitting instructor Walt Hriniak and Andre Dawson had 
two hits and an RBI to lead the Boston Red Sox in a 3-2 victory over the White 
Sox at Ft. Myers, Fla.

 Nelson Simmons was supposed to be a star. He reached the big leagues by 21. He 
cracked the defending World Series champion Detroit Tigers' starting lineup in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 10 years later, Simmons is playing for his seventh organization, 
desperate to shed the image that continues to haunt him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost wish I could change my name and go play baseball where nobody knows 
me," Simmons, 30, said. "People have long memories in this game, and 
unfortunately, they still remember the bad things about me." 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons, who last was in a major league spring training camp five years ago 
with the St. Louis Cardinals, is trying to prove he has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the days he spent in jail on misdemeanor charges. Gone are the days 
he got high on drugs. Gone are the days he assaulted authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done a lot of things I'm not proud of," Simmons said, "and I did test 
positive once for marijuana. But I know guys who have crack in their back 
pocket, and they're out there making millions. All I need is for someone to 
give me a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons, who was hitless in one at-bat Sunday in the Angels' 13-5 defeat by 
the Oakland Athletics, spent the last two seasons playing for Jalisco in the 
Mexican League. He won the batting title last year with a .382 average, with 34 
homers and 95 RBIs. He's ready to make one last push to wear a major league 
uniform again."

 The Angels will open negotiations this month on to discuss a contract 
extension with designated hitter Chili Davis, according to General Manager Bill 
Bavasi. . . . Frank Tanana struggled in his first outing of the spring in his 
quest to win a starting job, yielding four hits and six runs (five earned) in 
the fourth inning at Tempe, Ariz., including a towering home run by Ruben 
Sierra. . . . Second baseman Kevin Flora hit his first homer of the spring in 
the fifth inning off John Wasdin. BOB NIGHTENGALE

JACKSON STILL ISN'T SATISFIED; BASKETBALL: MATER DEI WINS SECTION, BUT JUNIOR 
AND TEAMMATES NOW ARE TARGETING STATE TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Mater Dei won its Southern Section Division I-A boys' basketball 
championship last season, Shaun Jackson watched from the bench in a suit and 
tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Monarchs' 65-59 victory over Edison in the Division I-A title game 
Saturday at Anaheim Arena, Jackson said: "I'm going to enjoy this one more 
because I'll be playing." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mater Dei didn't look satisfied with its ninth Southern Section crown in 
the past 12 seasons, and Jackson wasn't pleased with the team's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebration was replaced by long faces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played (terrible)," Jackson told a reporter after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is life at Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 In 12 seasons under Coach Gary McKnight, the Monarchs have lost only 27 games. 
Mater Dei is 31-0 and ranked No. 2 in the nation by USA Today. Excellence is 
expected, from the players, coaches and fans. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Monarchs have their sights set above the section title -- on a State 
championship -- and they know they will have to improve their play if they want 
to challenge for another State title. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson is used to the challenge of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 He played sparingly as a sophomore last season and was sent down to the junior 
varsity for the second half of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a lot of seniors last year," Jackson said. "I just wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
 One senior was Jackson's older brother, Chris, who had signed a letter of 
intent with UC Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun had to deal with playing in the shadow of Chris and his other older 
brother, Ray, a linebacker who signed to play football with Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shaun's hard work allowed him to blossom this season, and now McKnight 
compares him to former Mater Dei standout, Mike Mitchell. Mitchell also played 
basketball at Fresno State and Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight said Jackson has the same type of quickness and Division I college 
potential as Mitchell. Although Jackson has played primarily in the post this 
season, he should move to the wing next season with the development of freshman 
post players Chris Burgess and Mike Vukovich. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's former teammate, Mater Dei assistant coach Tom Lewis, has helped to 
develop Jackson's skills this season. Lewis, who went on to play at USC and 
Pepperdine, was one of McKnight's first marquee players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shaun worked his tail off in August and really benefited working with Coach 
Lewis," McKnight said. "He's just a 16-year-old junior, but he's shown more 
mental toughness this season. He's established his own identity and he's played 
very well." 
</P>
<P>
 McKnight pointed to the Tournament of Champions and the Orange tournament. 
Although overshadowed at times by his teammates -- Arizona-bound guard Miles 
Simon, highly-touted freshman Schea Cotton, or sharp-shooting guard Clay 
McKnight -- Jackson was selected as MVP of the Orange Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson said he felt he arrived in early December when the team traveled 
to St. Louis for a game against Chicago Mt. Carmel. 
</P>
<P>
 Mt. Carmel featured one of the most highly-touted players in the nation, 6-8 
forward Antoine Walker, and Jackson held his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, a McDonald's All-American, had 30 points and 12 rebounds to Jackson's 
14 points and 11 rebounds. But the Monarchs came away with a come-from-behind 
71-67 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when it turned around for me," Jackson said. "We kind of had a little 
fear going into that game, but we played our best, and we came out and won." 
</P>
<P>
 And with the State tournament beginning Tuesday and a possible meeting with 
Los Angeles Crenshaw looming, Jackson knows the Monarchs will have to be at 
their best. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei and Crenshaw, the fifth-ranked team in the nation by USA Today, must 
win two games before the dream matchup could take place March 12 at Anaheim 
Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think being ranked No. 2 in the nation, that's the highest we've been and 
we're proud of it," Jackson said. "But we don't just cherish that. We know we 
still have to come out and play hard." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Monarchs only have to look back to Saturday for a reminder.BASKETBALL

PREP BASEBALL 1994 / ORANGE LEAGUE; GARCIA HAS VALENCIA'S VOTE OF CONFIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Luis Garcia tossed his glove to the ground and leaned forward on the dugout 
bench at Valencia High as he eagerly awaited the Tigers' voting results. 
</P>
<P>
 As Coach Mike Scheetz prepared to announce the team's co-captains last March 
for the 1993 season, Garcia scanned the length of the bench and wondered who 
would lead. 
</P>
<P>
 He believed there were many good candidates; the Tigers couldn't go wrong with 
any selection. The junior first baseman/pitcher pictured several of his 
teammates fulfilling the roles well and guiding Valencia to a successful 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, however, did not imagine he would comprise half of the Tigers' 
leadership duo. He was elected along with then-senior Mike Mebane. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe they voted for me," Garcia said. "I was really surprised 
because we had some seniors on the team . . . a lot of other guys who would 
have done a great job. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me feel good that I gained their respect. I just wanted to prove it 
wasn't a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Seldom has the democratic process worked so well. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia and Mebane handled their responsibilities with ease and Valencia won 
its second consecutive league championship. Garcia, whom Scheetz expects to 
lead the Tigers again, believes his final go-around should yield similar 
results. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost some good guys from last year, and we have a lot of underclassmen, 
but I think we're going to have a good team again," Garcia said. "We just have 
to keep helping the young guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Extending a hand is no problem for Garcia. He derives pleasure from making 
others better. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me feel good when the younger guys ask me if they're doing things 
right . . . when they ask me for my opinion about how they're playing," Garcia 
said. "It's cool when you tell a younger player something, or you show them 
something, and they get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's relationship with his teammates pleases Scheetz. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's one of those kids all coaches love to have," Scheetz said. "The others 
kids listen when he says something, because they respect him for his work 
ethic. He's not so much a vocal guy. I guess you would say he is a quiet 
leader, but he always makes his point." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's focus is on focus . 
</P>
<P>
 He works relentlessly on every aspect of his game from the first minute of 
practice -- and after -- until darkness forces him from the field. His 
intensity actually increases during games, something his teammates initially 
thought an impossibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that when a leader plays hard, then other people tend to follow," 
Garcia said. "I always play hard because I have to have people respect me to 
follow me. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they see I'm working hard, then that might give then incentive to work a 
little harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Chris Draft is impressed by his friend's approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's always real serious," Draft said. "He never goes out on the field joking 
around and playing because he's real competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows not to do that stuff around him because he's respected." 
</P>
<P>
 Individual success on the field also helps to engender respect, and Garcia is 
a leader in that department, too. 
</P>
<P>
 A left-hander with a smooth swing, Garcia batted .333 with three home runs, 
eight doubles and 28 runs batted in. Also a defensive standout at first base, 
he was selected All-Orange League second team. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia might start as a pitcher this season in addition to playing first base. 
He relies on control and was used in relief as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes everyone in the infield better," Scheetz said. "He gets to a lot of 
balls and he always knows what he's supposed to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia is equally prepared in the classroom. He has a 3.3 grade-point average 
and has been accepted by Arizona. He will try to walk on at Arizona, but is 
open to playing elsewhere.

 No one will be surprised if Valencia wins its third consecutive league 
championship. The Tigers have a talented, senior-dominated lineup that is 
hungry for one more title before graduation. "I'm very encouraged by having so 
many experienced players," Scheetz said. "We should be a competitive team, but 
I don't think anyone will run off with (the title)." The Tigers definitely have 
enough talent to do just that. Draft is one of the county's most skilled 
athletes. The Times' back of the year, Draft was selected first-team all-league 
in baseball as a junior. He batted .391 with four home runs, 32 runs scored and 
22 runs batted in. He is the league's swiftest outfielder. Garcia was 
second-team all-league after batting .395 with three home runs and 28 RBIs. He 
is equally adept on defense. Esque was more lucky than good last season (7-0, 
4.32 earned-run average). Scheetz hopes the opposite will occur this season. 
"We bailed him out of a lot of jams," Scheetz said. "We need him to be more 
consistent."

 Upon retiring, Jane Dienstfrey's dream was to recline in her Connecticut home 
and read. She got her wish -- and a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
 A former editor at the New Yorker, Dienstfrey now reads more than 40 books 
each month to publish Select Fiction, a newsletter highlighting works 
overlooked by bestseller lists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought there should be a list somewhere," she said. "I track the authors 
and when someone you haven't heard of keeps popping up, I get the book. I love 
page turners." 
</P>
<P>
 Dienstfrey reviews about 10 books in each edition. The publication -- which 
covers light and heavy fiction -- offers a one-paragraph summary and excerpts 
from other reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 The newsletter has about 300 subscribers, and Dienstfrey said she is getting 
more than 50 calls a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's the winter," she said. "Not your winter; I've been to L.A. But 
out here, we have a lot of snow."

OUT FROM THE SHADOW; YOLANDA KING SPENT HER YOUTH TRYING TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR 
HER FATHER, THE LATE MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. NOW, SHE SAYS, 'I ONLY SPEAK FOR 
MYSELF.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Students at Inglewood's Morningside High gathered around Yolanda King the 
other day, seeking her pronouncements on Louis Farrakhan, Jesse Jackson, 
violence versus nonviolence and other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 The eldest child of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. answered each politely 
but reluctantly. She does not try to influence public opinion, she explained 
later. "I only speak for myself; I only represent myself. I do not represent 
any group, or the black community, or women or even my father." 
</P>
<P>
 She respects Farrakhan for having "probably saved many young lives," but she 
is pleased that African American leaders are repudiating some of his attitudes. 
Jesse Jackson, she tells a student, is "working inside the system." And she is 
passionately in favor of nonviolence. 
</P>
<P>
 But her talk to the student body, as part of the school's celebration of Black 
History Month, was apolitical and focused on the individual instead of social 
issues. It was based on one of her father's early sermons, stressing the 
importance of "healthy self-love; sharing that love with others, and the value 
of a connection to a higher power." 
</P>
<P>
 King, 38, an actress and producer, regularly speaks at high schools and 
colleges to honor her father's accomplishments and memory. She carries on his 
legacy, she said, but not exactly in the way most people expect. 
</P>
<P>
 She gave up trying to fulfill others' expectations long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yolanda King was thrust into the role of successor at age 12, when she turned 
on the TV and learned that her father had been assassinated. 
</P>
<P>
 First there were family concerns. She'd spent more time with her father and 
knew him better than her three siblings, so she felt obligated to pass her 
knowledge on to them. 
</P>
<P>
 But the outside world usually seemed to expect more of her than she could 
deliver. She felt pressured; she felt guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time I went back and forth between trying to please everyone and 
trying to be a real person." The pleaser usually won. 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, she recalled, she tried to "just blend in, just be accepted, 
just be like everyone else." But as the daughter of a slain icon, she was 
expected to be stronger, wiser, more politically correct than "ordinary" kids 
her age. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, since age 8 she'd been enrolled in what was then the only 
integrated drama school in Atlanta, run by Walt Roberts, father of actress 
Julia Roberts. But when she played in a teen-age production of "The Owl and the 
Pussycat" in 1972, she said, her hometown erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was 15, my co-star was white, and the white community criticized it because 
they didn't think (mixing the races) was right. 
</P>
<P>
 "The black community asked: 'How could you disgrace your dead father's image 
by playing the role of a prostitute?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The furor was so great that King said she was forced to stand up at church one 
Sunday and explain her actions to the whole congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she reached Smith College, her father's public image had grown 
even more immense, along with expectations placed upon his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 While most young women her age were finding their own talents and goals, King 
said she was trying to be what the world wanted -- a substitute for her father. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was asked to join this, do that, work with all sorts of groups. It was a 
tremendous burden because people expected me to automatically know things, to 
have opinions and answers I didn't have," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you come from this tremendous tradition, you feel obligated to pick it 
up and charge ahead. But I was floundering. It wasn't happening. I was in a 
hole and couldn't get out. I had no idea what I was good at, how I could 
contribute -- or how to feel comfortable about myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd do press conferences and people would ask me about the state of the world 
and what we should do about big social problems. For a very long time, I never 
said, 'I don't know.' I thought that would mean I was inept or inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
 About age 22, she said, she finally understood she'd been "putting up a front" 
and could no longer handle it. "I realized there are lots of things I simply 
just don't know, and I needed to be able to admit that to myself and others. 
It's great to be able to say, 'I'm not sure; what do you think?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 King said it took her "a little longer" than most people to get where she is 
today -- "which is a really peaceful place. I know what I love to do, and what 
I do well." 
</P>
<P>
 She was co-founder, with Attallah Shabazz (daughter of Malcolm X), of the 
Nucleus Theatre Company, which provides inspirational programs for schools and 
colleges. A one-woman show, "Tracks," which she produced and in which she plays 
all 16 characters, has toured the country. She said she sees the play as an 
affirmation of her father's philosophy of the importance of each individual in 
a socially responsible society. 
</P>
<P>
 A Denver Post critic lauded "Tracks," calling King's performance remarkable. 
When it played in 1992 at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., a Washington 
Post critic wrote: "Although no Lily Tomlin, the actress exhibits a real flair 
for speech patterns and telling gestures. . . . King should have enough faith 
in her powerful stage presence to pare down, simplify and avoid the 
melodramatic and the maudlin." She hopes to bring the production to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 King is working on a feature film about her mother, Coretta Scott King, who 
was an activist "before she ever met my father. It was not an accident that 
they came together." 
</P>
<P>
 And it was no accident that she, her sister and two brothers turned out to be 
achievers, she said. It was due to her mother's consistency: "One brother is a 
successful businessman, another is in Georgia politics, my sister is both a 
lawyer and a minister. We all live in Atlanta still, and we are all very close. 
Tragedy does that -- it brings you even closer." 
</P>
<P>
 King "can't imagine not being married and not having children." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've dated all sorts -- white guys, Jewish guys and, of course, primarily 
African American guys. But when I settle down, I want to know without a doubt 
that this is forever -- I haven't come across such a relationship yet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She still grapples with some memory loss surrounding the years after her 
father's death, created by what she explains as "a blocking mechanism" that the 
mind sets up to erase tragedy. She's "trying to resurrect" those memories. At 
some point, she said, she may share her recollections with others. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at Morningside High, King said the student question that pleased her most 
was personal: "If your father came back today, what is the first thing you'd 
say to him?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her I'd never even asked that of myself," she said. "I had to think 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, recalling the simple, playful moments when her father hugged her and let 
her know she was loved, King told the student: "I'd probably just tell him how 
much I miss being able to feel him, really feel him."

WORKERS' COMPENSATION; TRENDS: WITHOUT UGLY TREKS TO THE OFFICE AFTER THE 
NORTHRIDGE QUAKE, TELECOMMUTING EMPLOYEES ARE HAPPIER AND MORE RELAXED. AND 
BOSSES ARE WINNING, TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE KOENENN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The moment he clicked on the TV news the morning of the Northridge earthquake, 
Tony Davies knew he was in trouble. The Antelope Valley Freeway -- the lifeline 
from his Palmdale home to his job 42 miles away in Mission Hills -- was a 
wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Uh-oh, this is going to be incredibly terrible.' And it was. It 
took three hours to get in the first day." 
</P>
<P>
 Davies, a data-input clerk for GTE, resigned himself to life in his 1987 
Toyota Corolla for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't work out that way. Davies -- who requires only a computer, modem 
and telephone line to do his job -- has become a part of the much heralded 
telecommuting generation. Futurists have been promising it for years: Millions 
of Americans would "commute" by walking into a spare bedroom equipped with a 
computer or by driving a short distance to a telecommuting center. 
</P>
<P>
 But until Jan. 17, this widely touted revolution appeared to be more of a blip 
on the workplace radar, growing at a rather leisurely pace. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6.8 quake has hastened the pace of change. 
</P>
<P>
 GTE, for example, has converted a switching center in Lancaster to a satellite 
work center for almost 150 employees who live in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
Working around the clock, the company installed office furniture, computers and 
lighting, and added a room for employee breaks, a microwave oven and parking 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 As if a wand had been waved, post-quake commutes suddenly melted from three 
hours to 30 minutes or less. Says Davies: "When they asked us if we wanted to 
work in a satellite center closer to home, everybody sort of screamed, 'Oh, 
yes. Absolutely.' And they had it up and running in less than a week. I was 
stunned." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like the reprieve from a death sentence," says Terry Morgan, a 
customer care supervisor. With his wife, Norene, also a GTE supervisor, he was 
spending six to seven hours a day "just going back and forth" and wondering how 
much longer they could handle the stress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now everybody is a lot happier -- very relaxed and attitudes are great," he 
says. "I get a lot more productivity out of my people. I believe it's an 
excellent model."  
</P>
<P>
 Although the concept of telecommuting has been around for a long time, it has 
generally been identified with working at home alone -- usually a day or two a 
week, says Steve Wright, the GTE program manager who oversaw the project to 
establish the new center. "Management has traditionally resisted letting too 
many people out of sight at one time," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he says, GTE is hearing from a lot of companies curious about satellite 
centers. "The earthquake forced us to acknowledge that there is something not 
right in the way we go to work in Southern California. Everybody is 
re-evaluating this." 
</P>
<P>
 There are essentially three ways businesses can let their employees 
telecommute, says Jack Robertson, marketing manager for Pacific Bell. They can 
have people work at home by dialing into a database, lease work space in 
corporate telecommuting centers for multiple customers or set up company 
satellite operations. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a post-quake surge of interest in all three, Pacific Bell and GTE 
representatives say. Both companies are advertising their telecommuting 
services -- such as voice mail and additional lines for modems and faxes -- in 
newspapers and on radio, and they offer information hot lines and incentives, 
such as waivers of some equipment installation charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction from workers and businesses has been so favorable ("We'd taken over 
2,500 phone calls last time I looked," Robertson says) that both companies have 
extended their earthquake-relief telecommuting packages through March. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been beating the drums for 21 years and now I am an overnight success," 
says Jack Nilles, whose JALA International consulting firm specializes in 
telecommunications. His daily incoming phone calls have jumped from 10 to 40 
since Jan. 17, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nilles, who coined the word telecommute 20 years ago, says the fundamental 
reason telecommuting hasn't caught on is, "It scares the hell out of 
management. It's the loss-of-control problem: 'How do I know they're working if 
I can't see them?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the realization that people cannot work as well when they spend six hours 
a day in their cars has shifted managerial priorities.  
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Telebusiness Center, which opened a year ago in Lancaster 
as a county-funded pilot project, shot from 60% occupancy to 100% after the 
earthquake. "We were inundated with calls," says Suzette Cecchini, director of 
the center, which leases offices and individual work spaces stocked with 
computers, modems, business software, phone lines and fax machines.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry it took an earthquake to generate this interest. We think it's the 
wave of the future," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake also provided a big boost for the Valencia Corporate Telecommuting 
Center. Owned by the Newhall Land & Farming Co., the center was the brainchild 
of Steve Valenziano, now the center's marketing director, who lives in Valencia 
and "knew from experience that the whole community got into their cars every 
day and schlepped south on the 5 Freeway to work in major corporations 
throughout the Los Angeles Basin." 
</P>
<P>
 The Newhall company converted an empty warehouse to a center equipped with 
computer stations, private offices and teleconferencing rooms linked to the 
outside world by a fiber optic network and all available by lease to corporate 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 It opened in December with one business occupant, CareAmerica Health Plans. 
But after the quake, Valenziano says, everybody started returning his calls. 
Clients that moved in in February with long-term leases included Pacific Bell, 
Great Western Bank of Chatsworth, and Cigna Property and Casualty. The company 
is planning a second center.

 "We expected it would take nine months to fill all the spaces," Valenziano 
says. "We did it in two weeks after the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corporations are realizing it costs lots of money to move people across the 
landscape every day," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake caused us to think about being productive in creative and 
non-conventional ways," says Susan Herman, general manager of the Los Angeles 
City Department of Telecommunications. The department, created in 1985, 
oversees and regulates all video and data communications in city government and 
encourages private-sector participation in new information-age technologies. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The findings from a two-year pilot project that the department conducted -- 
comparing 500 city teleworkers with 500 commuting workers -- were so favorable 
in terms of productivity, morale and money saved that the City Council recently 
voted to enlarge the project, Herman says.  
</P>
<P>
 "And it involved a myriad of jobs -- clerk typists, city attorneys, police 
detectives, architects and engineers," she says. "People have worried that 
telecommuting might be a new high-tech sweat shop for data-entry work, but it's 
not that at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Most telework boosters agree with GTE's Dan Smith that "once people get a 
taste of telecommuting, they aren't going to want to go back to the old ways of 
working." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at his workstation in GTE's Lancaster satellite office, Tony Davies 
declares his satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have my own desk, everything's personal here and everyone is relaxed. I'm 
eight miles from home and not spending money on gas. It's almost like getting a 
raise."

ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT 
</P>

<BYLINE>

 The machinery for telecommuting is in place. It's the people who need to 
adjust, says management consultant Jack Nilles, president of the National 
Telecommuting Advisory Council and author of the book "Making Telecommuting 
Happen," to be published this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of management trepidation -- at losing control over their workers -- 
it's important to train people before they start telecommuting," he says, 
offering these tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Telecommuting must be voluntary on both sides. Management can't order an 
employee to work from home or a supervisor to let someone work from home. "Both 
will be incredibly ingenious at sabotaging it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't be spontaneous. Plan schedules ahead so people aren't away from home 
computer terminals at crucial moments or at home on those occasions when they 
are needed in the office. 
</P>
<P>
 * The benefits for management must be specific in terms of increased 
productivity, heightened morale, reduced costs of office space or parking. "You 
don't do it because it's nifty." 
</P>
<P>
 * To keep productivity up, the worker must be well-disciplined and a 
self-starter. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the employee needs access to a lot of expensive equipment, he or she may 
be better off at a work center than working at home. 
</P>
<P>
 * The employee needs to grow up. Telecommuting "can be terrifying for some 
people who rely on such invisible whips as getting up and putting on a suit, 
getting to the office on time and other cues." 
</P>
<P>
 * The manager needs to grow up. "You don't shout directions and crack the 
whip. Your job is leadership -- to decide where you're going, convey that to 
your employees . . . and let them do it." CONNIE KOENENN

8 BAJA OFFICIALS ACCUSED IN DRUG SHOOTOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a case with explosive political potential, Mexican federal authorities have 
issued arrest warrants for a deputy attorney general of the state of Baja 
California, a prosecutor and six state police officers in connection with last 
week's deadly shootout between federal agents and state officers who were 
guarding a drug kingpin, Mexican authorities said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials are accused of numerous crimes involving alleged complicity with 
Tijuana's powerful Arellano drug cartel, a complicity exposed by last week's 
gun battle between state and federal lawmen that left four men dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy attorney general, Sergio Ortiz Lara, allegedly went to the scene of 
the shootout and aided the escape of gunmen protecting an Arellano kingpin who 
agents were trying to arrest, authorities said. Ortiz is accused of obstruction 
of justice and abuse of authority. He has sought a judicial order to block his 
arrest, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the eight officials was in custody Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference, federal prosecutors said the shootout occurred when 
seven federal drug agents staking out a suspected cartel safehouse spotted a 
suspicious red Chevy Suburban leaving the house and tried to arrest the 
occupants at a busy commercial intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 The agents did not realize that among the passengers in the Suburban was 
Ismael Higuera Guerrero, alias El Mayel, a top lieutenant who inherited control 
of the cartel from the three Arellano brothers. The Arellanos are fugitives 
wanted in the killing of the cardinal of Guadalajara in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Higuera fled the scene with accomplices in a second vehicle after the 
gunfight, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attack was intended to avoid the discovery of (Higuera) and impede his 
capture," said Alfonso Cabrera Morales, the federal deputy attorney general of 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. federal sources had indicated previously that one of the Arellano 
brothers was believed to have been at the scene, but Cabrera said investigators 
now believe that was not the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrera emphasized that state officials cooperated in an intense investigation 
that also brought in the Drug Enforcement Administration and the FBI in San 
Diego. But the revelations about drug-related law enforcement corruption in 
Baja California at Sunday's news conference were explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 The case represents the worst law enforcement scandal in the four-year 
administration of Baja California Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel, the first 
opposition party governor in modern Mexican history, who had won praise for 
reform efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that the state government, via the state police, has been giving 
protection to the (drug) mafia," said Victor Clark Alfaro, a veteran Tijuana 
human rights activist who has repeatedly accused high-ranking officials of 
corruption. "There is a vacuum of authority when police settle their accounts 
this way. This is institutional violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Some activists and journalists have asserted that the scandal implicates Baja 
California Atty. Gen. Juan Francisco Franco Rios as well because the wanted men 
are under his command. But . Ruffo has expressed support for the embattled 
Franco in past days, and federal authorities said Franco was not a target of 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 17 people were facing charges as of Sunday, 11 of whom were either 
fugitive gunmen or officials who had not been arrested. They include state 
prosecutor Juan Carlos Guerrero, who is charged with abuse of authority and 
other crimes for permitting the escape of two alleged gunmen after they were 
placed in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 A state judicial police officer, Juan Hernandez Tejada, has been arrested on 
murder charges. He is hospitalized with gunshot wounds from the battle with 
federal agents. Five other officers are accused of obstructing justice and 
other crimes for their actions after the gunfight. 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining how the frenzied gun battle transpired, Cabrera offered yet 
another revised list of the dead. They are Cmdr. Alejandro Castaneda Andrade, 
commander of the federal anti-drug unit; Salvador Miramontes Torres, a state 
judicial police officer in Higuera's entourage; Riad Hatoum Serham, a Lebanese 
professional killer employed by the Arellano cartel, who was initially thought 
to be a state officer; and an as yet unidentified gunman. Two federal officers 
were wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday night, the federal agents tried to stop the Suburban carrying 
Higuera after they saw the vehicle leave the suspected safehouse believed to 
belong to the Arellano cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 After an initial gunfight killed the federal commander and three of Higuera's 
guards, the kingpin was able to flee with the help of gunmen in a white van who 
drove up and ambushed the remaining federal officers, Cabrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, deputy prosecutor Ortiz allegedly arrived, leading a group 
of armed men, who forced the federal agents to turn over one of four captured 
assailants, authorities said. That suspect remains a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The special federal unit had been tracking the Arellanos since August and had 
arrested 26 cartel soldiers and confiscated 53 properties. The cartel headed by 
the Arellano brothers has allegedly conducted a bloody turf war resulting in 
numerous murders and brazen shootouts in Mexico and Southern California during 
the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican officials say an Arellano assassination squad killed Cardinal Juan 
Jesus Posadas Ocampo by mistake while gunning for a rival drug lord, Joaquin 
(Chapo) Guzman, at the Guadalajara airport. 
</P>
<P>
 A sweeping investigation during the past nine months resulted in the arrest of 
eight San Diego gang members accused of being Arellano triggermen and of a 
fourth Arellano brother not directly suspected in the cardinal's murder. 
Mexican authorities have confiscated millions of dollars worth of cartel 
properties and arrested or fired numerous police officers suspected of 
collusion with traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. law enforcement officials and Mexican sources have maintained that 
the fugitive kingpins continue to smuggle drugs to the United States with the 
aid of corrupt law enforcement officials. The shootout and Sunday's arrest 
warrants provide new evidence to support those allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 There have even been reported sightings of the Arellanos at local restaurants, 
accompanied by bodyguards including policemen, according to U.S. and Mexican 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrera said the investigation of the shootout has not resulted in any solid 
leads about the whereabouts of the Arellanos.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON RUNS INTO CAPITAL PITFALL: THE WATERGATE TRAP; ETHICS: 
PRESIDENT IS ANGERED BY STAFF'S HANDLING OF WHITEWATER. BUT HE HELPED FUEL 
COVER-UP CONTROVERSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's decision to drop White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum and 
issue strict orders against further back-channel contacts with the Whitewater 
investigation came only after a belated realization that the growing appearance 
of a cover-up might prove more damaging than the ill-starred real estate deal 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, as criticism mounted in the wake of disclosures that Nussbaum 
had participated in a series of meetings on Whitewater with officials of the 
Treasury Department, an angry Clinton exploded at his staff, demanding an end 
to self-inflicted wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "His anger," said one aide, "was over the fact that the way we were handling 
Whitewater was being perceived as a Watergate cover-up, and he and all of us 
here know we operate on a different level of integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it was Clinton -- and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton -- who for months 
brushed aside warnings that Nussbaum's actions, along with others by the 
Clintons themselves, were fueling the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Clinton has run afoul of one of the most clearly marked pitfalls 
in Washington -- the Watergate trap, in which efforts to minimize or cover up a 
potentially damaging situation can become politically and even legally more 
dangerous than the original situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whitewater is not Watergate, but we've been acting like it is," an 
exasperated senior Clinton aide said shortly before Nussbaum's resignation. 
"The siege mentality here is dumb. We ought to learn from the past and not 
repeat it. We should get all the facts out." 
</P>
<P>
 That assessment was echoed by political operatives and legal experts outside 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is kind of baffling how very smart people and supposedly smart lawyers 
come to Washington and think they can manage the news," said Henry Ruth Jr., a 
special prosecutor during the Watergate scandal, referring to the tendency of 
officials such as Nussbaum to try to prevent public disclosure of embarrassing 
information. "They invariably find out they can't, and in trying to 
unsuccessfully manage the news, they do a great disservice to their bosses." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Watergate, President Richard Nixon was forced to resign, and 
several of his top aides went to prison, not because of direct involvement in 
what Nixon Press Secretary Ron Ziegler called the "third-rate burglary" of the 
Democratic Party's headquarters in 1972 but because of actions taken to shield 
the White House afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 The Watergate effort, which amounted to criminal obstruction of justice, added 
the word "cover-up" to the Washington lexicon. Today, the term applies to any 
ill-conceived attempt to suppress damaging or embarrassing information -- even 
if no crime is involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Ruth and others note that in many of the scandals since Watergate, 
stupidity and poor judgment rather than evil wrongdoing have led to problems. 
"In most cases we are involved in things that if revealed up front would not be 
so serious," Ruth said. 
</P>
<P>
 White House aides insist that is the situation with Whitewater, the failed 
Arkansas real estate development in which the Clintons invested during the 
1970s and 1980s, a span of time that included Clinton's tenure as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton himself has said in repeated public statements that he wants nothing 
done that would interfere with the various investigations of the real estate 
venture and the events and individuals surrounding it -- including the inquiry 
of Whitewater Special Counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet whether because of inattention, bad judgment or some other reason, the 
Clinton White House has often seemed bent on creating the opposite impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Nussbaum's) incompetence deserves a large share of the credit," one senior 
Administration official said, but he added: "I think the atmosphere existed 
there that created this behavior in a general way." 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum's miscues began after the apparent suicide in July of White House 
aide Vincent Foster, who was a former law partner of Hillary Clinton's in 
Little Rock, Ark., and had handled matters involving Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 When police came to the White House seeking information that might shed light 
on Foster's death, Nussbaum refused to give them direct access to his office. 
Instead, Nussbaum sifted through Foster's papers, withholding some. 
</P>
<P>
 It soon developed that some of the documents Nussbaum had held back were 
related to Whitewater. Critics -- many of them Republicans -- immediately cried 
cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 The papers in question have now been subpoenaed by Fiske. But at this late 
date it is almost impossible for Clinton to erase completely the impression of 
a possible cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and the White House also resisted for months the appointment of a 
special counsel, yielding only when continued revelations about Whitewater made 
the pressure irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 Some White House aides say Hillary Clinton was especially vigorous in opposing 
appointment of a special counsel and in defending Nussbaum, who had served as a 
mentor early in her career and whom she had backed for the post of White House 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, she thought they could get away with opposing a special counsel 
because they had been promised there would be no congressional hearings" on 
Whitewater, one aide said. (Now, GOP pressure is becoming so great that the 
Democratic majority in Congress may bow to the demands for hearings as well.) 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings with Treasury Department officials proved to be the final straw. 
The department is probing a defunct savings and loan once owned by James B. 
McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater project. A central question 
is whether money from McDougal's S&L was used to benefit the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
 By briefing Nussbaum and others from the White House on the progress of their 
activities, Treasury officials did something that is not routinely done for the 
targets of other such probes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics suggest Nussbaum had a blind spot on the sensitivity of 
Whitewater because of his feelings about the Resolution Trust Corp., the 
Treasury agency founded to deal with the S&L scandal. The RTC's criminal 
referral to the Justice Department began the Whitewater investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to becoming White House counsel, Nussbaum represented the New York City 
law firm of Kaye Scholer Fierman, Hays & Handler in a case brought against it 
by the RTC. The firm ultimately paid a $41-million settlement for allegedly 
misrepresenting the activities of S&L owner Charles H. Keating Jr. to the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 After the case was settled, Nussbaum publicly condemned the RTC for its 
aggressive approach toward Kay Scholer and other defendants in the savings and 
loan scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants say Nussbaum's meetings with the Treasury Department officials 
were innocuous, but because they were private, Clinton is in the position of 
saying "Trust me" -- a politically difficult position to maintain in the 
post-Watergate era. 
</P>
<P>
 And the drip-drip-drip of new developments, no matter how small or ambiguous, 
can have a devastating effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidential historian James David Barber of Duke University argues that 
"cover-up" has become a component of the political culture in part because it 
is often easier for voters to grasp the idea that someone is hiding something 
than it is to understand the details of the affair itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "People cannot really understand the complication of a lot of political news. 
And so something simple often comes to be the element that is remembered," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same way, says Douglas Bailey, publisher of Hotline, a newsletter on 
politics, the idea of a cover-up provides a handy lever to opponents who want 
to keep the probe of any potential scandal alive while the inquiry is in a 
stage where little about the case itself may be emerging. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe I have ever had a conversation with a candidate or a 
campaign, where I didn't start by saying: 'Look whatever the truth is, once the 
subject has been raised in any way, you have to make the assumption that it is 
going to come out. Now do you want it dragged out piece by piece and make you 
look like a fool and a liar? Or do you want to have it come out all at once and 
have you look like just a fool? If it comes out all at once, chances are people 
will be forgiving. If you drag it out, people will never forgive.' 
</P>
<P>
 "What is amazing is how many otherwise good and sensible people may understand 
that advice but simply ignore it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum "is not venal," said a close Clinton aide, but he "badly mismanaged 
the White House handling of Whitewater and has been overzealous in protecting 
the President." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Nussbaum and Hillary Clinton had reason to be extra sensitive to 
the cover-up specter. Both were staff attorneys for the House Judiciary 
Committee's impeachment inquiry on Nixon.

QUAKE SEEN SPEEDING RECOVERY OF ECONOMY; REBUILDING: $15 BILLION IN INSURANCE 
PAYOUTS AND AID PROVIDES STIMULUS FOR AREA. LONG-TERM EFFECT IS UNCLEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Call it shock therapy: Earthquake rebuilding efforts are about to breathe new 
life into Southern California's battered economy, as disaster relief money 
showers down on an army of builders, repair companies, retailers and suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, some economists now expect the quake to speed up the region's 
recovery rather than push it back into 1995, as many had feared in the chaotic 
days after Jan. 17. The fuel: $15 billion in insurance checks and disaster aid 
-- in effect an economic stimulus program aimed at the heart of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It filters through the economy in an amazing way," said Morton O. Schapiro, 
chairman of USC's economics department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks resident said the earthquake has provided his family a 
do-it-yourself lesson in the economics of disasters. "We replaced a TV. We 
replaced two VCRs. We spent a thousand dollars to get our car fixed. We built a 
new fence. And I don't think we're the only ones." 
</P>
<P>
 From earthquakes to blizzards, floods to tornadoes, natural disasters 
obviously take a toll on wealth as well as nerves. Work time is lost forever. 
Rattled residents move away. Businesses are wiped out. Tourists go elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Job gains in Southern California may be slightly lower in the future, when the 
rebuilding wave winds down around 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet seven weeks after the Northridge earthquake sparked fears of regional 
paralysis, the surprise is that Southern California's economy is not faring 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Sky-high estimates of up to $30 billion in damage have been slashed to $13.5 
billion in a new UCLA study. Freeway repairs in Los Angeles are proceeding much 
more rapidly than in the Bay Area after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake. Federal 
money is coursing through the pipeline from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "The irony of it is that this bad event that created a lot of hardship is 
going to start an economic expansion about a year before it would have happened 
otherwise," said private economist Mark Zandi, who expects a recovery this 
summer, based on his analysis of Hurricane Andrew and other disasters on their 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, new signs of economic life are emerging, as the shell-shocked 
aftermath of disaster evolves into a phase of methodical rebuilding. Property 
owners, still awaiting insurance payments, now are calling contractors and 
beginning to plan major renovations and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The increase in calls and estimates is tremendous," said Mike Quiroga, owner 
of Mike's Roofing Service in Van Nuys, who expects business to leap as much as 
75% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be busy in the next 30 to 45 days," he said. "Everybody will 
start receiving their insurance checks." 
</P>
<P>
 Not far from the epicenter, Roy Armstrong also is standing at the threshold of 
an upturn. His Northridge business, Far West Plywood Co., has recently suffered 
some of the worst weeks ever. 
</P>
<P>
 But word on the street is encouraging. "They're quoting the work," Armstrong 
said of the building contractors to whom he sells lumber and other materials. 
"They're just waiting for the money. There's a lot of bidding going on right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 No magic formula can reveal precisely how a region will fare in the aftermath 
of disaster. But Miami's experience with Hurricane Andrew may be instructive. 
</P>
<P>
 The August, 1992, storm devastated sections of Dade County and was blamed for 
$23 billion in losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet $19 billion in relief, mostly private insurance money, seemed to propel 
Miami out of recession shortly after the storm, despite the closure of nearby 
Homestead Air Force Base. The county gained 28,400 payroll jobs in 1993, an 
above-average advance, and the unemployment rate fell to 7.8% from about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no doubt that it (disaster relief) speeds up economic growth in the 
short run, no doubt at all," said Pat Fishe, a professor of economics at the 
University of Miami. "A lot of employment and a lot of income was created that 
people didn't plan to create." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a long time before Californians know the final price tag of the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA researchers last week estimated earthquake losses at $13.5 billion, 
although the governor's office maintains that the damage is between $13 billion 
and $20 billion. Overall, government agencies are providing $11.6 billion in 
aid and insurers are providing $3.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But Southern Californians stand to benefit more from relief money than their 
counterparts in other places because a lot of the cash will stick around. Local 
factories can produce many of the items needed for replacement and rebuilding, 
from home appliances to building materials to electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "After about March you'll start to see a plus from the rebuilding effort," 
said Ted Gibson, principal economist at the California Department of Finance. 
"You'll get an economic push for a year to 18 months that otherwise would not 
have occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, residents and retailers may feel the pinch of lost wages and 
out-of-pocket rebuilding expenses. Damage to the region's image, as employers 
and tourists choose to stay in places they perceive to be safer, will be hard 
to measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts view the negatives as enough to cancel out the positives. In the 
first half of this year, Los Angeles housing values may be 1 percentage point 
lower than without the quake, according to First Interstate Bancorp, with 
steeper declines expected in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the long run, it's a negative," said the University of Miami's Fishe. 
"Otherwise you'd like these disasters to keep coming along." 
</P>
<P>
 It is, however, a modest negative, almost too small to discern as the years 
progress, economists say. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA researchers were startled Friday when statewide jobs data for February 
revealed virtually no earthquake losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If February didn't show the hit, we could be talking positive gains from here 
on out," said UCLA economist Larry J. Kimbell, discarding his initial estimate 
of a short-term loss of 29,000 jobs. "We could be talking the end of 
recession." 
</P>
<P>
 The local economy should create 36,000 new jobs by September, the UCLA study 
found, knocking 2 percentage points off the unemployment rate and triggering an 
economic recovery three months earlier than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 After 1996, as the rebuilding stimulus peters out, the county will lose 
another 12,600 jobs, according to the forecast. But that loss may be partly 
offset by other job gains because a recovery is expected to be in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agonized over the question -- is this earthquake a good thing for 
California?" Kimbell said. The long-term answer, he and colleague Nancy Bolton 
concluded, was no -- but almost to a minuscule degree in an economic sense. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, the quake's aftermath has been a time of economic turmoil, 
reminiscent of wartime for many scrambling enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Bed Bath & Beyond, a national retailer, air-freighted new inventory, such as 
breakable picture frames and glassware, to meet public demand after the quake. 
Moreover, it flew dozens of managers in from around the country to get its four 
Los Angeles-area stores back into shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys flew in from Florida, from New York, from around the country. We 
probably had 100 guys," said regional manager Art Stark. "They dropped what 
they were doing and were here for 15- (to) 18-hour days, seven days a week. It 
was an amazing thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction firms, their suppliers and a wide range of specialists from 
asbestos removers to glass replacers are among the many beneficiaries of 
rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the massive task of getting things back to normal is creating less obvious 
opportunities as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Masters of Printing, a small business in Northridge, suffered $10,000 in 
damage, along with the loss of important customers at the Northridge Fashion 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, however, the post-quake helter-skelter of people moving 
around, scrambling for aid -- and keeping in touch with each other -- has 
provided a jolt of printing work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been doing a lot of business cards. We've been doing a lot of flyers," 
said Natalie Berger, who owns the shop with her husband. "A lot of copies have 
to be made for FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) stuff. Fortunately, 
we have been busy." 
</P>
<P>
 It will remain a mystery how the economy would have performed without the 
one-two punch of disaster and rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe the earthquake struck at a pivotal moment when the region was 
starting to edge out of recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Home sales had been rallying. Economists had detected an emerging trend of 
lower job losses, despite the continued weakness in aerospace and defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Business failures in California had declined slightly after shooting up in 
1991 and 1992. New businesses were being created, and opinion surveys pointed 
to rising public confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the prospect of billions of dollars in relief money has become the most 
persuasive piece of evidence that Southern California's long economic winter is 
going to end this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to get lulled into saying, 'Hey, everything's great. It's just 
like the good old days,' " said USC's Schapiro. "But we are on the path to 
recovery -- undoubtedly."

U.S. ENVISIONS NEW MILITARY TIES TO CHINA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the midst of the Clinton Administration's conflicts with China over human 
rights, the Pentagon is preparing a series of important steps to upgrade 
America's defense ties with Beijing, including possible joint U.S.-Chinese 
military cooperation in Asia, according to Pentagon officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The military cooperation, aimed at reassuring the People's Liberation Army 
that the United States does not consider it an adversary, would begin with 
peacekeeping operations or joint U.S.-Chinese disaster relief in places such as 
Central Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned by Pentagon officials, military units of the two countries would 
work together to set up joint command posts or temporary airfields. 
</P>
<P>
 Other steps envisioned by the Pentagon include the creation of a Joint 
Commission on Defense Conversion to discuss how to transform Chinese and U.S. 
defense industries from military to civilian use; and regular or annual 
meetings between America's defense secretary and China's defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
 These steps could be discussed or even finalized during Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher's trip to China, which begins Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pentagon source said Undersecretary of Defense Frank Wisner will accompany 
Christopher to Beijing in what would be the highest-level visit by a U.S. 
defense official since China's 1989 crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations 
in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisner's visit to Beijing has not been officially confirmed, however, and it 
is possible that it could be postponed because of the Administration's 
unhappiness with China's recent arrests of several dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
 At a Hong Kong news conference Sunday, Assistant Secretary of State John 
Shattuck said the detentions "cast a pall over Secretary Christopher's visit to 
Beijing." 
</P>
<P>
 So the Pentagon's plans to upgrade ties with China illustrate some of the 
complexities, mixed signals and contradictions of the Clinton Administration's 
current China policy. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 campaign, Clinton attacked the George Bush Administration for 
"coddling dictators" in China and other countries. And after taking office, 
Clinton signed an order that made the annual extension of China's "most favored 
nation" trading benefits conditional on improvements in the human rights 
climate in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton must decide by June what to do about China's MFN status. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the Administration has taken a relatively strong public position on 
human rights, both the Pentagon and officials at the National Economic Council 
have been pressing hard for more conciliatory policies toward China. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech two weeks ago to the Asia Society in Washington, Assistant Defense 
Secretary Charles W. Freeman Jr. characterized Clinton's 1992 campaign 
statements merely as "strong rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 He said these election-year statements were among the "irritants" in 
U.S.-China relations that the Administration has been trying to smooth over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in the Department of Defense don't spend a lot of time worrying about 
China," Freeman said in the speech. "We don't see it as a threat, particularly. 
. . . We see it as an opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1989 crackdown on protesters, the United States cut off all ties 
between U.S. military officials and the Chinese army. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, after an intensive internal review of China policy, the 
Administration re-established the military contacts as part of a series of 
measures aimed at easing tensions between Washington and Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Pentagon's point of view, better ties with Beijing would help prevent 
China from turning into a troublesome adversary. China is in the middle of a 
defense buildup, and U.S. military officials see China as the future power of 
Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials believe that leaders of the People's Liberation Army can be 
influential in determining the outcome of a number of potential flash points in 
Asia, including the nuclear crisis in North Korea, conflicting territorial 
claims in the South China Sea, continuing instability in Central Asia and the 
persistent conflict between India and Pakistan.

COLUMN ONE; A FATHER'S BITTERSWEET CRUSADE; MIKE REYNOLDS VOWED THAT HIS 
MURDERED DAUGHTER WOULD NOT DIE IN VAIN. FEW THOUGHT HE COULD WIN, BUT TODAY HE 
WILL SEE THE 'THREE STRIKES' BILL SIGNED INTO LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was the summer of 1992, a few days after Mike and Sharon Reynolds had laid 
their only daughter, Kimber, to rest after she had been fatally shot by a 
parolee who tried to steal her purse. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers it as if it were yesterday. Gov. Pete Wilson had come to Fresno 
on business, heard about the crime and asked to meet the Reynolds family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me tell you," Mike Reynolds said to the governor, "I'm going after these 
guys in a big way, the kind of people who would murder little girls in this 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson gave a sad smile of frustration. He could offer little hope that the 
laws would change. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Wilson will sign into law a bill popularly known as "three strikes and 
you're out." It requires that habitual criminals like the man who killed Kimber 
Reynolds must serve at least 25 years in prison. By 2001, state corrections 
experts predict, 100,000 more criminals will be serving what amount to 
life-in-prison terms because of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 California will have one of the toughest criminal sentencing laws in the 
country. And the man most responsible is Mike Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 In California politics, a Mike Reynolds comes along once in a great while. 
There were Paul Gann and Howard Jarvis. They changed property tax laws in 
California through Proposition 13, an anti-tax movement that spread across the 
country. There was Candy Lightner. Her daughter's death led to the creation of 
Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
</P>
<P>
 They were able to take lapses in the law, personal tragedy, drama and broad 
but unfocused public concern and create a powerful whirlwind strong enough to 
overcome politics as usual: a girl killed by a drunk driver. Elderly people 
losing their homes because they could not pay property taxes. The murder of a 
teen-age daughter followed by the kidnaping and murder of a 12-year-old 
Petaluma girl named Polly Klaas. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were issues that were lying there waiting to be dramatized," said Bruce 
Cain, a UC Berkeley professor who specializes in California politics. 
</P>
<P>
 In Reynolds' case, he came up with the plan, brought it to the Legislature and 
did not give up when it was rejected. He resorted to an initiative. When the 
rage of Californians propelled crime to the top of the political agenda in this 
election year, Reynolds was in the right place at the right time to focus it. 
</P>
<P>
 The policies that come of such events are not always the best, Cain noted. 
Critics say the cost of building new prisons to house the felons sentenced 
under terms of the Reynolds law will debilitate the state and lead to the 
warehousing of geriatric convicts. Joe Klaas, Polly's grandfather, said 
Reynolds' idea is badly flawed and pushed by a "distraught parent who wants to 
memorialize his daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a classic case. Some incident was going to make this come to light," 
Cain said. "A dramatic event has to coincide with a huge consensus out there. 
There was a big consensus. Remember, we're in an election year. That is going 
to quicken the pace of any idea. It's a matter of timing." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mike Reynolds is a few days past his 50th birthday. He describes himself as a 
"short, little fat guy," a wedding photographer, an "average Joe" who got 
married on Valentine's Day 25 years ago and never wanted much of anything other 
than to take pictures and raise his three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Reynolds also salvages things. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk into the back yard of his home on Harvard Street in Fresno, and there is 
an old cast-iron bathtub. He made it into a gas-fired barbecue. Next to it is a 
discarded restaurant stove, and a motel ice machine. Reynolds fixed them, and 
uses them on warm San Joaquin Valley nights. The well-worn picnic table is made 
of salvaged 4-by-8 lumber. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds also knows that some things cannot be fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter Kimber, an 18-year-old student at the Fashion Institute of Design 
and Marketing in Los Angeles, came home for the wedding of a high school friend 
in June, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 She stayed an extra day so her father could repair her car, and went to a 
restaurant in Fresno's Tower District for dessert. While she was out, two 
parolees sped up on a motorcycle and tried to snatch her purse. She fought. The 
driver pulled out a .357-caliber handgun and shot her in the head. She died two 
days later. Her killer died in a shootout with police. His accomplice was 
sentenced to nine years in prison. He could be out in half that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds reacted the only way he knew how. Here, beginning in this back yard 
built for neighborhood parties and kids, he would change the criminal justice 
system that allowed a career criminal out of prison to kill his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter had the guts to stand up to those two jerks. The least I can do 
is do everything I can to try to prevent this from happening to some other 
kid," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at the picnic table he built, Reynolds came up with the idea of 
imprisoning habitual felons for much longer terms and went to his assemblyman, 
Bill Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a Republican, doubted that he could get Reynolds' idea through the 
Democrat-controlled Assembly. But he agreed to try, and enlisted a Democrat, 
Jim Costa of Fresno, to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds arrived at the Capitol for the bill's first hearing April 20 with 
four busloads of people from Fresno. One Democratic assemblyman refused to meet 
with him. Another agreed to meet him, but said upfront that he would not 
support the bill. The measure died at its first committee hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Democratic lawmakers complained that it was written in 
such a way that felons could face huge sentences for property crimes such as 
burglary, even shoplifting in certain instances. 
</P>
<P>
 "They figured they'd listen to me, pat me on the head, say, 'I'm sorry about 
your daughter,' and send me home," Reynolds recalled. He told them: "You are 
the guys responsible for turning these guys loose. Don't you see that? You are 
the enablers." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebuffed, Reynolds decided the solution was to bypass the Legislature and 
pursue a ballot initiative. There the crusade might have ended, no matter how 
strenuous his efforts. Without a lot of money behind them, initiatives do not 
get on the California ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 But in October, Polly Klaas was kidnaped and later found dead. A parolee 
confessed to the crime -- and everything changed. The publicity surrounding the 
case was extraordinary. Pent-up public anger at crime became focused on a state 
seemingly incapable of keeping habitual criminals in prison. It was a mighty 
force seeking an outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 The outlet's name was "three strikes and you're out." 
</P>
<P>
 It became almost a mantra, repeated in the newspapers, on talk radio and on 
television. In a burst of recognition, hundreds of thousands of people signed 
Reynolds' initiative petitions. Politicians from California to the White House, 
keen to the message, wrapped themselves in the "three strikes" concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and Costa revived their bill, and by last Monday, it was on the verge of 
passing its final committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, Sen. Art Torres, a Los Angeles Democrat, wanted to amend it. It was 
an apple-pie idea. State fiscal analysts had calculated that the bill would 
cost billions. Torres' amendment sought to ensure that some of the money would 
get spent on crime prevention. Torres got the votes and the amendment was added 
to the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds, sitting in the committee room as he had done half a dozen times this 
year, was not sure what the lawmakers were up to. He stood and said he wanted 
to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators generally do not allow people from the audience to speak when they 
are in the midst of a debate. But Reynolds had attained special status. The 
senators gave him the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we start adding amendments," Reynolds told them, "it's going to open a 
Pandora's box. . . . It will also demonstrate to me at least the inability of 
the Legislature to act in a responsible way." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds went on to point out that the November elections were nearing. One of 
the senators protested that Reynolds' words sounded like a threat. Minutes 
later the committee rescinded the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres got up from his seat, walked to Reynolds and whispered into his ear, 
smiled and shook his hand. Later, Reynolds said, Torres told him that he was 
only trying to improve the measure and that he supported the bill. The Senate 
gave Jones' bill final legislative approval on Thursday, sending it to the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature that had rolled its eyes at his proposal last year now treated 
him with deference. Polling had showed that 80% of the state's voters liked 
Reynolds' idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds still fears that lawmakers will find some way to undermine the 
legislative version of "three strikes." Even though the law Wilson will sign 
today is virtually identical to the initiative, Reynolds intends to deliver his 
petitions to county clerks today for a vote on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does Reynolds trust the prosecutors and criminal justice experts who say 
there are ways to write a more focused statute that would ensure only violent 
felons would be locked up for life. Even Jones, the author of the bill, 
believes it could be made better. 
</P>
<P>
 In less than a year, Reynolds' life has been transformed. Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown, who earlier this year said Reynolds was motivated by crass 
political gain, has invited him to appear on Brown's new television show. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has invited him to the White House. He and Sharon, a 
Veterans Administration nurse, have been featured on ABC's 20/20 news magazine 
and in People magazine. He has had offers to run for office and to work for the 
passage of other initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarvis, Gann and Lightner all were swept up by events in this "electronically 
driven media state," Cain said. In the process, they became national figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will have the option and the temptation to continue in this mode," Cain 
said of Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 John Stoos, director of the Gun Owners of California, one of the strongest 
pro-gun lobbies in Sacramento, makes it his business to keep track of the 
goings-on at the Capitol. When Reynolds showed up last April with four busloads 
of people from Fresno, Stoos was there to introduce himself. Later, the group 
gave Reynolds $40,000 for his initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably the closest thing to Paul Gann I've seen since 1978," Stoos 
said. Come 1996, Stoos said, he hopes to enlist Reynolds in an initiative that 
gun owners hope to place on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul had a knack with the press. Whether they agreed with him or not, he was 
a great quote," Stoos said. "That's a talent that some people have. It's rare. 
I saw it in Paul. I see it Mike." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds would trade it all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish somebody else would have done this and I would have a daughter," 
Reynolds said. "If I could, even knowing that this law would save a lot of 
lives, if I could go back and have my daughter and not have this bill and not 
have this notoriety and just go back to life the way it was, I'd do it in a 
heartbeat. But that is not real. What we have to do is go on with the cards 
that have been dealt." 
</P>
<P>
 As he sits in his back yard, a squirrel climbs down a pine tree, and Reynolds 
hands it a peanut. He recalls how Kimber spent hours feeding them. The phone 
rings, as it does constantly, and interrupts the memory. 
</P>
<P>
 A local banker is offering a $1,000 contribution. Reynolds does what any good 
and gracious politician would do. He tells the banker that he will be appearing 
at a radio station later that day for a talk show and news event. If the banker 
would like, he could show up and publicly present the check. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a lot of pressure on me and suggestions that I run for some 
political office. I am emphatic about resisting it, to this point," said 
Reynolds, a Republican. "The thing that has driven this is my daughter's death. 
To use that for some personal gain for me would be a real travesty." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, in the dining room, there is the old piano, damaged in a flood. He 
reworked it into the dining room table. On it, he and his wife spread the 
mementos of their daughter: a kindergarten picture, a snapshot of Kimber as the 
proprietor of a front-yard lemonade stand, a plastic bag with a baby tooth and 
a sugar-and-spice note to the tooth fairy offering her 17 cents so the tooth 
fairy could give the pennies to some other child who might need it more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fresno High School yearbook is opened to the page with a black-and-white 
ocean scene and the words: "Remember me with a kind word or deed. Then I will 
live forever." The Class of '93, the one that followed hers, dedicated it to 
Kimber Reynolds.

L.A. STREET PARTY CELEBRATES THE MARATHON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN and ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 19,000 people ran, walked and wheeled themselves through the streets 
of Los Angeles on Sunday, turning the city's ninth annual marathon into a 
gigantic street party for spectators, a traffic quagmire for motorists and a 
showcase for extraordinary willpower. 
</P>
<P>
 And the rabbit won. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's Paul Pilkington, who was hired as the event's "rabbit" to pace the 
field of elite runners, instead crossed the finish line first with a time of 2 
hours, 12 minutes and 13 seconds. Mexican-born Olga Appell, who became an 
American citizen last week, was the first woman across, with a time of 2:28:12. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilkington, 35, said he kept going after 15 miles because he felt good running 
in the cool, moist morning air that turned out to be perfect for a marathon, 
and not bad for a spectators' bash either. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't come with me," Pilkington said of the top runners he assumed 
would eventually pass him. "Tactically they made a mistake by not keeping up. I 
didn't decide to stay in until the 15th or 16th mile." 
</P>
<P>
 But Italy's Luca Barzaghi, who came in second, said he expected Pilkington to 
drop out after 20 miles and was upset to learn he did not. So sure was Barzaghi 
that he had won that he had already chosen the color of the Mercedes that the 
first-place finisher wins along with a $15,000 prize. Poland's Andrzej Krzyscin 
finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's more compelling story, as always, was the thousands of other 
marathon participants who took to the streets of the city, setting off outside 
the Coliseum to the blasting refrains of Randy Newman's "I Love L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 1 million people lined the route, proffering refreshments, 
holding signs and balloons and yelling at runners to keep moving, it wasn't 
much farther, and they were really lookin' good! 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan, accompanied by boxing legend Muhammad Ali, fired the 
starter's gun. "Ali! Ali!" runners chanted as they strode by. 
</P>
<P>
 The runners came in all ages and in nearly every physical condition, in every 
get-up from slick running gear to bunny ears, midriff tops and what looked like 
an armadillo suit. Some pushed their children in aerodynamic strollers, while 
the wheelchair competitors pushed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wheelchair division, Frenchman Phillipe Couprie and Australia's Paul 
Wiggins tied as winners. They came in first by hard work and together by choice 
-- they held hands as they crossed the finish line side by side. 
</P>
<P>
 And for those few who thought that running 26.2 miles was not quite enough 
pain, Sol Wroclawsky, 40, was dragging a wheeled steel contraption called the 
"Riksha Runner" that he said adds six pounds of resistance. (There was no word 
on whether Wroclawsky, attempting his first marathon in 14 years, made it 
across the finish line.) 
</P>
<P>
 The marathon course looped and wound its way through 14 of the city's 
neighborhoods -- from Exposition Park, through Downtown, up Sunset Boulevard, 
to Hollywood, Koreatown, through the heart of the city's Central American 
community and back to the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 city streets were closed for the race, creating a maze of detours 
that clogged the streets with motorists desperately seeking a way around. 
Several freeway exits were blocked, turning the Harbor and later the 
quake-beleaguered Santa Monica Freeway into virtual parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time we have this many closures, it screws up the entire city," Los 
Angeles police Capt. Sandy Wasson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Los Angeles appeared to feel that the chaos was worth it -- at least 
for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good duty. You get to meet a lot of nice people," said Officer Martha 
Lopez of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority police. She does not run, 
"at least not on purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the runners crested a hill on Wilshire Boulevard heading to Koreatown, 
Kim Eun Soo stood happily clapping her hands. "Jal han da!" she said, again and 
again. Her neighbor explained that in Korean it means, "Very good!" 
</P>
<P>
 Farther up the road, Jerry Johnson, who had been watching the marathon on TV 
when she realized it was close to her door, was out on the curb yelling, "Pump 
it up! All the way! Come on! Over the hill!" 
</P>
<P>
 In South-Central Los Angeles, Curtiss Copeland, 58, had staked out a corner at 
Mile 24 with a folding chair he had toted from home. "I love it. It's amazing," 
he said. "Especially the wheelchair guys. They come flying by with the power of 
their own. So at least there's hope, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting nearby was Miss Pruiet, who preferred not to reveal her age or her 
first name. "This is exciting because people are up for it," she said. "They 
are friendly. In Los Angeles, how many times do you find people talking to 
people they don't know?" 
</P>
<P>
 More than midway through the course, runner Marlen Mertz was indeed talking a 
lot -- with Ron Ribstein of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "He met up with me along Mile 3," Mertz said. "But we might get married." (She 
later swore it was a joke.) 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing their seven-year tradition, one group of six women friends stayed 
overnight in a Los Angeles hotel and started the race at 6:15 a.m -- more than 
two hours before the official 8:40 start -- because they wanted to make sure 
that they crossed the finish line before the marathon closed down. 
</P>
<P>
 As is their custom, they were walking the entire way. Keeping up a brisk pace 
at the 17-mile mark, they were raving about the quality time the marathon lets 
them spend together, away from ringing phones or people asking them to do 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get to talk to each other for 6 1/2 hours," said Ellen Pearlman, a 
45-year-old psychologist. "The greater the pain, the more interesting the 
story. We talk about guilt, our mothers. We finish stories that we started a 
long time ago and never got the chance to finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the course, runners were serenaded by sidewalk gospel choirs, 
marimba musicians, Taiko drummers, salsa bands and almost every rhythm in 
between. Volunteers held Gatorade and water at arm's length so that runners 
need not slow down to grab a cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, they yell at you if you're not holding it the right way," said 
volunteer Mary Page of the Junior League of Los Angeles. "Or they yell, 'Too 
full!' " 
</P>
<P>
 At the starting line, Paul Rodriguez, a computer consultant from Paramount, 
said a friend gave him the idea of trying a marathon for the first time. "My 
main goal is to get to Hollywood," he said. "Just like everybody else from out 
of town." 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer George Jackson, 27, said when he left his house early Sunday morning he 
only had plans to pick up the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he found the streets clogged with runners and the area around the 
Coliseum in high party gear. Vendors were selling everything from steamed fish 
and foot futons to "therapeutic magnetic jewelry." You could sign up to join 
the Rainforest Action Network or get a free spinal screening. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said the spirit of the event just carried him along. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm running free-lance," he said, jogging in the T-shirt and shorts he had 
left home in. "I run every morning anyway. I figure I'll call my wife after 
about eight miles to come and get me." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, said they would never dream of giving up. This marathon was 
more than a race -- it was a test. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going pretty bad. I'm in a lot of pain," said Phillip Park, 33, as he 
stopped to massage a bad ankle just past the 17-mile mark. "I'm going to 
finish. I have to, to be complete, to be a man." 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly passing Park was Terry Ghiselli, an 18-year-old college student from 
Sunland, who was wincing with pain, complaining of a bad knee. It was his third 
marathon and he was not about to drop out now. If it came to that, he said, he 
would walk the course. 
</P>
<P>
 And even those who could not go the distance vowed to return next year. 
First-timer Adolf Naranjo, 21, of San Fernando dropped out after getting leg 
cramps after 17 miles. He blamed it on long hours working since the January 
earthquake with the Federal Emergency Management Agency helping to process 
thousands of victims' claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "It detracted from my chances of finishing here," he said. "This was really 
important to me. For sure, I'm going to try next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Police reported no major problems along the marathon route. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very exciting but very tame from a law enforcement standpoint," the 
LAPD's Wasson said. Police said the crowd was calm. 
</P>
<P>
 In two cases, very calm. Making a brief detour were two 29-year-old runners 
who were sharing their third marathon -- and a marijuana cigarette, something 
they called a tradition for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do it once before we start, and once at the 17 (mile mark)," Mike said. 
"I'm proud to smoke weed!" his friend, Bruno, said. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, the two shot off and joined the running crowd.

IT'S NERVOUS TIME AS U.S. TROOPS PULL OUT OF SOMALIA; AFRICA: MOST OF THE 
GROUND FORCE WILL BE GONE BY WEEK'S END. THEY LEAVE BEHIND ESCALATING CHAOS AND 
FEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A U.S. Marine sniper team peered through gun sights atop the Empire State 
merchant ship Sunday afternoon, scanning the horizon of a city slipping deeper 
into chaos by the day, as 277 American soldiers flanked by the high-powered 
cannons of two Bradley fighting vehicles quietly marched up the gangplank. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, another ship will dock at Mogadishu's seaport, the Greek cruise 
ship Mediterranean Sky. Also amid strict security, more than 500 U.S. troops 
will march aboard, bound for the Kenyan port of Mombasa and a passenger jet for 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of this week, the bulk of the American ground forces assigned to 
the long and sometimes painful U.S. military mission to help save Somalia from 
self-destruction will be gone -- most of them ferried out by sea in a costly 
yet discreet withdrawal operation designed to limit further U.S. casualties in 
a land where most Americans believe that too many have already died. 
</P>
<P>
 At an added cost of about $13 million, the ferry service is "an additional 
measure of protection" against "somebody who might like to take a parting 
potshot" at a more visible American target in the air, said Army Col. Steve 
Rausch, the U.S. military spokesman here. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-security naval withdrawal marks the first time the United States has 
redeployed its forces in such a way since the Vietnam War, according to 
Military Sea Lift Cmdr. David Heim. 
</P>
<P>
 For many in the Somali capital, that fact is symbolic of the escalating chaos 
and fear that the U.S. military is finally leaving behind. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Somali gunmen have ambushed civilian aid workers and U.N. 
positions with increasing frequency. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in months, Somali militiamen tried to fire a rocket grenade 
into the sprawling U.N. compound in Mogadishu late Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Half an hour later, two pickup trucks packed with armed Somalis opened fire on 
a checkpoint manned by Egyptian soldiers. The Italian Embassy was attacked 
several hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most dramatic illustration of the spiraling violence and 
accompanying jitters now surrounding the American pullout came just hours 
before the U.S. troops marched onto the Empire State. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Marine sharpshooter at Mogadishu's airport, where the last of the 
American troops are bunkered waiting to go home, spotted a Somali teen-ager 
pointing a pistol at an Egyptian sentry about 300 yards away. The Marine fired 
a single round from his M-40A1 rifle, wounding the boy holding the gun and 
fracturing the skull of another Somali youth standing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The pistol, U.S. military sources later confirmed, was a toy. 
</P>
<P>
 Somalis injured during such incidents in the past routinely were taken to the 
sophisticated U.S. Army field hospital for emergency treatment. But that 
hospital officially closed on Saturday as part of the American redeployment. 
</P>
<P>
 So the wounded boys, both about 15 years old, were taken to the Romanian 
military hospital, which turned them away. A Romanian doctor explained that his 
hospital was closed for decontamination on Friday after an outbreak of viral 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys were finally taken to the Egyptian field hospital, which had to 
transfer one of them to the Pakistani field hospital because it was not 
equipped with an X-ray machine. 
</P>
<P>
 At the heavily guarded Mogadishu seaport, there were few signs of that chaos 
as the troops boarded the Empire State for home. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, most of the troops seemed satisfied that they were leaving after a job 
largely well done. 
</P>
<P>
 None wished to speak about last year's prolonged, U.S.-led military hunt for 
Somali warlord Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid, which climaxed last Oct. 3 in a 
bloody firefight that left 18 American soldiers and hundreds of Somalis dead 
and reversed U.S. policy in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 After the battle, President Clinton abandoned the U.N.-sanctioned hunt for 
Aidid, who was the prime suspect in an earlier massacre of 24 Pakistani 
peacekeepers, and ordered a massive military buildup to cover America's 
withdrawal before March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The pullout is expected to be completed a week early. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the troops would comment on widespread criticism that the U.S. 
military intervention in Somalia was, at best, a setback in America's efforts 
to define its role in a new world order at a time of growing regional 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see a lot of starving Somalis dropping off like flies," said Lt. Col. 
Keith Stafford, commander of the 4th Aviation Battalion, who insisted on 
shaking hands with every soldier under his command as they approached the 
gangplank of the Empire State on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see hundreds of thousands of healthy Somalis now. We did something that 
needed to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his soldiers seemed to agree. 
</P>
<P>
 With each handshake, the colonel asked each one, "Did you have a good time 
here?" Typical responses included: "Yes, sir," "It was better than Saudi 
Arabia" and "Well, I'm feeling pretty good right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Warrant Officer Mike Lamee, 28, a helicopter pilot from South Dakota, 
preferred a nonverbal response. Protruding from his backpack was a teddy bear 
and a large American flag his wife had mailed to him last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The flag pretty much says it all," Lamee said. "Duty, honor and country. 
That's what it stands for. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who make the decisions, I believe in them, or else I wouldn't be 
here in the first place."

SINATRA COLLAPSES ONSTAGE, IS IN HOSPITAL BRIEFLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON and DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legendary entertainer Frank Sinatra walked out of a Richmond, Va., hospital 
early this morning, two hours after he was wheeled into the emergency room 
following his collapse onstage as he was singing "My Way" during a concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank Sinatra became overheated and passed out for a few moments onstage," 
his publicist, Susan Reynolds, had said earlier. "Mr. Sinatra's vital signs are 
stable, he is talking and he is alert." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors performed some tests before the 78-year-old Sinatra left the Medical 
College of Virginia Hospitals, a hospital spokesman said. He was driven off by 
limousine to the airport, where an airport police officer said he departed in 
his private plane. A band member said Sinatra had earlier planned to return to 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before, Sinatra waved weakly and blew a kiss to the crowd as he was 
taken offstage in a wheelchair, concert-goers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took 10 years off my life," said his son, Frank Jr., who was conducting 
the orchestra as his father fell onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a terrible shock when it happened, but it looks pretty good," he said 
of the diagnosis. He said his father was conscious while at the hospital and 
discussed his condition with medical personnel. Frank Jr. said doctors are 
trying to determine whether his father became dehydrated under the hot stage 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Sinatra was to have stayed overnight at the hospital for 
observation. He was wheeled into the emergency room on a gurney as he arrived 
at the hospital about 10:20 p.m. Richmond time. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinatra had been nearing the end of the performance and was in the last verses 
of his trademark "My Way" when he fell off a stool and hit his head on a stage 
speaker, according to drummer Gregg Field, who was about five feet from the 
singer when he collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he just fainted," Field said. "He was very warm on stage, sweating 
real hard. It was hotter than hell in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Sinatra had complained about the heat earlier in his performance at the 
historic Richmond Mosque, where he was giving the second of two weekend shows, 
Field said. 
</P>
<P>
 He had launched into "My Way" when, according to Field, "he said, 'Boy, get me 
a chair. I'm feeling faint.' " Frank Jr., who was conducting the orchestra, 
went for a chair. Sinatra, who was already sitting on a stool, started to rise, 
then collapsed and his face hit the speaker, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics were on the stage immediately to help him, while the audience stood 
and watched in silence, Field said. He said Sinatra was coherent by the time 
paramedics tried to give him oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said: 'Get that thing away from me. I don't need it,' " Field said. "They 
put him in a wheelchair and he waved to the audience and blew a kiss." 
</P>
<P>
 Sinatra, who has been performing for nearly six decades, was in New York last 
week to accept a Grammy legends honor at the music awards Tuesday night. He was 
to perform in Hershey, Pa., later in the week, but those shows were canceled 
because the entertainer was stranded in New York by a snowstorm, Field said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sinatra made it to Richmond, where his Saturday and Sunday performances 
sold out the 3,667-seat theater, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Field said orchestra members were told that Sinatra was still planning to go 
ahead with concerts planned later this month in Oklahoma, Illinois and 
Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinatra, who has made more than 100 albums, released "Duets" last fall, and it 
reached the top 10 in the Billboard charts. He also has appeared in 58 feature 
films, including "From Here to Eternity," which won him an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 Theater worker Jody Hunsaker said Sinatra had looked fine when she watched him 
sing "Luck Be a Lady" earlier in the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sounded wonderful," Hunsaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great show," Field said. "It was one of our best in a long time."

NEWS ANALYSIS; FOES EXPLOIT BROWN'S OMISSION ON SCHOOL CRIME ISSUE; CAMPAIGN: 
IN TV AD, CANDIDATE FAILS TO MENTION HER TENURE ON L.A. BOARD OF EDUCATION. 
RECORDS SHOW SHE VOICED CONERN ABOUT CAMPUS VIOLENCE IN THE '70S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Television viewers who watch state Treasurer Kathleen Brown's ad on school 
safety will learn a few things about the Democratic gubernatorial candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, Brown has grown children. "When my kids were little," she says 
in the ad, "my big worry was they'd get hurt during recess." For another, she 
is fed up with crime in schools. "Now, 12,000 kids a day bring guns to school. 
It's an outrage," she says, before proposing a few solutions: boot camps for 
juvenile offenders, "real" after-school programs and anti-drug education. 
</P>
<P>
 What viewers will not learn from the 30-second spot is that Brown has nearly 
five years of experience wrangling with school issues -- not as a mother, but 
as a member of the Los Angeles school board from 1975 to 1980. Since the ad hit 
the airwaves late last month, Brown's opponents have been eager to point that 
out, seeking to show that her record as a board member contradicts the 
proposals she is making in her bid for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathleen Brown's Rhetoric vs. Reality," began a one-page critique of Brown's 
safe schools ad that Gov. Pete Wilson's campaign sent to reporters. Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi faxed information about Brown's allegedly 
"disastrous" record to the media and then skewered Brown in public last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Kathleen Brown's kids were little and attending L.A. schools, she . . . 
was an elected member of the school board," Garamendi told several hundred 
members of Town Hall, a nonpartisan civic group meeting in Los Angeles. "When 
she had the chance to stop rising school violence, she failed." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not such attacks have merit, they indicate that school violence is 
an issue that every gubernatorial candidate wants to claim. The specter of 
danger in the classroom marries two of the greatest concerns to California 
voters -- crime and education. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna Lucas, a Republican political consultant, said Brown's safe schools ad 
may be a "preventive strike" in the battle for control of a thorny issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is very vulnerable on the death penalty," said Lucas, referring to 
Brown's contention that even though she personally opposes capital punishment 
she can vigorously enforce the law. "There are some who believe that if she can 
define the crime issue on school safety, on issues she has some credibility on, 
that could help her." 
</P>
<P>
 Does Brown have credibility on the school safety issue? It depends on whom you 
ask. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown's school safety ad premiered, George Gorton, Wilson's campaign 
manager, was quick to point out that as a school board member, Brown had 
opposed the use of undercover officers to track down drug dealers on school 
campuses. Gorton did not mention that Brown's opposition was short-lived. After 
becoming convinced that campus drug use was widespread, she changed her 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is a sick, sick situation" when police must infiltrate school 
campuses, Brown told The Times in 1975. But if traffic cannot be otherwise 
controlled, she added, the police were the best antidote. "Who else," she 
asked, "is left?" 
</P>
<P>
 Darry Sragow, Garamendi's campaign manager, promptly claimed that Brown "has 
the rare distinction of having been sued by the attorney general of the state 
of California for failing to protect students from a rising tide of violence in 
the Los Angeles school system." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the distinction was not so rare. The 1980 lawsuit, filed by 
then-Atty. Gen. George Deukmejian, listed as defendants eight city, county and 
school governmental bodies and 32 individuals, including Mayor Tom Bradley, 
Dist. Atty. John K. Van de Kamp, Police Chief Daryl F. Gates and all members of 
the school board, City Council and County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, which alleged that it was "cruel and unusual punishment" to force 
children to attend violence-scarred schools, was dismissed -- a fact that 
Sragow's blistering facsimile did not mention. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the minutes of school board meetings during Brown's tenure, the 
48-year-old grandmother has been voicing concern about school violence since 
the 1970s. She established a policy of zero tolerance for violence on campuses, 
proposed a standardized record-keeping system to assess the scope of the 
problem and, in 1979, declared reduction of campus violence her top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some (school administrators) have said: 'Don't make a big deal of violence' 
and 'Let's not focus on the negative,' " The Times quoted Brown as saying. 
"Until the powers that be -- administrators, the board, law enforcement -- 
focus attention on this problem, we won't get the resources and energy 
committed to its reduction." 
</P>
<P>
 How much she accomplished toward that goal -- and how much could fairly be 
expected of her -- is difficult to assess. Even today, no school board has 
licked the problem of crime on campus, and educators hold out little hope that 
administrative bodies can do it alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to view the safety problem as a community problem, not just a school 
problem," said Mary Bergan, president of the California Federation of Teachers, 
which has endorsed Garamendi. "Because if we view it only as a school problem, 
we'll never get safe schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Garamendi and Wilson camps note that during Brown's years on the 
school board, crime on campuses went up. According to the Los Angeles Unified 
School District's school police, the number of robberies, assaults and sex 
offenses in public schools rose during that period, even as enrollment fell. 
But Michael Reese, Brown's campaign spokesman, said Brown should not be judged 
harshly based on the statistical increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her record overall shows that she was proactive on this issue. What was 
missing in those years was any help from Sacramento while John Garamendi was 
serving as a legislator," said Reese, who last week sent reporters a biting 
facsimile of his own titled: "10 Things John Garamendi Doesn't Want You to Know 
About His -- and Kathleen Brown's -- Safety Record." 
</P>
<P>
 So, why does Brown's ad not even mention her time on the school board? Reese 
indicated that future ads will discuss her record in detail. "Stay tuned," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Tom Hayden has said he will not use 30-second ads in his 
gubernatorial campaign because the format is too brief to truly educate voters. 
Brown's school safety ad is an example of how the format can be confusing. In 
it Brown says: "We've got to get the violent kids out of here -- into boot 
camps -- so that those who want to learn can." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Brown does not support boot camps for juveniles who have committed 
violent crimes. She has called for the creation of a statewide network of boot 
camps for first-time nonviolent offenders and has proposed disciplinary 
academies for troubled nonviolent students. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese acknowledged that the ad is confusing. "It's technically accurate," he 
said. "In her education speech she talks about disruptive violent kids that 
have no place remaining in classrooms. There are two alternatives under her 
plan, either boot camps or disciplinary academies." But he reiterated that 
juveniles convicted of violent crimes would not be eligible for boot camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the one statistic Brown used in her ad -- "12,000 kids a day bring 
guns to school" -- has sparked some curiosity. Reese said the number came from 
an August, 1993, report, "Weapons in Schools," published by the National School 
Safety Center based in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ronald Stephens, executive director of the center, said that although the 
number is "probably pretty good" for the state of California, he has never 
published it in his reports because he lacks the data to support it. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese said the statistic in the ad was an estimate derived from the 1987 
National Adolescent Student Health Survey, which was excerpted in the "Weapons 
in Schools" report. That survey found that nationally, as many as 100,000 
students carry a gun to school every day. Based on its proportion of national 
population, California's share is about 12,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brown's policy addresses on crime and education, she has made several 
proposals to remedy crime in schools. Among them: $50 million a year for 
anti-drug education programs, $75 million a year for after-school programs, 
in-school mentoring programs and disciplinary academies for first-time juvenile 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two of Brown's proposals -- creating gun-free school zones that 
provide tough penalties for those who carry guns within 1,000 feet of a school, 
and trying violent teen-age criminals as adult offenders -- also appear on 
Wilson's list of safe school priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is proposing, among other things, to expand the attorney general's 
weapons hot line statewide to report guns on campus and to enhance penalties 
for selling or giving a handgun to anyone younger than 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, like Brown, is an advocate of boot camps for nonviolent offenders. 
As a legislator, he authored bills that funded drug prevention programs and 
expanded gang violence suppression programs. He believes that idleness is one 
of the major causes of juvenile criminal activity, and he is an outspoken 
supporter of more funding for after-school programs.

HONIG IS OUT OF OFFICE BUT STILL IN SCHOOL; EDUCATION: FORMER SUPERINTENDENT OF 
PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TEACHES AT A UNIVERSITY AND TUTORS FIFTH-GRADERS. MEANWHILE, 
HE APPEALS HIS CONVICTION ON CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST CHARGES. 
</P>

<P>
 Fifth-graders compete for the attention of the balding, bespectacled tutor in 
the open-collar, blue-and-green plaid shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how to do this," complains one about a math problem. "I need 
help, too," pleads another. A third lightly tugs on the tutor's clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the hubbub of a crowded classroom in the heart of the city, the tutor, 
former state schools chief Bill Honig, bends his 6-foot, 4-inch frame over a 
desk to help one of the puzzled youngsters figure out the mystery of decimals. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're on the right track," he says. And, finally, with familiar Honig gusto, 
he forcefully exclaims: "You've got it!" 
</P>
<P>
 Forced to resign his office after his conviction last year on 
conflict-of-interest charges, Honig found a sanctuary from his legal troubles 
among the racially and ethnically diverse student body at the Dr. William Cobb 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, these kids are just as eager to learn as anybody," Honig says, waving 
his hands at the wide-eyed students whose school is just a short walk down the 
hill from his home on the edge of fashionable Pacific Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 His experience at Cobb, Honig says, provides him "a sense of reality. You 
start to forget after awhile, so it's good to come back" into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 In the year since his conviction, the former superintendent of public 
instruction has plunged back into the mainstream of the education reform 
movement, mixing his real-world experiences with academic theories. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his weekly court-mandated community service at Cobb, Honig is teaching 
at San Francisco State University, consulting and writing papers. His 
enthusiasm for school improvement is undimmed. 
</P>
<P>
 But he continues to devote considerable energy to clearing his name, seeking 
vindication through a court appeal. To help defray his legal bills, estimated 
at nearly $400,000, Honig raised about $91,000 last year, according to state 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 He left office after a Sacramento jury found him guilty of authorizing 
$337,509 in state contracts for local educators to set up parent involvement 
programs with the Quality Education Project, a nonprofit organization run by 
his wife, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Honig, 56, said his wife remains on the QEP board of directors but is not 
involved in day-to-day operations. He said she has established another group 
that has encouraged parent involvement in Mexican schools. 
</P>
<P>
 He was not sentenced to jail but was ordered to do 1,000 hours of community 
service, pay a $10,800 fine, serve four years probation and pay restitution of 
nearly $275,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence was suspended pending the outcome of his appeal. An unrepentant 
Honig maintains that he committed no crime, though he acknowledged that his 
actions might have been "dumb" or "stupid." 
</P>
<P>
 Honig is especially bitter about the restitution provision, saying he likely 
would be forced to sell his house or his share in a winery partnership in order 
to raise the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Honig repeated his contention that Republican Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren pursued 
the case as a favor to Honig's conservative critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining to discuss the specifics of the case, Lungren responded: "I have 
faith in the system. I'm sorry he doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Honig still has his share of admirers. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent San Francisco education summit sponsored by Assembly Speaker 
Willie Brown, Honig was greeted warmly by longtime friends and well-wishers, 
including a 24-year-old Mountain View teacher who shook his hand and said the 
former schools chief inspired him to become a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, across town at Cobb Elementary, Honig was met with equal 
excitement by students who begged him to assist them with their math. 
</P>
<P>
 "I happen to love fifth-graders because they are just so open," Honig said. 
"You can stimulate them so easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though his sentence was suspended pending his appeal, Honig said he 
decided to bank the hours and continue going to teacher Stephen Riave's 
33-pupil class. 
</P>
<P>
 "They love him," Riave said. "He's not afraid to get his hands dirty." 
</P>
<P>
 Honig said that in Riave's classroom he is reminded of the reforms he sought 
as superintendent. Honig noted that he pushed for more reading of books, not 
just textbooks. "Even though they are strapped for funds, you'll find more 
children's literature in the classroom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also acknowledged disappointments, citing the inability of many 
children to read at their grade level. 
</P>
<P>
 Honig's rise to prominence began in 1975 when then-Gov. Edmund G. (Jerry) 
Brown Jr. appointed him to the State Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a wealthy advertising man, Honig practiced corporate law before 
quitting to take up teaching at an inner-city school and later earned a 
master's degree in education. He became superintendent of a small but wealthy 
Marin County school district before he was named to the state board. 
</P>
<P>
 Honig still displays the same single-minded passion, outspokenness and 
inexhaustible energy that marked his tumultuous decade as superintendent of 
public instruction. In Sacramento, he gained a reputation for arrogance, but in 
the classroom Honig easily bantered with the schoolchildren about everything 
from homework to a classic Disney cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Even stripped of the bully pulpit of the $102,000-a-year superintendent's 
post, Honig has sought ways to make schools more accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 He was appointed to a $60,000-a-year visiting professorship at San Francisco 
State University and helped launch an education reform center there. 
</P>
<P>
 Honig, who is eligible for a $40,800-a-year state pension when he turns 60, 
also is consulting on education issues. He is negotiating a trip to South 
Africa as part of a World Bank team to review how that nation can consolidate 
its school system as it dismantles apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he interacts with a group, he makes them think in new ways," said 
Henrietta Schwartz, dean of the School of Education at San Francisco State. 
"And Bill is the eternal optimist. He sees opportunities where others may see 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Honig stopped short of acknowledging that there was a silver lining to losing 
his superintendent's job. But he admitted that there was a "benefit to me as an 
educator. . . . I got a chance to read a lot, visit a lot . . . it's like a 
self-education." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding his continuing pursuit of education reform, he vowed: "If they (the 
courts) won't let me do it one way, I'll just do it another way."

RUSSIA'S FACTORY FAILURES RAISE FEARS FOR THE FUTURE; REFORM: TEXTILE 
INDUSTRY'S DEMISE UNDERSCORES A DILEMMA FOR YELTSIN. SITUATION PROMPTS 
COMPARISONS TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION OF THE '30S. 
</P>

<P>
 Larisa Baranova comes to the gates of the March 8 Weaving Factory every day 
with her 3-year-old son and the desperate hope that maybe, just maybe, this 
time the plant will pay her the three months' salary it owes her. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far, there's only silence," she said, swallowing tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Silence, too, reigns in the eerie factory halls lined with top-grade weaving 
machines, now idled, draped in cloth and looking as if there are oversized 
corpses beneath. One month ago, the March 8 Weaving Mill, the pride of Soviet 
technology, the recipient of the Red Labor Banner award for performance and the 
envy of many a foreign visitor, ground to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The collapse of Russian industry is visible to the naked eye," said 
Vyacheslav Mityunin, the plant's deeply depressed chief engineer. "And the end 
is not in sight." 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of factories like the March 8 mill lies at the crux of the Russian 
government's dilemma over the next stage of economic reform. Russia's gross 
domestic product plummeted by 20% in 1993, prompting comparisons with America's 
Great Depression of the 1930s and raising the question of just how much further 
it can drop before popular resentment explodes in violence and widespread 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 The strict, Western-oriented young economists of former reform chief Yegor T. 
Gaidar's school argue that Russia's outmoded factories must be left to sink or 
swim on their own. Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, a more conservative 
pragmatist, has vowed to make stemming Russia's plunge in production this 
year's top priority, even if that means issuing government subsidies and loans 
that would stoke inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin, in his first State of the Nation speech to the new 
Parliament recently, left the issue blurry. He acknowledged that under current 
taxes and conditions, "the only thing an enterprise can do honestly is die." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the drop in Russia's industrial production accelerated to a 
hair-raising annual rate of 23% in the last two months, Yeltsin offered no new 
strategy except to propose that the government decide which one-tenth of the 
country's factories are strategic and help only them. 
</P>
<P>
 If that is, indeed, the line Yeltsin takes, with no further aid for industry, 
then the great textile mills of Ivanovo, a region of 1.5 million people east of 
Moscow, may be doomed. Dominated by women workers, the weaving mills, some here 
say, may soon be on the verge of a babby bunt -- a women's rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are hungry -- they eat only potatoes and bread," said chief engineer 
Mityunin. "We have a husband and wife who both work here and they have three 
kids, and they've gotten two-thirds their December pay and nothing since then. 
It's a horror, a catastrophe." 
</P>
<P>
 The March 8 mill, with its 1,500 workers, is only one of almost 50 textile 
factories in the Ivanovo region, the textile heart of Russia for three 
centuries. Almost all the Ivanovo plants are in the same plight, so despairing 
-- Ivanovo's cloth production has dropped by 60% since 1991 -- that they have 
asked the Kremlin to declare the region an "economic disaster zone." 
</P>
<P>
 The mills' troubles started when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, 
jeopardizing the supply of cotton from Central Asia, said Alexei Shiganov, 
chief specialist at Ivtex, the association of Ivanovo textile factories. In 
1992, cotton prices shot up, and by the time Ivanovo plants could persuade the 
government to lend them money to buy it, there was almost none left. 
</P>
<P>
 So their output dropped radically. And when the factories' loans came due in 
early 1993, they had to borrow more -- this time at 213% interest. Now they are 
all "up to their ears in debt," Shiganov said, unable to pay not only interest 
but salaries, energy bills and suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Factories such as March 8 are so deep in the red that their suppliers have 
refused to deliver any more raw material until they are paid -- and without 
cotton to weave, the plant has nothing to do. Added to its troubles are 
skyrocketing energy costs, competition from cheap new Asian imports and 
long-overdue bills from its own customers. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps worst of all are the taxes, loads so heavy it seems to directors 
as if the government is intent on suffocating its own producers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm strangled by taxes to the point that I don't have enough left for 
cigarettes," said Stanislav Kuznetsov, director of the Polyot parachute-weaving 
factory in Ivanovo where output has been cut in half since 1990. "They take 
taxes for every time we breathe." 
</P>
<P>
 Shiganov calculated that in addition to the 30% to 40% tax on profits 
factories must pay, 19 other levies are imposed on them, to the point that only 
10% of their profits remain. "We work just for taxes," said Mityunin of March 
8, which was named for the International Women's Day holiday celebrated in 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 By all indications, the financial difficulties of most Russian factories, not 
only those in Ivanovo, are snowballing. The Russian Statistics Committee 
reported last month that unpaid wages more than doubled in January, now 
amounting to more than 1.6 trillion rubles (in excess of $1 billion). About 
30,000 factories owe wages to workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Baranova, the weaver at March 8, said she had been paid only 30,000 rubles -- 
about $20 -- in the last three months. The factory kindergarten has closed and 
city day care is overcrowded, so she must care for her son as she looks 
hopelessly for another job. Her husband, another March 8 employee, also is on 
unpaid vacation. "I don't know how we'll live," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ivanovo factories, where clattering cloth machines once ran 24 hours a 
day, virtually all have slashed their workweeks and shifts, sent employees on 
unpaid vacations and radically cut output. There is nowhere for Baranova to 
find another job. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the unions of the Ivanovo region formed a strike committee. They 
do not want to strike, labor leader Antonina Kurzina said. But if factories 
keep dying, things could come to a head. If unemployment goes up by 1% more, 
the regional compensation fund will run out of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonid Ivanov, assistant industry overseer for the regional government, said 
he did not think things would reach the point that the long-suffering people of 
Ivanovo would take to the streets. Unless, he added, the government made no 
efforts to help and virtually all the factories fell idle -- the crunch could 
come by this fall. "When I see a factory where all the equipment is standing 
idle, I get goose bumps," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanovo's leadership has been lobbying Moscow to make the textile industry a 
higher priority, but their chances there, too, are dim. "At the same time that 
we appeal, the coal miners are appealing, the oil workers are appealing, the 
communication workers are appealing," said Yuri Kuzmin, economics editor at the 
local newspaper, Ivanovskaya Gazeta. "Who really deserves preference?" 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not the textile workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuznetsov of the parachute factory said he would be satisfied if the 
government at least paid its own debts on time. He said the military has gotten 
so slow in paying that he has threatened, "I'm going to give up making 
parachutes and go into making women's brassieres." The answer he gets back: "Go 
right ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still working, that's all I can be proud of," he said. "We just have to 
get through this year and next year will be easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Will it, though? "The drop will continue because there's nothing to raise it 
with, our cotton has run out," said Shiganov of Ivtex. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gaidar school's hopes that factories would quickly adjust to the market by 
shifting to profitable products look painfully unrealistic from the 
frighteningly silent shop floors of Ivanovo. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Kuznetsov, whose parachute factory still runs, said he has started 
putting out camouflage uniforms. But he cannot compete with clothing factories 
that specialize in shirts or coats. 
</P>
<P>
 So it makes sense for him to adopt a wait-and-see attitude and hope for 
government help instead -- exactly what the Gaidar team did not want. None of 
the factories in Ivanovo is declaring bankruptcy, none is being put onto the 
auction block; all are advertising their misery and waiting for a response. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ivtex, only 14% of workers were laid off -- another sign of the 
wait-and-see attitude and another wrong response from the Gaidar perspective. 
"Maybe that's our problem," said Viktor Sokolov, editor of Ivanovskaya Gazeta. 
"We're used to expecting that tomorrow or the day after, someone will come and 
save us."

UKRAINE WARHEADS ARRIVE IN RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A heavily guarded train carrying nuclear warheads along a secret route arrived 
in Russia this weekend as part of a deal to scrap deadly arms based on 
Ukrainian soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's Itar-Tass news agency quoted high-ranking nuclear experts as saying 
the warheads would be dismantled by Russian companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine, left with about 1,600 warheads on its territory when the Soviet Union 
fell apart in 1991, agreed to ship them to Russia for destruction under a deal 
sealed when President Clinton visited Russia and Ukraine in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The January disarmament deal offered Kiev cash and enriched uranium to run its 
nuclear power stations in exchange for agreement to hand over the warheads. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine promised to transfer at least 200 nuclear warheads to Russia within 10 
months and turn over the rest of its nuclear stockpile "in the shortest 
possible time." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Ukraine's 46 SS-24 missiles should be deactivated within 10 
months by having their warheads removed.

AMERICAN ALBUM: TOURISTS MAKE SMALLEST POST OFFICE A BIG DEAL; TOOLSHED-SIZED 
FLORIDA ATTRACTION HAS NO BATHROOMS, GATORS -- JUST A FEW SNAKES. BUT IT MAKES 
MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a state bursting with major tourist attractions, this may be the least of 
all. Still, the tour buses pull up, the visitors get out, and one at a time 
they step into the smallest post office in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most common -- and usually the first -- question," Postmaster Naomi Lewis 
said, "is: 'Do you have a bathroom?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the answer is no. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis barely has room to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for 41 years this onetime toolshed -- measuring 8 feet, 4 inches by 7 
feet, 3 inches -- has served the people who live on islands of high ground amid 
Florida's swampy interior near the Big Cypress National Preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 200 families whose mail is delivered out of Ochopee are Native 
Americans of the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of how Ochopee -- a misspelled Native American word meaning big 
field -- got to have its own ZIP code -- 33943 -- and an official designation 
as the nation's smallest post office begins with a roaring fire in 1953 that 
destroyed the general store that once housed the post office. 
</P>
<P>
 According to local historian Maria Stone, a shed used to store irrigation 
pipes was dragged to the roadside to serve as a temporary mail drop until the 
store could be rebuilt. Of course, the store was never rebuilt and Ochopee, 
once an area known for its tomato farms, never grew. 
</P>
<P>
 And anyway, the tiny post office soon became so popular that no one cared. 
</P>
<P>
 Located on the Tamiami Trail (U.S. 41), 35 miles east of Naples, Fla., and 70 
miles west of Miami, the tiny white building next to the flagpole stands alone 
and conspicuous against the forested green background, and makes a natural stop 
for passers-by. Many people buy a 25-cent picture postcard of the building and 
a 19-cent stamp, then dash off a message to someone at home. Lewis hand-cancels 
it on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Lewis said, she often fields the second-most common question: 
Do you get alligators in here? 
</P>
<P>
 No. Alligators, abundant in the surrounding wilderness, are not permitted 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Snakes are another story. While technically not permitted inside either, 
several snakes have slithered in over the years. But Lewis said efforts to seal 
the baseboards of the tin-walled hut may have halted the intruders. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its dollhouse look, the Ochopee post office is a working, full-service 
station, offering Express Mail, money orders and packaging materials, stored in 
an attic-like compartment above Lewis' head. 
</P>
<P>
 And the place is a money-maker, according to U.S. Postal Service spokesman 
Marty Roberts. The Postal Service pays $25 a month in rent for the building, 
while taking in an average $5,000 each month in revenue. That more than covers 
the salaries of Lewis, one contract mail carrier and the electric bill, Roberts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ochopee office is cost-effective, it generates a lot of publicity and it 
demonstrates our concern to provide universal service," Roberts said. "It is 
also valuable as the answer to a trivia question." 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, the Postal Service sponsored a nationwide search for small, 
free-standing post offices and found two to rival Ochopee. One was in Salvo, on 
North Carolina's Hatteras Island. But it was destroyed in 1992 when torched by 
an arsonist. Although rebuilt and restored, it is now a piece of history and 
not a working post office, according to Postal Service clerk Linda Hooper. The 
residents of Salvo now get their mail from nearby Rodanthe, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The other contender was in Birds Landing, a California town of 28 residents 
located about 20 miles northeast of San Francisco. Although that post office 
delivers mail to only nine families and has an annual revenue of less than 
$8,000, by Ochopee standards the building is Grand Central Station. "We're 6 
feet by 24 feet," said Shirley Paolini, postmaster for 26 years. "We even have 
a lobby where you can sit down." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the Ochopee post office has been featured many times in print 
and on television. The former postmaster, Evelyn Shealy, was also a notary 
public who performed 19 marriages here. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis says she does not have time to marry anyone. She is too busy sorting 
mail and hand-canceling tourist postcards and boxes of mail carted out from 
Miami or Naples by people who just want the Ochopee postmark on their 
correspondence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I meet a lot of interesting people, from all over the world," she said. "I'd 
say the only drawback is that sometimes I get something like tennis elbow from 
all the hand-canceling. But my job -- oh, I love it."

LEADING DISSIDENT LEAVES BEIJING AMID CRACKDOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 China's most famous dissident left Beijing suddenly Sunday, a day after he was 
released by police after a brief detention. 
</P>
<P>
 Wei Jingsheng's abrupt disappearance came as the official New China News 
Agency accused him of violating his parole, and police extended a crackdown on 
dissidents by taking away a prominent student leader of the 1989 Tian An Men 
Square protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Wei's secretary, Tong Yi, told reporters that the veteran activist had 
departed voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she did not know if police had advised Wei to leave before this 
week's visit by Secretary of State Warren Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 Wei, a stirring political essayist who publicly challenged Chinese Communist 
leader Deng Xiaoping during the 1978-79 democracy movement, was released from 
jail in September after serving 14 1/2 years of a 15-year prison term, much of 
it in solitary confinement. 
</P>
<P>
 The conditions of his parole are said to include a prohibition against 
participating in political activities or publishing articles on political 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 But soon after his release, Wei reassumed his position as leader of the banned 
opposition, defying authorities by meeting openly with foreign reporters and 
allowing new essays to be published abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's top human rights envoy, John Shattuck, said the Chinese 
justification for Wei's detention was not sufficient reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individuals free on parole, whatever their formal continuing obligations to 
police and judicial authorities, ought not to be denied an opportunity to 
express their views peacefully," said Shattuck, who was in Hong Kong on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Wei met with Shattuck and reportedly urged the U.S. government to 
be tough with China on human rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
 China's recent roundup of opposition voices sparked a furor in the Clinton 
Administration only a week before Christopher is scheduled to arrive in Beijing 
to meet with Chinese leaders on human rights issues.

 The latest incident occurred Sunday. Zhai Weimin, who served a 3 1/2-year 
sentence for his pro-democracy activity in the Tian An Men Square movement, was 
taken away by four people outside a Beijing university, according to Wang Dan, 
another student leader from 1989.

 Some recent detainees have been released after about 24 hours. Others have yet 
to be freed.

 Qian Yumin, a dissident who was freed late Saturday after being held for four 
days, said police had cautioned him not to make trouble during Christopher's 
visit.

GREEK ACTRESS, POLITICIAN MELINA MERCOURI DIES AT 70; FILMS: FAMOUS FOR HER 
'NEVER ON SUNDAY' ROLE, LUNG CANCER CLAIMS FIRST WOMAN TO HOLD A SENIOR CABINET 
POST IN ATHENS. 
</P>

 Melina Mercouri, the throaty actress who rocketed to international fame as the 
good-hearted prostitute Illya in "Never on Sunday" and went on to become 
Greece's passionate minister of culture, died Sunday in New York. She was 
believed to be 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercouri, a heavy smoker who had been treated for lung cancer for the last 
five years, died of the disease. She underwent surgery last month to remove a 
tumor on her lung and slipped into a coma Saturday at New York's 
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The first woman to hold a senior Cabinet post in Greece, Mercouri served as 
culture minister from 1981 to 1989 and returned to the post last October, when 
Andreas Papandreou's Socialist government resumed power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Greece today mourns the death of Melina, a brave fighter, an important 
artist, a wonderful human being," Prime Minister Papandreou said. "It laments 
the loss of a woman who through her art and her struggles made her name one 
with the name of Greece." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Mercouri's most ardent campaigns was for the return to Athens of the 
famous Elgin Marbles, priceless statues removed from the Parthenon in the early 
19th Century and housed in the British Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will never stop on the Elgin Marbles," the fiery, green-eyed Mercouri 
declared last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "The marbles are part of a monument to Greek identity, part of the deep 
consciousness of the Greek people -- our roots, our continuity, our soul. The 
Parthenon is like our flag," she told The Times in 1983 after personally 
viewing the historic statuary in London. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you ask me will I be alive when they come back," she said in 1988, "yes, I 
will be alive. And if I'm not alive, I will be reborn." 
</P>
<P>
 Mercouri herself became something of a monument to Greek identity because of 
her remarkable political accomplishments and her successes on the stage and 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Her 1960 film "Never on Sunday," by American director Jules Dassin, her 
husband, established the actress as a prototypal Greek and was credited with 
launching tides of tourists toward Greece. 
</P>
<P>
 The film won her the Best Actress Award at the 1960 Cannes Film Festival and 
an Academy Award nomination for what Variety termed "a brilliant execution of a 
larger-than-life character." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Mercouri was reluctant to take on the role of the hedonistic 
harlot who teaches a priggish American male tourist, played by Dassin, about 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought of myself as a tragic -- a serious -- actress," she said at 
the time. "I was sure I wouldn't know how to go about playing comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Born into a wealthy Athens political family on Oct. 18 in years listed by 
various biographies as 1922, 1923 or 1925, Mercouri was christened Melina for 
the Greek word meli , or honey. The name was given to her by her devoted 
grandfather, who was mayor of Athens for three decades. Her father was a 
legislator and interior minister. 
</P>
<P>
 When her family objected to her interest in acting, at age 17 she married the 
wealthy older Athenian businessman Panayiotis Harokopos to escape their 
control. She enrolled in the Academy of the National Theater, where she spent 
three years studying classical Greek tragedy. Her marriage ended after a few 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercouri began her career on stage, earning prominence with her role in Eugene 
O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra." 
</P>
<P>
 She made her film debut in 1954 in the title role of "Stella" by the Greek 
director Michael Cacoyannis, which won her the Best Actress Award at Cannes in 
1955. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercouri met Dassin at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival and began their long 
professional and personal partnership. Their first film was "He Who Must Die," 
in which she had the role of Mary Magdalene. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who married in 1966, went on to "Never on Sunday," then "Phaedra" 
in 1962 and "Topkapi" in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she disdained Hollywood, Mercouri made scores of films in Greece, 
France, Italy, Spain and the United States and graced stages throughout Europe 
and America. Among her other films were "A Man Could Get Killed" in 1966, 
"Promise at Dawn" in 1970 and "Once Is Not Enough" in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercouri swung from entertainment back to her political roots in 1967, when a 
junta took over Greece. Vociferously joining the resistance, she was stripped 
of her citizenship and her property and spent the next seven years living in 
exile in Paris and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 48 hours after the junta was toppled in July, 1974, Mercouri was back 
in Greece. She helped to found Papandreou's Panhellenic Socialist Movement. 
</P>
<P>
 She is survived by her husband, Dassin.

BOSNIAN CLAIM OF SERBS' BOMBING MUSLIM BRIDGE QUESTIONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A NATO jet swooped over a besieged northern town Sunday after Bosnian state 
radio claimed Serbian warplanes destroyed a bridge in an attack similar to the 
one that provoked NATO retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bosnian Serb troops barring access to Maglaj, there was no way for NATO 
or U.N. officials to visit the site to check the claim that planes attacked the 
Muslim-held town about 40 miles north of Sarajevo. But officers from the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization raised questions about the report. 
</P>
<P>
 Squadron Leader John Jeffery, a NATO spokesman in Naples, Italy, said early 
warning aircraft did not detect any air attack on Maglaj. "If we had, we would 
have taken action," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a raid would be a flagrant violation of the "no-fly" zone imposed by the 
U.N. Security Council over Bosnia. It would also be a challenge to NATO, which 
has been patrolling the zone since April and has begun showing a new resolve to 
act forcibly against warring parties in the former Yugoslav state. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago, two U.S. Air Force F-16 fighters shot down four Bosnian Serb 
fighter-bombers in central Bosnia that U.N. officials said were attacking 
Bosnian government targets. 
</P>
<P>
 A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said visibility was too 
poor when the two bombing runs reportedly took place for accurate attacks on a 
bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO reconnaissance aircraft also flew over the area around the time the 
second bombing run was reported but saw nothing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs ridiculed the Muslim-led government's claim, accusing the 
Bosnian army of faking an air strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been no (air) bombardments of Maglaj," said a statement from the 
Bosnian Serb military in Banja Luka. "The so-called Army of Bosnia-Herzegovina, 
following its old recipe, sets fire to heaps of old tires, wishing to create an 
impression of bombardment of the town." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian radio and neighboring Croatia's HINA news agency said Serbian planes 
targeted Maglaj's only bridge, which spans the Bosna River, and destroyed it. 
HINA said its story was based on reports from ham radio operators in Maglaj. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Rasim Delic, commander of the Bosnian army, reported the alleged bombing 
to Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, commander of U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia, and 
demanded "more effective" NATO action. Bosnian radio said Serbian artillery 
also shelled Maglaj after the air attack. 
</P>
<P>
 With the nearly 4-week-old Sarajevo cease-fire between Bosnian Serbs and 
Muslim-led government forces under strain, the U.N. chief representative in the 
former Yugoslav federation, Yasushi Akashi, flew to Sarajevo for talks. 
</P>
<P>
 He met with Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic in Pale east of Sarajevo and 
later in the capital with Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi said he made progress toward reopening Tuzla's airport, which has been 
kept closed for much of the nearly 2-year-old war by shelling from Bosnian Serb 
artillery.

EX-WATERGATE PROSECUTOR RUFF IS REPORTED TO BE FRONT-RUNNER FOR NUSSBAUM'S JOB; 
POLITICS: CLINTON AIDE CALLS THE 54-YEAR-OLD ATTORNEY A 'PERSON OF DISTINCTION' 
BUT GOES NO FURTHER. NAMING OF SUCCESSOR EXPECTED SOON. 
</P>

<P>
 As the furor over the Clinton Administration's handling of the Whitewater 
investigation raged across the Sunday TV talk shows, the White House appeared 
to be narrowing in on a replacement for presidential counsel Bernard Nussbaum, 
who resigned under fire for his actions during the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior Administration official said the White House will pick a successor 
soon and said former Watergate prosecutor Charles F. C. Ruff had emerged "as 
the clear, clear front-runner for the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other White House sources, the official cautioned that no final decision 
had been reached. "In this game there is no guarantee until it is over," he 
said. But he added: "Charles Ruff is pretty far along with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about those remarks, Ruff said Sunday: "You're way ahead of me," adding 
that he "was not in a position to talk about this." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview on CNN's "Late Edition," White House Chief of Staff Thomas 
(Mack) McLarty on Sunday described Ruff as "a person of distinction." But he 
added: "I'm not going to get into any specific individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum resigned Saturday after it was reported last week that he had 
participated in three meetings between White House aides and Treasury 
Department officials supervising the Resolution Trust Corp.'s investigation of 
a failed Arkansas savings and loan owned by the Clintons' business partner in 
the Whitewater land development. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Republicans escalated charges that those meetings raised the 
specter of a "cover-up" and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not forget that Richard Nixon turned a third-rate burglary into a 
constitutional crisis by not leveling, by interfering in the investigation," 
said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) on ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley." "I 
think the President is getting deeper into a hole. If the President continues 
to have officials of the regulatory agencies over to the White House to brief 
staff, if the President continues to have White House counsels interfere in 
investigations, that can quickly become obstruction of justice if you're not 
careful about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Also appearing on the program, George Stephanopoulos, senior adviser to the 
President, said the Administration doesn't believe "anything unethical 
occurred" during the meetings between White House and Treasury Department 
staffers and that "no specific information about the substance of the 
investigation was provided at all." The purpose of the meetings, was to discuss 
how "to handle the press inquiries" about the controversy, Stephanopoulos said. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Stephanopoulos conceded, "the meetings probably should not have 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Vice President Al Gore acknowledged Sunday that "mistakes have been 
made" in the White House's handling of the investigation. "Whatever mistakes 
were made," he said on the NBC-TV's "Meet the Press," "there is an aggressive 
determination to make absolutely certain that there is no interference of any 
kind." 
</P>
<P>
 As a successor to Nussbaum, a longtime friend of the Clintons, the President 
should pick someone beyond his inner circle, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan 
(D-N.Y.) counseled Sunday. The person should be "someone who is not a friend of 
anybody working there now, but is a friend of the institution of the 
presidency," he said on CBS-TV's "Face the Nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The senior Administration official said it was unrealistic to demand that 
Clinton appoint to the job someone he doesn't know. Instead, he argued, the 
test should be whether "you can imagine a President other than Bill Clinton 
appointing (the person) to the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Administration appeared poised to nominate Ruff, a 54-year-old 
Washington attorney who served in the Justice Department under Jimmy Carter, as 
deputy attorney general. But the appointment unraveled after Ruff revealed he 
had failed to pay Social Security taxes on a housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision came after the Administration withdrew the nomination of Zoe 
Baird to be attorney general in the wake of revelations that she had failed to 
pay Social Security taxes on a housekeeper who was an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, though, the Administration has nominated about two dozen other 
officials who had failed to pay required taxes on household help; in each case 
the nominee paid up the back taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), appearing separately on CNN, 
reiterated the GOP's calls for congressional hearings on the Whitewater 
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan had earlier rejected such calls, saying such hearings would only 
interfere with the investigations of Whitewater special counsel Robert B. Fiske 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an interview on the ABC program, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), 
himself under investigation for alleged ethical lapses, cracked open the door, 
saying "we'll take a look" at hearings.

TEXAS-SIZED HEALTH CARE PROBLEMS OFFER PROS, CONS OF REFORM POLICY; MEDICINE: 
ALMOST 26% OF LONE STAR STATE RESIDENTS UNDER 65 HAVE NO HEALTH COVERAGE. YET 
MANY SAY THE PRICE OF COVERING EVERYONE MAY BE TOO HIGH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Texas Medical Center in Houston, the nation's largest and richest health 
complex, pours $4 billion a year into cutting-edge research and care. Insured 
patients at Houston's Methodist Hospital are met with valet parking, uniformed 
bellhops and a 24-hour concierge. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas has more multimillion-dollar magnetic resonance imaging machines than 
the entire country of Canada -- and Houston has even more than Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet in West Texas, there is a county the size of Connecticut that does not 
have a single primary-care doctor. Better than one in four Texans under age 65 
has no health coverage. Third World diseases are rampant along the Mexican 
border. At Houston's public hospital, it is not unusual for a seriously ill 
patient to have to wait 24 hours for a bed. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be difficult to imagine a place that better embodies the breathtaking 
achievements of modern American medicine -- and its tragic failures -- than 
Texas. That is why this state offers a unique road map of the opportunities and 
the pitfalls that lie ahead as President Clinton and Congress seek to come up 
with a way to fix what is wrong with the current system while preserving what 
is right. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have here is a plan (Clinton's) that has some very good parts and 
some other parts that are just not doable in Texas," said Dr. Robert Tenery, 
president of the Texas Medical Assn., one of the most powerful and conservative 
statewide physicians organizations in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 No state welcomes Clinton's promise of universal coverage more eagerly. Almost 
26% of Texans under 65 have no health coverage -- nearly the worst record of 
any state. One out of every 10 uninsured Americans is a Texan. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many here say they fear that the price of covering everyone could be too 
high -- particularly if the state's employers, which have only just begun to 
shake a decade-long economic downturn, are forced to bear the brunt of it. 
</P>
<P>
 And a plastic card guaranteeing access to health coverage is useless if there 
is nowhere to take it, as is true across vast stretches of this sprawling 
state. Nor will it cover the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants whose 
care cost state and local governments in Texas $94 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
 While polls show strong public sentiment here for major change in the health 
care system, it remains to be seen whether most people will be willing to give 
up their current insurance. Cost-saving concepts such as health maintenance 
organizations and managed care, in which consumers are limited to networks of 
doctors who offer cut-rate prices, have only begun to take root in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of Texans who have coverage are not at all sure they want to give 
up what they see as unrestricted access to the best that medical science has to 
offer -- particularly if it is in favor of a program that comes to them from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people in Texas, probably as much or more than any other place in the 
country, are very skeptical of a government that's coming to give us 
something," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.). "We have not found government to be 
a bearer of great gifts." 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm said no one opposes universal health care coverage in principle. "The 
problem is how to pay for it," he said, "and how to find the sources of paying 
for it in a way that does not disrupt the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas economy is built on small, low-paying, non-union firms -- the very 
kind that are unlikely to offer health coverage as an employee benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, many poor, non-working Texans must go without coverage because 
the state has one of the nation's stingiest Medicaid programs. A single mother 
with two children does not qualify for Medicaid if she earns more than $2,200 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the uninsured do get health care, and it is often in the 
expensive setting of the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs of treating the uninsured show up in the inflated prices that 
hospitals charge their insured patients and in the strained budgets of state 
and local governments. Medicaid spending alone has grown by more than one-third 
since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paying for health care is killing us," Democratic Gov. Ann Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration says its reforms would help by controlling health 
care costs generally and requiring businesses to pay up to 80% of the cost of 
insurance for their workers. Altogether, it says, Texas would save at least 
$3.3 billion between 1996 and the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials are dubious. Richards said she wonders whether the net result 
would be additional costs for Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Her doubts are echoed by other state officials. "We're certainly leery of the 
numbers," said Democratic state Sen. John T. Montford of Lubbock, chairman of 
the chamber's Finance Committee. "I think it's going to be significantly more 
costly than what they are anticipating." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as troubling to many Texans is Clinton's plan to shift the primary burden 
for health care costs to businesses. His proposed requirement that employers 
dedicate up to 7.9% of their payroll costs to workers' health coverage is 
sending shudders through a state where three-quarters of the work force can be 
found in businesses that employ fewer than 100 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas is only beginning to recover from the oil bust of the early 1980s, and 
people here take seriously the National Federation of Independent Business' 
dire warning that employer mandates could cost the state over a million jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Summers provides a case in point. As proprietor of a small welding 
business in Austin, he was paying $911 a month for health insurance for his six 
workers until a few bad breaks -- a drug-abusing employee, a problem birth and 
Summers' own wife's chronic illness -- more than quadrupled his rates and 
forced him to cancel his policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Summers, 61, made two trips to Washington in 1992 to plead with congressional 
committees to make health coverage more affordable. Now that he has seen the 
White House proposals, he wonders if he should not have left well enough alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Clinton's idea has taken our request for help and turned it into a gun to 
our heads," he said. He estimates that the burden of paying 7.9% of his payroll 
for health insurance (his company's average salary is slightly too high to 
qualify for federal subsidies) would wipe out two-thirds of his profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Texans also wonder whether having a plastic card entitling them to health care 
will make much difference to people in the 87% of the state's counties that, 
according to the Texas health commissioner, do not have enough medical 
facilities and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 In Leakey, the seat of Real County, for instance, people must drive 45 miles 
to the nearest Wal-Mart store just to get a prescription filled. Those too sick 
or poor to make the trip must hope that one of their neighbors happens to be 
listening when the pharmacist uses the public address system to ask if anyone 
in the store can deliver the medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lose people. They die from lack of medical services," County Judge G.W. 
Twilligear said. 
</P>
<P>
 Susie Casillas, now five months pregnant, has almost miscarried three times -- 
and in each emergency has had to drive 65 miles from her home in Sonora to the 
nearest obstetrician in San Angelo. "We have a nice operating room in our 
hospital" in Sonora, she said, "but it's used for storage." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Clinton plan has incentives for doctors and other medical workers 
to practice in underserved areas, officials in the state doubt that an adequate 
health care network would rise from the dust in the vast expanses of rural 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless Dairy Queens are going into the business of health care, we've got a 
problem," state Health Commissioner David R. Smith said. "There's nothing else 
out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor has experience inspired rural Texas' confidence in any system that comes 
from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quarter of a century that Dr. Jim Bob Brame has practiced in the West 
Texas town of Eldorado, he has been known to drive 90 miles to make a house 
call in Crockett County. Mostly, though, sick people try to go to his 16-bed 
hospital, with its emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, when Brame admitted a 76-year-old rancher who had pneumonia 
and lived alone 25 miles outside of town, Medicare disallowed the expense as 
unnecessary. "Those types of things make us very, very skeptical of anything 
the government is running," Brame said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community health centers and public hospitals now struggle to fill the gaping 
holes in the fabric of the Texas health care system. Their budgets could shrink 
dramatically if Washington cuts back federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas' public hospitals could lose $1.2 billion in "disproportionate share" 
payments -- government subsidies for institutions that provide large amounts of 
free care. While the amount of free care would drop sharply under universal 
coverage, public hospital officials said many needy people would continue to 
show up in their waiting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could pull out all the underpinning and the whole system could collapse," 
said R. King Hilliard, director of government relations for Houston's Harris 
County Hospital District. 
</P>
<P>
 Also of concern to Health Commissioner Smith is the fate of public health 
spending. The Clinton proposal calls for many initiatives but does not 
guarantee funding for them.  
</P>
<P>
 "In Texas, we have the biblical diseases," Smith said. "We have plague, TB, 
leprosy and rabies, and they're epidemic. Even a plastic card, an emergency 
room and access to a CAT-scanner aren't going to fix those. It will take good 
water, sanitation and a public health infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
 DeAnn Friedholm, Texas' Medicaid director and a member of the task force that 
helped devise the Clinton plan, said Texas' diversity makes it the most 
difficult state to implement health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, she said, referring to Clinton's proposal: "I'd rather be struggling with 
making that one happen than continuing to struggle with what we struggle with 
today."

THE LOS ANGELES MARATHON; DRIVERS ARE LOSERS AS L.A. MARATHON CLOSES 400 
STREETS, CREATES TRAFFIC CRUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The 26.2-mile Los Angeles Marathon created a virtual chokehold on the city's 
side streets, sending frustrated drivers into a maze-like series of detours and 
jammed freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 400 streets were barricaded along the route, creating a ring 
around Downtown, Exposition Park and parts of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Event organizers, anticipating a crush even worse than in years past because 
of earthquake damage to the Santa Monica Freeway, tried to post detour signs. 
But it often was of little help as ramps or intersections were closed in 
succession over a 12-hour span. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the route is so large, there is no easy way to detour," said Jim 
Sherman, principal transportation engineer for the city Department of 
Transportation. "Logistically, it's just a tremendous job posting detour signs 
along the route." 
</P>
<P>
 That stretched even short commutes into hours for Sunday workers accustomed to 
clear streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like this," said Allison Fisher, whose West 
Hollywood-to-Hollywood commute, normally requiring 15 minutes, stretched to 
almost two hours. "It didn't look like your usual Sunday morning drive. The 
drivers were pretty courteous, but they all had that same dazed look." 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, irate drivers called to complain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been getting them all day," said an officer in the LAPD's Hollywood 
Division. "One woman said she tried to get on a freeway, but her access was 
blocked. It then took her three hours just to get back home. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opinion is just like everyone else's," the officer said. "They should run 
around the Coliseum." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman noted that city officials had tried to ease the problems by informing 
news media of the closures, and posting alerts on electronic message boards on 
surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But that did not help Fisher, who is an anchor reporter for the high school 
newscast Channel One. She left her home near the Beverly Center at 10:05 a.m., 
and headed to Raleigh Studios five miles away, at Melrose and Van Ness avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew the marathon was going on, and I just thought they would have detour 
signs," she said. "They didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Her usual route, 3rd Street, was closed, as was Beverly Boulevard. She tried 
Melrose and Wilshire Boulevard, but both were closed too. It was little 
consolation when she looked in her rear-view mirror and spotted the car of a 
co-worker who was facing the same headache. 
</P>
<P>
 She is not quite sure how, but she finally made it in. At 11:50 a.m.

NASA KEEPS SHUTTLE ON SCHEDULE, WATCHES TROUBLED FUEL LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NASA said Sunday that it does not intend to cut short the space shuttle 
Columbia's 14-day mission -- at least not yet, despite trouble with a fuel line 
connected to a crucial auxiliary power unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it boils down to at this point is that there's still some uncertainty," 
Mission Control's Gregory Harbaugh told the space shuttle crew."There is no 
discussion at this point about any kind of early mission termination." 
</P>
<P>
 For the third day in a row, engineers studied unusually high pressure readings 
from the fuel line. Their best guess was that the line was blocked with ice or 
some kind of contaminant. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Briscoe, mission operations director, said the analysis will continue 
until engineers understand what is causing the readings, which were detected a 
few hours into the flight Friday. The pressure in the line dropped to normal 
after the crew switched to backup heaters Saturday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttle's three auxiliary power units supply power to hydraulic systems 
vital for launch and landing. NASA flight rules require three working auxiliary 
power units, although a shuttle could land safely with one. If a unit failed in 
orbit, a shuttle would have to return to Earth as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia's crew spent Sunday building Erector Set-like structures. The thin 
rods, once snapped together in the form of an oblong tower or space station 
truss, were shaken to see how they would hold up in weightlessness. Researchers 
say the findings will help them build stronger space platforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Control surprised the astronauts with a short video of Friday's 
liftoff that was sent to their laptop computer as part of a high-speed 
communications test.

APPEALS FOR CALM FOLLOW N.Y. RITES FOR SLAIN STUDENT

<P>
 In the wake of a shooting attack on ultra-Orthodox Jewish students, New 
York-area Arab and Jewish leaders appealed for calm Sunday after the funeral of 
a slain Jewish student. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 members of the Hasidic Lubavitch community shut down traffic in 
part of Brooklyn as 16-year-old rabbinical student Aaron Halberstam was 
eulogized as a "sacrificial lamb." 
</P>
<P>
 Halberstam died four days after he was wounded in Tuesday's shooting on the 
Brooklyn Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanese-born taxi driver Rashad Baz, 28, was charged in the shooting that 
wounded three others in a van carrying 15 Hasidic students back from a hospital 
visit. Hlal Mohammad, 32, and Bassam Reyati, 27, both Jordanians living in 
Brooklyn, were charged with hindering prosecution and weapons possession by 
helping Baz dispose of the guns and the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Baz will likely be charged with murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammad Mehdi, head of the American Arab Relations Committee in New York, met 
Sunday with City Councilman Noach Dear, a Jewish community leader, hours after 
Halberstam's funeral. They said the meeting was an attempt at dialogue between 
New York's Muslim and Jewish communities.

MOYNIHAN SEES HEALTH ALLIANCES' DEMISE; INSURANCE: HEAD OF POWERFUL SENATE 
PANEL HAS HOPE FOR OTHER KEY ELEMENTS OF CLINTON PLAN. MORE SMALL BUSINESSES 
MAY ESCAPE EMPLOYER MANDATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In another sign that Congress plans major changes in President Clinton's 
health care reform proposal, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee on 
Sunday almost completely wrote off the prospects for a major component of the 
initiative: the requirement that virtually all Americans join 
government-organized purchasing cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) said the Senate could still pass 
revised versions of two other pillars of Clinton's plan: the requirement that 
employers contribute to health insurance for their employees and price controls 
on health insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 And Moynihan again endorsed Clinton's contention that the final legislation 
must provide health care coverage for all Americans -- though he signaled that 
it might take years to phase in. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's non-negotiable as far as I'm concerned," Moynihan said on the CBS-TV's 
"Face the Nation." "But it doesn't have to happen on July 1 of next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan's comments came three days after House Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.) told reporters that the Clinton plan faced major revisions. 
Like Moynihan, Gephardt indicated that Congress was unlikely to accept 
Clinton's proposal for the cooperatives, known as health alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliances are the centerpiece of the Administration's reform plan. They 
are intended to reduce the cost of health care insurance by allowing consumers 
to pool their purchasing power, but critics maintain that they would diminish 
consumer choice and create a vast new bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked on the CBS program if the Administration's health alliance proposal "is 
probably dead," Moynihan replied: "I think so." 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan cited the analysis of a private group of health care experts that the 
alliances were "too big, too much government" and created too much uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan's opposite number in the House of Representatives, Ways and Means 
Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), struck a contrasting note in a 
separate interview. On ABC-TV's "This Week With David Brinkley," Rostenkowski 
said he was "not going to concede" that the alliances would have to be dropped 
from the legislation -- and if that point arrives, "I'm going to try to get 
something for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Vice President Al Gore repeated the Administration's support for 
the alliances but, as the President did in other interviews last week, also 
signaled flexibility on the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you say you're not going to allow discrimination against people with 
pre-existing medical conditions or discrimination against small-business 
owners, then we think that leads you inevitably toward a kind of purchasing 
alliance," he said on NBC-TV's "Meet The Press." "We've said that if you have a 
better way to do that, let's hear it. We don't think there is a better way to 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan suggested that despite intense opposition from much of the business 
community, a mandate that employers contribute to the health insurance of their 
employees is not dead, as Republicans have recently suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he indicated, the legislation might exempt more small businesses from 
that requirement than Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan also said reports of the demise of the President's proposal to place 
price controls on health insurance premiums were premature. "They may have to 
be a little bit more flexible than the first appearance," he said, "but you 
want to have some . . . downward pressure on prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), appearing on ABC, predicted that the Senate will 
reject the employer mandate and premium caps, as well as the health alliances. 
"I believe that the Democrats do not have enough votes to pass a bill," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rostenkowski was more upbeat about the legislation's ultimate prospects, 
comparing the travails of Clinton's plan to the struggle to pass the sweeping 
tax reform bill of 1986. "You know, I went, in 1986, to about 25 wakes on the 
'86 tax bill," he said. "But I never went to a funeral." 
</P>
<P>
 On another subject, Moynihan offered encouraging words for two ideas expected 
to be included in the Administration's welfare reform package, which also falls 
under his committee's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 He endorsed a plan to phase in Clinton's proposed two-year benefit limit 
beginning with welfare recipients 25 and younger, as the task force drafting 
the Administration's plan is likely to recommend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to hear that we're going to take the young mothers first and maybe 
phase into a system where everybody will be covered."

 Gunmen firing from two taxis and a motorcycle assassinated a senior federal

 The attack appeared to be a hit by drug traffickers. Luis Fernando Correa, 34, 
was the chief investigator for Medellin, a cocaine-trafficking center and

NAIVE OR DEADLY -- 2 IMAGES OF WIFE TO DOMINATE TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Petite and perky, with a turned-up nose, large sparkling brown eyes and a 
sassy short hairstyle, Mary Ellen Samuels seems to radiate suburban 
wholesomeness. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet she is about to go on trial for hiring a hit man. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hi, Muffin," remarked a friend recently, waving at Samuels, 45, from the 
front row of a Van Nuys courtroom. "She's so darling," she added to another 
court watcher. 
</P>
<P>
 To defense attorney Philip Nameth, Samuels is "naive and gullible and nice." 
But the prosecutor, Deputy Dist. Atty. Jan Maurizi, uses other choice words: 
greedy and manipulative and callous. 
</P>
<P>
 As Samuels' trial starts this month in Van Nuys Superior Court, the charges 
include murder, attempted murder and soliciting murder. If the seven men and 
five women on her jury find Samuels guilty of deliberately killing her husband 
and her hit man for financial gain, she could become the fifth woman among the 
381 convicted killers on California's Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Maurizi is alleging that greed and a pending divorce motivated 
Samuels to hire a gunman to kill her husband of nine years, 40-year-old motion 
picture cameraman Robert B. Samuels, who had worked on the television series 
"China Beach," as well as the "Lethal Weapon" features and "Heaven Can Wait." 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 8, 1988, he was ambushed inside the Sepulveda house the couple once 
shared, and shot in the head with a 16-gauge shotgun. There was no sign of a 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, Mary Ellen and her 18-year-old daughter Nicole called the 
police, saying they had found his body in the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 "The picture that I have of her is she was really pretty pampered by her 
husband," Maurizi said. "She was well taken care of. Her child was in private 
school. I think she already had what the average American would consider the 
good life. But half of it wasn't going to be good enough for her." 
</P>
<P>
 About six months after Samuels' slaying, a botany professor on a nature hike 
found the body of the suspected hit man, a 27-year-old reputed cocaine dealer 
named James Bernstein, who had been dumped in remote Lockwood Canyon in Ventura 
County. Maurizi alleges that Samuels had to hire two other hit men to do away 
with Bernstein when he asked for more money to buy a car, and threatened to go 
to the police if she didn't pay him. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys Nameth and Josh Groshan will tell the jury a different 
story. They contend that Bernstein, who carried a business card calling himself 
"James R. Bernstein, specialist," was utterly smitten with the Samuels' 
daughter. He acted on his own when he killed Robert Samuels, motivated by anger 
and revenge. Nicole, the defense says, had told Bernstein and others that 
Robert Samuels, her adoptive father, had raped her. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Samuels is likely to testify, and her story of family abuse will 
play a key role in the defense case, Nameth said. "Bob Samuels closed more bars 
than most bartenders," Nameth said. "When he drank, he would become abusive." 
</P>
<P>
 As for who had Bernstein killed and why, the defense attorneys say their list 
of people with strong motives is a long one that includes drug customers and 
suppliers -- but not Mary Ellen Samuels. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men who admitted killing Bernstein will testify against Samuels under plea 
bargains that spared their lives, but sent them to prison for 15 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 That killing was botched and messy. The admitted hit men -- Paul Edwin Gaul 
and Darrell Ray Edwards -- had been drinking beer all day. First they tried to 
strangle Bernstein, but it generally takes three to five minutes of constant 
pressure to accomplish that, and he managed to squirm out of the car. So, they 
tackled him on the side of the road and broke his larynx, according to court 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other people Samuels once considered her closest friends also will 
testify for the prosecution under grants of immunity to protect them from being 
charged after admitting their involvement in the alleged murder plots. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense contends that Samuels was not only physically and psychologically 
abused by her husband, she was sold down the river by a flock of "fair-weather 
friends" who implicated her to save their own skins. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are doing what many people would do," Nameth said. "When the 
finger is pointed at them and the pressure comes, they roll over. It is an easy 
way to solve a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Each one of the former friends testifying against Samuels owes her money, 
Nameth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi said she doesn't believe that Samuels or her daughter were ever 
abused, adding that she has been unable to find any doctor's or police reports 
to substantiate the claims. 
</P>
<P>
 The Samuels' marriage broke up in 1987 when Mary Ellen moved out on him, 
taking the refrigerator and leaving a five-page "Dear John" letter. She set up 
housekeeping in a condominium in Reseda. For a while, according to court 
records, Robert Samuels expected them to reconcile. But reconciliation was far 
from Mary Ellen's mind. She wanted him out of her life -- permanently, she told 
friends who testified at her preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 She told people "that she hated him and that he abused her and her daughter 
and she wanted him done," longtime friend Heidi Dougall recalled during a court 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to prosecutors, she didn't want to give up their investment -- a 
Subway sandwich franchise she managed on Van Nuys Boulevard in Sherman Oaks -- 
or the $1,600 that Robert Samuels paid in support each month. 
</P>
<P>
 He stopped making those payments two months before he died. 
</P>
<P>
 During the second half of 1988, Samuels spoke openly about her plans to rid 
herself of her husband, and offered the job to several people -- even 
approaching Nicole's high school friends, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole, then a senior, turned to a friend in the cafeteria at Alemany High 
School, and asked for help in finding a gun, Maurizi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend, Celina Krall, recalled at an earlier hearing that Nicole "asked if 
I could get a gun so someone could take care of her father. She was tired of 
him beating her mother and raping them. She said she wanted to get rid of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Nameth called that scenario nonsensical. "Oh, come on. Be serious," he said. 
"What hit man doesn't carry his own gun?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Maurizi says Samuels did not seek out "the typical, Hollywood-style hit 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 She allegedly had to look no farther than the friends and lovers of her 
daughter and best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Mary Ellen Samuels asked Celina's brother, John, 
and her fiance, David Navarro, if they would be interested in carrying out the 
hit. She then continued to shop for a hit man and, prosecutors allege, finally 
found one. 
</P>
<P>
 About a month before Robert Samuels died, his wife arranged a dinner for him 
and several friends at a restaurant in Northridge. According to court records, 
the plan was to get him drunk and take his car, leaving him confused and 
vulnerable to the hit man who would stalk him in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hit man never showed. Robert Samuels took a taxi home and Samuels 
complained bitterly to a friend that she and her hired hit men had "tried to do 
him" three or four times, Dougall testified at the preliminary hearing. "She 
said she'd spent almost $15,000 and nothing happened." 
</P>
<P>
 And later, Samuels allegedly became so frustrated that she took matters into 
her own hands, beating him with a pink broomstick, according to court records. 
The incident led to the charge of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense contends that the pink broomstick, the alleged lethal weapon, was 
a dog toy. 
</P>
<P>
 Other plots involved getting Robert Samuels drunk and driving him off a cliff 
along Mulholland Drive, Dougall said, but they never progressed beyond the 
planning stage. 
</P>
<P>
 If the whole tale seems incredible, many of Samuels' friends didn't want to 
believe it, either. Hatched in some of the San Fernando Valley's best-known 
bars and restaurants, the murder plot seemed to be an open secret in some 
circles of the Valley's newly divorced. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday night always was rock 'n' roll night at the Tickets lounge at the 
Woodland Hills Marriott, where Marsha Hutchison met Samuels in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone would talk about their divorces," complaining about being broke, she 
said. Hutchison was taken aback, however, when Samuels asked her for a loan to 
pay for a hit man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought she just flipped out, had cracked up," Hutchison testified in 
court. She told Samuels that "she should quit saying stuff like that in 
public." 
</P>
<P>
 Just before Christmas, 1988, Hutchison testified, she received a call from 
Samuels. "She said something terrible had happened. Bob was dead. She said he 
had been shot in the head. I threw up in my bathroom sink," Hutchison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, nobody wanted to talk about what had happened to Robert Samuels. 
And, no one went to the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Marie Hambly, once a friend of Samuels and now a key prosecution witness, 
explained why: "Things don't happen like this. I didn't know of anybody who had 
ever concocted or dealt with something like this before. It's not something I'm 
used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ellen Samuels seemed very much the distraught spouse after she found her 
husband's body and initially, police didn't suspect her. But as the leads she 
gave officers fizzled, Samuels collected about $500,000 worth of insurance and 
went on a shopping spree, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 She paid $50,000 cash for a new white Porsche, bought a $130,000 condo in 
Cancun, Mexico, and was photographed lying, come-hither style, on a bed -- 
wearing only strategically placed stacks of $50 and $100 bills. The defense and 
prosecution are expected to argue before Judge Michael Hoff over whether the 
photograph is too prejudicial to show the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Bernstein began feeling the heat of the police investigation. He 
was crazy about Nicole, but Nicole told friends that while she once had been 
involved with the older man, she was just stringing him along, according to 
court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole has not been charged in the case and her status as a witness is likely 
to be the topic of a hearing Wednesday, according to attorneys involved in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense would like her to testify on behalf of her mother, but the 
prosecution is fighting the use of a witness who will probably invoke her Fifth 
Amendment right not to testify against herself during cross-examination. The 
trial is scheduled to begin March 21. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts of the Samuels case are such an odd brew of the banal and the 
bizarre, that jurors may have difficulty suspending their disbelief, prosecutor 
Maurizi acknowledges. "It's hard to imagine another fellow human being being 
that callous," she said. "I think her appearance adds to that sense of 
disbelief. That's part of what boggles the mind -- that these people actually 
exist in our world, our Valley, and not just up on the movie screen."

WHEEL ESTATE; RECOVERY: WHEN THE JAN. 17 QUAKE STRUCK, SOME WENT FROM 
3,000-SQUARE-FOOT LUXURY HOMES TO 32-FOOT MOTOR HOMES. AND DESPITE THE CRAMPED 
CIRCUMSTANCES, THEY ARE DOING JUST FINE.

 It's more Sedan De Ville than Hooverville, located -- after all -- in the 
upscale Devonshire Country Estates section of Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, it is still one of scores of makeshift encampments from the Jan. 17 
earthquake that tumbled without prejudice the homes of the rich, the poor and 
the comfortable. Like thousands of the newly homeless, these folks have a 
renewed appreciation for privacy, the flush toilet and the hot shower; they 
string extension cords to draw electricity from nearby homes, cook their meals 
outdoors and face weeks or months on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, they look to be going nowhere fast. 
</P>
<P>
 But put away the hankie, stick the casserole back in the freezer, cancel the 
bake sale. 
</P>
<P>
 This group of a dozen or so have gone from 3,000-square-foot luxury homes to 
32-foot motor homes and they are doing fine, thank you, under the 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're learning now to live in close quarters," said resident Linda Gutierrez, 
who is sharing a rented RV with her husband, 14-year-old daughter and 
9-year-old son while workers repair their home. "It's less privacy; everybody 
was used to their own room and having a family room and a den. Now, we have 
basically one room." 
</P>
<P>
 And a narrow one at that. But inside the 32-foot Executive motor home, 
Gutierrez's son, Kris, has put a sign showing the family's resignation to their 
circumstances: "Motorhome Sweet Motorhome." 
</P>
<P>
 More evidence is tacked to the side of the RV's fridge -- the school lunch 
menu and a birthday party invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Up front, behind the driver's seat, is the Gutierrez living room, complete 
with TV and videocassette player. At night, it's the couple's bedroom. The kids 
sleep a few feet away, just past the kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 For a family used to separate TVs, separate rooms -- the luxuries of private 
space -- the changes have been dramatic, but not without some benefit, 
especially for the children who must relearn the basics of sharing and 
compromise, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly we are part of a group of people who are displaced," said Gutierrez, 
whose black BMW is parked next to the family's temporary home. "For us, it's a 
reality check. We are experiencing a way of life that is permanent for many 
others. For us, it is temporary." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, Bill Bowser is less philosophical about his new RV lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 6-foot-4 with a 5-foot-10 bed . . . I can't sleep worth a damn," said 
Bowser, an electrical contractor. "These things might be OK for a weekend, but 
they're too small to live in." 
</P>
<P>
 The new RV crowd in the neighborhood agree that they have more to be thankful 
for than many others left homeless by the quake. Most have earthquake insurance 
that will pay for the bulk of repairs to their homes, which are estimated to 
run between $100,000 and $250,000, as well as the costs of renting the motor 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowser and his neighbor, Beverly Brownell, spent part of a recent afternoon 
explaining why they choose trailer life over renting a nearby house or 
apartment while their homes are being fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, rentals now are not that easy to find. But more importantly, 
they said they want to be close to their homes, watching over repair crews 
during the day and keeping a watch against thieves at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my home, whether I'm in a car or a motor home, I'm staying here," 
Brownell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowser agreed, saying, "Everybody else can leave, but I'm staying here." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors compare notes over the progress of repairs. Bowser got some bad 
news this week -- the last of his two chimneys will have to be replaced. He 
shrugs and Brownell sympathizes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've learned that you can't see the home's internal injuries until you start 
pulling out pieces," she said. "It really is a can of worms." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest benefit, so far, is "we can't feel the aftershocks," said 
Brownell. An optimistic perspective, considering the reason is that everything 
-- from the wind to passing cars to turning over at night -- starts the RVs 
rocking. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gutierrez family got a respite this past weekend when they spent a night 
in a suite at a local hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The brief vacation came after family members had reached a point where "we 
throw up our hands and said, 'I can't do this anymore,' " said Gutierrez. "It 
really gave us a break. There were doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Down the street, retired trucking company owner Tony Sica watched as crews 
slathered stucco over a repair to his garage. Sica's contractor estimates that 
it will be another six months before his house is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Sica and his wife, Mary Ann, sleep each night in the 33-foot 
motor home parked in their driveway. Unlike other retirees, Sica said he never 
once considered using an RV to travel the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really not my cup of tea," said Sica, who logged his share of miles on 
the road during his career. "But I just don't feel like staying in a hotel for 
six months." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than rent, Sica went ahead and bought his new rig, which carried a 
sticker price of about $84,000. He says he may even keep it after his house is 
done. If he sells, he will be able to advertise low mileage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked it up from a place on Sepulveda and brought it home," he said. 
"About seven miles. That's all the driving I plan to do."WEALTHY

TUESDAY NIGHT AT THE FIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not glamorous. But plush seating and a smoke-free environment mean 
nothing to guys in flannel. In fact, a beer and a metal chair are all that's 
needed for those who gather one Tuesday night each month at the Tony Longvall 
Country Club in Reseda.That and a good fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The club, also the site of concerts, as hosted professional boxing for 10 
years. The venue is typical for a small club: dark and smoky. Cigarette girls 
sashay through the aisles hawking cigars, cigarettes and snacks. Men cheer on 
the boxers between gulps of Budweiser or Miller. The fighters prepare for their 
bouts in a room lit by a single overhead light. It's boxing in it's purest 
form. No Las Vegas glitter here. 
</P>
<P>
 The seating capacity for fight night is for just 1,000 spectators, and boxing 
promoters and fans like that. "The best thing is it's intimacy," said Dan 
Goosen of Ten Goose Boxing, who has booked fights there for 10 years. "When you 
can promote fights in front of 900 people, it makes it very exciting."

MAN FATALLY SHOT IN HIS APARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was shot and killed inside his apartment Saturday night, Los Angeles 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, Balious Street, 40, was found dead about 8:30 p.m. Saturday inside 
his home on the 12500 block of Fillmore Avenue by police responding to a call 
of shots fired. He had been shot in the upper body, said Sgt. Frank Reynoso of 
the LAPD's Foothill Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide detectives inspected Street's apartment building Saturday night but 
were unable to find any clues to the shooting. It remains under investigation, 
Reynoso said.

PACOIMA MAN, 18, KILLED, 2 HURT IN BROADSIDE CRASH; ACCIDENT: ONE OF THE TWO 
VEHICLES INVOLVED WAS DRIVEN BY AN UNLICENSED MOTORIST, POLICE SAY. ONE CAR 
REPORTEDLY RAN A RED LIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old Pacoima man was killed and two other people were injured when a 
car driven by an unlicensed driver broadsided another vehicle in Sun Valley, 
Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Cortez died late Saturday after he was thrown through the rear 
windshield of a Toyota Camry driven by Javier De Lacueva, 18, of Van Nuys, 
Valley Traffic Division Officer Jim Thompson said.Cortez was not wearing a seat 
belt. 
</P>
<P>
 De Lacueva was not licensed to drive, Thompson said. He was traveling south on 
Laurel Canyon Boulevard when he broadsided an Oldsmobile traveling east on 
Branford Street, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the cars had apparently driven through a red light, but police are 
unsure which one, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the Oldsmobile, Thomas Funakura, 63, and his wife, Alice 
Funakura, 59, of Arleta were not injured in the crash, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other passengers in the Camry were injured after they were thrown from the 
car, Thompson said. Alfredo De Lacueva, 19, of Pacoima was treated for a broken 
pelvis, and 2-year-old Stacy Arroyo, of Van Nuys received scrapes and bruises, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both De Lacueva and Arroyo were transported to Holy Cross Medical Center in 
Mission Hills for treatment, Thompson said. Arroyo's mother, Isabel, who was 
holding the 2-year-old on her lap before the collision, was not injured, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 De Lacueva was released by police after questioning Saturday. He faces a 
misdemeanor charge of driving without a license, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manslaughter charges could be filed against the driver responsible for the 
collision, Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, Thompson said, "we have to have an independent witness" to the 
crash.

YOUNG PIANIST, INJURED IN QUAKE, INTENT ON 'HANGING IN THERE'; AFTERMATH: A 
DOCTOR HAS TOLD EMERSON PALAME, 10, WHOSE FINGER WAS CRUSHED, THAT A PART OF IT 
WILL HAVE TO BE AMPUTATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL QUINTANILLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Emerson Palame is no complainer. 
</P>
<P>
 Not about the asthma that prevents him from playing ball with his friends. Nor 
about the allergies that keep him indoors more than he'd like. And not even 
about the finger on his left hand that may require amputation since it was 
crushed and nearly severed during the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments after the quake, Emerson, 10, a gifted pianist, calmly asked himself, 
"Why is it hurting so much?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel pain right away," Emerson remembered, looking at his finger 
wrapped inside a plastic, removable cast. Two doctors had wanted to amputate 
the finger immediately, but Emerson's parents, Emil and Ellen Palame, refused. 
</P>
<P>
 They're happy that they did. Last week, Dr. Gregory Hanker, the third 
specialist that the Palames have consulted, told the family that the finger's 
bone is still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a portion of Emerson's finger will have to be amputated, skin grafts 
and other surgical techniques will give the rest of the finger a chance for 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a blessing and a waiting game," said Emil Palame. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking back to 4:31 a.m. Jan. 17 when the quake rocked his world, Emerson 
said, "I was kind of shocked and my hand felt numb, but I thought that was just 
earthquake nerves." 
</P>
<P>
 The youngster, who has been playing piano since age 3 and writes and records 
his own music on cassettes, was spending the night at the home of his 
grandparents, John and Mary Dulaney in Woodland Hills, about two miles from his 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had talked my grandparents into letting me sleep in a sleeping bag in the 
playroom. So when the earthquake started, I got up and was kind of stuck inside 
the bag. I tripped and went forward and fell." 
</P>
<P>
 An eight-pound shadow box containing a clock above the room's doorway came 
crashing down on Emerson's left hand, crushing his little finger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was right about to get up when the clock hit my hand. So now when I think 
about it, my guardian angel sort of protected me because if I would have moved 
some more, the clock would have fallen on my head. It could have killed me," 
Emerson says. 
</P>
<P>
 After the clock fell on him, Emerson decided not to struggle out of the 
sleeping bag and hopped with it into the middle of the kitchen where he and his 
grandparents huddled together. 
</P>
<P>
 His grandparents rushed him to an emergency room in West Hills. Within 30 
minutes, Emerson's parents and his 4-year-old sister, Emily, were at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, back at his grandparents' home, Emerson remembers seeing the clock on 
the floor "right where the pool of blood was. This little finger lost a lot of 
blood," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping his sense of humor -- despite occasional bouts of depression and 
trauma, including sleepless nights -- has been important, he says. So has his 
faith in God. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without God I probably wouldn't have been able to get through this as well," 
said the fourth-grader at West Valley Christian Church School. "I've asked 
myself 'Why has this happened to me?' But then I realize that this may be a 
test to see if I still believe in God -- like God tested Job -- which I do now 
more than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there are times when Emerson says he gets "sort of depressed that my 
finger might have to be amputated." 
</P>
<P>
 When depression sets in, his parents step in. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll sit there very quiet and I'll know that he's either in a lot of pain or 
very depressed," says his mother. "I know that he just lets go within. He tries 
to find the strength. As parents we have to reach out for him and hold him and 
let him know that it's going to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 His parents reassure him that if he has to lose part of the finger or all of 
it, he can still continue playing the piano with a prosthesis. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now, cast and all, Emerson plays duets with his father in the evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult so I just play with my good hand for now. At first I 
didn't want to play because I was in so much pain, but I didn't allow myself to 
miss a single piano lesson." 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson's teacher, Karen Militello, who has been working with Emerson the last 
four years, says her student is amazing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He goes with the flow and deals with it. I have students who didn't come for 
their lessons the week after the earthquake because they were petrified to 
leave their homes. And here was Emerson coming for his," Militello said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been so brave," said Emerson's father, a piano accompanist for Peggy Lee 
and a studio musician for the TV show "Frasier." 
</P>
<P>
 But Emerson doesn't think he's brave at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just see myself as hanging in there," he said, and then offered this advice 
to others injured in the earthquake: "Pretend like the earthquake never 
happened and go on with life. Don't keep hanging onto the past; look again to 
the future."

VALLEY CHRONICLE: UNIFORM APPROACH HELPING TO LESSEN TENSIONS ON CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUE REILLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's been an outbreak of uniformity at George Washington Elementary School 
in Burbank, and a lot of parents across the Valley think it's a pretty good 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Washington's kids have given up the baggy pants and long-shirt look 
and are sporting outfits of red, white and blue. 
</P>
<P>
 The new school uniform is not a case of sudden patriotism, although Principal 
Joan Baca mentions that patriotism would be a natural for a school named 
Washington located on Lincoln Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The uniforms reflect the wishes of the majority of the school's parents, 
according to Baca, who made that judgment following a survey to decide what the 
look would be and how much it should cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca says last year she started thinking about the possible benefits of 
adopting a uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, we call it a school outfit because uniform has negative 
connotations to a segment of our parents," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall a questionnaire was sent to the 500 school families. Of the 400 
who responded, only 36 were opposed to uniforms, Baca says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those opposed thought uniforms restricted self-expression, and some 
parents of graduating fifth-graders felt it was too costly. And some of the 
students complained about regimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the general consensus was that the idea was cool. 
</P>
<P>
 The administration, working with parents and student advisory groups, chose 
red sweat shirts, white polo shirts and blue pants, skirts, culottes or shorts. 
The shirts have the school logo sewn on them. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of an outfit is about $30, and Baca says there is money available for 
parents who want their children in school outfits but cannot afford them. 
</P>
<P>
 Christy Atkins says her daughter, Jamie, a fifth-grader, was initially 
reluctant to get a uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 But once Jamie saw the outfits modeled at a fashion show for the students, she 
told her mother to go ahead and order them. 
</P>
<P>
 Atkins, who is active in several parent groups at Washington, says she has 
heard from teachers that the uniforms bring a calming influence to the 
students, although she is not sure why. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca says she too is getting feedback that indicates there is a lessening of 
tension on campus following the adoption of uniforms. "I don't know if that's 
because there is less of a gang look, or because there is not so much 
competitiveness, or because it tends to put students on a more equal footing. 
I'm just not sure why," Baca says. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Hernandez, a school aide whose 7-year-old son, Cord, attends Washington, 
says she also has noticed a lessening of tension. But Hernandez thinks she 
knows exactly why that's happening. "Kids are not making comments about the way 
other kids are dressing, saying so-and-so looks cool but someone else does 
not." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez says uniforms take the attitude out of some kids who threatened 
others with their gang look and implied menace. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the kids are all wearing red sweat shirts, it's hard to advertise how 
tough you think you are," Hernandez adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca says about 80% of the school's students are wearing uniforms, including 
almost all of the children in bilingual classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca says the inspiration for the outfits came from a pilot program at San 
Fernando Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Principal Candida Fernandez-Ghoneim reports their blue-and-white 
school uniforms were ready for purchase in October and a majority of her 
students now are wearing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez-Ghoneim says she ran into a small pocket of resistance from parents 
who bemoaned the lack of clothing choice for their children, adding that many 
of those children favor the baggy-pants look. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of those kids will turn into gangbangers," says a frustrated 
Fernandez-Ghoneim, "and their parents will wonder how all that got started." 
</P>
<P>
 Both principals say that the uniforms have been a success and that they are 
fielding many questions from parent groups throughout the Valley about how to 
institute a similar program at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca's best tip is to get the parents and students involved. These Bikers 
Steer Others Onto the Road to Conversion 
</P>
<P>
 They look like guys who would take a chain saw to your leather upholstery if 
they didn't happen to like the way you make a lane change. 
</P>
<P>
 Just seeing a group of these bikers in your rearview mirror can bring on an 
auto-neurotic experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bikers, however, want to convert you, not hurt you, like the J. C. Riders 
in the San Fernando Valley and the Antelope Valley Riders of the Cross. Many of 
the members formerly belonged to outlaw bike groups, including the Hell's 
Angels, but now they are riding for Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Ron Pierson, formerly of the Valley group, now president of the Antelope 
Valley chapter of the Christian Motorcycle Assn. Pierson, 62, grew up in San 
Fernando and got his first bike, an Indian, when he was 14. He says he became a 
proper outlaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd take a chain to the headlights of anyone who got in our way," Pierson 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 For years he rode with groups that were not as good as they could be. Then, he 
began to question the path he had taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, actually I was living in two worlds. I would take our four kids to 
church where I taught Sunday school. Then I would get on my bike and go riding 
with the gang," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The split personality wasn't a problem until 1963 when he became a minister. 
"I was taken to a church ministerial meeting and asked to accept a ministry," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierson says he served as assistant pastor at several churches but didn't feel 
that was his real calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then on a day trip to Santa Barbara, two would-be rowdies told me they were 
going to beat the crap out of me," Pierson says. "I ended up preaching the 
gospel to them and drew a crowd in doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 A street corner preacher was born. 
</P>
<P>
 "By that time I had changed my affiliation to the Christian Motorcycle Assn., 
which had been founded in Hatfield, Ark., in the mid-'70s and spread across the 
country," he says. "As a minister and biker it was just the right place for me 
to be." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he likes talking to people about Christ, informally. After all, that's 
the way Jesus used to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his band of about 40 bikers in the Antelope Valley not only ride 
together but do the community some good. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go to biker rallies and help set up things like child care, and we collect 
clothing for the needy," Pierson says. "If people ask about our organization, 
we tell them. If they want to hear about our beliefs, we witness for Jesus, but 
we don't force our ideas on anyone. That would be out of place." Victorian 
House Lovers Keep Phones Ringing Off the Hook 
</P>
<P>
 Last week there was a Chronicle item about a restored Victorian house and bed 
and breakfast in the Lake Hughes area. The item did not give information about 
how to get in touch with the folks there. 
</P>
<P>
 Big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 With apologies to those who have been driving the folks at the local chamber 
of commerce crazy, the Victorian is called Willowbrook and the number there is 
(805) 724-1076. Overheard 
</P>
<P>
 "I stopped giving him money when I realized how many dollar bills I had given 
him and that if I asked him to return one, because I really needed it, he would 
laugh in my face."

DRIVER ARRESTED AFTER COLLISION KILLS PASSENGER IN PICKUP TRUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A passenger in a truck driven by a suspected drunken driver was killed Sunday 
when the truck drifted across three lanes of oncoming traffic before colliding 
head-on with another truck, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified victim was described as a male Latino who appeared to be in 
his late 20s or early 30s, said John Amott of the Los Angeles Police 
Department.His identity was withheld pending notification of next of kin, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Onesino Tirado of Palmdale, is suspected of drunken driving, Amott 
said. The accident occurred about 3 p.m. on San Fernando Road near Sierra 
Highway in Granada Hills, at the northern edge of the Los Angeles city limits, 
Amott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Tirado on suspicion of manslaughter after he was treated for 
minor injuries at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, Amott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also discovered two handguns, one inside Tirado's truck and another on 
his person when he was examined at the hospital, Amott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Tirado's pickup was traveling north at an unknown rate of 
speed through a curved portion of road that runs beneath freeway overpasses 
when he crossed the road and struck a four-wheel drive truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of that vehicle, Jeff McKinney of Lancaster, was also taken to Holy 
Cross Medical Center where he was treated for a cut and released, Amott said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY BUSES USED IN FUEL EXPERIMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most Southern Californians are reluctant to get out of their cars and into 
public transportation, but this city's buses have a new selling point. They've 
got Wesson-ality. 
</P>
<P>
 Four buses in Santa Clarita's 33-bus fleet are using a blend of diesel fuel 
and vegetable oils as part of a nationwide program by the National SoyDiesel 
Development Board. The fuel not only contributes to cleaner air, but also 
smells better, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita is one of 30 cities, including five in California, with buses 
now using 20% biodiesel for a 50,000-mile test run. The Missouri-based 
SoyDiesel trade agency hopes to carve out a larger market for the alternative 
fuel by showing it's as reliable as its petroleum-based cousin. 
</P>
<P>
 Biodiesel is similar to the vegetable oil in your kitchen cupboard, minus the 
glycerin, which is removed with the application of alcohol and a catalyst in a 
process called transesterification. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is more expensive than traditional diesel -- $2.50 a gallon 
compared to $1 or less for diesel -- biodiesel is drawing more interest as 
stricter air-quality requirements take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to test if there are other ways of meeting federal and state 
standards without having to switch to a new fuel," said Ron Kilcoyne, Santa 
Clarita transportation manager. "We thought this was a great idea to help meet 
stringent clean-air requirements without going to an expensive fuel system." 
</P>
<P>
 The material is compatible with existing engines, providing similar horsepower 
and mileage while allowing municipalities to avoid hundreds of thousands or 
even millions of dollars in retrofitting expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Biodiesel generates half the soot particles and carbon monoxide of 
conventional diesel fuel. A mix of 80% diesel and 20% biodiesel, costing 30 to 
40 cents more than straight diesel, can reduce carbon monoxide by 21% and soot 
particles by 31%, according to the SoyDiesel trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 "This compound has some of the same composition as diesel fuel," said Kenlon 
Johannes, executive director of the National SoyDiesel Development Board. "The 
combustion engine doesn't know the difference, but the tailpipe does." 
</P>
<P>
 That also makes the exhaust smell better, cutting down what many transit 
operators affectionately call the "big blue haze" when buses pull away from 
curbs. Those who have used biodiesel in earlier programs say the smell is more 
like fried food. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding the thick, black belch of smoke when buses accelerate also may help 
transit systems avoid the stereotype that their buses are actually adding more 
pollution into the air than automobiles, Kilcoyne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita was first approached for the program about six months ago. "We 
sent them a free 55-gallon barrel and they tried it and liked it," Johannes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade agency is now providing Santa Clarita with enough biodiesel for the 
entire 50,000-mile experiment -- or about 12,500 gallons. "I don't normally 
like to be a guinea pig unless I know our expenses are going to be reimbursed," 
Kilcoyne said. 
</P>
<P>
 All four of the Santa Clarita buses in the experiment are used for local 
routes, rather than commuting lines into Los Angeles, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita's participation in the program was interrupted by the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake, but is expected to resume by the end of this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Buses must use alternate fueling sites to fill up with the blended diesel 
fuel, and Santa Clarita transit officials have opted to suspend the experiment 
until city buses are running normally. Some city buses were taken off their 
regular routes because of traffic problems caused by the earthquake.

SANTA ANA SCHOOL SITE TOO PRICEY, CRITICS SAY; DEVELOPMENT: PROJECTED 
$21.8-MILLION COST FOR 11-ACRE PLOT EXCEEDS TYPICAL RATE FOR RETAIL LAND, 
OPPONENTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The local school board, eager to tap into a little-known pool of state money 
for building new schools, is planning to spend nearly $22 million to buy a 
strip of commercial land that real estate experts say appears to be worth less 
than half that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics charge that the inflated price for the controversial project, which 
was approved by the school board last month, demonstrates a disturbing 
disregard for how taxpayer money is spent. 
</P>
<P>
 And several also question the propriety of the close relationship among 
appraisers on the project, lawyers for the school district, and a state 
assemblyman who has lobbied Sacramento officials for the approval of the school 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the state of California that loses," says Jim Righeimer, a commercial 
real-estate broker and critic of the project who says that retail land 
typically sells for a third of what the Santa Ana district is planning to pay. 
"The school district's attitude is: 'It's free money. The state's paying, so 
who cares?' Well, it's taxpayer money, and I care." 
</P>
<P>
 But Santa Ana Unified School District officials insist that their 
responsibility is minimal in ensuring that they get a good deal for an 11-acre 
site at a local shopping plaza that they plan to convert into a "fundamental 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 If the district is in fact spending too much to buy the land, they say, then 
any overpayment should be caught by the state before the deal is completed in 
the months ahead. "I'm sure that the state will make sure that the integrity of 
the process is upheld," Santa Ana District Superintendent Rudy M. Castruita 
said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials, for their part, say they are well aware of concerns that have 
emerged about the land costs. "Our land expert has already said that if it 
comes in at $20 million, he's going to pull it apart with a fine-tooth comb. . 
. . He's very concerned about $20 million for that piece of property," said 
Lyle A. Smoot of the State Allocation Board. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, however, the state has already set aside $22.7 million for 
the project. And the district is moving ahead with plans to build a two-story 
junior high school above a parking lot at the back third of the Bristol 
Marketplace at 17th and Bristol streets. The mall owner thinks bringing a 
school into the complex could solve some of its financial troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is part of an experimental and still untested state "space saver" 
program that reflects the growing space crunch squeezing today's urban schools. 
The idea is to take an already developed area -- an apartment complex, for 
instance, a shopping plaza or even museum grounds -- and plop a multistory 
school down in the middle of it, building up instead of out. 
</P>
<P>
 The state first approved money for the idea in 1989, but no school district 
has yet come up with a workable plan to capitalize on it. Santa Ana school 
officials, facing a shortage of space for 18,000 students by the end of this 
decade, want badly to be the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the plan has generated a firestorm of protest from plaza 
neighbors. The prospects of loitering children, rising crime and vandalism, as 
well as potential traffic problems, have all attracted attention. Nearly 500 
people packed a hearing last month on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of the project's costs, however, often appears to have gotten 
short shrift in the public debate. Even among the myriad issues raised in a 
Feb. 9 letter to the district, the state Board of Education sharply questioned 
the safety and convenience of the 1,300 students at the proposed school -- but 
there was no mention of the project's expected costs. This, despite another 
grim budget season ahead, with projections of a $5-billion state shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, less than three weeks after the Santa Ana school board approved the 
project on a 3-2 vote, critics are stepping up their attacks on the economics 
of the plan, questioning why district staff members have apparently been so 
reluctant to release basic information on its costs -- even to the school 
board's own trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, there's just an air about this thing that I don't like. And I think 
the whole thing has been orchestrated to get more money out of the district," 
and ultimately, out of the state, suggests trustee Tom Chaffee, an engineer who 
joined the school board in December and was one of two members to vote against 
the project on Feb. 16. "I question what goes on behind closed doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the author of the legislation that created the space-saver school concept 
appeared taken aback by the amount that Santa Ana is planning to spend on the 
plaza land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't ever see how we'd be spending $20 million on land acquisition for a 
space saver," state Sen. Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael) said in an interview. 
"There's something wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, independent experts and realty documents appear to bear out some of 
the concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The final sale price has not been set for the project. In fact, persistent 
questions about the cost have prompted the district to seek three new 
appraisals of the plaza property -- at a cost of $25,000 each. Those may be 
completed in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But district officials say that at least for now, the total projected price 
for the 11-acre site in Santa Ana works out to $21.8 million -- or nearly $2 
million an acre. 
</P>
<P>
 That figure includes $13.5 million for the land acquisition itself (or $1.23 
million per acre) and $8.3 million in what are termed "damages" that the school 
development would mean to the property owner, Interstate Consolidated 
Industries, based in Westminster, according to a November, 1993, preliminary 
estimate prepared by a private appraiser for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 But five specialists in realty brokerage or appraising -- contacted by The 
Times and provided details of the Santa Ana plan -- each agreed that the 
district appears ready to pay at least twice -- perhaps even three to four 
times -- what the property would typically sell for. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time of sluggish movement for land sales, many commercial/retail parcels 
aren't selling at all, these specialists said. Those that are moving typically 
sell for anywhere from $400,000 to $800,000 an acre in Orange County, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the 14 acres of land beneath one of the county's ritziest hotels -- the 
Marriott in Newport Beach -- sold for $790,000 an acre last year. That makes 
the Santa Ana deal all the more puzzling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sounds like a great deal for the seller," said Stephen Rethmeier, vice 
president at S.S. Herron & Associates, an Anaheim appraisal firm. "The land 
market is dead. There's no development that's occurring. And if (the Santa Ana 
sale) ever ended up closing, that'd be one of the highest sales in a long 
time," Rethmeier said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say that's $12 (a square foot) to $15 dirt at the most," said Paul 
Carlson, chief executive officer of the Carlson Co., one of the largest 
property management firms in Orange County. Broken down by the square foot, 
Santa Ana is planning to pay double that price -- more than $28 for the land 
itself. That jumps to $45.50 a square foot when the estimated "damages" are 
added in. "That's a helluva price," Carlson said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 And an executive for one major county developer who asked not to be identified 
agreed that the sale price appeared "extraordinarily high." 
</P>
<P>
 An informal survey of realty records from recent transactions involving major 
commercial properties appears to bolster their observations. 
</P>
<P>
 One already-developed retail shopping center in Newport Beach, for instance, 
sold for $576,000 an acre last April, while an eight-acre retail site in Lake 
Forest went for $728,000 per acre a year ago. The Mission Viejo Co. collected 
$654,000 an acre from the Kmart Corp. in December, 1992, for an 11-acre 
commercial site in Mission Viejo, and Target Stores paid $368,000 an acre for 
Foothill Ranch land last May. 
</P>
<P>
 So why the $2-million-an-acre price tag for a strip mall that, because of its 
odd configuration, is described by its own owner as "dysfunctional"? 
</P>
<P>
 No one working on the project seems willing, or able, to say. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael G. Vail, the school district's top facilities planner, said simply: 
"It's the price the appraiser gave us. . . . I'm not an appraiser. I have 
nothing to do with what the property owner gets. That's left to the appraiser." 
</P>
<P>
 The appraiser, Michael Waldron, president of Newport Beach-based Waldron & 
Associates, said he would not discuss details of the project, because the 
analysis he gave the district to arrive at the $21.8-million price tag is 
"confidential." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even that analysis, a preliminary cost assessment that Waldron prepared 
for the district four months ago as part of a $25,000 contract, appears to 
leave many questions unanswered. A copy was obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 At the outset, Waldron's Nov. 1 letter to the district offered a string of 
disclaimers, stating that the preliminary assessment "does not represent an 
appraisal 'per se,' " "represents a departure" from standard appraisal 
practices, and "is not to be used for acquisition, negotiations or otherwise 
disseminated to the public in any way." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, it was on the basis of that assessment that the state has 
reserved more than $22 million for acquisition of the land for the school. And 
Vail, the school district's facilities director, said that assessment has 
helped shape the district's financial discussions and planning on the project 
for the past four months. 
</P>
<P>
 The appraiser's report to the district estimates that by the time ongoing 
renovations at Bristol Marketplace are completed, the entire 37-acre plaza will 
be worth some $48 million, but it offers no explanation as to how this value 
was computed. (ICI paid about $12 million for the site a decade ago, and 
general partner R. Scott Bell said in an interview that the company has pumped 
undisclosed millions into its renovation since then.) 
</P>
<P>
 In one key finding, Waldron's report also estimates that the school plan would 
cost Bell's company $8.3 million in damages, in large part because two 
buildings -- the HomeBase store and the Montgomery Ward automotive center -- 
would have to be torn down and relocated elsewhere in the plaza to make way for 
school grounds and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report does not mention any of the economic uncertainties that already 
face the plaza -- including the prospect that HomeBase, an anchor tenant in the 
mall, might have been moving its store anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping plaza, once a run-down eyesore that featured an X-rated movie 
theater, has undergone wholesale renovations in the past few years, and now 
includes a slew of brightly painted fast-food stops, grocery stores, a video 
shop, a nail salon and all the other accouterments of the modern-day 
neighborhood shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean the plaza owners at ICI are counting on a booming future 
-- at least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 If the school deal does not go through, ICI said in a report to the school 
district that the company will have to sell off land or assets to someone else 
because a tight lending market and "the current economic environment" have made 
it tough to raise capital for future renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 More troubling, the plaza's size and shape mean poor visibility and reduced 
sales for shops tucked in the back -- away from the major streets. "As 
presently configured, the shopping center is dysfunctional," ICI said in its 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 HomeBase has been one of the stores most affected by its poor visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a company official refused to discuss the issue, Vail at the school 
district said he understood that the chain had put the store on a "sublease 
list" to explore the prospect of finding a new tenant to fill its spot. And ICI 
acknowledged in writing to the district that HomeBase "has expressed 
discontent" over its current locale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the whole thing's suspicious," said Rosemarie Avila, a school board 
member who voted against the project and insists that district staff members 
have repeatedly misled the board about its key elements -- whether this was the 
only site acceptable to the state, whether there was a hard and fast deadline 
for approving the project, and other issues. "The concern I have is: Why so 
much disinformation? Why was there such a campaign to pass this so fast by our 
district?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just bothers me when the attitude is, 'Take the money and get the school, 
and it doesn't matter what we pay.' Nobody would treat their own money that 
way," Avila said. 
</P>
<P>
 But fellow board member Audrey Yamagata-Noji, who supports the project, said 
she believes Avila's stance is merely designed to garner attention for her 
current state Assembly campaign. Avila "turns everything we talk about into a 
taxpayer issue. I'm a little suspicious about her motives," Yamagata-Noji said 
in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamagata-Noji said she believes the $21.8-million price tag for the land falls 
in line with today's market, but ultimately, she said, the district has to 
trust its appraisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a certain point where you have to look at the facts you're given and 
have some confidence in them," she said. "Am I wrong that I didn't on my own go 
out and talk to other realtors and appraisers? Maybe I could be accused of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), who sits on the seven-member 
State Allocation Board, said she remains confident that the state agency's 
staff will act as a backstop if questions persist once a final property 
appraisal is completed in weeks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many safeguards," Bergeson said. "Believe me, the State Allocation 
Board is tough on figures. If there is anything out of the ordinary, the 
whistle will blow. . . . No one is trying to make a profit for the developer."

OPERA REVIEW; O.C. TRIES WAGNER ON FOR SIZE; OPERA PACIFIC MEETS MOST OF THE 
CHALLENGES IN 'DIE WALKURE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And here we thought it was safe to forget about Opera Pacific. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 When last heard from, Orange County's official guardian of the lyric muse was 
lavishing its pretensions upon a fragile operetta, and doing so with heavy, 
provincial hands. The public, it should be noted, seemed to love it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, David DiChiera and his not-so-little band have turned to Richard Wagner's 
"Die Walkure." Repeat: "Die Walkure." 
</P>
<P>
 The stretch is formidable, and very costly, too. Some might call it foolhardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner, who never even dreamed of thinking small, dealt here in nearly five 
hours of massive, and massively convoluted, Germanic mythology. He wrote for a 
huge, tireless, brassy orchestra and demanded a cast of singers equipped with 
huge, leathery lungs. He required a scenic apparatus that could invoke -- 
hopefully without caricature -- an ever-ever-land of super-heroes, super-gods 
and super-villains, not to mention flying lust-maidens, mystical apparitions 
and a magic fire adorning the sacred rocks of Valhalla. 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't much ersatz-Viennese waltzing here. 
</P>
<P>
 The opulent Music Center Opera has attempted Wagner only once -- a single 
"Tristan und Isolde" 6 1/2 years ago. That sobering realization made matters 
doubly intriguing on Friday as Costa Mesa rushed in where Los Angeles fears to 
tread. 
</P>
<P>
 DiChiera was trying to play David to Peter Hemmings' Goliath. Although the 
local "Walkure" would hardly make the burghers of Bayreuth look to their 
laurels, it was emphatically serious, never less than honorable and seldom less 
than competent. There may be hope. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The musical direction was entrusted to John Mauceri, who had led a 
much-publicized, somewhat controversial "Ring" during his tenure at the 
Scottish Opera. His concept of Wagnerian grandeur would seem to be neither 
terribly grand nor terribly passionate, but he knows how to keep the pulse 
moving, knows where the climaxes lie, knows how to define a mood, and, perhaps 
most important, knows how to accompany the endangered species on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mauceri is, if nothing else, a pro. He also happens to be a musician whose 
conscience precludes mutilating the score even by a hemidemisemiquaver. (One 
wonders why he sanctioned that awful wind machine that obliterated much of the 
prelude.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Segerstrom Hall pit is ridiculously inadequate for Wagner. It seated only 
71 players on this occasion, and there couldn't have been room for another 
piccolo. Undaunted, the Opera Pacific Orchestra played reasonably well for 
Mauceri; it doesn't often encounter a real conductor. Even so, the symphonic 
output was modest at best, anemic at worst. 
</P>
<P>
 The action -- and inaction -- on the stage was entrusted to another canny 
veteran of Wagnerian wars, Roberto Oswald of the Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires. 
Functioning as director as well as set and lighting designer, he enforced logic 
amid the potential chaos and created some nice, pretty pictures in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 He is no fashionable revisionist -- probably not even a modernist -- yet he 
does have the good taste to simplify and stylize the mythic vistas. That's more 
than can be said for the folks in charge of the kitschy Metropolitan Opera 
"Ring," which reproduces every infernal leaf in every fussy forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Oswald, comfortably safe even when he isn't particularly stimulating, projects 
a lot of busy clouds on the scrim, makes his characters spend a lot of time 
rolling on the floor, and tries not to contradict the libretto too much. His 
traditional sets, designed for Dallas 22 years ago, leave no turns unstoned. 
Anibal Lapiz's old-fashioned costumes are disarmingly functional -- winged 
helmets, funny breastplates and all -- even if they don't always flatter their 
current wearers. 
</P>
<P>
 One first-rate singer dominated the generally second-rate cast on opening 
night. Jane Eaglen, the 33-year-old Briton who had stepped in to replace Ealynn 
Voss, actually suggested that the authentic Wagnerian soprano may not be as 
extinct as the dodo bird. Her voice -- big, warm, rich and wide-ranging -- cut 
through the orchestral mass with laughing ease. She articulated Wagner's text 
poignantly, and, despite her ample physique, sustained a sympathetic facsimile 
of dramatic credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't happen to command much of a trill for the battle cry, but Birgit 
Nilsson didn't master that detail either. Actually, if comparisons were 
essential, Eaglen would recall Helen Traubel more than Nilsson. It's a happy 
recollection. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The others, for better or worse, belonged in the yes-but category. 
</P>
<P>
 John Keyes sang Siegmund with strikingly strong, dark, vibrant tone and really 
resembled a muscular giant. Like many a would-be Heldentenor before him, 
however, he tired easily, found the top notes a struggle and tended to sing 
flat under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Mechthild Gessendorf complemented him as an authoritative if rather matronly 
Sieglinde. Though vocally uneven, she rose nicely to the lofty climaxes, and 
earned gratitude for omitting the bizarre Rysanek scream -- a popular bit of 
reverse symbolism that often accompanies Siegmund's withdrawal of the sword 
from the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Roloff, admired in numerous Seattle "Ring" cycles, remains an uncommonly 
compelling Wotan -- on a manly rather than godly scale. He paced himself 
wisely, phrased intelligently, conveyed ample pathos in the ultimate farewell, 
but could not summon the sheer vocal force ideally needed for this formidable 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Maynor -- like Eaglen and Keyes a holdover from Mauceri's Scottish 
"Ring" -- looked tall, lithe and pleasant while sounding soft, vague and woolly 
as Hunding, the primal basso-bad-guy. Shirley Close hectored Wotan with 
incisive energy as a rather shrewish Fricka. 
</P>
<P>
 The assorted warriorettes screamed and yodeled their Ho-jo-to-hos with 
bravado. Like their sisters in most conventional productions, they also seemed 
very silly.

 The non-capacity audience (reportedly papered) shrank substantially as the

safely removed, of course, from the precious foyer carpets.

THEATER REVIEW; 'NIGHT' DELIVERS UNFOCUSED MESSAGE ON TV'S INFLUENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as we stare in horror at the chain-smoking habits of Hollywood's 1940s 
movie stars, future generations may look back at our television-obsessed 
behavior and gasp, "Didn't they realize it was killing them? Couldn't Americans 
at the end of the 20th Century see that TV is physically addictive?" 
</P>
<P>
 Until medical science pronounces television a disease-carrying addiction, 
crusaders must remain dependent on cautionary morality plays like "Night and 
Her Stars" at South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa. Richard Greenberg's 
ambitious world premiere examines our obsession with television and 
celebrities, using the 1950s network quiz show scandals as a platform. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's an impressively staged epic with marvelous speeches and stellar 
performances, "Night and Her Stars" resembles that era's television reception 
-- the story flickers in-and-out of focus. At three acts and nearly three 
hours, there is ample time for the playwright to discover that focus. But 
Greenberg, author of the Broadway comedy hit "Eastern Standard," never commits 
to a core image or character. Instead, he employs a static literary style to 
deliver a message about a visual medium. Even the classic quiz show image of a 
contestant sweating in a glass booth is reduced to abruptly glimpsed rear-stage 
silhouettes. While some 27 characters spin from 1956 to 1959, we feel like the 
playwright is channel surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 This is baffling because we're initially hooked by Greenberg's finest 
character. Co-producer of NBC's quiz show "Twenty-One," Daniel Enright should 
be the play's Machiavellian puppet master. Glib, eloquent, cynical, Enright has 
mastered "these boxes of light" and knows he's present at the creation of the 
sound byte. As portrayed with hypnotic cunning by Peter Frechette, Enright 
resembles Nosferatu in search of victims, an Elmer Gantry preaching immoral 
imperative. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a sponsor's complaint about dull contestants, Enright 
introduces theatrical values to live television. He "casts" a nerdy Herb 
Stempel (an appropriately anti-heroic Patrick Breen), costuming the part-time 
college student in ill-fitting suits while rehearsing answers. When Stempel 
sweats profusely, Enright orders the heat turned up in the contestant's booth. 
But the ethnic Stempel fails to capture the imagination of the masses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a hero," Enright realizes. A charismatic All-American winner is 
drafted to compete against the sweating ethnic loser. Columbia professor 
Charles Van Doren (an ambiguous Dylan Baker), son of a famous author, offers 
the perfect contrast. In one of Greenberg's exquisitely rendered debates, Van 
Doren allows Enright to intellectually plant seeds of moral corruption into his 
psyche. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Stempel believes that anti-Semitism contributed to his fall from 
the heights of television. Soon Stempel is confessing to the press that the 
quiz shows were rigged. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dylan Baker maintains a pose of bemusement as the compromised 
educator-turned-entertainer. Although this interpretation is valid, his 
character fails to ignite. Nor can we attach much sympathy to the self-pitying 
Stempel. Even a dynamic performance by Robert Curtis-Brown as a congressional 
investigator can't provoke dramatic momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 The character who does attract our focus is Enright, potentially a ring-master 
resembling the Joel Gray maestro from "Cabaret" or the Edward James Olmos 
spirit of El Pachuco from "Zoot Suit." But Enright's role dwindles until 
reduced to a bit player on the fringes as more conventional characters struggle 
with the new medium of television. 
</P>
<P>
 Director David Warren rarely overcomes the script's indecisive, episodic 
nature. His stage tableaux can be stunning, especially when fans recite their 
bizarre letters like a chorus from a modern tragedy. But Warren's detached, 
Brechtian style undermines scenes crying out for emotional catharsis. When 
Warren does unleash his actors in a contrived, sentimental final scene between 
Van Doren and his father, the outburst is embarrassing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Night and Her Stars" still manages to reward our attention, primarily because 
of the sincere and convincing staging of a significant contemporary issue. What 
Enright calls "the fascination of the abomination" mesmerizes us. Like victims 
of the quiz show hoaxes, we're still reeling from the power of an unknown new 
God called television. Designers Cliff Faulkner and Wendall K. Harrington 
contribute witty slide projections of 1950s pop images on scrims to help hold 
our focus. But we aren't beguiled by projected titles announcing "the tension 
mounts."

SHOWEST . . . NOW A LOOK AT COMING ATTRACTIONS; MOVIES: THEATER OWNERS, STUDIOS 
AND STARS WILL ADD SOME GLITTER TO LAS VEGAS AS THEY GATHER FOR AN ANNUAL 
CONVENTION TO PREVIEW UPCOMING FILMS. IT IS EXPECTED TO BE THE LARGEST EVENT IN 
THE GROUP'S 20-YEAR HISTORY. 
</P>

 Warner Bros. and Paramount Pictures will pit their star rosters against one 
another at this week's '94 National Assn. of Theater Owners/ShoWest convention, 
which organizers say will be the largest gathering of exhibitors and 
distributors in the event's 20-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, the major studios spend an average of $1 million or more to promote 
their top brass, upcoming movies and big stars to theater owners from across 
America and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's gathering kicks off today and runs through Thursday at Bally's 
Hotel and Casino, with an expected guest list of 6,500, including such top 
Hollywood stars as Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, Kevin Costner, Mel Gibson, Jodie 
Foster, Eddie Murphy, Harrison Ford, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robin Williams, 
director Steven Spielberg and "Jurassic Park" author Michael Crichton, as well 
as industry heavyweights such as Ted Turner and Sumner Redstone. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Turner, with his recent acquisitions of independent movie companies 
Castle Rock Entertainment and New Line Cinema, and Redstone, whose company, 
Viacom Inc., just fought a bloody battle for the ownership of Paramount 
Communications, are Hollywood's newest movie moguls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Redstone delivers the keynote address here Tuesday, using the opportunity to 
discuss how he beat out Barry Diller and QVC for the entertainment giant. 
</P>
<P>
 On the convention's last day, Turner joins Universal Pictures chairman Tom 
Pollock and a panel of exhibitors to discuss the future of theatrical 
exhibition in the coming age of the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Most exhibitors today remain bullish about their business -- which hit a 
record $5.2 billion in '93 -- and pooh-pooh the notion that video-on-demand, 
cable, pay-per-view and 500-channel information superhighways will render movie 
theaters obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you take the statements being made today and compare them to what the 
media wrote in 1953 when they predicted we'd all go broke because of TV, it's 
the same speech," says Michael Patrick, owner of the 1,735-screen Georgia-based 
circuit Carmike Cinemas. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan Wood, film buyer for Los Angeles-based Pacific Theaters, predicts new 
integrated delivery systems are "still five or 10 years away." He doesn't seem 
worried. "Look what happened with video. It leveled off and theaters kept on 
going. People want escapism . . . they want to go out, have popcorn and see a 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
 While there's certain to be plenty of heady talk at the show, exhibitors 
really come to see what they can expect to book in their theaters in the coming 
year. Studios fork out from $750,000 to $1.5 million on "product reels," clips 
of their upcoming movies that they hope will excite exhibitors and ensure prime 
bookings. 
</P>
<P>
 By previewing the movies, exhibitors can plan their Memorial Day through 
Christmas schedules. "You get a flavor of anywhere from 10 to 20 films from 
each studio," says Pacific's Wood, noting the real value is not previewing 
trailers from the more sure-fire big star offerings, but seeing those of 
smaller, unknown films. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood recalls past years when exhibitors discovered such surprises as "Free 
Willy" and "Edward Scissorhands," neither of which had any buzz going into 
ShoWest. "As an exhibitor, all you need is one or two sleepers and it can make 
your quarter," Wood says.  
</P>
<P>
 The same rule holds true for the distributor. Warner Bros. distribution chief 
Barry Reardon says: "A little-known picture can get kosher at ShoWest. We can 
spend hundreds of thousands of (advertising) dollars, but put 3,500 exhibitors 
in one room and have them buzz about a movie -- that's an impossible effect to 
duplicate." ShoWest, he acknowledges, may be "about hype, but if you show the 
right product there, the payback is incalculable." 
</P>
<P>
 But a great trailer doesn't necessarily mean a great film. And in cases where 
movies have not been shot yet, exhibitors see only title treatments, slides or 
teaser trailers, which can be unsatisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmike's Patrick says he wishes ShoWest would move to mid-April to allow 
exhibitors to see at least two- to three-minute trailers on completed movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "ShoWest is too early, and it's been disappointing in the last few years 
because we did not get to see the amount of product we were led to believe from 
the majors," said Patrick, who like some exhibitors prefers to see movies in 
their entirety at the sister convention, Showeast, held every October in 
Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One thing most exhibitors -- particularly ma-and-pa theater owners from 
small-town America -- love about ShoWest is the Hollywood glamour. And this 
year, it doesn't appear they'll be disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday will be the most star-studded day, with Warner Bros. and Paramount 
sponsoring lunch and dinner events, respectively. With last-minute commitments 
still being finalized, expected guests on Warners' dais include Macaulay 
Culkin, Cruise, Costner, Gibson, Foster, Warren Beatty, Annette Bening, Michael 
Douglas and James Garner. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount expects to parade in Ford, Tom Hanks, Eddie Murphy, Joe Pesci, 
Melanie Griffith, Ed Harris, Ted Danson, Mary Steenburgen, Wesley Snipes, 
William Shatner and Patrick Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 New Line Cinema will host Tuesday's lunch in a big-band nightclub setting, 
promoting its upcoming comedy "The Mask," starring Jim Carrey, while that 
evening Disney will transport guests to the Aladdin Hotel for an elaborate 
stage show. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Universal Pictures throws the final lunch for its Memorial Day 
release, "The Flintstones." Appearances by some cast members are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Noticeably missing as main-event sponsors will be Columbia Pictures, which has 
had a streak of flops and negative publicity, and TriStar Pictures, which is 
undergoing top-level unrest with the recent departure of Mike Medavoy and 
impending departure of distribution President Bill Soady. 
</P>
<P>
 Soady's departure is already reigniting speculation that Sony may be planning 
to either sell TriStar or fold it into Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 In low-profile fashion, Columbia will host a cocktail reception for Castle 
Rock Entertainment's "City Slickers 2: The Legend of Curly's Gold," showing a 
three-minute clip from the upcoming summer release and bringing in Billy 
Crystal to banter with exhibitors.

BREAKING THE 'BIG SILENCE'; 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' FORCES GERMANS TO LOOK AT THEIR 
HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Young Germans often call it "the big silence." At home, among family, talk of 
the Holocaust was taboo. Children learned quickly that the subject was too 
painful, too shameful for their parents and grandparents to face. And most 
stopped asking. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Steven Spielberg, a Jewish-American film director who lost 10 relatives 
in the Holocaust, gives them "Schindler's List" and tells them that it is not 
only OK to ask questions, it is essential to look history in the eye without 
shame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Germany is ready and waiting and willing -- the new generation of Germans -- 
to look at their past and not put it behind them but bring it with them 
throughout their lives," Spielberg said at the film's German premiere Tuesday 
in this city where Schindler spent his last years. "Not as a way of paying 
penance or expressing guilt or shame but as a way of understanding that we 
cannot put the present or future to right until we make peace with our past." 
</P>
<P>
 Will his message be heeded? Seldom in Germany has a film generated such 
emotion and soul-searching as "Schindler's List," the story of the "good 
German," businessman Oskar Schindler, who did what most Germans could not or 
would not do: Save Jews from the Nazi extermination. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone should see this film," the conservative daily newspaper Frankfurter 
Allgemeine stated categorically in a front-page review. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg's film "is an event of contemporary history," added the liberal Die 
Zeit newspaper critic. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, many German reviewers are asking why a German has never 
made this film. And some Germans say "Schindler's List" is too long and too sad 
to bother seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 As in other countries, German audiences are filing out of theaters at the end 
of the three-hour film in stunned silence, like mourners leaving a funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am totally shattered," Thomas Schreier, 24, an insurance salesman said 
after opening night in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 The film gives Germans a hero through which they can look at the Holocaust, a 
pain-reliever they have not always had. But it also raises uncomfortable 
questions: If Schindler resisted the Nazis, why didn't so many others? If 
Schindler found out what was happening, why didn't the others who say they 
never knew? 
</P>
<P>
 The film forces younger Germans to ask what they would have done in their 
parents' shoes, and the answer is not always what they would hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Over coffee after seeing "Schindler's List," university student Bert Schleimer 
says that he was 12 years old when he learned the full horror of the 
Holocaust's 6 million dead Jews. He came home from school and angrily 
confronted his father, who had been a teen-age soldier in the Third Reich. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked, 'What did you do?' And he said, 'You are young and haven't seen. You 
wouldn't have done anything either.' And now I fear he is right."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, Andrej Pomtow tried to broach the subject of the war many times 
with his parents and grandparents, but with little success. Then he heard his 
grandparents refer to a green armchair in their home as "the Jew's chair" and 
was told that they had bought it cheaply during the war from Jews forced to 
sell their belongings before fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I learned where the chair came from, I was really shocked," said the 
27-year-old Pomtow. Only then did he find out from his mother that his 
grandfather had been a soldier, his grandmother a Nazi collaborator, and that 
they were ashamed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Frankfurt premiere, Spielberg described how Schindler's story brought 
about his mid-life metamorphosis from entertainment movie-maker to the director 
of the world's most ambitious Holocaust film. It is a transformation that 
sounds much like Schindler's own evolution, and one that Spielberg hopes to 
share with generations of Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Spielberg reminded Germans that anti-Semitism "predates Nazi Germany 
by many hundreds of years," anti-Semites were throwing bricks and a firebomb at 
a synagogue in the Ruhr valley city of Essen. In the southwestern town of 
Karlsruhe, a bomb threat was called into the crowded theater where the film 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Neo-Nazis are a small but vocal minority in Germany, Spielberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he feared that the film would assuage German consciences, he said, "I 
hope that's true. It could ease the conscience." 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg wants Germans to look, listen and learn. But the Bonn University 
students said many of their friends felt the movie was too long and wouldn't go 
see it. Their parents, they said, found the subject too disturbing. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked how he felt about "Schindler's List," Pomtow chose to focus on 
technical aspects, as if to avoid its moral content. But his colleague, Bert 
Schleimer, responded as Spielberg might have hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not my history directly, but it is my country and I have to be 
careful that the Holocaust does not happen again," Schleimer said. "We have to 
work to convince people that all people are the same, that if (immigrants) come 
to Germany, they don't leave their homes without reason. They are in fear, 
maybe for their lives. And they need help. We have to do something against 
racism."

outstanding group. 4-Non Blondes received two awards: "What's Up" was named 
best song and dread-locked lead singer Linda Perry top female vocalist. Van 
Halen lead vocalist Sammy Hagar also received two honors: the Arthur M. Sohcot 
Award for public service and outstanding male vocalist. Neil Young was named

 No Promotional Medal: The Winter Olympics provided a ratings bonanza for CBS, 
but their value as a promotional vehicle was far less stellar. Despite the 
dozens of promotional spots that ran during the 16-day games, the Grammy Awards 
on CBS last Tuesday registered their second lowest ratings ever -- down 20% 
from the previous year -- and the debut of the sitcom "Tom" on the network the 
following night ran third in its time slot. Last year's World Series also was a 
promotional dud for CBS, as the drama series "South of Sunset," heavily hyped 
during the baseball championship, drew ratings so low that it folded after a 
single episode.

sources, she has had conversations with King World executives about 
possibilities for one of their programs. She recently was supposed to be a 
guest on Al Roker's talk show on CNBC, but due to a snow storm in New York she 
ended up as host of the program. CNBC has expressed interest in Sullivan as a

 'Ace' is the Place: Warner Bros.' "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective" was No. 1 again 
during a slow weekend at the box office, according to early industry estimates. 
The family farce starring Jim Carrey took in $5.2 million. In second: "Greedy," 
a new release from Universal starring Kirk Douglas and Michael J. Fox, with $5 
million. Warner Bros.' "On Deadly Ground" dropped to third with $4.3 million. 
20th Century Fox's "Sugar Hill" was in fourth with $3.5 million, followed by 
the studio's "The Chase" with $3.3 million. Universal's "Schindler's List" was 
close behind with $3.2 million.

 Spielberg Watch: The Philippine government has overturned its own censor's 
decision to cut sex scenes from Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List" and 
ordered it to be shown in its entirety. Executive Secretary Teofisto Guingona 
said the film should be released for viewing by anybody over the age of 15. His 
decision overrides the controversial cuts of a sex scene and flashes of a 
woman's breasts ordered by chief censor Henrietta Mendez. Rather than cut the 
film, Spielberg had pulled it from Philippine theaters. . . . In other 
Spielberg news, the director will receive yet another accolade when the Hebrew 
University of Jerusalem presents him with an honorary doctorate in June. The 
degree recognizes Spielberg's work, his contribution to combatting denial of 
the Holocaust, as well as his dedication to the university, which is home to 
the Steven Spielberg Jewish Film Archive. QUICK TAKES

 "Them boys gonna be up to their ass in robots. Huh!" declares a crusty codger 
in "Apex," watching the film's 21st-Century rebel warriors march off to do 
battle with a contingent of testy terminators. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring your waders, sci-fi fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apex" is another tiresome "T-Too" in which a future hero leapfrogs the 
space-time continuum to get a jump on the mechanical bipeds that have it in for 
humanity. It also has moments that play like a laugh-less "Back to the Future" 
derivation, though even that comedy had a consistency to its fantasy plotting 
that director/co-writer Phillip J. Roth can't muster here. 
</P>
<P>
 In 2073, a scientist (Richard Keats) makes a quick visit to 1973 and, on his 
return, finds the world gone to apocalyptic hell, thanks to a mistake of a few 
minutes and/or 100 years prior. No, he didn't accidentally destroy the master 
tapes of "My Love"; his fateful tear in the '70s time fabric was leaving a 
trace of a fatal disease that all those robots would later be designed to 
bloodily eradicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon he's got a cadre of soldiers together to trade endless rounds with all 
the armor-plated automatons, while he plots his return to his alternate 
alternate reality, one where there's no robots, no plague and his smoochy 
spouse (Lisa Ann Russell) isn't a cranky mercenary. This is initially 
confusing, but comes clear by the 19th or so voice-over of "I have to stop the 
paradox from ever happening!" or "In this world, she's not my wife!" 
</P>
<P>
 The script lacks an internal logic to explain its contradictory time-travel 
twists. (In one alternate reality, our time-tripper slips right into his 
doppelganger's body; in another reality, there are two of him briefly bumping 
noses. Huh?) But it does at least have a moral. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is a strange thing," muses the wiser hero at the close. "No matter what 
happens, no matter what you do, things change, and they can never be quite the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
 With friends like "Apex," the theory of relativity doesn't need any enemies.

ANIMATION REVIEW; AN OVER-VIOLENT 'OVERFIEND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even by the undemanding standards of its genre, "Urotsukidoji: Legend of the 
Overfiend," the latest installment in the Laemmle's "Japanimation" series, is 
short on plot and long on misogynistic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Adapted by Michael Lawrence from a screenplay by Noburo Aikawa, it's another 
tale of overlapping dimensions: the Human World, the World of Monster-Demons 
and the World of Man-Beasts. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a legend known to everyone but the humans, the super-powerful 
Overfiend is reborn every 3,000 years to unite the dimensions in peace and 
happiness. Nagumo, a nerdy high-school student, may be the Overfiend without 
knowing it; Amano and Megumi, a brother-sister team from the Man-Beast World, 
think he is and protect him from marauding demons. 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts to ascertain his identity quickly devolve into a hodgepodge of 
Japanese animation cliches: flickering backgrounds, rapid-fire editing, 
explosions, monsters sprouting phallic tentacles, flesh blowing off skulls, 
fountains of blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The dubbed English dialogue is often unintentionally hilarious, providing a 
welcome note of levity. As a towering monster pulverizes Osaka, Amano warns 
that if the destruction doesn't stop, "I'll never forgive you!" Viewers 
unaccustomed to Japanese sci-fi will be repulsed by all the rape and gore. 
</P>
<P>
 MPAA: Unrated; contains profanity, cartoon nudity, sex, masturbation, rape and 
extreme violence.  
</P>

OPERA; 'LA HIJA DE RAPPACCINI': VENTURING A MEXICAN FANTASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Diego isn't reputed to harbor the world's most progressive opera company, 
or, for that matter, the world's most adventurous audience. But there it was, 
Saturday night at the Civic Theatre: the American premiere of "La Hija de 
Rappaccini," a.k.a. "Rappaccini's Daughter," by Daniel Catan. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was billed as "the first fully-professional production of an opera 
by a Mexican composer to be staged in the United States." At first glance, that 
shameful claim seemed hard to believe. But a lot of memory and file searching, 
not to mention head-scratching, produced no contradictory evidence. Another 
barrier broken at last. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the circumstances, it would be nice to hail "La Hija de Rappaccini" as a 
masterpiece. That, alas, would stretch generosity a bit beyond veracity. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in the quirky and irrational world of opera, one has to be grateful for 
small favors, and Catan's opera is just that. It may not abound in passionate 
revelation or lofty inspiration, but it is a serious, often compelling piece -- 
intelligently crafted and sensitively staged. 
</P>
<P>
 It speaks a sophisticated musical language with elegance. And, encountered 24 
hours after "Die Walkure" in Orange County, it also seems blessedly concise -- 
lasting only two hours, including the intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 The opera was first performed, with some of the same forces in a different 
staging apparatus, at the Teatro del Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City 
three years ago. Significantly, perhaps, the myopic musical Establishment north 
of the border paid no attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Our loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Catan, born in 1949 and a student of Milton Babbitt at Princeton, does some 
deep thinking in his first opera. Juan Tovar's poetic libretto is based on a 
play by the Nobel-Prize laureate Octavio Paz, whose source in turn was a story 
by Nathaniel Hawthorne. The plot concerns a presumably demented Italian 
botanist, Dr. Rappaccini, who cultivates exquisite flowers that happen to be 
poisonous. His creative empire blurs the lines that are supposed to separate 
good and evil, not to mention life and death. The central focus -- and central 
victim -- is the doctor's innocent daughter, Beatriz, whose blood bears a fatal 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
 There is plenty of room here for rumination. On one level, the opera can be 
regarded as just a tall twice-told tale. Remember the melodramatic Vincent 
Price movie of 1963? On other levels, the opera demands to be examined as a 
dark and complex symbolist fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Catan's score certainly avoids the easy lurid road. Obviously, he'd rather be 
subtle than crass. 
</P>
<P>
 The dominant metaphor in the work is Rappaccini's exotic garden. The composer 
makes it shimmer and glow and throb and rustle with orchestral impulses rooted 
in Debussy and Ravel. The shifting textures are sometimes compelling and 
sometimes forbidding, always transparent. They support the vocal lines 
effectively, but never -- repeat, never -- overpower the singers. 
</P>
<P>
 The vocal lines, unfortunately, aren't exactly fascinating. The characters 
converse, most of the time, in a rather monotonous sing-song. There is more 
parlando here than is par for so colorful a narrative course. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The doomed heroine does get to float some otherworldly pianissimo tones, and 
her suitor, the medical student next door, does get to flex a few ardent 
tenoral muscles. Most of the time, however, the disparate characters all sound 
pretty much the same as they gasp and sputter in the lush symphonic garden. The 
listener waits in vain for the melodic expansion implied by Catan's idiom, 
longs in vain for the ultimate cathartic gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 The music is beautifully crafted and tastefully restrained, to be sure. It may 
just be too polite for its own theatrical good. 
</P>
<P>
 The imaginative San Diego production, assembled by Ian D. Campbell, certainly 
accentuated the positive. Contrary to cautious tradition, modernism can be 
alive and well at the San Diego Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnathon Pape directed the drama with a knowing eye for abstraction, moving 
the action with swift, economic strokes from reality to dream to nightmare. 
John Conklin designed a strikingly spare set that frames the conflicts in an 
expressionist realm defined by cool neon accents, platforms raked at distorted 
angles and an endless array of huge flower-cutouts that drop from the sky and 
float across the stage invoking the mysterious sensuality of Georgia O'Keeffe. 
</P>
<P>
 Mimi Jordan Sherin oversaw the fluid lighting scheme. Barbara Bush created the 
simple, stylish costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast, uniformly strong and obviously dedicated, respected the wonted 
intimacy of expression. Soprano Encarnacion Vazquez projected the heroine's 
toxic purity with physical pathos and vocal radiance. Fernando de la Mora 
looked properly befuddled as the hero who would save her and thus kills her, 
and he exuded bel-canto lyricism. Catan's Padua proved more congenial for the 
tenor than Verdi's Mantua, which he explored here last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Samano brought solid dignity and matching tone to the muted ravings of 
Dr. Rappaccini. Ignacio Clapes voiced the warnings of his skeptical colleague 
with crisp authority and dynamic flexibility. Ellen Rabiner did what she could 
with the ominous mezzo-soprano platitudes of the old servant, Isabela. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone articulated the Spanish text with model clarity. The detailed 
super-titles proved functional, but, as always, distracted attention from the 
singers, flashed some key points prematurely and invited inappropriate 
laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Eduardo Diazmunoz conducted with a masterly combination of introspection and 
propulsion. It would be interesting to hear what he can do with the so-called 
standard repertory. 
</P>
<P>

THEATER; 'OUR SONG' HITS A FLAT NOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the late '70s, singles had discovered the importance of talking about their 
relationships ad nauseam but had yet to learn the meaning of co-dependency. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the world of "They're Playing Our Song," a musical comedy set 
implacably in that era. Since its premiere in Los Angeles and its subsequent 
Broadway run, it hasn't been seen very often. They haven't been playing its 
songs with any regularity. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder. There are only nine of them, and except for a couple of numbers 
near the top, most are generic pop ditties. They have a hard time grabbing a 
theater audience, especially in a hall as gigantic as the Terrace Theater, 
where Long Beach Civic Light Opera has chosen to disinter them. 
</P>
<P>
 For a show that was reportedly inspired by the relationship between its own 
composer and lyricist -- Marvin Hamlisch and Carole Bayer Sager -- the songs 
here are remarkably impersonal. 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes even worse. The first act finale, "Just for Tonight," apparently 
was added late in the process -- it's listed on the Broadway program but not on 
the original Los Angeles program. Yet it's the low point of the score, with 
impossible lines like "I'll be my feelings, and I know they'll lead me home." 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Simon's book isn't much more memorable. It contains his usual supplement 
of one-liners, and perks along capably enough in the first act, but it falls 
apart in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a boy-meets-girl, girl-loses-boy, boy-returns-to-girl story. The main 
problem is that the middle chapter is too lopsided in favor of the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonia Walsk is a mess, hopelessly co-dependent on her unseen ex-lover, often 
showing up as much as a day late for appointments with her new partner Vernon 
Gersch. While Simon made up a few references to Vernon's flaws as well -- 
something about his professional jealousy of Sonia and how that interferes with 
their love life -- there is no onstage evidence that Vernon's problems amount 
to much. Sonia is the one who would drive anyone crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 So her second act lecture to Vernon about her needs sounds like so much hot 
air. And their reconciliation is a hollow attempt to give the audience a 
supposedly happy ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorna Patterson, assisted by a parade of costumes that broadcast her dizziest 
side, is a strong Sonia, with a voice that's equally at home in a recording 
studio or on a stage. But Jack Wagner's Vernon lacks a distinctive comic charge 
like the one that Robert Klein brought to the original production. 
</P>
<P>
 Each lead is backed by a trio of singing and dancing "voices," alter egos who 
enliven the action occasionally, as does a parade of images on a screen at the 
back of the stage. Glenn Casale directed. 
</P>
<P>
 But generally this show is perilously thin. While it might have been less of a 
stretch in the smaller Center Theater next door, here it pales in comparison to 
the Kopit/Yeston "Phantom" -- which it replaced on the season schedule in an 
attempt to cut costs. 
</P>

COUNTERPUNCH: BRITS CAN'T ESCAPE FILM'S TRUTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY GEORGE, Terry George, a native of Belfast, is the co-screenwriter and 
co-executive producer of In the Name of the Father. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Surprise, Surprise! Some British lawmakers don't like "In the Name of the 
Father" ("Brit Lawmakers Take Issue With 'Name of the Father,' " Calendar, Feb. 
4). David Gritten in his report on the British Parliament screening of the 
movie focuses on the criticisms of the English politicians and media who claim 
the filmmakers "compromised" the Guildford Four story by "blatant falsehoods." 
In fact, what's going on in England at the moment is a campaign of falsehood 
and innuendoes aimed at defusing the righteous rage cinema-goers, particularly 
Americans, feel about the injustices perpetrated against Gerry and Giuseppe 
Conlon. 
</P>
<P>
 British critics have fumed about certain details we changed: "Gerry Conlon was 
not in the same cell as his father." Correct. But he was in the next cell for 
the last year and a half of Giuseppe's life and spent most of every day with 
him. "Paul Hill did not eat sausages in Annie Maguire's house." Correct. 
Instead, he met her in a bar. "The lawyer Gareth Pierce did not find the note 
'not shown to the defense' in the police archives." Correct. She discovered it 
in bed in her home as she examined a bundle of documents from the police 
archive. "We compressed two trials into one." Correct. But both trials had the 
same judge, the same prosecutor, and dealt with the same series of events. 
"British judges don't say, 'Case dismissed.' " . . . Enough already. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's set the record straight. "In the Name of the Father" tells the true 
story of Gerry Conlon's ordeal. He fled Belfast in 1974. He met up with Paul 
Hill in England. On the night, and at the time, of the Guildford bombing, Gerry 
Conlon met an unemployed man named Charlie Burke. Gerry Conlon returned to 
Belfast. He was arrested, flown to England and brutalized in a police station. 
He confessed. His father was arrested. Both received long prison sentences. The 
real bombers were arrested. They admitted the Guildford bombing. The British 
decided to ignore that admission. Giuseppe Conlon, an innocent man, died in 
prison. Gerry's lawyer, Gareth Pierce, discovered the Charlie Burke alibi 
evidence. The Guildford Four were freed by the appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
 That's Gerry Conlon's story. That's the film we made. The nit-picking by 
certain elements of the British press and the Establishment is accompanied by 
snide remarks about audiences on this side of the Atlantic: "Americans like to 
bring all politics down to Oedipal struggles and 'the politics of the poisonal 
,' it's no wonder they wet themselves in their hundreds at this touchy-feely 
field day" (Julie Burchill, London Sunday Times, Feb. 13). 
</P>
<P>
 Most despicably, victims are turned against victims. Some members of the 
Maguire family have been marshaled by the right-wing press to attack Gerry 
Conlon, as though he was the one who arrested the Maguires and sentenced them. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to Ireland, there are few impartial voices in Britain. 
Twenty-five years of war and terror, perpetrated by all sides, have guaranteed 
that anger is the emotion most prevalent in any discussion about The Troubles. 
But let's not allow partisanship to cast doubt on the central truth of this 
film. "In the Name of the Father" is not the acting out of some conspiracy 
theory -- it is a dramatic retelling of one of the most serious miscarriages of 
justice in British history. Nobody has challenged the basic facts at the heart 
of this film. Case dismissed.

SPIELBERG'S 'LIST' A CALL TO 'DUTY'; MOVIES: HOLOCAUST FILM 'WAS A STORY THAT 
NEEDED TO BE TOLD,' DGA AWARD WINNER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID J. FOX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "It's a surprise," said Clint Eastwood, joking with the crowd as he opened the 
envelope and read "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 It was exactly the title that almost everyone at the Directors Guild of 
America's dinner Saturday night expected would be announced, as the Steven 
Spielberg epic drama about the Holocaust continues to sweep this season's film 
prizes on an uninterrupted march to the Oscars, two weeks from tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 In a voice filled with emotion, Spielberg said the film "was my duty to make, 
as a filmmaker and a Jew. It was a story that needed to be told simply because 
the generations forget and every new generation needs to face their past all 
over again." 
</P>
<P>
 The film is the true story of Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party and 
a World War II industrialist, who saved more than 1,100 Polish Jews by 
convincing the Nazis it would be more cost-effective to employ them than to 
kill them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't ever think that film could be powerful enough to reach beyond the 
popcorn barrel and get people to change the way they think about the world," 
said Spielberg, the director of the two all-time top grossing movies, "Jurassic 
Park" and "E.T. -- The Extraterrestrial." "I always sort of left that to the 
novelists, the essay writers, the professors. I had no idea that a film could 
be made that would allow people into a subject which is profoundly horrific and 
they come away saying, 'I just didn't know it was that bad.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg's guild award was his second. The first was for 1985's "The Color 
Purple." He has been nominated five other times. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the seventh one," Spielberg said. "This is the best one." 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep hugging this (gold plaque). I'm going to take it to bed with me 
tonight." And he quickly added: "and my wife, Katie." 
</P>
<P>
 Spielberg won the prize over Jane Campion, nominated for "The Piano," Andrew 
Davis for "The Fugitive," James Ivory for "The Remains of the Day" and Martin 
Scorsese for "The Age of Innocence." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Spielberg is the world's most commercially successful filmmaker, his 
directing has never been recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and 
Sciences with its Oscar award. He was nominated for "Close Encounters of the 
Third Kind," "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and "E.T." 
</P>
<P>
 But this year seems different. "Schindler's List" has won Golden Globes and 
critics' honors. It is nominated for 12 Academy Awards. And now that Spielberg 
has won the Directors Guild honor, history favors him to take home Oscars. Only 
three times since the guild began giving awards in 1949 has the winner of the 
guild's prize failed to also win the Oscar for direction. More often than not, 
the Academy gives the Oscar for best picture to their best director winner. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the exceptions, however, is sure to give "Schindler's List" backers 
pause. In 1985, Spielberg won the guild award for directing "The Color Purple." 
He and the movie were nominated in 11 Oscar categories. But he and the movie 
went home with no Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Directors Guild prizes were presented in a dinner ceremony at the Beverly 
Hilton Hotel and at the Russian Tea Room in New York. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

'LIST'S' VIEWERSHIP LARGE IN GERMANY, OTHER COUNTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 During its first three days in Germany with a limited distribution, 
"Schindler's List" drew a large audience -- more than 62,000 viewers -- and 
sparked a demand for the film in cities where it is not yet playing. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience size "rates between excellent and outstanding," said Fred Sorg, 
general manager in Germany for United International Pictures (UIP), which is 
distributing the film in Europe. UIP is jointly owned by Universal Pictures 
(distributor of "Schindler's List" in the United States), Paramount Pictures 
and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Early box-office figures from Japan, Australia, England and France also were 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schindler's List" opened in Germany on Thursday, two weeks earlier than 
originally planned and on a relatively limited basis with just 35 copies, two 
dozen of them dubbed and 11 originals with partial subtitles. By contrast, 
"Philadelphia" opened in Germany with 203 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, from Thursday through Saturday, 62,800 people saw "Schindler's 
List," in Germany, spending about $500,000 at the box office. Another 25,000 
Germans were expected to see the film on Sunday, Sorg said in a telephone 
interview from Frankfurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The demand is incredibly high. People are phoning in to reserve tickets even 
in cities where it is not yet playing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, UIP also reported that the movie, which is limited in the number of 
playing times due to its three-hour-plus length, was doing big business in 
Japan -- $1.5 million in its first four days in 51 theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Australian business was strong with $1.6 million grossed after three weeks in 
48 theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 In England, the film had played on only 14 screens its first two weeks and 
pulled in $672,000, but was expanded to 147 theaters on Friday and took in an 
estimated $900,000 more over the weekend. In France, $295,000 in tickets were 
sold during the movie's first two nights, last Wednesday and Thursday, at 94 
theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorg said UIP hoped to deliver another 60 copies of the film to German 
theaters by Thursday and 100 more next week. He said the film originally had 
been scheduled to open on March 17, but director Steven Spielberg's visit last 
week pushed up the opening. The black-and-white prints, with some hand-painted 
color, take longer to produce than the typical color film.

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; CRASH TEST DUMMIES OFFER LIGHT PARABLES AT PALACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can't say the Crash Test Dummies lack for lyrical breadth. The Canadian 
group's show on Friday at the Palace began with "God Shuffled His Feet," in 
which the act of creation is immediately followed by humanity's questioning 
what the hell all those parables are about, and closed with "At My Funeral," a 
song in which, singer Brad Roberts explained, "I'm cheerfully put into a grave 
and the worms eat me."Yep, that pretty much covers it. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, with skittish songs weighing in on dualism, mortality and weird 
places the mind might wander during sex, the Dummies deigned to combine a 
healthy morbidity with an agreeably light touch, the obvious quirks veering 
near but avoiding a disastrous collision with preciousness. Their "Mmm Mmm Mmm 
Mmm" is the season's unlikeliest hit, and the Palace show -- combining material 
from the band's two albums -- showed there's more quasi-philosophically 
quizzical, anecdotal delights where that came from. They seem to like parables 
just as much as God, and it works for 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, one of rock's rare baritones, looks and sounds a little like a cross 
between Iggy Pop and Dan Aykroyd. Screwing up his face or winding up a weird 
world-view curveball, he's usually as amusing as he means to be; a capable 
raconteur, he doesn't overplay the wit quite so much as to negate the implicit 
pain. The band underscored his musings in a nice, gentle way, rollicking if not 
really rocking out, just driving enough on the debut album's country-flavored 
material as well as the new one's more mainstream folky-rock. CHRIS WILLMAN

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; MAGIC MISSING IN VER PLANCK WORKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marlene Ver Planck has almost everything one could ask for in a jazz-based 
singer of classic American songs: a gorgeous, musically pliable sound, a solid 
understanding of the linkages between words and story, and a sure and steady 
feel for rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 Working at the Jazz Bakery on Friday in one of her rare Los Angeles bookings, 
however, Ver Planck was missing one more important element: sufficient 
rehearsal time with her backup duo.No singer can completely overcome the 
problems inherent in inadequate preparation and the lack of a clear creative 
bond with accompanying musicians, and Ver Planck was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Bill Cunliffe and bassist Dave Carpenter are first-rate players who 
did a respectable job with Ver Planck's sometimes too-fussy and too-stylized 
arrangements. But the deep, symbiotic, almost sensual interaction between 
singer and accompanists that results in the most moving interpretations was 
simply not present, to Ver Planck's detriment. 
</P>
<P>
 Only during a few ballads -- "Body and Soul," "Two for the Road" and "Skylark" 
were good examples -- when Ver Planck was working solely with Cunliffe's piano, 
did one get a real sense of how superb the New Jersey-based performer can be. 
Other parts of the two-hour program, especially medleys of Gershwin and 
Ellington pieces and rhythm tunes such as "Nice and Easy," were pleasant 
enough, but bothersome for their failure to deliver the full gamut of Ver 
Planck's skills. DON HECKMAN

POP AND JAZZ REVIEWS; ETHNIC MUSIC BLOOMS AT RHINO 'MASHDOWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SNOWDEN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, why not enjoy a live world-music festival while casually browsing the 
bins at a record store? The idea made sense to Rhino Records, which presented a 
two-day "Global Music Mashdown" on Saturday at its Santa Monica store, with the 
Sunday show scheduled at its Westwood location. The free event featured a dozen 
locally-based world-music ensembles that were generally closer to the formal 
ethnomusicology zone than the global dance floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The small stage limited James Mcubea's eight-strong Kiyira Ensemble, and the 
Ugandan percussionist's set didn't really fit the informal setting, but that 
didn't keep the blend of dance and percussion pieces from sounding superb. A 
stringed instrument feature for African harps, lyres, fiddles and log xylophone 
was particularly effective in showing how the individual parts are layered into 
a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 A Man, Two Women & A Couch (actually a sextet) made the musical connection 
between Eastern European folk traditions and the English/Celtic variety with 
three-part vocal harmonies supported by the violin melodies and solos of John 
Zeretske (of the Aman Folk Ensemble). Spanish Fly offered a stripped-down, duo 
edition of their modern flamenco with guitarist Alberto De Almar and 
percussionist Rene Castro employing a savvy command of dynamics to great 
effect. DON SNOWDEN

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; 20TH-CENTURY WORKS DRAW AN AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Something unusual happened Friday night: The Los Angeles Philharmonic played a 
program of four works, all of them written in this century, and a sizable 
audience not only attended the event in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, it also 
stayed to the end. 
</P>
<P>
 There were, of course, a few leave-takings at intermission -- but none of the 
wholesale defections that sometimes accompany a 20th-Century program. Are our 
audiences growing more broad-minded? 
</P>
<P>
 To some, no doubt, the agenda may have looked forbidding: two acknowledged 
masterpieces by a composer whose name still strikes terror in some quarters, 
Bela Bartok; a famous, regularly encountered piece by the late Witold 
Lutoslawski; and a brand-new overturette, Steven Stucky's "Fanfare for Los 
Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 In the ear, at the first performance, this quartet of works boasted 
extraordinary variety in mood, texture and sound-profile. As conducted by music 
director Esa-Pekka Salonen -- returning to the Pavilion podium after taking an 
unscheduled night off, Thursday, for the birth of his second daughter -- the 
combination proved a delectation for the orchestra's subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 There was, however, unexpected disappointment in Salonen's loose-limbed 
reading of Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra, a work of great and dangerous 
familiarity. One anticipates its mystery, its urgency, its lyric soaring and 
its remembered pungency, especially as limned by this virtuosic orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of those qualities rose up again on this occasion. The laser-like 
concentration so often observed on this podium when Salonen is the occupant 
became spotty rather than consistent. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half, all conditions emerged positive. Stucky's new fanfare, this 
one for full orchestra, used the ensemble in a kaleidoscopic but pointed 
manner, filling ear and mind provocatively for all of two minutes. Then, 
Lutoslawski's haunting "Musique funebre" became, 36 years after its birth, a 
paean to its writer, who died last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Yefim Bronfman's completion this week of the Bartok piano concerto cycle, with 
the full-throated but sensitive collaboration of Salonen and the Philharmonic, 
reached an appropriate climax in the pianist's handsome detailing of all the 
mellow facets in the Third Concerto. This is a work that demands awesome 
pianistic resources, then uses them to create a sparse, serene otherworld. 
Bronfman excelled in every wise.DANIEL CARIAGA

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; KODO SHOW TURNS TO GOSPEL HOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Somebody switched the channel about 85 minutes into the Kodo program Saturday 
at the Wiltern Theatre, and suddenly the show turned into an old-fashioned 
revival hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the marathon-running drummers of Soto, Japan, have recently gotten 
Religion and feel that their message can be -- or needs to be -- amplified, as 
on this first-time occasion as part of a "One Earth Tour," through the addition 
of gospel singer Lecei Wright and her pianist and singers. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Wright sang her three songs with warmth and commitment, injecting 
some jazz riffs and scat singing. But for at least one long-term Kodo fan, the 
switch in style was a serious miscalculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Until that moment, the troupe's message had remained powerfully austere, 
nonverbal and abstract, capable of sustaining intellectual and philosophical 
musings, demanding them, almost, through the variety and architecture of the 
tonal imagery, or even by the players' refusal to guarantee socko endings to 
the pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they might switch gears to dampen-down any excitement or, 
contrariwise, continue the drumming to the point of emphasizing the 
percussionists' hyper-endurance and focus, rather than any sensory appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 For sheer metaphysics, consider "Monochrome," in which individual voices 
emerged and dissolved out of steady pianissimo rolls played by seven taiko 
players. Call the piece a study in dynamics, an imitation and evocation of 
abstract or natural forces, or a demonstration of the philosophical conundrum 
of the One and the Many. Anything else? Your choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Using players capable of evoking imagery such as this as a mere back-up band 
for Wright's throaty, amplified vocalism and sentimental lyrics diminished 
their extraordinary energy and vision. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the 900-pound O-Daiko drum sounded less compelling than it had earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kodo and Wright will appear at the Wiltern Theatre, 3790 Wilshire Blvd. 
through Wednesday at 8 p.m. Tickets: $13-$32. Information: (213) 380-5005.

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; SHAMAN FUNERAL RITES FROM KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From masked dancers and massed rifles among the Dogon of Mali to Dixieland 
marching bands in our own New Orleans, traditional funerals offer both 
spectacular entertainment and revealing insights about cultural values. 
</P>
<P>
 In Schoenberg Hall, UCLA, on Saturday, the Asia Society's ongoing Festival of 
Korea presented the Chindo Sikkim Kut Preservation Group in an 85-minute 
sampling of shaman funeral rites that can last nine hours on Chindo Island, 
southwest Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Incorporating song, instrumental music, chant and dance, these rituals of 
invocation, benediction, purification and leave-taking ended in a spirited drum 
dance by the group's director, Pyong-chon Park. However, an earlier sequence 
provided the evening's key image: a bolt of white cotton held waist-high and 
stretching across the stage, presumably from this world to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Over this symbolic pathway, one shaman (always women in Korea) held a bundle 
containing clothing of the deceased, another the white paper streamers used to 
contact the dead; a third, a large toy boat. Dressed in white robes and cloth 
caps, they resembled nuns and nurses -- and functioned as both in guiding the 
deceased away from the living. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the musicians were men in high, wide-brimmed black hats. Playing 
drums, gong, cymbals, flute, oboe, zither and two-stringed fiddle, they also 
added their voices to intense choral passages. If the women dancers exuded 
meticulous control in their stately rising/sinking footwork, delicate flicks of 
the wrists and subtle shifts in shoulder placement, the musicians supplied 
great vigor, weight and rhythmic force in their accompaniments. 
</P>
<P>
 With everyone seated in a semi-circle framing a table of offerings, this 
ceremony managed to be at once energetic and mournful, eloquently affirming the 
joy of living while accepting the inevitability of that long, white road.LEWIS

MUSIC AND DANCE REVIEWS; ORCHESTRE, DUTOIT GIVE FRENCH LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cards were stacked, but this wasn't cheating: the touring Orchestre 
National de France conducted by Charles Dutoit performing French classics by 
Berlioz and Debussy. 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone who knew this ensemble, this conductor and this repertoire, it 
looked like a foregone conclusion. The only real danger was if the participants 
took the night off and merely went through the motions of their extra-familiar 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, the concert 
became a revelation of authoritative wonders, a display of unquestionable 
expertise, as if the musicians had prefaced their performance with a 
collective, OK, listen, this is the way it goes, like some Parisian waiter 
correcting your French -- but without the upturned nose. 
</P>
<P>
 They opened with an athletic burst in Berlioz's "Le Corsaire" Overture, 
powering through its jagged course with smooth and muscular agility. 
</P>
<P>
 The 57-year-old Dutoit's take on Debussy's "La Mer" was thoroughly aggressive 
as well, stressing rhythm and drive over poetry and color. One might 
characterize it as cool if it hadn't been so urgent. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliciting the expected clarity and detail from his orchestra, Dutoit refused 
to dawdle over transitions or to loll in the mists. In uniformly fast tempos, 
the orchestra played with a lean force and visceral brightness (though one 
noted some minor blemishes in execution) and dynamic changes sounded quick, 
tense and firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Symphonie Fantastique" emerged as everything it should be and not a jot 
more. That is, it never slouched into vulgarity. This was a propulsive and 
super-heated reading but Dutoit got there not through any histrionic fakery or 
undue bombast, but through incisive rhythmic inflection, perfectly weighted 
instrumental balances and blends, and a dramatic sense of the (very) long line. 
The effect of Berlioz's play of cross-rhythms and stratified lyricism in this 
atmosphere was nothing short of startling. TIMOTHY MANGAN

 W e get letters. . . . The piece in Calendar accused Arsenio Hall of being a 
worshipful patsy in having Louis Farrakhan on his show. Rosenberg chose to 
display throughout his article his own very narrow-minded, negative and 
prejudiced attitude toward both Hall and Farrakhan and only reinforces the 
perception that Jews manipulate the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg suggests that Farrakhan is guilty of rejecting and obscuring facts. 
I would suggest that same misguided thought process is like suggesting that 
Rosenberg is guilty of rejecting and obscuring facts in the murder of 48 
Palestinians in the West Bank by not addressing that story in his article or 
that he is manipulating the news media because he is an American Jew who also 
writes for the Los Angeles Times.

 The three-fold weapon of "scapegoat," "anti-Semitism" and "Holocaust" stops 
any meaningful discussion of how things really are in the United States. The 
control of the media has allowed the Jews an unfair advantage on all issues 
pertaining to race. The blacks have and still do suffer indignities that no 
other group in the U.S. has had to endure. The blacks have defended America in 
all its recent wars far more in proportion than our Jewish citizens, yet they 
are unappreciated and scorned.

 It's important that people understand the slick tricks used by Farrakhan in 
his "Arsenio" appearance. Rosenberg missed many of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether he had Jewish friends, Farrakhan said that most inner-city 
blacks (of which he isn't one) don't have contact with Jews. Then he said he'd 
had several rabbis to dinner, and dined at their homes, with no friendships 
resulting. In effect, he told his followers, "You don't know Jews, but I've met 
some for you, and rejected them. None are worthy of acceptance." 
</P>
<P>
 This loving man of God said that even if the Nation of Islam members accused 
of murdering Malcolm X were guilty, one couldn't judge the whole group by those 
few. Why then does he talk about Jews as if they all owned slaves today?

 I found the CBS coverage of the Olympic Games excellent, and think that all 
the CBS employees did a great job. The exception was the pretentious Dan 
Rather-Connie Chung love-in. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also that outrageous 10-minute tribute to Israel and the Mossad, a 
shocking, discomforting intrusion. One moment, we were enjoying the ski 
jumping; the next, we were hot on the trail of "Palestinian terrorists," in a 
triumphal celebration of how the Mossad always gets its man. 
</P>
<P>
 The hook to this awful piece of pro-Israel propaganda was a 1973 assassination 
by a Mossad hit team of an Arab waiter in Lillehammer. It was an affront to 
Norway and a serious invasion of its national sovereignty. It had no proper 
place at the 1994 Olympics.

 CBS covered the games with such unprofessionalism. Am I going to be able to 
watch another conversation "starring" Rather and Chung, telling the world how 
wonderful and nice the other is? Nope. Can I believe Chung actually traipsed to 
Portland the week before Tonya Harding was due to arrive in Norway in order to 
obtain her "exclusive"? Nope. Does CBS (or anyone for that matter) still think 
the public waits with baited breath for the next Harding-Nancy Kerrigan 
episode? Yup . . . I guess. 
</P>
<P>
 All participants practice for years to try for the brass ring. They deserved a 
chance to be seen too. What I strongly objected to were the retrospectives, 
i.e., Sonja Henie, Brian Boitano et al. These took up time that could have been 
used for actual competition. I believe that everyone involved with CBS 
compromised their journalistic integrity to the self-serving sacrificial lamb.

absurd ad-agency reativity," I have made a personal decision to buy no more 
Campbell's soups, not another Toyota automobile (I have one now that is ready 
for replacement), and no Chrysler product; nor will I patronize any of the 
other sponsors of this fiasco.

 How stupid they were to think that we'd happily endure their too-frequent and 
overlong interruptions.

 Re the Trumps' tepid response to Digable Planets during the Grammys. The group

declared the Trumps the enemy . . . and you and me too, I guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, he was talking about black unity and said they should stop fighting 
each other and start fighting the "real enemies"? Or weren't you listening? 
Donald Trump was listening. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trumps weren't being square, they were being real . . . something you 
politically correct Times writers don't seem to have a clue about. I read 
several references to Digable Planets . . . all positive . . . nothing about 
Butterfly's fascist remark, not a whisper.

 You became totally irresponsible in my eyes two years ago when you supported 
San Francisco's public station KQED in its abominable effort to televise 
executions. Based on your critique of "Witness to the Execution," you still 
harbor the same detestable belief. 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone to sit down before a TV screen, munch a sandwich and watch someone 
really die before his eyes is absolutely subhuman. You declare that executions 
are acceptable to most American people, and that as a result the televising of 
executions should be considered proper. The acceptance of executions by the 
public is bad enough, and so why compound the felony by attempting to televise 
these events?

L.A. STREET PARTY CELEBRATES THE MARATHON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 More than 19,000 people ran, walked and wheeled themselves through the streets 
of Los Angeles on Sunday, turning the city's ninth annual marathon into a 
gigantic street party for spectators, a traffic quagmire for motorists and a 
showcase for extraordinary willpower. 
</P>
<P>
 And the rabbit won. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah's Paul Pilkington, who was hired as the event's "rabbit" to pace the 
field of elite runners, instead crossed the finish line first with a time of 2 
hours, 12 minutes and 13 seconds. Mexican-born Olga Appell, who became an 
American citizen last week, was the first woman across, with a time of 2:28:12. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilkington, 35, said he kept going after 15 miles because he felt good running 
in the cool, moist morning air that turned out to be perfect for a marathon, 
and not bad for a spectators' bash either. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't come with me," Pilkington said of the top runners he assumed 
would eventually pass him. "Tactically they made a mistake by not keeping up. I 
didn't decide to stay in until the 15th or 16th mile." 
</P>
<P>
 But Italy's Luca Barzaghi, who came in second, said he expected Pilkington to 
drop out after 20 miles and was upset to learn he did not. So sure was Barzaghi 
that he had won that he had already chosen the color of the Mercedes that the 
first-place finisher wins along with a $15,000 prize. Poland's Andrzej Krzyscin 
finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's more compelling story, as always, was the thousands of other 
marathon participants who took to the streets of the city, setting off outside 
the Coliseum to the blasting refrains of Randy Newman's "I Love L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 19,000 participants, nearly 3,000 were from Orange County, according to 
a marathon official. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 1 million people lined the route, proffering refreshments, 
holding signs and balloons and yelling at runners to keep moving, it wasn't 
much farther, and they were really lookin' good! 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan, accompanied by boxing legend Muhammad Ali, fired the 
starter's gun. "Ali! Ali!" runners chanted as they strode by. 
</P>
<P>
 The runners came in all ages and in nearly every physical condition, in every 
get-up from slick running gear to bunny ears, midriff tops and what looked like 
an armadillo suit. Some pushed their children in aerodynamic strollers, while 
the wheelchair competitors pushed themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wheelchair division, Frenchman Phillipe Couprie and Australia's Paul 
Wiggins tied as winners. They came in first by hard work and together by choice 
-- they held hands as they crossed the finish line side by side. 
</P>
<P>
 And for those few who thought that running 26.2 miles was not quite enough 
pain, Sol Wroclawsky, 40, was dragging a wheeled steel contraption called the 
"Riksha Runner" that he said adds six pounds of resistance. (There was no word 
on whether Wroclawsky, attempting his first marathon in 14 years, made it 
across the finish line.) 
</P>
<P>
 The marathon course looped and wound its way through 14 of the city's 
neighborhoods -- from Exposition Park, through Downtown, up Sunset Boulevard, 
to Hollywood, Koreatown, through the heart of the city's Central American 
community and back to the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400 city streets were closed for the race, creating a maze of detours 
that clogged the streets with motorists desperately seeking a way around. 
Several freeway exits were blocked, turning the Harbor and later the 
quake-beleaguered Santa Monica Freeway into virtual parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time we have this many closures, it screws up the entire city," Los 
Angeles police Capt. Sandy Wasson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Los Angeles appeared to feel that the chaos was worth it -- at least 
for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good duty. You get to meet a lot of nice people," said Officer Martha 
Lopez of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority police. She does not run, 
"at least not on purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the runners crested a hill on Wilshire Boulevard heading to Koreatown, 
Kim Eun Soo stood happily clapping her hands. "Jal han da!" she said, again and 
again. Her neighbor explained that in Korean it means, "Very good!" 
</P>
<P>
 Farther up the road, Jerry Johnson, who had been watching the marathon on TV 
when she realized it was close to her door, was out on the curb yelling, "Pump 
it up! All the way! Come on! Over the hill!" 
</P>
<P>
 In South-Central Los Angeles, Curtiss Copeland, 58, had staked out a corner at 
Mile 24 with a folding chair he had toted from home. "I love it. It's amazing," 
he said. "Especially the wheelchair guys. They come flying by with the power of 
their own. So at least there's hope, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting nearby was Miss Pruiet, who preferred not to reveal her age or her 
first name. "This is exciting because people are up for it," she said. "They 
are friendly. In Los Angeles, how many times do you find people talking to 
people they don't know?" 
</P>
<P>
 More than midway through the course, runner Marlen Mertz was indeed talking a 
lot -- with Ron Ribstein of Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "He met up with me along Mile 3," Mertz said. "But we might get married." (She 
later swore it was a joke.) 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing their seven-year tradition, one group of six women friends stayed 
overnight in a Los Angeles hotel and started the race at 6:15 a.m -- more than 
two hours before the official 8:40 start -- because they wanted to make sure 
that they crossed the finish line before the marathon closed down. 
</P>
<P>
 As is their custom, they were walking the entire way. Keeping up a brisk pace 
at the 17-mile mark, they were raving about the quality time the marathon lets 
them spend together, away from ringing phones or people asking them to do 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get to talk to each other for 6 1/2 hours," said Ellen Pearlman, a 
45-year-old psychologist. "The greater the pain, the more interesting the 
story. We talk about guilt, our mothers. We finish stories that we started a 
long time ago and never got the chance to finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the course, runners were serenaded by sidewalk gospel choirs, 
marimba musicians, Taiko drummers, salsa bands and almost every rhythm in 
between. Volunteers held Gatorade and water at arm's length so that runners 
need not slow down to grab a cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, they yell at you if you're not holding it the right way," said 
volunteer Mary Page of the Junior League of Los Angeles. "Or they yell, 'Too 
full!' " 
</P>
<P>
 At the starting line, Paul Rodriguez, a computer consultant from Paramount, 
said a friend gave him the idea of trying a marathon for the first time. "My 
main goal is to get to Hollywood," he said. "Just like everybody else from out 
of town." 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer George Jackson, 27, said when he left his house early Sunday morning he 
only had plans to pick up the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he found the streets clogged with runners and the area around the 
Coliseum in high party gear. Vendors were selling everything from steamed fish 
and foot futons to "therapeutic magnetic jewelry." You could sign up to join 
the Rainforest Action Network or get a free spinal screening. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said the spirit of the event just carried him along. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm running free-lance," he said, jogging in the T-shirt and shorts he had 
left home in. "I run every morning anyway. I figure I'll call my wife after 
about eight miles to come and get me." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, said they would never dream of giving up. This marathon was 
more than a race -- it was a test. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going pretty bad. I'm in a lot of pain," said Phillip Park, 33, as he 
stopped to massage a bad ankle just past the 17-mile mark. "I'm going to 
finish. I have to, to be complete, to be a man." 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly passing Park was Terry Ghiselli, an 18-year-old college student from 
Sunland, who was wincing with pain, complaining of a bad knee. It was his third 
marathon and he was not about to drop out now. If it came to that, he said, he 
would walk the course. 
</P>
<P>
 And even those who could not go the distance vowed to return next year. 
First-timer Adolf Naranjo, 21, of San Fernando dropped out after getting leg 
cramps after 17 miles. He blamed it on long hours working since the January 
earthquake with the Federal Emergency Management Agency helping to process 
thousands of victims' claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "It detracted from my chances of finishing here," he said. "This was really 
important to me. For sure, I'm going to try next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Police reported no major problems along the marathon route. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very exciting but very tame from a law enforcement standpoint," the 
LAPD's Wasson said. Police said the crowd was calm.

MONEY SPECULATOR SOROS WEATHERS $600-MILLION BLOW; CURRENCY: THE WIDELY WATCHED 
BILLIONAIRE, WHO MANAGES THE INTERNATIONAL QUANTUM GROUP FUNDS, APPEARS TO HAVE 
SHAKEN OFF THE RUMORS THAT HE IS IN FINANCIAL TROUBLE.

<P>
 There are, no doubt, a few central bankers around the world who would not mind 
seeing the wheel of fortune turn against George Soros, the billionaire 
speculator whose huge bets on currency movements have wrecked the monetary 
policies of some countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Economist magazine called him the "Man Who Broke the Bank of England," 
after his speculation against the British pound helped force Britain to drop 
out of Europe's exchange rate mechanism in 1992, and temporarily wrecked the 
hopes for a common European currency. That bet earned Soros and the investment 
funds he oversees $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the 63-year-old Soros suffered an unaccustomed major loss of $600 
million in one day last month -- prompting rumors that he was in financial 
trouble -- the Soros empire appears to have taken it in stride. 
</P>
<P>
 Soros, along with a lot of other managers of big international hedge funds, 
got caught by the recent wild gyrations of the world currency and bond markets. 
In his case, his Quantum Group of funds wagered Feb. 14 that the yen would 
continue to fall against the dollar. Instead, the Japanese currency surged 5% 
the same day, after trade talks between the United States and Japan broke down. 
</P>
<P>
 A Soros spokesman, who insisted that his name not be used, said the loss was 
partly offset by gains since the beginning of the year, leaving the Quantum 
Funds down only about 2.7%. He said the impact of the $600-million loss was 
spread evenly among the individual funds. He said the Soros empire has about 
$12 billion in assets under its management. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a lot of rumors that have blown it out of proportion," the 
spokesman said, noting that Soros receives intense attention because of the 
extraordinarily successful record of his funds, which were up 60% to 70% last 
year. In recent years, the funds have appreciated at an average annual rate of 
40%. 
</P>
<P>
 A manager at a rival global hedge fund, who also didn't want his name used, 
said losses like the one Quantum suffered are merely "fairly normal volatility 
given the nature of these funds' big trades." 
</P>
<P>
 A Hungarian Jew who managed to escape from the Nazis, Soros after the war got 
a degree at the London School of Economics. He began working on Wall Street in 
1956 as an analyst and currency trader. 
</P>
<P>
 He founded the Curacao-based Quantum Fund in 1969, which has been open only to 
non-U.S. investors. Lately, he has left much of the daily management of the 
funds to his deputy, Stanley F. Druckenmiller, while Soros pursues a consuming 
interest: Donating hundreds of millions of dollars toward rebuilding Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 His speculation against certain national currencies and his sometimes 
vitriolic public criticism of central bank policies, however, has left him with 
potential enemies in high places. 
</P>
<P>
 "Say you're the senior person at the Bank of England, you make the equivalent 
of $45,000 a year, you have three degrees and have written learned monographs, 
and you've been reading for the last year and a half that Mr. George Soros has 
been saying what a moron you are," explains James Grant, editor of Grant's 
Interest Rate Observer in New York. "Mr. Soros has inflamed the animosity of 
the global regulatory community against him." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant also says that for a hedge fund manager, a notoriously private breed, 
Soros has made himself conspicuous by his very public philanthropy in Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an unwritten rule," Grant says, "that you do not go bruiting your 
success or flashing your wallet," and warns that Soros might be inviting 
retribution. "He seems to be flying very close to the sun." 
</P>
<P>
 The great unknown with hedge funds is the amount of borrowed money used in 
speculation. The funds typically borrow huge sums to leverage their bets. By 
doing so, profits can be greatly magnified. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the market goes against the speculator, the same use of borrowed funds 
can multiply losses, leading to potentially disastrous results depending on the 
amount of money involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Soros, however, has weathered big losses before. According to published 
reports, the Quantum Funds lost $800 million a short while before the October, 
1987, stock market crash, betting the wrong way on Japanese stocks.

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: TIGHTER CREDIT MAY NOT SQUEEZE WALL STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Coming soon to the Economy Theater, a horror tale: "The Tightening, Part II." 
</P>
<P>
 But will it be anywhere near as violent and bloody as the first one? 
</P>
<P>
 After another batch of healthy economic reports last week, many Wall Streeters 
are betting that the Federal Reserve Board will tighten credit again soon, for 
the second time in a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokerage CS First Boston in New York told clients Friday that the Fed could 
act as early as today by raising its discount rate from 3% to 3.5%. That rate, 
which banks pay for short-term loans from the Fed, hasn't been increased since 
early 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 A discount-rate hike, after the Fed's quarter-point boost in another key 
short-term interest rate on Feb. 4, would signify that the central bank is 
serious about restraining the economy and with it the potential for higher 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Fed, as more often than not, finds itself in the difficult position of 
trying to orchestrate the economy without driving stock and bond markets to 
ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 And there has been plenty of ruin to go around in recent weeks, as Wall Street 
has responded to the Fed's first tightening with a deeper sense of anguish than 
most pros had expected: Long-term bond yields have surged nearly a half-point 
since Feb. 4, while stocks have slumped. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, some experts believe the markets have factored in not only the 
first Fed rate boost, but the next one as well. That could mean that, if the 
Fed does act this week, stocks and bonds will respond either favorably to the 
news, or not at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts point to the markets' action on Friday, after the government reported 
a surprising drop in the nation's unemployment rate, to 6.5% from 6.7% in 
January: 
</P>
<P>
 * Short-term Treasury bill yields jumped on the news, indicating that traders 
believe the Fed will seize on the strong employment report to boost rates 
again. Yields on 3-month T-bills shot up to 3.62% from 3.56% on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The T-bill yield was 3.06% just before the Fed surprised markets with its 
first rate hike on Feb. 4. Because that initial hike was just a quarter-point, 
while the T-bill yield has since risen 0.56 points, it's obvious that markets 
are assuming the Fed will do more, and soon. 
</P>
<P>
 * While short-term yields surged, long-term bond yields closed little changed 
on Friday after an initial rise. The 30-year T-bond yield closed at 6.83%, 
unchanged from Thursday after hitting 6.88% early in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The reappearance of bond buyers, despite the February employment news, 
suggested that the market may be comfortable with long-term yields at current 
levels even if the Fed raises short-term rates further. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Fed has made clear that its No. 1 goal in tightening credit early 
is to quash inflation, which should in theory make the bond market happy 
because long-term interest rates are ultimately determined by the level of 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 * The stock market had a good day Friday, signaling that many investors are 
responding more to the promise of higher corporate profits in a healthy economy 
than to the risk posed by a gradual rise in short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrials gained 7.88 points to 3,832.30 on Friday, and rising 
issues solidly outnumbered losers on the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq 
Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most significant, the Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks 
leaped 5.97 points to 790.55 on Friday, and is now just 1.2% below its all-time 
high of 800.47 set on Jan. 31. The Dow, in contrast, is off 3.7% from its peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Wall Streeters say the surprising strength of smaller stocks in recent 
weeks may herald another rally in the aging bull market, despite the rising 
number of bears who believe that higher interest rates spell certain death for 
the bull. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a fight between rising (corporate) earnings and fear of higher 
interest rates, and I think earnings will win," says Louis Navellier, an 
Incline Village, Nev., money manager who runs $900 million for clients. 
</P>
<P>
 But can the bond market also win? Many pros are less sanguine about bonds' 
longer-term prospects, even if the market sails through the next Fed hike. 
That's because Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and others may keep harping about 
the possibility of still-higher rates in the future, making it tough for bond 
investors to regain their composure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult for the bond market to look through to the fundamentals of low 
inflation when so many Federal Reserve officials are talking about the next 
tightening," says Lacy Hunt, chief U.S. economist for HSBC Holdings, a Hong 
Kong banking giant. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes that the Fed ought to lay low for now. Noting the surge in bond 
yields and the plunge in stock markets worldwide since Feb. 4, Hunt says, "I 
think the Fed has induced a considerable amount of restraint in the (economy)" 
just with its initial quarter-point interest rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Schlossberg, economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco, also 
believes the Fed can afford to hold off, even though the market is already 
expecting another quarter-point rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, he says, the Fed may take its next cue from the bond market: If 
long-term yields continue to rise, suggesting that investors believe higher 
inflation is coming, the Fed may have to aggressively boost short rates to 
demonstrate its resolve to fight inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No Bonus For CDs: Though short-term interest rates are rising, you'll be 
waiting a long time for bank and S&L certificate of deposit yields to move up 
much, warns Bob Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor. "Godot will show up 
sooner," he jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 CD yields have barely budged despite the Fed's quarter-point rate hike a month 
ago. The national average yield on 1-year CDs is now 3.14%, up from 3.08% 
immediately before the Fed move, according to Bank Rate Monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Banks pay what they can get away with," Heady notes, and most banks simply 
don't need more deposits today. Given the wide spread between U.S. Treasury 
security yields and CD yields, most savers in 6-month and 1-year CDs would be 
better off buying Treasury securities of those terms direct.

 SCEcorp Dividend Cut? Southern California Edison's parent company is warning 
its 136,000 shareholders that their cash dividend may have to be cut, and Wall 
Street is acting as if it's a done deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The electric utility's holding company, SCEcorp, tells shareholders in the 
1993 annual report now in the mail that its earnings are being squeezed as 
regulators lower its allowed rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 In language clearly meant to raise a red flag, John E. Bryson, SCE's chief, 
says in his shareholder letter that reduced returns "unavoidably . . . will 
affect our ability to raise or possibly even retain current dividend levels." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies rarely spook shareholders with talk of a lower dividend unless 
chances are substantial that such a cut will occur. Electric utilities are 
particularly sensitive about their dividends because that payout, not share 
price appreciation, is the primary reason investors own the stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, SCEcorp shares have plunged with other electric utilities 
since last fall. Much of that decline has been related to rising interest 
rates, which force utility shares down in order to force their dividend yields 
up, so that the stocks are competitive with bonds and other income investments. 
</P>
<P>
 But SCEcorp's 29% stock slide, from $25.75 last fall to $18.25 now, has far 
exceeded the declines of most other utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 At the current price, SCEcorp's annual dividend of $1.42 a share provides a 
yield of 7.8% -- well above the yields of most other major utility stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 That return is so high, in fact, it's a sign that Wall Street doesn't believe 
it can continue. Many analysts believe investors have pushed the price down in 
anticipation of a dividend cut by SCEcorp, effectively valuing the stock based 
on some lower future dividend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's at least 50-50 that they'll cut the dividend, and maybe a little 
stronger," said Linda Byus, analyst at Duff & Phelps. 
</P>

 SCEcorp's net earnings were $1.43 a share in 1993 after one-time charges, 
which means earnings barely covered the $1.42-a-share dividend. This year, Byus 
expects earnings to be no higher than $1.45 a share. Typically, utilities aim 
to pay out no more than 75% to 80% of their earnings in dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides state regulators' decision to lower what SCEcorp can earn in line with 
the long-term decline in interest rates in recent years (that's how utility 
returns are set), the company has also suffered from the Southland economy's 
recession and from lower-than-expected contributions from its Mission Energy 
independent power arm.

A TALE OF 2 POLICIES; HOW YOUR QUAKE INSURANCE CAN SAVE YOU -- OR SINK YOU; 
VALENCIA HOMEOWNER REENA NEWHALL PAID MORE THAN TWICE WHAT HER NEIGHBOR DID FOR 
PROTECTION THAT WASN'T HALF AS EFFECTIVE. THAT CHASM IN COVERAGE SAYS MUCH 
ABOUT THE EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE BUSINESS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two neighbors, two insurance policies, two vastly different stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Tucker and Reena Newhall live next door to each other in a new Valencia 
subdivision that was badly jolted by the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Their stucco-sheathed homes, built by the same contractor in similar styles, 
suffered similar destruction: deep cracks and some structural damage inside, 
broken tiles and brickwork outdoors, and cabinets full of china, glassware and 
other personal items smashed to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tucker's earthquake insurance will cover everything beyond a single 
$22,100 deductible, whereas Newhall must meet separate deductibles of $68,550 
for the home itself and $34,275 for its contents. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Newhall's policy costs $994 a year and Tucker's, $387. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have so much insurance that we don't have any," Newhall exclaimed during a 
recent interview in her battered kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 That Reena Newhall could pay more than twice as much for coverage that in this 
case isn't even half as effective says much about the earthquake insurance 
business and shows why consumers need to educate themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the first question to ask is whether earthquake insurance is 
necessary in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians spent $524 million on quake insurance in 1992, which was nearly 
three-quarters of the total for the whole country, according to the Insurance 
Information Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, fewer than one in four Californians statewide bother to buy the 
coverage. It is more popular in Southern California, where up to 40% of 
homeowners have it. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common reasons people give for refusing the coverage are high prices 
and high deductibles. Rates range from $1.25 to $10 per $1,000 worth of 
coverage, although about $2 per $1,000 is typical. 
</P>
<P>
 The standard deductible is 10% of coverage limits, but policies are available 
with deductibles as high as 25%. State Farm, California's largest insurer, is 
one of the few companies that still sells earthquake insurance with a 5% 
deductible. Many carriers phased out 5% deductibles after the 1989 Loma Prieta 
quake ravaged the Bay Area. 
</P>
<P>
 High deductibles are one reason why insurers shoulder a relatively small share 
of the burden in earthquakes. However, experts still recommend buying 
earthquake insurance. Although it can be frustrating to pay for an insurance 
policy that provides no protection against a slight or moderate loss, experts 
believe consumers ought to change their thinking about earthquake insurance. 
Its real value comes in its protection against a severe or total loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to tell people not to buy quake insurance, but frankly, we're less 
comfortable with that position now," said Gail Hillebrand, a lawyer with 
Consumers Union in San Francisco. "It is a bad buy relative to your chances of 
ever collecting, but it's the only thing out there." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Loma Prieta earthquake, insurers paid out claims of $960 million, while 
total destruction reached some $7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The ratio of insurance payouts to total damage might be similar in the 
Northridge quake. The official industry estimate of insured damage is $2.5 
billion, although some insurance experts expect that number to climb. The total 
cost -- including damage to uninsured public infrastructure such as freeways -- 
is now estimated from $13 billion to $20 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura resident Kathy Nenneker, whose home sustained about $15,000 worth of 
damage -- less than her deductible -- said she and her husband have been 
debating whether to keep their quake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the house falls down, the 10% deductible suddenly isn't so bad," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emily Chan Clark's house didn't fall down, but it did shift from its 
foundation and sprout cracks in every direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northridge resident said the damage could be anywhere from $100,000 to 
$250,000, including contents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a plate or glass or bowl to my name," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 From her perspective, the $18,000 deductible looks insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you one thing," she said. "The premium I pay on the earthquake 
insurance is sure worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus, then, seems to be that earthquake insurance is worthwhile, but 
consumer advocates emphasize that you need to know what you're shopping for. 
The earthquake insurance market has undergone some dramatic changes in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, the disaster that has had the most profound influence on the 
market was not an earthquake at all, but the Oakland and Berkeley firestorm of 
October, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 After the conflagration, which killed 25 and destroyed more than 2,500 homes, 
many fire victims discovered that they were woefully underinsured because their 
policy limits either hadn't kept pace with rising construction costs or hadn't 
fully reflected the value of their homes in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 For those with "guaranteed replacement value" coverage, it was the insurer's 
responsibility to restore the home regardless of cost. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many people had "actual cash value" coverage, meaning that the payout 
was strictly capped at the policy limits. If you had a $100,000 policy, 
$100,000 was the most you could collect, even if it would cost $300,000 to 
rebuild your house. 
</P>
<P>
 A huge public outcry ensued, with homeowners, consumer advocates and 
politicians accusing insurance companies of failing to adequately inform and 
protect their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers bowed to the pressure, paying some $300 million beyond policy limits 
on Oakland fire claims -- in effect acting as though people were entitled to 
guaranteed replacement coverage whether their policies said so or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined not to get caught the same way twice, the industry began 
aggressively reviewing its homeowners' coverage to make sure that policy limits 
reflected the actual costs of rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 These so-called insure-to-value programs came under harsh criticism last week 
by Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, who said there are such wide 
variations in how insurers calculate construction costs and apply annual 
inflation factors that the result can be "as unfair as the scoring for Olympic 
figure skating." 
</P>
<P>
 How did the insure-to-value programs affect earthquake coverage? 
</P>
<P>
 Two ways, in the case of Reena Newhall, the Valencia homeowner who discovered 
that her coverage didn't measure up to her next-door neighbor's. 
</P>
<P>
 First, her insurer, TIG Insurance Co. (formerly Transamerica Insurance Co.), 
sent her and other policyholders a form in mid-1992, asking for detailed 
information about home size and design features. Based on Newhall's responses, 
TIG boosted her policy limits by 20%, from $380,000 to $457,000. That caused 
the limits on her personal property coverage (one-half the dwelling limits, in 
TIG's standard policy) to take a similar leap, from $190,000 to $228,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, with Oakland fresh in mind, TIG hired a consultant to analyze the 
company's exposure to various kinds of disasters. The consultant reported that 
if an 8.3-magnitude earthquake -- the strength of the San Francisco quake of 
1906 -- struck the San Andreas fault, TIG would face potential losses of $110 
million, according to TIG Vice President Dave Rowlands. 
</P>
<P>
 That number was unacceptably high, Rowlands said, so TIG -- with the approval 
of Garamendi's office -- reduced its exposure by boosting the deductibles on 
its earthquake coverage. For people like Reena Newhall with policy limits of 
over $100,000, the deductible jumped from 10% to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, from one year to the next, her deductibles nearly doubled -- from 
$38,000 to $68,550 on the dwelling and from $19,000 to $34,275 on the contents. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, next door, Jan Tucker had insurance with the Auto Club of Southern 
California. Because it doesn't operate in the Bay Area and was unscathed by the 
Oakland fire, the Auto Club did not undertake any sweeping changes in its 
homeowner policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucker's home is one story and 3,150 square feet, Newhall's two stories and 
3,800 square feet. The styles and interior construction features are nearly 
identical. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the two insurers' rebuilding cost estimates are radically different. 
TIG's estimate is $120 per square foot and Auto Club's only $70 per square 
foot, which accounts for much of the difference in policy limits between the 
two homes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was these kinds of variations that Garamendi criticized in last week's 
broadside against insure-to-value programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall, whose husband, Anthony, is a descendant of the founder of the Newhall 
Land & Farming Co., developer of the master-planned community of Valencia and a 
major landowner in the Santa Clarita Valley, admits that she didn't always pay 
attention to her insurance bills as they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wrote the check," she said. "Pretty stupid, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Newhall also blames her insurance agent and TIG for not making more of an 
effort to bring the policy changes to her attention and explain how they came 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi announced that he is developing new regulations to require insurers 
to inform policyholders in their annual renewal notices about exactly how 
inflation and construction cost factors contributed to any change in their 
premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer advocates favor greater disclosure as well, but they add that 
homeowners shouldn't be passive in evaluating a product as complex as 
earthquake insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to take control," said Mary Griffin, insurance counsel for the 
Consumers Union in Washington. "Don't just let other people tell you what's 
happening. You have to really read the policy." 
</P>
<P>
 And after reading the policy, shop around. There's enough variety in 
homeowner's insurance products that comparison shopping can pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 Newhall is unhappy with just about every aspect of her policy, but there are 
cases where separate deductibles like hers are an advantage over a single, 
lump-sum deductible like Tucker's. If the only damage you suffered was to your 
home's contents, for example, you'd be better off with the separate deductible 
because it's lower.

 It may take lot of blood, sweat and tears to buy into this conspiracy theory. 
</P>
<P>
 Add to the list of weird historical theories a new one: that the late British 
Prime Minister Winston Churchill "played a significant role" in the stock 
market crash of 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly what role isn't clear, but that's what promoters of the new book "The 
Greatest Story Never Told" are saying as they send out promotional materials 
claiming to show Churchill and his brother met for nearly two months with top 
U.S. bankers, business leaders and key government officials in the weeks 
leading up to the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 If that isn't enough, the promoters also claim there was "a private Fifth 
Avenue gala banquet in Churchill's honor the night of the crash in 1929" just 
before Churchill and his brother left to return to England. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago author Pat Riott is quoted as saying that before he wrote the book, "2 
+ 2 was never adding up to 4." For Riott, it has added up to about 25,000 books 
sold so far, according to his publisher. Ecologically Incorrect

 The Simple footwear catalogue offers a welcome change for anyone weary of 
self-righteous environmental plugs companies give themselves whenever they use 
recycled paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple, part of Deckers Outdoor Corp. in Carpinteria, Calif., includes the 
following message on its catalogue: 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely no recycled paper was used for this catalogue. It is printed on 
paper made from really young naive trees, cut down in their prime by dull, smog 
producing chain saws. Subsequently much of the rain forest was destroyed and 
ultimately the ozone hole has grown into a vast gaping chasm." (Simple also 
admits that it's all a joke.) 
</P>
<P>
 Deckers President Doug Otto says the message was written by Eric Meyer, 
Simple's founder and president. 
</P>
<P>
 Otto describes Meyer as "anti-hype." Otto said Meyer once ran a print 
advertisement for his products using copy that read "blah, blah, blah." eep Aid 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another post-earthquake product promotion comes from Washington state 
"relaxation therapist" Caroline M. Sutherland. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying she's concerned about what she calls "aftershock insomnia," Sutherland 
is promoting her line of audiotapes she says helps children relax and sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutherland calls then "positivity tapes." 
</P>
<P>
 The negative impact on one's wallet is $10 per cassette, or $19.95 for a tape 
with a doll. Briefly . . .

 The recreation industry's trade group quotes the head of a firm that tracks 
cultural trends as saying RVs offer "the perfect answer for many baby boomers

 Harding Protests Use of Photo in Ad: A potential legal brawl has emerged in 
New York over the use of Olympic figure skater Tonya Harding's photo in a 
pun-filled newspaper ad for two music bargain stores. But her lawyers pointed 
out that Harding, under investigation in the Jan. 6 attack on Nancy Kerrigan, 
has not authorized commercial use of her name or likeness. The ad in the 
current Village Voice and NY Press is for two Tower Clearance Outlets owned by 
Tower Records in New York. The photo of Harding adjoins a cartoon balloon that 
suggests she is saying, "Unbeatable bargains that will bring you to your knees.

PRESCOTT, ARIZ., TOPS LIST OF PLACES TO RETIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three hundred sunny days a year and fresh mountain air -- as well as 
affordable housing and cultural offerings -- helped make Prescott, Ariz., the 
top place to retire in a Money magazine ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine said that despite a cost of living 6% higher than the national 
average, Prescott, a mile-high mountain town 90 miles from Phoenix, was rated 
No. 1 largely because of its mild climate and relaxed lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 The other cities in Money's top five: Fairhope, Ala.; Mount Dora, Fla.; Las 
Vegas, and Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine rated its top 20 places to retire on factors including housing, 
economic outlook, health care and climate. The rankings appear in the 
magazine's special retirement guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Money asked seven experts to list what retirees wanted when they relocate, 
then drew up a list of 10 attributes. Those included low crime rate, mild 
climate, affordable housing, attractive environment, proximity to cultural and 
educational activities, strong economic outlook and excellent health care. 
</P>
<P>
 The experts ranked the 20 places that best met those criteria. 
</P>
<P>
 In Prescott, two-bedroom homes or condominiums cost an average of $115,000. 
The town has four museums, three performing arts facilities and extensive 
outdoor recreation opportunities, Money said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the town's 28,000 people, 22.5% are older than 65, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining places in the top 20 are: Naples, Fla.; Sedona, Ariz.; Palm 
Springs; Aiken, S.C.; Fayetteville, Ark.; Kerrville, Tex.; Brevard, N.C.; 
Durango, Colo.; Asheville, N.C.; Myrtle Beach, S.C.; St. George, Utah; 
Hendersonville, N.C.; Sequim, Wash.; Charleston, S.C., and Clayton, Ga.

SEC ACTS TO CURB LAWYER FEES IN PRUDENTIAL CASE; LAWSUITS: THE AGENCY URGES A 
JUDGE TO GIVE INVESTORS' ATTORNEYS LESS THAN THE $26 MILLION THEY REQUESTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a highly unusual move, the Securities and Exchange Commission has urged a 
federal judge to give investors' lawyers much less than the $26 million in 
legal fees that they have requested in a class-action lawsuit involving oil and 
gas partnerships of Prudential Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The request came in a letter last month as the SEC has begun to focus on the 
handling of securities class-action lawsuits, in which investors often get 
little but their lawyers frequently receive millions of dollars in fees. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC General Counsel Simon M. Lorne, who sent the letter to U.S. District Judge 
Marcel Livaudais Jr. in New Orleans, said that as far as he knows the SEC has 
never before urged a judge in a private lawsuit to curtail legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involves Prudential's Energy Income Funds, into which about 130,000 
small investors put $1.44 billion in the late 1980s. The great majority 
suffered heavy losses. In January, the judge approved a settlement that will 
pay about $90 million to the investors, or about 29 cents on the dollar for 
their out-of-pocket losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorne's letter was dated Feb. 24 but a copy wasn't released until late last 
week. It was at least the second recommendation by a regulator that the judge 
closely scrutinize the fee request. California Corporation Commissioner Gary S. 
Mendoza made a similar request to the judge earlier in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The class-action lawyers early last year had recommended that the judge 
approve a settlement that would have paid only $37 million in cash to 
investors, or less than seven cents on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 After state regulators and other investors' lawyers objected, however, the 
judge derailed that settlement. The new settlement is much more favorable to 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lorne argued that a group of class-action lawyers, led by Edward A. 
Grossmann of New York, had played only a minimal role in bringing about the 
higher settlement, and should receive no more than the maximum of $21 million 
in fees they would have gotten under the lower settlement offer they had urged 
the judge to accept.

 "Support for that inadequate proposal would seem more properly to lead to a 
reduction, rather than an increase, in fee awards," Lorne said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossmann couldn't be reached for comment. Lawrence Sucharow, another lawyer 
seeking part of the fees, said he didn't believe that the SEC had legal 
standing in the case to object. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the fees were earned here," he said.

 Continental May De-Emphasize Denver Hub: The airline said it will move nearly 
1,400 pilots and flight attendants out of the city this year and assign jets to 
other airports as it continues to cut back its money-losing operation in the 
region. Following Southwest Airlines' lead, Continental has been trying to 
avoid its hubs and depend on cheaper tickets to fill its planes.

by individual investors and state and local pension funds. Levitt called for

of bonds, stocks and other assets.

 Chevron CEO's '93 Compensation Up 46%: Chairman Kenneth T. Derr received more 
than $2.77 million in salary and bonuses last year as his cash compensation 
rose 45.5% from 1992, the San Francisco-based oil company said.Derr, who is 
also Chevron Corp.'s chief executive, also received options to acquire Chevron 
stock in 2003 that is expected to be worth $2.58 million. Chevron's net income 
fell in 1993 as it restructured U.S. operations, laid off workers and was hit 
hard by a 10% decline in crude oil prices. But profit from continuing 
operations rose to $2.15 billion from $1.56 billion, and its stock price rose 
more than 25% in 1993.

 Imported Vehicle Sales Up 26%: Sales of imported cars, trucks and buses in 
Japan soared in February from the year-earlier month to 17,812 units, the Japan 
Automobile Importers Assn. reported. The sharp increase in February came as an 
extension of the recent rise in foreign car sales in Japan, which are boosted 
largely by lower prices resulting from the appreciation of the yen against the 
dollar and other major currencies.

previously reported 10.6%. The revised figure is the lowest unemployment rate 
since April, 1992. "There is a strong possibility of a sub-10% unemployment 
rate by the end of 1994," the bureau said.

BATTLING THE TRADE IMBALANCE WITH BAGELS AND MINK HATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These days, many people have ideas about how to shrink the U.S. trade deficit. 
Some want sanctions. Others believe in a stronger Japanese yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiichirou Ayano tried bagels. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayano, a Japanese trade representative, scoured his country on behalf of two 
American bagel entrepreneurs who thought the Japanese were ready for something 
more adventurous than raw fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried six or seven months for these people, but no success," Ayano said, 
looking crestfallen. "There is no Japanese market at present." 
</P>
<P>
 Ayano is part of a team that may go down as the oddest byproduct of the trade 
dispute between the United States and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly four decades ago, a booming Japan posted trade representatives such as 
Ayano to the United States to promote its exports. Recently, though, as the 
U.S. trade deficit with Japan has soared, the 21 senior trade advisers were 
ordered to do an about-face and promote U.S. exports to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 That means crisscrossing the United States, exhorting Americans to manufacture 
bigger hats for the Japanese head and smaller teacups for the Japanese home. It 
also means persuading the Japanese that they really do need kayaks made in 
Seattle, glow-in-the-dark dogs from New York and log cabins built in Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of my callings is to export good products from the U.S., even if it's a 
very little bit," Ayano said. "That is my duty." 
</P>
<P>
 A day spent with Ayano shows it's no easy task. First stop on the rainy, cold 
day was an unheated ceramics studio in Brooklyn. There, Jamaican-born artist 
Noel Copeland was painting pink and blue Rastafarian characters with flowing 
dreadlocks onto platters and sushi plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind Japan's ancient tradition of exquisite china. Rasta is on the way. 
"These kind of products are a different taste," said Ayano, who's helping 
Copeland sell to a Japanese boutique. "Very funky." 
</P>
<P>
 On to a tiny Harlem fur shop, where Steven Cottman hopes to export mink 
baseball caps to Japan. Ayano urges him to make his hats bigger and rounder, 
for Japanese heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Next was Kate Kennedy in lower Manhattan. Like Copeland and Cottman, the 
ebullient Kennedy met the Japanese representative through a government export 
program, this one run by the regional Port Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy was beaming. Thanks to Ayano, her glow-in-the-dark plastic dog 
necklaces were featured in a Japanese import magazine. She's gotten several 
orders. Now, Ayano said, a Japanese entrepreneur wants to license the design 
for Glow Dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said she'd like to shift all her production to the Far East. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be more cost-effective," she said, but added, "I don't know 
if I'm betraying my country." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are helping only made-in-America," Ayano later told a reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japan External Trade Organization, which employs the advisers, estimates 
it was responsible for $150 million of U.S. exports to Japan last year. That's 
a small sum compared to the $59 billion U.S. merchandise trade deficit with 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ayano defends his mission to assist small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 If General Motors or Ford wants to export to Japan, Ayano said, "they have the 
resources. The small or mid-size company has no such resources." 
</P>
<P>
 For all his efforts, Ayano said, fewer than 10% of the companies he assists 
succeed in exporting. Some just have the wrong products, he said. Others run up 
against government regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayano admits that Glow Dogs and Rastafarian pottery won't match Japan's 
prodigious exports of cars and fax machines. But he hopes the number of small 
U.S. exporters will continue to grow.

 Help Planned for Vietnam: The government has agreed to help Vietnam develop 
the transportation infrastructure in Hanoi, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
said. The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on a 
transportation project for Hanoi, under which they will cooperate on the 
development of a traffic engineering and management system, the improvement of 
bus services and the drafting of a road code. This is the second major 
technical cooperation project for the two countries, the ministry said.

GDP. The central bank report said total exports were $30.67 billion, up 13.1% 
from 1992. Industrial exports grew 17.7% and agricultural exports 10.5%.

 Business Sentiment Index Holds Steady: The Bank of Japan's quarterly Tankan 
report, issued last week, shows that the business sentiment index -- the 
percentage of business people expecting things to get better minus those 
expecting worsening conditions -- is a level 56. The bank said corporate 
capital spending will fall 4.5% in fiscal 1994, on top of a 9.2% decline for 
1993. Meanwhile, the Construction Ministry said housing starts shot up 20.7% 
from a year ago because of low interest rates and declining prices.

 Corporate, Individual Tax Rates Cut: In a surprise move, the government cut 
the tax rates for the fiscal year beginning April 1, as it projected a budget 
surplus and steadily mounting cash reserves. With government revenue swollen by 
soaring property prices and booming stock trading, Financial Secretary Hamish 
Macleod said in his annual budget speech last week that the corporate tax rate 
would fall to 16.5% from 17.5%, while the top marginal individual tax rate 
would drop to 20% from 25%.

By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 DON BARTELSON 
</P>
<P>
 Owner, Ontario Ice Skating Center 
</P>
<P>
 Don Bartelson, 53, is a district representative of the Ice Skating Institute 
of America, a rink owners' trade group based in Illinois. His district includes 
Southern California. A former skater and instructor, Bartelson bought the 
Ontario Ice Skating Center in 1984 and transformed it from a business on the 
verge of collapse to a going concern. Bartelson spoke last week with Times 
staff writer Chris Woodyard about the effect of the Olympic Games and the 
growing popularity of professional ice hockey on the ice-rink industry. 
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 Question: The ice-rink industry is on a high. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There are four ingredients that will never happen again. We are never 
going to have two Olympic Games 24 months apart. No. 2, the Kings are not in 
the immediate future headed to the Stanley Cup playoffs again. No. 3, we are 
never again going to have the Mighty Ducks being a new (National Hockey League) 
franchise. No. 4 -- the kicker, which is responsible for 30% of the new 
business we have had -- we are never again going to have the Nancy 
Kerrigan-Tonya Harding situation. What our industry is wondering is, are we 
going to return to the normal four-year cycle? We hope not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why not? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Business declines. It's peaks and valleys. For the health of the industry, 
we have to try to reach more of a level. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has business picked up in the past year because of the Mighty Ducks? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. Usually we can do percentages and say the Olympics brought in this 
much new business, or NHL hockey brought in this much. This year, it's a little 
hard to break that one down. A year ago the majority of our enrollment was in 
hockey. This month, it's five to one in figure skating. . . . We have had 
approximately 30 hours of ice sports in front of people forthe past three weeks 
during the Olympics. If it weren't for that, none of (the increase in business) 
would take place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the Kerrigan-Harding affair? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That situation bothers me, sportsmanship-wise. And a verdict, guilty or not 
guilty, does not matter. I am concerned about that type of image being 
portrayed to youngsters. I feel a very strong moral situation there. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q: Are rinks doing anything to get away from having to depend on events like 
the Olympics to bring in new skaters? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We have done an incredible job of creating public awareness to ice sports. 
You will find now that rinks do cable-TV advertising, particularly on Mighty 
Ducks and Kings games. (The Ducks' founder, Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael) 
Eisner is a genius, and he really offers more. When you go to a Mighty Ducks 
game, it is more than a hockey game.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Hockey took years to catch on in Southern California. Why did it finally 
take hold? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Wayne (Gretzky) brought hockey to Southern California. I don't think 
there's a doubt in anybody's mind. Wayne is really responsible for major public 
awareness of the sport of ice hockey. Look at his image. He's wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you find there are a lot of older people who are interested in hockey? 
</P>
<P>
 A: This is a market we are now going to be able to service better. For 
instance, there are 25-year-olds who have never been on ice skates, let alone 
hockey skates, and they want to be hockey players. We can teach them to skate, 
play hockey and become a member of a team.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does it take to be successful in the ice-rink business? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Patience and long-term goals. You need to look at the picture in a decade 
situation, not in a 48-month situation. What is going to happen to the sport? 
Where are we going to be? Certainly the visibility of ice sports is going to 
continue to increase. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are new ice rinks being built? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. There are a lot of new rinks going on line. Disney is talking about 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Ice rinks were going into shopping malls for a while. What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's all due to money. Mall space rents are ridiculously high. They used to 
do it to draw people in, but now those numbers don't work. They have to have 
'X' number of dollars per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the peak season for ice skating? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Thanksgiving through Easter. That's for public skating  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Because people want a wintry kind of experience? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So how do rinks struggle through the summers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: By arranging enough organized programs, which the Ice Skating Institute of 
America offers to all rink owners. I'm really family-oriented, encouraging 
people to bring the whole family. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you deal with girls who want to be the next Nancy Kerrigan? Don't 
most of them have false hopes? 
</P>
<P>
 A: This is why we offer recreational programs. If they find out they are not 
going to be Nancy Kerrigan, they can still participate and have fun in a 
healthy environment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there a certain number of stage mothers in this business? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know which is worse, the stage mother or the hockey father. They 
are both at the same back door, beating each other up to get into the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On America's fascination with Olympic ice skating. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a certain amount of mystique and glamour. It encompasses so much of 
an individual. It takes a complete package to make that Olympic team, to be 
able to stand under those five rings." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the effect of the in-line roller skating fad on ice rinks. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It increased our business. Once you step on a pair of skates, it's friction 
versus non-friction." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the future of the industry. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a possibility that we are going to see the world of ice skating 
change. I'm not sure how -- perhaps more of a family experience." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On areas for expansion. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still room for growth in certain markets. The most explosive market 
we have in this country is the Sun Belt states, Florida especially."

O.C. ENTERPRISE / JAMES M. GOMEZ: MODEL MAKER TURNS ILLUSION INTO SLICES OF 
LIFE; THE COSTA MESA FIRM TRANSFORMS FLAT DRAWINGS INTO THREE-DIMENSIONAL 
MINIATURES OR PROTOTYPES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Douglas Yates performs a special kind of legerdemain. 
</P>
<P>
 In a shop hidden away in a corner of Costa Mesa's industrial district, Yates 
makes fireworks displays that illuminate picturesque harbors, submarines that 
dive into coral reefs teeming with marine life, and rockets that fly to 
futuristic space stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Yates does not work for Disneyland -- though he once did. And he does not work 
for a movie studio -- though Universal Studios is one of his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Yates is one of a handful of local industrial model makers, artists whose job 
it is to transform two-dimensional architectural and engineering drawings into 
miniature slices of life -- or at least a believable facsimile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our business is illusion," said Yates, who is president and owner of Model 
Technics Inc., an 18-year-old, privately held model-making firm. "We have to 
create reality out of illusion." 
</P>
<P>
 When it came to building his $450,000-a-year business, Yates created reality 
out of hard work, attention to detail and miles of pavement pounding. Yates had 
once aspired to be an architect, but he quit his studies 32 years ago when he 
realized that the only part of the profession that really inspired him was the 
model making. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't looked back since. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was still in his early 20s, Yates began knocking on the doors of 
building contractors, promising to build models for the same price that 
architectural firms were charging for their conceptual drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked for several model-making firms, including one in Europe, finally 
landing a position at Disneyland, where he helped develop the Anaheim amusement 
park's master plan in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a year, Yates struck out on his own, driven by a desire to take full 
control of the creative process and be flexible enough to adapt to the 
evolution of the industry. He began honing his skills as an architectural model 
maker as well as branching out to other areas of the field, such as creating 
full-size prototypes ranging from missile and computer components to portable 
radio housings and auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
 He once turned out a model for Irvine-based Allergan Inc., a maker of eye and 
skin-care products, designing a new version of a contact lens holder. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his most recent models is a battery for a camcorder being designed by a 
division of Irvine-based Western Digital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Digital spokesman Bill Frank said the company needed the model to help 
engineers conceptualize how the battery pack would fit into the new product and 
if it would impede its operation. "The quality of the samples we received back 
far exceeded what we expected," Frank said. "Models are very important to us," 
he said. "His were very beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 For the 18 years that Model Technics has been around, the art of industrial 
model making has evolved into a complicated science. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Yates said, static models and prototypes were enough to satisfy 
most customers. Today, adding special effects to models, especially 
architectural ones, is much in demand. Customers eager to woo prospective 
buyers and investors want to create a mood with the models they display, Yates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing just that is the key to Yates' latest project: a model of a resort 
proposed on the shore of the Persian Gulf. Last week, Yates and his crew of 
eight employees went to work on a tabletop model of what will eventually be a 
massive salt-water aquarium several stories high. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the project as appealing as possible, Yates' group decided to "push 
the envelope," equipping the model with lights and motors that will send 
replicas of sharks and whales swimming through a mini-reef in a giant aquarium 
that will be a resort attraction; make a submarine dive and surface; and even 
take tiny tourists for strolls along a promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 On a shop table, workers studied undersea photographs from books before 
sculpting plastic rocks and coral reefs and hand-painting the hundreds of tiny 
fish that will be added to the model. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had never built an aquarium before," Yates said as workers sawed and honed 
to make the hundreds of pieces fit snugly together. "But that is the nature of 
the business. You learn as you go along." 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever the job, Yates said, he feels that the talent he has recruited -- 
artists and sculptors, mechanical engineers, architects, computers specialists 
-- is sufficient to fill any job order or satisfy any imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to take the vision of the clients and make it work for them," he 
said. "I have a lot of good people to make that possible. I guess you can call 
me the ringmaster." 
</P>

FLORIDA OFFICIAL SAYS MET LIFE TO REFUND $76 MILLION IN SALES ABUSE CASE; 
INSURANCE: MORE THAN 2,500 OF THE 57,000 POLICYHOLDERS AFFECTED ARE FROM 
CALIFORNIA. COMPANY DISPUTES THE FINDINGS. 
</P>

<P>
 Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. has tentatively agreed to offer refunds 
totaling $76 million to more than 57,000 policyholders nationwide to settle 
charges of widespread sales abuse by its agents, the author of a Florida 
investigative report said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Tew, special counsel to the Florida Department of Insurance and the 
Florida attorney general, said there is a "reasonable likelihood" that the 
policyholders were sold "whole-life insurance policies disguised as pension 
savings plans." He said 2,649 of the policyholders are Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Tew and members of a 17-state task force are also seeking up to $20 million in 
fines from Met Life. If the insurer agrees to that amount, California's share 
could reach $1 million, said Rick Baum, California's chief deputy insurance 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Met Life disputed the findings of the report, saying that it does not condone 
any sales abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a series of efforts over a period of time to enforce company policy," 
said Met Life spokesman Charles Sahner. "They weren't as effective as we would 
have wished." 
</P>
<P>
 Tew's report, which capped a five-month investigation, faulted Met Life's top 
management for "tacit approval" of questionable sales tactics and failure to 
act on numerous indications of sales abuses. Headquartered in New York, Met 
Life is the nation's second-largest insurance company, with assets of more than 
$118 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The abuses, such as the use of sales literature that touted a retirement plan 
without identifying life insurance as the product for sale, occurred in 
virtually every area of the country and involved 950 Met Life sales offices, 
said the report by Tew, a Miami attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The report specifically cited Met Life's Executive Vice President Robert 
Crimmins, who heads the company's 13,000-agent sales force, and the legal 
department, which is responsible for reviewing sales materials. 
</P>
<P>
 These executives failed to halt millions of misleading sales letters sent by 
the company's Tampa, Fla., office under the supervision of Daniel (Rick) Urso, 
the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Met's management style (is) that of ignoring the problem in the hope that it 
will disappear, like an ostrich burying its head in the sand," said the 57-page 
report.  
</P>
<P>
 Baum said it is believed that many of the California policyholders purchased 
the insurance through the mail from offices in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Florida Insurance Commissioner Tom Gallagher: 
</P>
<P>
 "The company executives and management chose not to correct this situation out 
of ignorance, incompetence or greed." Gallagher heads the 17-state task force 
that has been looking into Met Life's sales practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Tew's report said Met Life's tactics not only violated many states' laws, but 
caused financial hardship to as many as 57,272 policyholders who thought they 
were accruing more cash than they actually did. These policyholders paid 
premiums of more than $76 million through December, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation covered a period of nearly five years, ending in October, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Tew said the settlement calls for Met Life to either provide refunds to 
policyholders who request them or to offer policyholders a new annuity. 
Policyholders may also decide to keep their policies, Tew said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed $20-million fine would be split by 47 states. Three states -- 
Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Georgia -- have already imposed fines totaling 
$2 million against Met Life for sales abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are supporting the effort of the settlement and want to ensure that 
policyholders are appropriately protected and there are penalties for 
outrageous behavior," said Baum, the California insurance regulator. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Met Life's Sahner has said the company would likely reject any fine 
that large and would consider scrapping the comprehensive settlement framework 
and reverting to state-by-state solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the company has already dismissed seven mid-level executives in 
December for failure to halt improper sales practices in the Tampa office. 
</P>
<P>
 Met Life's legal department, meanwhile, was plagued by "confusion, uncertainty 
and ineffectiveness" in its dealings with Urso, Tew's study said. The company 
had only three headquarters lawyers working part-time to review sales 
literature used by 13,000 life-insurance agents, the report said.

MOTOROLA ADVANCES PALMTOP COMPUTING; ELECTRONICS: ENVOY, BEING UNVEILED TODAY, 
WILL LET USERS CONNECT WITH ON-LINE SERVICES OR OTHER HUMANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Motorola Inc., raising the level of palmtop computing and wireless 
communications, is introducing a device that combines the two emerging 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Envoy personal communicator, to be unveiled today, lets users send and 
receive information through Ardis, the nation's largest wireless network. 
</P>
<P>
 The device, expected to retail at about $1,500 after its release this summer, 
can also be linked by wire to telephones, computers and peripherals. This lets 
users tap into on-line information services, exchange files with personal 
computers, or use a printer or keyboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Envoys also can "talk" with each other through an infrared transceiver, 
exchanging messages that can be enlivened with animation and sound, either the 
user's voice or packaged effects. It also includes software for taking notes 
and keeping track of schedules and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "First-generation products fell short -- they didn't really deliver on 
communications," said Cheryl Beck-Ruff, Envoy project manager. "And the 
critical thing is, you do need to be in touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts praised Envoy's communications abilities and combination of hardware 
and software. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are communication devices that put you in touch with more than other 
people. That's what makes this a very, very interesting development," said Paul 
Saffo, a director of the Institute for the Future, a consulting firm in Menlo 
Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Envoy is the latest product in the field of personal communicators. The 
hand-held devices linked through wire or a wireless network communicate by 
voice, fax, electronic mail and other ways and also manage personal 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the earliest of the products, Apple Computer Inc.'s Newton MessagePad, 
was upgraded on Friday with improved handwriting-recognition capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry observers have been eager to see the book-size Envoy because it is 
the first product on the market to include software by General Magic of 
Mountain View, Calif., which was formed by Motorola, AT&T and Sony Corp. and 
hopes to develop standards for personal communicators. 
</P>
<P>
 Users operate the Envoy by tapping on-screen boxes or an on-screen keyboard 
with a finger or electronic pen. They can also jot down a note and transmit it 
as written. But Envoy -- unlike Apple's Newton -- does not recognize 
handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because handwriting recognition hasn't come far enough to use easily, 
said Curtis Sasaki, manager of product marketing for General Magic. The 
original Newton was criticized for inaccurate reading of writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Envoy links users to Ardis, a network owned by Motorola and IBM through a 
built-in wireless modem and a built-in two-way wireless radio modem. Ardis 
links with RadioMail service, enabling users to communicate with anyone with an 
Internet address. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have one disappointment with the product -- and I do -- it's that it 
doesn't have an external keyboard," said Andy Seybold, who edits a newsletter 
on mobile computing. "The on-board keyboard is not good enough for people to do 
wireless e-mail."

O.C. OPERA REVIEW; OPERA PACIFIC TACKLES WAGNER; MOST OF THE CHALLENGES IN THE 
EPIC 'DIE WALKURE' ARE MET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 And here we thought it was safe to forget about Opera Pacific. . . . When last 
heard from, Orange County's official guardian of the lyric muse was lavishing 
its pretensions upon a fragile operetta, and doing so with heavy, provincial 
hands. The public, it should be noted, seemed to love it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, David DiChiera and his not-so-little band have turned to Richard Wagner's 
"Die Walkure." Repeat: "Die Walkure." 
</P>
<P>
 The stretch is formidable, and very costly, too. Some might call it foolhardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner, who never even dreamed of thinking small, dealt here in nearly five 
hours of massive, and massively convoluted, Germanic mythology. He wrote for a 
huge, tireless, brassy orchestra and demanded a cast of singers equipped with 
huge, leathery lungs. He required a scenic apparatus that could invoke -- 
hopefully without caricature -- an ever-ever-land of super-heroes, super-gods 
and super-villains, not to mention flying lust-maidens, mystical apparitions 
and a magic fire adorning the sacred rocks of Valhalla. 
</P>
<P>
 There isn't much ersatz-Viennese waltzing here. 
</P>
<P>
 The opulent Music Center Opera has attempted Wagner only once -- a single 
"Tristan und Isolde" six-and-a-half years ago. That sobering realization made 
matters doubly intriguing on Friday as Costa Mesa rushed in where Los Angeles 
fears to tread. 
</P>
<P>
 DiChiera was trying to play David to Peter Hemmings' Goliath. Although the 
local "Walkure" would hardly make the burghers of Bayreuth look to their 
laurels, it was emphatically serious, never less than honorable and seldom less 
than competent. There may be hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical direction was entrusted to John Mauceri, who had led a 
much-publicized, somewhat controversial "Ring" during his tenure at the 
Scottish Opera. His concept of Wagnerian grandeur would seem to be neither 
terribly grand nor terribly passionate, but he knows how to keep the pulse 
moving, knows where the climaxes lie, knows how to define a mood, and, perhaps 
most important, knows how to accompany the endangered species on the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mauceri is, if nothing else, a pro. He also happens to be a musician whose 
conscience precludes mutilating the score even by a hemidemisemiquaver. (One 
wonders why he sanctioned that awful wind machine that obliterated much of the 
prelude.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Segerstrom Hall pit is ridiculously inadequate for Wagner. It seated only 
71 players on this occasion, and there couldn't have been room for another 
piccolo. Undaunted, the Opera Pacific Orchestra played reasonably well for 
Mauceri; it doesn't often encounter a real conductor. Even so, the symphonic 
output was modest at best, anemic at worst. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The action -- and inaction -- on the stage was entrusted to another canny 
veteran of Wagnerian wars, Roberto Oswald of the Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires. 
Functioning as director as well as set and lighting designer, he enforced logic 
amid the potential chaos and created some nice, pretty pictures in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 He is no fashionable revisionist -- probably not even a modernist -- yet he 
does have the good taste to simplify and stylize the mythic vistas. That's more 
than can be said for the folks in charge of the kitschy Metropolitan Opera 
"Ring," which reproduces every infernal leaf in every fussy forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Oswald, comfortably safe even when he isn't particularly stimulating, projects 
a lot of busy clouds on the scrim, makes his characters spend a lot of time 
rolling on the floor, and tries not to contradict the libretto too much. His 
traditional sets, designed for Dallas 22 years ago, leave no turns unstoned. 
Anibal Lapiz's old-fashioned costumes are disarmingly functional -- winged 
helmets, funny breastplates and all -- even if they don't always flatter their 
current wearers. 
</P>
<P>
 One first-rate singer dominated the generally second-rate cast on opening 
night. Jane Eaglen, the 33-year-old Briton who had stepped in to replace Ealynn 
Voss, actually suggested that the authentic Wagnerian soprano may not be as 
extinct as the dodo bird. Her voice -- big, warm, rich and wide-ranging -- cut 
through the orchestral mass with laughing ease. She articulated Wagner's text 
poignantly, and, despite her ample physique, sustained a sympathetic facsimile 
of dramatic credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't happen to command much of a trill for the battle cry, but Birgit 
Nilsson didn't master that detail either. Actually, if comparisons were 
essential, Eaglen would recall Helen Traubel more than Nilsson. It's a happy 
recollection. 
</P>
<P>
 The others, for better or worse, belonged in the yes-but category. 
</P>
<P>
 John Keyes sang Siegmund with strikingly strong, dark, vibrant tone and really 
resembled a muscular giant. Like many a would-be Heldentenor before him, 
however, he tired easily, found the top notes a struggle and tended to sing 
flat under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Mechthild Gessendorf complemented him as an authoritative if rather matronly 
Sieglinde. Though vocally uneven, she rose nicely to the lofty climaxes, and 
earned gratitude for omitting the bizarre Rysanek scream -- a popular bit of 
reverse symbolism that often accompanies Siegmund's withdrawal of the sword 
from the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Roloff, admired in numerous Seattle "Ring" cycles, remains an uncommonly 
compelling Wotan -- on a manly rather than godly scale. He paced himself 
wisely, phrased intelligently, conveyed ample pathos in the ultimate farewell, 
but could not summon the sheer vocal force ideally needed for this formidable 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Maynor -- like Eaglen and Keyes a holdover from Mauceri's Scottish 
"Ring" -- looked tall, lithe and pleasant while sounding soft, vague and woolly 
as Hunding, the primal basso-bad-guy. Shirley Close hectored Wotan with 
incisive energy as a rather shrewish Fricka. 
</P>
<P>
 The assorted warriorettes screamed and yodeled their Ho-jo-to-hos with 
bravado. Like their sisters in most conventional productions, they also seemed 
very silly. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 The non-capacity audience (reportedly papered) shrank substantially as the 
long evening progressed. Those who stayed, however, were rewarded with an 
unprecedented Segerstrom Hall treat: the sale of coffee on the terrace -- 
safely removed, of course, from the precious foyer carpets. 
</P>
<P>

MUSIC REVIEW; ORCHESTRE AND DUTOIT PROVIDE FRENCH LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cards were stacked, but this wasn't cheating: the touring Orchestre 
National de France conducted by Charles Dutoit performing French classics by 
Berlioz and Debussy. 
</P>
<P>
 For anyone who knew this ensemble, this conductor and this repertoire, it 
looked like a foregone conclusion. The only real danger was if the participants 
took the night off and merely went through the motions of their extra-familiar 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, the concert 
became a revelation of authoritative wonders, a display of unquestionable 
expertise, as if the musicians had prefaced their performance with a collective 
"OK, listen, this is the way it goes," like some Parisian waiter correcting 
your French -- but without the upturned nose. 
</P>
<P>
 They opened with an athletic burst in Berlioz's "Le Corsaire" Overture, 
powering through its jagged course with smooth and muscular agility. 
</P>
<P>
 The 57-year-old Dutoit's take on Debussy's "La Mer" was thoroughly aggressive 
as well, stressing rhythm and drive over poetry and color. One might 
characterize it as cool if it hadn't been so urgent. 
</P>
<P>
 Eliciting the expected clarity and detail from his orchestra, Dutoit refused 
to dawdle over transitions or to loll in the mists. In uniformly fast tempos, 
the orchestra played with a lean force and visceral brightness (though one 
noted some minor blemishes in execution) and dynamic changes sounded quick, 
tense and firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Symphonie Fantastique" emerged as everything it should be and not a jot 
more. That is, it never slouched into vulgarity. This was a propulsive and 
super-heated reading, but Dutoit got there not through any histrionic fakery or 
undue bombast, but through incisive rhythmic inflection, perfectly weighted 
instrumental balances and blends, and a dramatic sense of the (very) long line. 
The effect of Berlioz's play of cross rhythms and stratified lyricism in this 
atmosphere was nothing short of startling. 
</P>
<P>
 Dutoit and orchestra played everything as if something was on the line. But 
when it came time for the bows, the conductor simply put one hand in his pocket 
and smiled mildly with the confidence of complete mastery. No doubts here.

JAZZ REVIEW; PORCUPINE IS MISSING SOME OF ITS OLD SHARPNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Porcupine is the luxury sedan of fusion bands, a comfortable, well-appointed 
model full of high style and fine appointments. Through a pair of albums and a 
host of live appearance in Los Angeles and Orange counties, the five-piece band 
has gained a reputation for clean lines and a tight sense of fit and finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Saturday's appearance at Randell's was no lemon, it wasn't quite up to 
the seamless presentation one expects from the 'pines. Part of the reason was a 
substitute saxophonist, unfamiliar with the group's book. Another: The group 
was trying out new material, some of it being performed in public for the first 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the band was running on all cylinders, it was quite a performance. 
Porcupine's principals, drummer Bernie Dresel and pianist Bill Cunliffe, bring 
an unusual amount of intelligence and technical skills to their music, 
qualities missing from most crossover bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Cunliffe was the winner, in 1988, of the first Thelonious Monk International 
Piano Competition. These days, the prize usually guarantees a major-label 
recording contract for the first-place (and often the second-place) finisher. 
But that wasn't the case when Cunliffe won, and he has worked hard to build a 
following, pursuing both fusion and mainstream careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dresel is a busy studio and session musician who likes to develop his rhythms 
into something more than timekeeping. Even during the most beat-conscious 
pieces, such as "Adventures of Cal Ipso," Dresel was never content Saturday to 
just lay down the beat, instead varying his sound with various drum and cymbal 
combinations. Together he and Cunliffe have made Porcupine one class act. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that is due to the music they write for themselves -- melodically 
accessible, beat-driven numbers with enough variation to keep even jaded 
listeners in line. Add their high level of musicianship -- Cunliffe is 
especially adept at developing a tune's lyrical side -- and you have, as the 
pianist called it from the bandstand, "music that sticks with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Paulo, sitting in for usual saxophonist Brian Scanlon, brought a sense 
of adventure to the music, especially when playing alto. But his unfamiliarity 
with the material may have hampered his expression. He seemed particularly 
reserved while maneuvering his soprano through the mid-tempo exercise called 
"Street Bop," and he sat out entirely during Cunliffe's ballad "Street Eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 But during the funk-driven Cunliffe-Dresel number "If Not Now, When?" he 
slipped into his alto improvisation with some well-placed dissonance, giving 
the piece an uneasy edge, before stringing together a series of quick, fluid 
lines. He was particularly soulful on a new tune, "Ready and Waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 The tropical feel of the tune gave Dresel a chance to do what he does best: 
color his sound with cymbal effects and sultry tom-tom exchanges. Tim Weston, 
the former Wishful Thinking guitarist, added further color to the mix with 
ringing accompaniment chords, and solos that built from note-at-a-time runs 
into rich, multi-tone blends. Weston was particularly effective during the lush 
construction of "Armed Response," a piece that also featured dependable bottom 
riffs from bassist Rick Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal soloist, though, was Cunliffe, mixing acoustic and electric 
tones with sounds from Randell's resident B-3 organ (an instrument not usually 
part of the Porcupine mix). He backed his piano work with synthesizer-produced 
strings in "Starlit Eyes" and showed some Les McCann-styled soul in "Cal Ipso." 
His dynamic build during "Armed Response" grew not only in volume but in detail 
and emotion as well.

THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET; MAKING IT WORK; THERE'S A JOB OUT THERE 
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You're on the street for the first time, or maybe for the first time in a long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Panic sets in. Wherever you go, you're not the person they're looking to hire 
this time around. You're either too old -- or not old enough. Or it's a 
question of gender or ethnicity or education or job experience or location. 
Something's always wrong. Sometimes it even seems that if Hollywood were 
casting a movie of your life, you'd be told you were wrong for the part. 
</P>
<P>
 Must job hunting in the 1990s be so difficult? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course not. Employment counselors repeatedly say there are any number of 
techniques a job applicant can use to edge closer to that all-important 
interview and, better still, that most hallowed of apparitions: a job offer. 
</P>
<P>
 First, don't wimp out. Just because your job, or maybe your entire industry, 
melted away like a sandcastle at high tide does not mean you are no longer of 
use to American business. 
</P>
<P>
 True, your technical skills may have been geared to a now-extinct industry, 
but your problem-solving skills, your energy and your experience are universal 
and valuable. Sell, sell, sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Your life is not just the sum of your resume. Atomize/analyze/assess your life 
and find skills that are in demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many skills are hiding in non-work experiences," said Nella Barkley, 
president and chief executive of Crystal-Barkley, a New York-based career 
counseling and training firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you were a camp counselor in the long ago. Many people would be 
reluctant to put that on their resume. Nonsense, Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A good camp counselor has to know how to operate boats, how to deal with 
safety procedures, how to integrate other skills in dealing with people, how to 
show leadership with kids," she said. "A lot of these things are transferable 
into the workplace." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the best potential hirees flub interviews because they can talk the 
lingo only of their former employer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've tied their personal goals to the company goals for so long they tend 
to talk in the company's terminology," said Jan Thompson, managing director of 
the La Jolla office of Drake, Beam & Morin, one of the nation's largest firms 
that helps downscaling companies find jobs for former employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's fine if you're still in the company, but it's tough for the new 
employer to drag the information out of you," she said. "Today, when employers 
are getting hundreds of applications for every job, the more work the 
interviewer has to do the less likely you are to get hired." 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, the resume remains the weapon of choice for most job-seekers. Two 
pages is tops. And forget stunts like sending in a resume on red paper or 
showing up for an interview in a gorilla suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Network like crazy. Call up friends and associates to see what they've heard 
about job opportunities. You've got to tap into the hidden job market, because 
if you restrict yourself to answering classified advertisements, you'll find 
yourself in a long line. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't hide your light under a basket. List not only your previous job title, 
but also your accomplishments. Be assertive but not obnoxious. 
</P>
<P>
 You didn't just organize a community theater play, you negotiated a 15% 
discount in materials for scenery, arranged a work schedule and made sure that 
deadlines were met and quality standards satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, it's a tough market out there and the average employer spends 30 
seconds per resume. That's 30 seconds you've got to separate yourself from the 
pack. 
</P>
<P>
 One tip: Talk the talk. 
</P>
<P>
 You've got to tell the employer how you can help his or her business. This is 
the lean and mean '90s, not the go-go '80s. Make your resume and follow-up 
interview reflect the era. 
</P>
<P>
 Be specific. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surface descriptions like 'I'm good with people' or 'I'm a problem solver' 
may have worked 15 years ago but not today," Thompson said. "For every skill 
claimed, you should have at least two accomplishments on how that skill was 
used and was of value to the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Learn phone techniques. If you're an ex-executive used to being put right 
through, learn to adapt to the world of being put on hold and given the quick 
brushoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a job search, it's not unusual to make 15 calls before getting in," 
Thompson said. "In each call, you have to be respectful, not let your 
irritation show, and be purposeful." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Hauter, a Chicago management consultant and author of "The Smart Woman's 
Guide to Career Success," says the smart job applicant during an interview 
talks about diversity, speed, customer service and the new non-hierarchical 
structure of American business. 
</P>
<P>
 Diversity: If you've had experience in a racially or ethnically diverse 
workplace or helping a company break into a diverse market, talk it up. 
</P>
<P>
 "An employee who can help remove obstacles or impediments for minorities is a 
tremendous plus for an organization of the future," Hauter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Speed: In a competitive market, the employee who can deliver the soonest with 
the mostest is much prized. "The faster you can do something, the bigger asset 
you are to a company," Hauter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Customer service: If you've had experience assessing the mood of customers or 
tailoring a product to the shifting whims of the market, your chances of 
landing a job are much improved. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1980s, companies ignored customers," Hauter said. "But in the 1990s, 
customers won't take it anymore. They're more demanding, more confrontational, 
they know how to price-shop, and they have no brand loyalty." 
</P>
<P>
 The new "flattened" structure of business: A job with big responsibilities for 
a small company is probably more impressive on your resume than a job with 
small responsibilities for a big company. 
</P>
<P>
 "Show the employer that you were wearing more hats than your job title shows," 
Hauter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hierarchical organization of the Industrial Age is disappearing. 
Organizations are flatter now, and everybody has to assume more responsibility 
and accountability." 
</P>
<P>
 There you have it: Job Hunting '94. And remember: Be good to yourself while 
looking for a job. Your ego will take a battering, but don't take it 
personally.

THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET; MAKING IT WORK; THE RESUME: PRESENTING THE 
UNIQUE AND IRRESISTIBLE YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The task at hand: Summarize everything there is to know about you in an 
enticingly brief manner to tempt someone who will pick you from the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like drafting an ad for the personals? No, this is worse. It's called 
Writing the Resume. You know, boil your entire life down to one -- or at the 
very most, two -- neatly typed pages. It's an arduous and daunting task for 
even the most seasoned job hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. A whole crop of professional resume writers stands ready to help 
you draft the resume of your dreams, the resume specifically designed to get 
you the job you want. 
</P>
<P>
 But be careful. Despite the growing acceptance and popularity of these 
services, the quality of these operations varies widely, and your resume is too 
important a document to trust to just anyone. Just as the recession has swelled 
the ranks of job-seekers, so has it flooded the market with folks willing to 
advise job-seekers for a price. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, there is a lot of incompetent work out there, because talented 
writing is not a skill that everyone has," said Yana Parker, author of "The 
Damn Good Resume Guide," published by Ten Speed Press in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "A resume won't get you a job, but the lack of a resume makes it hard to get 
an interview," Parker said. "You need a really good one." 
</P>
<P>
 Why should writing about such a familiar subject -- oneself -- be such an 
onerous task for so many of us? 
</P>
<P>
 The experts say we hate writing our own resumes partly because they are an 
exercise in self-examination. So we turn to books, computer programs, workshops 
and an increasing number of professional resume services. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting a professional to prepare your resume can be cheap -- usually starting 
at about $25 a page, although a few advertise rates about half that -- if all 
you need is a glorified typist with a stock of fancy paper. 
</P>
<P>
 But be prepared to pay more, perhaps as much as $100 per page, if you need 
someone to help you draft a resume from scratch. And for extras, such as cover 
letters and salary history, the price tag goes even higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a typist," said Mel Ginsberg, who for five years has owned Word 
Works, a Palmdale resume service. "I'm a writer and creator and publicist. 
</P>
<P>
 "A resume I consider professional advertising," he said. "What my clients want 
from me is to optimize the skills they have . . . to convince the employer that 
my client is the only logical alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 About two years ago, Jorge Arenado turned several years of personnel and 
training experience into his own resume business, Citi-Pro Resume. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people out there doing this, and all they do is put together a 
resume that anybody could put out," Arenado said. "You need to produce a 
document that markets a person effectively. A lot of times it takes a third 
eye, someone outside the loop . . . to pinpoint your abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 But career counselor Kate Pope worries that professional resume writers lack 
the skills needed to help the truly lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe really strongly that people should write it themselves, but we 
also believe you sometimes need some help to write it yourself. You're not born 
knowing how to write a resume," said Pope, director of counseling for Women at 
Work, a nonprofit job resource center in Pasadena. Women at Work offers 
counseling, evening resume workshops and individual resume critiques. 
</P>
<P>
 "The resume has got to bring out the uniqueness of the individual," Pope said. 
"I believe the professionally written resume is easily identified." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, one laid-off bank employee says a resume service made the difference 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross Berliner sent out 150 resumes but got in the door only twice for job 
interviews. His unemployment stretched to five months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not believe my rotten luck," Berliner said. "Turns out it wasn't 
rotten luck, just a rotten resume." 
</P>
<P>
 Berliner hooked up with Arenado, who interviewed him about his abilities and 
accomplishments and then came up with a new resume. The interview ratio jumped 
to one interview for every three or four resumes sent, Berliner said. And he 
landed a job soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just goes to show, if you don't have an excellent resume to get your foot 
in the door, especially these days, you're going to be out of a job for quite a 
while," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker advises sizing up potential resume writers and career counselors with a 
critical eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask a lot of questions and demand examples of their work, Parker said. 
"Especially ask, 'What are you going to do for me and how do I know if you're 
any good?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell them what your job objective is and what your problem is, why you can't 
do this yourself, and find out what their strategies are for how they're going 
to solve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ones to keep away from are the ones who spend a lot of time talking about 
their fine parchment paper and their fancy twofold executive thing," Parker 
said. "That's all hype."

 Three years ago, Marc Silverman knew he wanted a job in the music business, 
but the hard-to-crack industry didn't exactly have this recent liberal arts 
grad from UC Berkeley at the top of its hiring list.  
</P>
<P>
 So Silverman, whose sole career credential was being an avid fan of 
"experimental" bands, became one of a growing number of volunteers who 
contribute their time in exchange for experience they can later parlay into a 
paying job. 
</P>
<P>
 Silverman, 25, finally got that job at Alternative Distribution Alliance, a 
music company in Burbank. Not only did the unpaid internships he held for two 
years dress up his resume and give him the contacts he needed to land the job, 
it helped Silverman home in on areas of the music business he wanted to work 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no firm figures on the use of volunteering as a deliberate career 
path, but consultants say the route has become a popular one with savvy 
job-seekers -- especially in today's highly competitive employment market. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even top college and university graduates can count on finding jobs in 
their fields, according to Susan W. Miller, a Los Angeles-based career 
counselor. Cost-conscious employers have cut down on campus interviewing and 
in-house training programs, turning instead to experienced applicants or those 
who have worked in a similar setting.  
</P>
<P>
 For a new entrant into the job market, volunteering or unpaid internships may 
be the only ways to amass those credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having volunteer work differentiates these applicants from their peers," says 
Patty Oertel, executive director of the Center for Non-Profit Management in Los 
Angeles. "It says to an employer, 'Here is someone who at least knows something 
about working in an organizational setting.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer option is not just for new graduates. Alison Berka, 36, a 
Manhattan Beach mother of two, closed her mail-order business when her son, 
Max, was born in 1988. But even while she stays home to care for Max and his 
younger sister, Berka is planning her second career. 
</P>
<P>
 Building on the MBA degree and marketing skills she used in her mail-order 
business, she is using these years at home to add credentials in environmental 
work, a longtime interest. As a board member of Volunteers and Organizations 
Improving the Community's Environment, Berka writes a regular column on 
environmental issues for a local newspaper serving the beach communities south 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to build my portfolio and improve my writing skills," she says. 
Through her volunteer work and a course on solid-waste management at UCLA, 
Berka is also making valuable contacts who may be helpful in a few years when 
her children enter school and she re-enters the job market. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a mother, you do lots of demanding things that require creativity and 
management skills," Berka says. "But you can't just walk into an employer's 
office and say, 'Look at the great job I've done with my child; hire me. My 
work with VOICE gives me something that works better on a resume." 
</P>
<P>
 If, like Berka, your goal is to translate volunteer experience into paid 
employment, experts recommend that you carefully research the organization you 
are offering your time to and the assignments available to volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are going to lick envelopes as a volunteer, that is not going to 
prepare you for much," warns Miller, the career counselor. "If you want to go 
into public relations, make sure your volunteer position is at a level that 
lets you author a brochure or write press releases." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonprofit organizations in particular rely on volunteers for work that other 
organizations and businesses pay for. Among the highly marketable experiences 
available to volunteers in nonprofits are public relations, fund raising, event 
planning, program administration, bookkeeping, grant writing, publishing and 
paralegal work. 
</P>
<P>
 There are even organizations that exist to match the skills and interests of a 
potential volunteer with the needs of a particular business, government agency 
or community organization. The Volunteer Center of Los Angeles and its 
counterparts in the San Fernando Valley and Orange County provide this service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will work with the person to custom-design something if they have a 
particular career interest" and are looking for experience in the field, says 
Janet Harrison of Los Angeles' Volunteer Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In communities without such a center, the local United Way or city government 
can help direct you to specific volunteer opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't assume organizations will give you these opportunities just because 
you're willing to work for free. Like paying employers, volunteer-dependent 
businesses and nonprofit organizations have become highly selective, favoring 
people with a genuine interest in the field and useful skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts suggest learning as much as you can about the organization before 
applying for a volunteer position, in order to highlight the skills of yours 
that the organization needs. 
</P>
<P>
 And when you land the position, treat it like a real job. Otherwise, says 
Silverman, the plum assignments that look good on a resume and the job 
recommendations will go to someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to prove that you are a capable worker; you have to show up on time 
and you have to take responsibility," he says. "You don't want to be wasting 
your time." Resources for Volunteers

THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET; MAKING IT WORK; HOW TO SURVIVE THE FIRST 
RUNG AND THEN MOVE UP THE LADDER 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 A decade after her First Real Job was but a dim memory, Julie Adair King 
realized what she did wrong and why that job had remained a dead end for so 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't that she was a bad worker. The young educational-video production 
coordinator applied herself to her job, was conscientious and capable of much 
more than she was allowed to do. Still she foundered. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? She brought her personal life into the office. It was her first job away 
from home and her boss was the fatherly type. So it just seemed OK to go to him 
with her everyday problems: the broken-down car, the difficult boyfriend, the 
worried mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people, especially young women, bring their personal lives into the 
workplace, and it marks you as unprofessional," says King, who now writes 
career books for women. "I was terribly frustrated that no one was advancing me 
along. And I didn't realize it wasn't a smart thing until 10 years later." 
</P>
<P>
 But no college teaches Office Politics 101 or even Acceptable Work Place 
Behavior 1A. And much of the job advice that is available is tailored to older 
workers in search of a second career, not twentysomethings grappling with a 
first job. Even career how-to books for the young worker are more likely to 
offer counsel on getting the first non-fast-food job, not surviving it. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, many young workers think they have it made simply by getting Real 
Job No. 1. They're wrong; they still have to prosper and jump to Real Job No. 
2. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to popular belief, surviving the first step up the career ladder does 
not require the skills of a rocket scientist, a fancy MBA from an even fancier 
graduate school or even a degree from the school of hard knocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "For people in their first job, the assumption is that they're so naive they 
need to be beaten around a little before the teachable moment occurs," says 
management consultant Janet Hauter. "But if the first-time employee could be 
prepared a little better, they would be less shellshocked and might stay around 
a company a little longer." 
</P>
<P>
 Surviving the first job requires a good dose of common sense and the 
willingness to follow a few simple guidelines. Hauter steals the first one 
straight from the real estate industry: 
</P>
<P>
 * Location, location, location: When you buy a house, you pick the most 
affordable property in the priciest block. When you get your first job, you 
should aim at landing in the best company you can find in your career field. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can go to a superior place . . . that will help you focus far faster 
than reading the books about your field or going to a second-class 
organization," Hauter says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Silence is golden: Shutting up and taking notes is one of King's favorite 
pieces of advice to the new employee. "This is not the time of your career to 
come in insisting you know the right way to do things." 
</P>
<P>
 * Timing is everything: Prepare for a minimum of a 50-hour workweek, 
particularly if your first job is in a growing entrepreneurial company. Still, 
you have to know how to draw the line at unwanted overtime. One graceful out: 
"I have really worked so hard today that if I stayed to work overtime, I 
wouldn't be giving the company my best," Hauter suggests. 
</P>
<P>
 * Timing is everything II: Don't quit too soon; and for heaven's sake, don't 
stick around too long. Two to three years is a nice amount. In that time, you 
must do three things: Learn the job, learn the political disposition of the 
company and learn the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * Know when to fold 'em: A "restlessness in the gut" is Hauter's first signal 
that it's time to quit. Other good indicators are an inability to get to work 
on time or make deadline on important projects. 
</P>
<P>
 For Alex DeLeon, 26, it's way too soon to be getting any intestinal signals 
that it's time to go. An animator who graduated from UCLA in 1990 with a degree 
in fine arts, he is five months into his first real job. 
</P>
<P>
 During a short tenure as a security guard -- about two years into his search 
for that career opener -- DeLeon realized he'd already had 14 mostly unreal 
jobs since graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "One night I was sitting there in the lobby -- they didn't even have a desk 
for me -- (and) I knew it was my last day there. I had to find a real job," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Contacts in an animation workshop helped land him his current position at 
Sidley Wright Motionworks in Hollywood, where the first project he was assigned 
to was Steven Spielberg's animated dinosaur movie "We're Back." 
</P>
<P>
 Flexibility and a willingness to work long hours helped get him recalled after 
brief layoffs between projects, while others have not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Now DeLeon has his own hard-learned advice for others on the first rung of the 
career ladder: "I show up, listen and do the job."

THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET; MAKING IT WORK; FOR PEOPLE WITH 
DISABILITIES, HOME MAY BE WHERE THE JOB IS 
</P>

<P>
 When a terrible car accident in her college years destroyed her dreams of 
becoming a diplomat or an anthropologist, Anne Hart of San Diego was forced to 
reassemble her life. 
</P>
<P>
 Plagued with chronic dizziness and other difficulties, Hart found herself 
unable to function in a 9-to-5 work environment. Her solution, which she now 
recommends to other people with disabilities, was to turn the tables, 
employment-wise. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of Hart going to the workplace, she arranged for the workplace to come 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 52 and a successful writer in several genres -- including books on job 
searching -- Hart's proudest boast is that she has never held a "real" job. 
"It's a matter of taking action rather than reaction," said Hart, who also 
writes under the name Anne deSola Cardoza. 
</P>
<P>
 To Hart, working at home has several advantages: You can make your own hours, 
dress as you please and escape the stereotypes that -- liberation movement or 
not -- still haunt the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of mental blocks to employers hiring the handicapped," Hart 
said. "They think we pose the greatest risk because the stress of the job will 
make us fall apart. If you work at home, that isn't a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 49 million Americans classified by the Census Bureau as disabled, no 
one knows for sure how many are working at home. But labor experts think the 
number is growing, just as the number working at home is growing in the general 
population. Some 40 million people in the United States work full or part time 
at home, either in their own businesses or for employers. 
</P>
<P>
 People with disabilities have long been involved in home businesses and 
take-home work. The information superhighway is paving the way for even more 
telecommuting and virtual-reality offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of exciting stuff going on with people working out of their 
homes," said Cynthia Jones, publisher of San Diego-based Mainstream magazine, a 
15,000-circulation monthly publication for the "able-disabled." 
</P>
<P>
 An article in Mainstream details a number of the possibilities: paralegal 
work, word processing, medical transcription, legal transcription, medical 
billing, computer researching, letter writing -- in short, any chore that can 
be done with a computer, a fax machine, software and maybe voice mail.  
</P>
<P>
 "The possibilities are almost endless," free-lance writer Joseph Chamberlain 
said in Mainstream. "You could even develop a small income by preparing 
computerized Tarot card readings, monthly horoscopes or biorhythm charts. Other 
possibilities include recipe collections, videotape databases, genealogy 
reports and gardening statistics." 
</P>
<P>
 Private firms and community colleges offer classes in computer skills for 
those with disabilities and sub-specialties such as medical transcription. 
Training, and in some cases equipment, is available through the state's 
vocational rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a caveat in all this, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jones is upbeat about the idea of people working at home, she would 
not like to see employers use home employment as a way around the new federal 
Americans With Disabilities Act, which requires, among other things, that 
workplaces be designed to fit needs of people with disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when those people and able-bodied people work together will the 
stereotypes and prejudices be broken down, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the office can be made accessible, it should be," she said. "I would hate 
to see the lack of interaction" between the two groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Marti Gacioch, 45, who has had severe arthritis since childhood, decided five 
years ago she wanted to work at home in Cardiff, a seaside town north of San 
Diego. She started Graphic Language, which offers graphics, typesetting and 
public relations services. 
</P>
<P>
 She offers two words of advice: niche and network.  
</P>
<P>
 "You have to find something you offer better than anybody else, or at least as 
well as other people," she said. "You have to get out there and talk to a lot 
of people" to get business.

THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET; MAKING IT WORK; THE PART-TIME WORK FORCE 
TAKES ON A PROFESSIONAL LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARLENE RICKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mix together a tight economy, a demanding career, a hobby long neglected, a 
new spouse, a baby. It can be a recipe for frustration -- or a revamped career. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the world of the "part-time professional," a recent incarnation that 
owes its genesis to recessionary cuts in the full-time work force and a growing 
feeling among graying baby boomers that life has passed them by. 
</P>
<P>
 Among American workers in managerial, executive or professional positions, 
11.6% worked part time last year, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor 
Statistics. That figure is up from 10.7% in 1986, and many labor experts expect 
the increase of part-time professional careers to match the rising numbers of 
part-timers throughout the entire labor force. 
</P>
<P>
 Until only recently, the conventional wisdom held that a part-time 
professional was a contradiction in terms. Professionals who were committed to 
their jobs and wanted to get ahead were required to work full time -- and then 
some. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the last several years, employers have begun to "recognize that 
part-time work can be a legitimate goal of the employee and a benefit to the 
employer," said Richard Flye, chairman of the management committee for the 
Washington-based law firm McKenna & Cuneo. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do not allow part-time schedules, it definitely increases turnover. It 
is a major benefit for a firm not to lose highly skilled legal personnel that 
we've spent so much money training," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This does not appear to be a passing phenomenon," said Bill Charland of the 
Center for the New West, a Denver-based think tank on economic development. 
Charland sees part-time careers as evidence of a general, economy-wide 
"lessened commitment by employers to long-term full-time employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than retaining full-timers reluctant to adopt new technology, Charland 
said, companies are creating leaner work forces composed, in part, of highly 
skilled part-time employees. 
</P>
<P>
 That leanness, however, may benefit the corporate balance sheet more than the 
employee, since part-timers generally do not receive benefits such as life and 
health insurance, pensions or paid vacations. And career professionals who 
choose part-time status often find themselves cut off from promotions or the 
partnership track. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Maria Laqueur, executive director of the Assn. of Part-Time 
Professionals -- comprising lawyers, administrators, engineers, social workers 
and physicians -- expects to see more part-time careers. "In the past, 
part-time schedules were seen as an employee benefit; now they are becoming a 
workplace strategy. It makes good business sense," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, McKenna & Cuneo adopted a policy allowing part-time 
schedules for all levels of personnel, from corner-office partners to mail room 
workers; it even provides full benefits for people who work at least 30 hours a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation couldn't differ more from the legal profession Flye entered more 
than 20 years ago, when the prevailing view was that "it was impossible to 
practice law unless you worked at least 26 hours a day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Career professionals have come a long way from that mind-set, but the reason 
may be less humanitarian than employers would have us believe. "It is a mistake 
to think that the workplace has become family-friendly," said Marilyn Moats 
Kennedy, managing partner of Career Strategies in Wilmette, Ill., and publisher 
of a monthly career-planning newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal of all organizations in the '90s with more than two people is 
flexible staffing. CEOs have been traumatized by having to implement massive 
layoffs. Going lean with part-timers spares them that agony," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It benefits the employer to "cut a private peace" with the employee who wants 
part-time status, said Kennedy, because such workers tend to be "more cheerful 
and willing. There is no question that satisfaction and productivity are in bed 
together. The employer gets more bang for his buck." 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Thurman, who works three days a week as manager of community affairs for 
TRW in Fairfax, Va., agrees. She sees part-time professional work as a win-win 
situation for both parties. The employee "wants it to work out so badly that we 
work extra hard to get the job done," she said. "On my days in the office, I 
don't chitchat and I generally don't take lunch breaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Miller of Anaheim Hills, a government contracts attorney in the Los 
Angeles office of McKenna & Cuneo, switched from full time to three days a week 
after she and her husband, also an attorney, had their first child in October. 
"By the time I go back to the office, I'm ready to focus on law again," she 
said. "The change of pace makes me more productive." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Thurman, Miller drafted a specific part-time proposal for a 60% plan -- 
she would meet 60% of the annual billable hours required of a full-time 
associate, for 60% of her full-time salary. Neither of the women opted for 
health benefits, since they are covered by their husbands' employers, but they 
do receive prorated vacation and sick days. 
</P>
<P>
 But some employers, like that of Celia Whitley, remain unconvinced. Whitley, 
for 17 years a chemist at a large Boston teaching hospital, drafted her 
resignation in December when her supervisor refused to consider allowing her to 
work part time. Whitley's reasons were a medical condition that required her to 
commute less often and a growing desire for more time to enjoy her hobbies and 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 On Whitley's shift, three of nine full-time professionals have recently asked 
-- unsuccessfully -- to switch to part time. "By the end of the year, one-third 
of the shift will have quit because they don't want to work full time," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final analysis, the needs of the employer generally carry the day. And 
as those needs change, so may the balance of part-timers. 
</P>
<P>
 The banking industry, for example, has been replacing full-time workers with 
permanent part-timers. The only way to efficiently operate branches during peak 
banking hours was with part-timers, said Kathleen Shilkret, a Wells Fargo Bank 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she said she expects that as branch functions change, banks will have 
less need for part-timers and will once again rely more heavily on full-time 
career positions.

 Like most gimmicks, the Kirk Bierley Man of Action Doll won't get his 
eponymous creator a job. But the two- foot-high, custom-designed puppet, which 
wears a suit, tie and Bierley's face, never fails to dazzle prospective 
employers when it arrives in the mail, clutching Bierley's resume in a Dr. 
Seuss-style book called "All About Me." 
</P>
<P>
 "That doll has opened a lot of doors for me," says the 27-year-old Bierley, a 
wry salesman who is shopping for a job in product development or marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bierley's doll certainly had the desired effect on Trent Ready, the jaded 
director of recruitment for Mattel Toys in El Segundo, who has seen every trick 
known to desperate job hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most incredibly original thing I have ever received," says Ready, 
who was impressed by the imagination of a man "who wanted to work for a toy 
company so he designed his own toy." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Ready says, Mattel doesn't have a position open that would 
match Bierley's talents. But he says the Dayton, Ohio, salesman is on his mind 
for right-brain jobs that might come open. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as too many people chase too few jobs, prospective employees will 
continue to angle for a way to stand out in a crowd. The more persistent ones 
will bombard personnel directors with innovative, wacky and sometimes plain 
annoying pleas that in one way or another say, "Hey, look at me." 
</P>
<P>
 Job recruiters, personnel directors and executives say Bierley's approach is 
the right stuff: doing your homework about the company, presenting yourself in 
a creative manner and being persistent but not annoying about following up. 
</P>
<P>
 Many employee wanna-bes send flowers, boxes of candy or notes to thank 
personnel directors for taking the time to interview them. 
</P>
<P>
 Some take the candy motif further. One personnel director received two huge 
chocolate feet in the past year bearing the inscription "Just trying to get my 
foot in the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Another who groused about a recruit's guerrilla tactics in trying to get 
noticed promptly received a toy gorilla holding a balloon. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman who works for TV's "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine" says one man sent a 
resume with a letter opener that said, "Think of me for your next opening." 
</P>
<P>
 "I use his letter opener all the time, it's sitting on my desk, but it's 
terrible, don't ask me where his resume is," says the employer. She wouldn't 
give her name, saying that if she did, legions of "Star Trek"-obsessed fans 
could ask for her when they call looking for work. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers say that even the most creative presentation will only get a 
prospective employee in the door. After that, an applicant is either qualified 
-- or sunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiters concur that there is an art to appearing eager but not desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember actress Sean Young? Sneaking onto the Warner Bros. lot in a Catwoman 
costume didn't persuade director Tim Burton to cast her in the "Batman" 
sequel's plum female role; Michelle Pfeiffer landed that spot. 
</P>
<P>
 For lesser mortals, making bellicose demands on the phone or waiting all day 
in the lobby despite being told that no one can see you are two no-nos. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a fine line, and if you cross over and it's too far out of the 
mainstream, it can backfire," says Pam McCarthy, senior vice president and 
director of human resources at Saatchi & Saatchi, DFS/Pacific in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 One who went too far was the job hunter who sent Saatchi & Saatchi a noose 
with his resume. McCarthy can't remember the person or the resume, but she 
keeps the noose in her office for morbid curiosity value. 
</P>
<P>
 Two resumes stick in her mind as striking the right note. One man presented 
his qualifications in a newspaper format, with banner headlines and various 
articles that described his background, training and extracurricular 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman looking for a job as an assistant account executive recently submitted 
a floppy disk containing a multimedia presentation on Hypercard for Macintosh 
that combined text in Spanish and English with graphics and music. 
</P>
<P>
 "This stands out because it's something new; she wants to show her computer 
skills, her writing skills and her bilingual abilities," says McCarthy, who 
intends to review the resume closely. "My associate wrote me a note saying she 
looked like a very enterprising young woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Some job hunters assume that applying for work at a creative company gives 
them license to be wacky. Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 One man who applied for a job at Iwerks, a Burbank company that designs and 
manufactures high-tech, out-of-home entertainment systems, got tired of waiting 
when personnel officials told him they had to review all applications submitted 
for a job he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it was late December, the man dressed up as Santa Claus and appeared at 
Iwerks corporate headquarters, where he proceeded to hand out gifts to everyone 
in the human resources department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bad thing to do; it was too aggressive," says Rachelle Lewis, a 
human resources assistant at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 But even the most corporate companies allow room for creativity, within 
limits. Caroline W. Nahas, managing vice president in the Century City 
corporate office of Korn/Ferry International, an executive recruiter with many 
Fortune 500 clients, says people who get jobs usually exhibit "a tremendous 
amount of perseverance." Cunning doesn't hurt, either. 
</P>
<P>
 One approach is "getting the direct lines of executives and then calling after 
hours, so the executive picks up the line," Nahas says. Often, instead of being 
annoyed, the executive may be impressed at how dogged the applicant has been, 
she says. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Bierley, if he fails to land that job at Mattel, he can always hire 
himself out as a creative consultant for other employment seekers.  
</P>
<P>
 Bierley garnered two interviews with Toys R Us after sending the company a 
talking robot doll. He solicited the Big Three auto makers in Detroit by 
mailing personnel directors his resume embossed on a hubcap. When he applied to 
Walt Disney World, he customized the Man of Action Doll with a Mickey Mouse 
wristwatch and tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come from a classic marketing background, but sometimes you have to go 
outside the paradigm," Bierley says. He's talking to Chrysler. What got him in 
the door? 
</P>
<P>
 "I sent them a 1/18th-scale model of a Viper, with a shrunk-down photo of me 
waving from the front seat."

<P>
 We asked readers to send in their resumes and share their career dreams. Eight 
readers were referred to job counselors, who told them how to achieve those 
dreams. Here's what they were told. Margaret Kono 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 33 
</P>
<P>
 Education: BA in economics, UCLA; MBA, Pepperdine University 
</P>
<P>
 Experience: 1983-90, account clerk and senior subcontract administrator at TRW 
</P>
<P>
 Present job: Housewife and mother 
</P>
<P>
 Dream job: Editor of children's and women's books 
</P>
<P>
 Quote: "I let myself be brainwashed into believing that a business degree was 
a savior even though it was evident from first grade that my aptitude was 
literary." 
</P>
<P>
 Expert's advice: From Susan Miller, Los Angeles career counselor: As a 
re-entry worker, you should confirm your interest in book publishing by 
learning more about that industry and taking personality tests to determine if 
you are truly suited to it. The extension program at the University of 
California at Irvine offers career testing through its Women's Opportunities 
Center. You might also want to attend 'Writing for Children's Books,' a one-day 
program offered at least twice a year by the UC Irvine Extension Writing 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also learn more about publishing by reading 'Getting Into Book 
Publishing,' a free booklet from the Assn. of American Publishers, 220 E. 23rd 
St., 2nd Floor, New York, NY 10010. The pamphlet describes what publishers want 
in job candidates and the range of jobs available. It also lists programs, 
courses and degree programs related to publishing.  
</P>
<P>
 To identify local book publishers aiming at the children's or women's market, 
consult the California Publishing Marketplace, available through Writers 
Connection, 1610 Blossom Hill Road, San Jose, CA 95124 ($11.65, including tax, 
postage and handling). 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, you might want to gain writing and editing experience by volunteering 
as a newsletter editor for a local children's or women's group in your 
community. Richard Bremmer 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 40 
</P>
<P>
 Education: BA in industrial arts from California State University, Long Beach; 
MBA, Pepperdine University; paralegal certificate from University of West Los 
Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Experience: 1978-90, manufacturing planning and proposal pricing for aerospace 
companies, most recently McDonnell Douglas; since being laid off in 1990, 
bookkeeper and security guard 
</P>
<P>
 Present job: Airport shuttle driver  
</P>
<P>
 Dream job: Job estimator and contract negotiator for manufacturing company 
</P>
<P>
 Quote: "I thought I had a career in aerospace, and I never thought I'd have to 
look elsewhere. I brought myself up in aerospace from the bottom. It's hard to 
get back in on the career ladder." 
</P>
<P>
 Expert's advice: From Judith Sommerstein, a Torrance career consultant: Due to 
the length of time you have been away from your profession, I recommend 
exploring other careers beyond that of cost estimator for a manufacturer. 
Broaden your search to include such potential employers as government agencies, 
environmental concerns and construction and health care operators. Information 
about cost estimating in government and manufacturing sectors is available from 
the Society of Cost Estimating and Analysis in Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 You should also consider looking in related career fields, including contract 
administrator, technical writer, proposal writer, operations manager, 
appraiser, management analyst or quality control manager. 
</P>
<P>
 You should also develop a resume that emphasizes your skills and a one-page 
marketing letter focusing on the industry and job you are seeking. As a former 
aerospace worker, the jargon used in your previous work may not be relevant to 
the positions you may be seeking. Send your resume to the head of the 
department you are interested in and bypass the personnel department. 
</P>
<P>
 Check in professional journals and trade newsletters for job opening 
advertisements. Another excellent resource is the book 'How to Get a Job in 
Southern California' by Thomas M. Camden and Jonathan Palmer, published by 
Surrey Books. Judy Harrison 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 48 
</P>
<P>
 Education: High school graduate with course work at Los Angeles 
Trade-Technical College, Los Angeles City College and National Education Center 
</P>
<P>
 Experience: 1968-90, secretary, receptionist, public relations and symposium 
coordinator positions 
</P>
<P>
 Present job: Receiving stress-related workers' compensation payments 
</P>
<P>
 Dream job: Public relations coordinator 
</P>
<P>
 Quote: "I'm looking for a job that would allow me to be creative. I'm a people 
person and enjoy working on projects." 
</P>
<P>
 Expert's advice: From Walter Brown of the UCLA Placement and Career Planning 
Center: Most of us bring to the job market two distinct sets of skills: our 
acquired expertise and what we are temperamentally suited for. The strongest 
job candidate is one whose personality complements his or her expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 You have over eight years as an event coordinator, and you have developed 
strengths as a flexible, enterprising, self-starter. There should be any number 
of organizations crying out for your help. Concentrate on large, civic, 
community and cultural nonprofit organizations, as well as social and fraternal 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Potential employers include professional associations, colleges and 
universities, labor unions, political campaigns and conference management 
firms. Professions with continuing education requirements often have training 
coordinators whose job it is to contact speakers, arrange for sites and promote 
the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Your age should not be a negative factor. The field you have chosen requires 
interaction with people in your age group who often feel more confident dealing 
with an age peer than someone who hasn't 'been there.' Don't be bogged down by 
your age; if you don't think about it, chances are no one else will either. 
Thomas LaRoche 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 27 
</P>
<P>
 Education: BA in psychology and economics, University of California, Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Experience: 1985 to present, staff trainer, billing clerk, insurance claim 
representative, office manager 
</P>
<P>
 Present job: Part-time bank teller 
</P>
<P>
 Dream job: Stockbroker 
</P>
<P>
 Quote: "I do not just want a 'job.' I want a career. Therefore, I continue to 
work while seeking my dream job." 
</P>
<P>
 Expert's advice: From Walter Brown of the UCLA Placement and Career Planning 
Center: To become a stockbroker, you generally need a college degree. Then you 
must pass the Securities and Exchange Commission's certification examination to 
get your broker's license.  
</P>
<P>
 Most recent college grads start out at a big stock brokerage firm, where they 
establish themselves and learn the ropes. Larger brokerage firms, including all 
the national companies and many regional ones, offer structured apprentice 
programs to train new recruits on the ins and outs of the brokerage business. 
</P>
<P>
 These programs also offer help in passing the SEC exam. But smaller firms can 
offer you the opportunity to find a dedicated, knowledgeable mentor who can 
also give you the apprentice training you will need. 
</P>
<P>
 You might also want to consider a career as a product manager with a 
manufacturer or large service organization. It is the product manager's job to 
figure out how best to market each new market entry. And this job offers a wide 
range of responsibilities, including analyzing mounds of statistical data on 
consumer preferences and running focus groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Other strong career possibilities for you include financial planning and 
corporate management of inventory control, logistics and customer relations.

</P>
<P>
 Age: 56 
</P>
<P>
 Education: BA in business economics from Nebraska Wesleyan; MA in political 
science, San Diego State University; postgraduate studies in counseling and 
education at USC 
</P>
<P>
 Experience: 1967 to present, elementary school teacher, middle-school 
counselor and high school administrator 
</P>
<P>
 Present job: Los Angeles Unified School District high school counselor 
</P>
<P>
 Dream job: Sales and marketing representative in Asia for American 
manufacturer 
</P>
<P>
 Quote: "I speak and write Chinese Mandarin, Indonesian, Malaysian and Fulkien 
dialect. I wouldn't mind being relocated in Asia." 
</P>
<P>
 Expert's advice: From David Lazzara, an Orange County career consultant: The 
major challenge you face as you attempt to move into the burgeoning Pacific Rim 
business arena will be your perception among employers as a career educator. 
</P>
<P>
 To correct this, you must be able to show prospective employers you have the 
abilities they need by positioning yourself as an executive with corporate 
skills. Reinterpret your background to highlight your achievements in the areas 
of administration, operations and finance.  
</P>
<P>
 Focus on how you conceived and implemented various programs. Highlight how you 
successfully 'sold' your school administration and students on the merits of 
your programs and then showcase the programs' positive results. You should take 
this tack in preparing your resume and in all job interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 To find companies that might be interested in your skills, check local 
libraries, trade associations, import-export seminars and business publications 
for potential contacts. In addition to providing leads about possible openings, 
personal contacts made during your research can often assist in evaluating your 
goals and skills, reviewing your resume and developing your interview 
technique. These contacts can also bolster your confidence. Diane Surak 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 30 
</P>
<P>
 Education: BA in anthropology, Boston University 
</P>
<P>
 Experience: 1985 to present, public relations coordinator, advertising account 
executive and fund-raiser 
</P>
<P>
 Present job: Development coordinator at Buena Vista Productions 
</P>
<P>
 Dream job: Film development and production 
</P>
<P>
 Quote: "I accepted my current position to learn about television development 
and production. I spend half my day, however, scheduling and rescheduling 
appointments for my boss, including bikini waxes, pedicures, eyelash tints. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 Expert's advice: From Linda Buzzell, director of the Entertainment Industry 
Career Institute in Beverly Hills: Capitalize on your present position. Between 
scheduling pedicures and bikini waxes, absorb everything you can about the 
business. Since you're interested in film development, read as many scripts as 
you can get your hands on and write brilliant 'coverage' (script analysis) and 
'notes' that impress people with your savvy creativity and writing ability. 
</P>
<P>
 You're putting up with a lot to be on the inside of a major studio, so make 
the most of it. Pinpoint all of the players at Disney with whom you'd like to 
work and network your way into the introductions you need. Other assistants are 
leaving all the time -- some are giving up and some are getting promoted -- and 
your dream job may be only a schmoozy lunch in the commissary away. Robert 
Thais 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 51 
</P>
<P>
 Education: BA in English, Loyola Marymount University; MA in English, 
California State University, Los Angeles; Ed.D, UCLA 
</P>
<P>
 Experience: 1968 to present, manpower development administrator, educational 
development specialist, industrial relations manager, customer satisfaction 
manager 
</P>
<P>
 Present job: Human resources manager for unit of Xerox Corp., but scheduled 
for layoff soon 
</P>
<P>
 Dream job: To work with a consortium of corporate employers and government and 
private agencies in the RLA (formerly Rebuild L.A.) effort 
</P>
<P>
 Quote: "I could apply my experience in human relations, manpower development, 
change management -- and my familiarity with L.A. as a Mexican American -- to 
make over Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Expert's advice: From Susan Miller, Los Angeles career counselor: Besides 
taking full advantage of all outplacement services offered through Xerox, you 
should contact the Los Angeles Private Industry Council ((213) 237-0855) to 
find out about the Work Link System, a new job development program. You might 
also want to build skills and experience in inter-group relations training by 
volunteering for RLA ((213) 740-4752), the Center for Nonprofit Management 
((213) 623-7080) or the Kellogg Training Center ((213) 736-1304). 
</P>
<P>
 Your potential professional association resources include the Diversity 
Development Division of the Los Angeles Chapter of the American Society for 
Training and Development ((310) 908-3020). This group will be offering 
workshops March 12 and 26 featuring a variety of speakers on workplace 
diversity and cross-cultural issues. This group also offers a job listing 
service for chapter members that is available by sending a self-addressed, 
stamped envelope to 10820 Beverly Blvd., Suite A5-101, Whittier, CA 90601, and 
holds monthly meetings for job-seekers.  
</P>
<P>
 Other sources include the Los Angeles Chapter of the Organization Development 
Network at (818) 789-8245. Further, you should renew your contacts at UCLA and 
especially investigate the Organizational Development/Change Management program 
for alumni contacts in Los Angeles. In addition, UCLA career counseling 
services are available to all University of California alumni. John Henshaw 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 45 
</P>
<P>
 Education: BA in psychology, California State University, Hayward; MA in human 
resources, University of Redlands 
</P>
<P>
 Experience: 1982 to present, training department at Vons Cos. 
</P>
<P>
 Present job: Manager of training and development for Vons 
</P>
<P>
 Dream job: Vice president of human resources for Vons 
</P>
<P>
 Quote: "I am currently handcuffed in this middle-management position and need 
to break through." 
</P>
<P>
 Expert's advice: From David Lazzara, an Orange County career consultant: If 
you want to be corporate vice president, you have got to present yourself as 
such -- starting with your resume. Currently, you describe yourself as a 
manager of training and development. Since most interviewers tend to have 
tunnel vision, that is exactly how you will be viewed. 
</P>
<P>
 It is imperative that your credentials clearly communicate your experience, 
knowledge and potential as a vice president. Your resume is not just a door 
opener, it continues to represent you as it is circulated among other decision 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
 The same approach must be taken with your interview technique. You must 
present yourself as the executive you aspire to be. Teach yourself to seize 
opportunities to point out ways that your experience and abilities can help 
your potential new employer. Answer questions with concrete examples of actions 
you successfully took. Include quantifiable results. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin your job search by targeting employers looking to increase management 
positions because of recent business acquisitions, new market penetrations, new 
product launches or site relocations. Look for growing companies that may soon 
need a human resources vice president and contact them directly, noting that 
such a position would aid in employee training and retention and result in 
higher productivity and profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, look to recruiters, classified ads and trade journals for job 
openings. Be persistent and always follow up an interview and resume with a 
personal phone call or letter.

 Nearly 400 readers responded to our offer last month to let career counselors 
help them chart the path toward the job of their dreams. Unfortunately, only 
eight could be selected.The resume material printed in the profile of each of 
these readers was provided by them. 
</P>
<P>
 The selected readers represent the range of desired career paths expressed by 
respondents. Housewives are looking to re-enter the work force in a new 
capacity, displaced aerospace and high-tech workers are scrambling for careers 
that match their skills, mid-career workers are seeking new opportunities, and 
younger workers are anxiously trying to find their first career footholds. 
</P>
<P>
 All the job counselors asked to advise our readers work solely as job 
counselors; none offer job placement services in addition to their counseling.

THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET; MAKING IT WORK; IS THE BOSS AN OGRE? TAKE 
HEART -- YOU'RE NOT ALONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINA LINDGREN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the ripe old age of 24, White House aide Andrew Friendly knows all about 
tough bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 With television news cameras whirring, he has been berated by President 
Clinton on an airport Tarmac in Vail, a golf course in Arkansas and a porch in 
the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Friendly is still in the high-profile job, which White House observers say 
makes up for the public abuse, especially considering that Clinton is given to 
hasty, if private, apologies. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Velasquez, now a successful advertising account executive, also felt the 
sting of an intimidating taskmaster early in her days at a Denver television 
station. The former boss, whom she won't identify, once called her "Teresa 
Taco" and sent her on paid leave in her eighth month of pregnancy, saying he 
was afraid she'd have her baby in the office hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 She persevered, cultivated mentor relationships with others at the station -- 
and ultimately outlasted her boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Most everyone has known a Boss From Hell. They can be the creative but 
exasperating detailer, the control freak or the intimidator intent on proving 
his or her superiority. Then there is the manipulator who says you're 
empowered, then proceeds to second-guess your decisions, or the opaque one who 
expects you to read his or her mind, then doles out demerits when you guess 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Been there, you say? Done it? Don't want to experience it again? 
</P>
<P>
 Odds are you will, say human resource experts. In today's tougher economic 
times, companies may be downsizing, but workplace stress is multiplying. 
Squeezed between investors anxious for increased productivity and profits and 
employees anxious to learn how to meet those expectations, even the most benign 
of bosses can turn into a take-no-prisoners Darth Vader. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too much of a buyer's market out there today, and the employers are the 
buyers," said Pat Allen, a Southern California psychotherapist and 
communications specialist. The market is "glutted with prospective employees, 
people so desperate for a job that they will take disrespect, disregard, snide 
remarks." 
</P>
<P>
 People like Kathryn Besemer. 
</P>
<P>
 Besemer's strategy for dealing with Steve Jobs, the perfectionist founder of 
Apple Computer and Next Computer in California's Silicon Valley who is renowned 
for temper tantrums, was to anticipate Jobs' every demand, then comply. The 
same strategy, she adds, also works with Mo Siegel, the visionary Colorado herb 
collector who helped found Celestial Seasonings Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people aren't so difficult. If you watch them, you can figure out what 
they want, what they value," said Besemer, who worked for Jobs at both Apple 
and Next and is now a vice president at the Boulder-based herbal tea company. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Besemer spent countless hours culling through nearly 40 shades of 
green before divining the exact one Jobs envisioned as the corporate color for 
his extravagant unveiling of the Next Computer at San Francisco's Davies 
Symphony Hall in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "People call it 'Steve's Green' or 'Next Green,' but that green was important; 
it had to be a rich color," she said. "For a lot of people, green is green, 
they don't care. But Steve cares. And I tell people, if the chairman of the 
company cares, then it's your job to care too." 
</P>
<P>
 Besemer, who left Next a few years after picking Steve's Green, said she never 
got into shouting matches like other Jobs employees, because she would tell 
Jobs that she was making an honest effort to understand and clarify what was in 
the perfectionist boss's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs "is very driven, and he'll say, 'You just don't get it!' . . . If you 
can't wrap your mind around something, that's when he gets most frustrated," 
she said. "But if he thought you were genuinely trying to understand, if you 
said, 'Steve, I'm trying to get it, help me with this,' then he would hang in 
there with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Many say the need for teamwork in the '90s and beyond will force mean and 
exploitative bosses out of the marketplace. Maybe so. But don't hold your 
breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the boss is a jerk, the type who yells and screams, then a lot of this 
stuff doesn't matter," said Richard A. Moran, author of the book "Never Confuse 
a Memo With Reality" and an organizational change expert for Price Waterhouse 
in San Francisco. "You have to grin and bear it until the boss leaves or you 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Compliance as a way of manipulating the boss into feeling in control is often 
the only answer short of quitting or being fired, said psychotherapist Allen, 
who has offices in Century City and Newport Beach. Allen calls it a form of 
seduction, a means of defanging intimidators, if only temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're doing is buying time," Allen said, "playing the game for a little 
while as you look around for a better situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen J. Scheier, another Apple alumnus who now advises corporations on 
change and improvement, distinguishes between bosses who are out for No. 1 and 
those whose passion is for the success of the organization. In dealing with the 
latter, he offers some tips: 
</P>
<P>
 First, understand what motivates him or her. Then, if at all possible, support 
that vision. Many people have disagreed with a hard-nosed boss and paid the 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 But Scheier believes it's worth the risk to stand up for your ideas or 
convictions -- provided you can back them up. "These are dominant personalities 
who are . . . looking for people who won't be a speed bump," he said.

THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET; MAKING IT WORK; A PRIMER FOR WHEN YOU 
WONDER, 'CAN THIS JOB BE SAVED?'

 Deborah Jones is skating on thin ice at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few weeks ago, Jones, an administrative assistant for a financial 
services firm in Los Angeles, was told her job was in jeopardy after a boss 
accused her of skipping out early and making frequent paperwork errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Stunned by the complaints, which she calls unfounded, Jones quickly asked for 
a meeting with her supervisors. Although the session cleared up some 
misunderstandings, Jones concedes that her job security remains questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 "They watch me very closely. . . . As long as I remain there, I'm going to 
have to be careful," acknowledges Jones, who asked that a pseudonym be used for 
this story to avoid further grief with her bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Can this job -- and others in jeopardy for similar reasons -- be saved? 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, say career counselors and other job consultants, employees can 
work their way out of trouble even after getting "shape up or ship out" 
warnings. But, they note, it takes quick action, a coolheaded approach and, 
over the long run, a single-minded willingness to sell yourself and take on new 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the employee in jeopardy must decide whether the job is worth 
the considerable time and effort it will take to keep it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a situation is too far gone to turn around. A manager might simply 
"have it in" for an employee, even if the supervisor officially states another 
reason for the problem. As a result, employees should be aware of hidden 
agendas and office politics before deciding what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging onto a job may also be impossible when a company isn't singling out 
one employee but is launching an across-the-board layoff of larger groups of 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees tend to get into trouble in their jobs for one of three reasons, 
experts say. In each case, says Walker, there are constructive steps the worker 
can take. 
</P>
<P>
 Often the problem stems from the arrival of new management, because of a 
merger or another type of corporate shake-up. Long-entrenched employees may not 
recognize that they have to adjust to the new management's ways. 
</P>
<P>
 On other occasions, employees are experiencing personal crises such as divorce 
or a death in the family and start neglecting their work, which angers their 
bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Or employees may feel they've outgrown their jobs and want to move on to 
something better. But their bosses don't see it that way, and instead want them 
to buckle down in their current roles. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, career advisers say, is that too many people delude themselves 
for too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "When your job is in jeopardy, you have to look at yourself the way they look 
at you when you're having a physical exam at the Mayo Clinic. You have to look 
at every inch of yourself," says Harvey Mackay, a Minnesota businessman and 
author of such business books as "Swim With the Sharks Without Being Eaten 
Alive."  
</P>
<P>
 For those who want to try getting back on their bosses' good sides, it's 
usually a good idea to follow Jones' example: Attack the matter head-on by 
quickly calling for a meeting to review the circumstances.  
</P>
<P>
 The opposite approach -- trying to ride out a bad situation until it improves 
on its own -- can be deadly.  
</P>
<P>
 How the meeting with the dissatisfied boss is handled is critical. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare, seek the advice of a respected company veteran or a mentor outside 
the firm. When the meeting is underway, be sure to stay calm and professional 
and keep your emotions in check. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key is to nail down what the supervisors regard as the problem and 
what can be done to correct it. Then, in the months following the formal 
meeting, seek out feedback.

THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET; MAKING IT WORK; BRINGING HOME THE BACON 
WHEN TROUBLE'S COOKING THERE

 The earthquake last January was just one in a series of disasters that 
strained Robert Sackett's ability to focus on his work.  
</P>
<P>
 First, the customer relations manager of a Santa Monica software concern was 
felled by a kidney infection for the entire month of December. Then, his 
Sherman Oaks home was wrecked by the earthquake. Finally, two weeks later, he 
stepped on a shard of glass at a friend's house in Northridge, severely 
injuring his foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ludicrous at this point," Sackett, 42, says. "I'm a manager -- I'm 
expected to be a problem solver, not a victim. So I worry about how this looks 
to my staff. I have done my job over the past few weeks, but I have not been as 
effective as I would like to be by quite a margin." 
</P>
<P>
 Sooner or later, we all face some measure of grief, some amount of 
distraction. But, as we all well know, a personal crisis is not a license for 
an extended leave from your job responsibilities. Still, when your world at 
home is falling apart, just how can you remain attentive to your job? After 
all, there's no point in compounding your problems by jeopardizing your 
standing at work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Focus on the task at hand," says Judith Martin, author of the syndicated 
etiquette column, "Miss Manners." She suggests employees use work as a welcome 
distraction from their private ordeals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taking your mind off your troubles can be much more valuable than wallowing 
in them," she says. "Remind yourself, 'I am not here as a person with aches and 
pains and resentment. I am here as a person with a job to do.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Raymona Bailey, whose 9-year-old son suffers sickle cell disease, practices 
that technique while teaching seventh grade at Markham Intermediate in 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell myself, 'I've done everything humanly possible; Anthony is now in 
God's hands,' " explains Bailey, 41, a single mother who is divorced from 
Anthony's father. "Then I do the best job I can for the youngsters I have in 
front of me."  
</P>
<P>
 People with chronically ill family members, or who themselves are chronically 
ill, face a double urgency for hanging on to their job despite personal 
pressures. Not only do they need the paycheck, they need the group health 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see families stand on their heads to keep their health insurance," says Pat 
Riordan, a social worker at Children's Hospital of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 While divorce is probably the most common stress that employees bear, it is 
still one of the most painful and consuming personal disappointments. And it is 
usually preceded by months of an unhappy, moribund marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The period leading to the breakup was actually worse in terms of work 
productivity," says Rich Seeley, 46, a technical writer for a computer 
manufacturer in Woodland Hills. "You have sleepless nights, you might drink too 
much, you spend a lot of time either fighting with or not talking to your 
spouse." 
</P>
<P>
 When Seeley went through his divorce three years ago, he found that sharing 
his experience with co-workers helped to ease tensions. "I left my wife on a 
Sunday, and on Monday I went to my immediate supervisor and talked to her about 
it," he explains. "I wanted people to understand why I was quieter than usual, 
and why I sometimes closed my office door to make phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Glassner, chairman of the sociology department at USC and author of the 
recently published book, "Career Crash," said that open communication is often 
the best policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It removes the mystery," he says. "Otherwise, the gossip mill gets going, and 
instead of going through a divorce you're having an affair, and instead of 
having to make repairs on your home, you're homeless."

THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET; MAKING IT WORK; ESSAY: FROM THE COCOON OF A 
JOB -- POOF! -- A CAREER EMERGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANNE KLEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A while back, something called "Take Our Daughters to Work Day" was declared. 
The idea behind this was sort of a grown-up show and tell, inspirational and 
educational at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 It was supposed to convince daughters that their parents have a Job to Do, 
which is important in the overall scheme of things and might be fun too. 
</P>
<P>
 All right, it was a gimmick. Mothers of sons groused that it may as well have 
been called "Leave Our Sons at Home Day." 
</P>
<P>
 But what this particular gimmick set out to do was encourage girls -- maybe 
next year it will be boys -- to seriously consider a career, as opposed to a 
job.  
</P>
<P>
 Talk about coming a long way. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a girl, the notion that women were destined only for marriage and 
motherhood was already passe. I never gave it a serious thought; my own mother 
worked for wages. Still, the nuances of the working world were a bit foreign. 
My parents never explained, for example, about this jump from job to career, or 
why one should bother to jump at all. 
</P>
<P>
 So now that I'm on the other side of the generational divide, I think, 
finally, that I understand the leap. This is what my parents should have told 
me back then. 
</P>
<P>
 See (they might have explained), if you're lucky enough to have a choice, a 
job is something you do when you are not Serious. A job is something you can 
skip to, or walk away from, just because you feel like it. (Like when I quit my 
job selling Kentucky Fried Chicken because I was tired of coming home smelling 
like a drumstick.) 
</P>
<P>
 But a job can also be a blast, they would have said. It can lead to nowhere, 
and nobody -- including you -- cares. A job eats up your time and then gives 
you some money in return, except that the money tends to be spent on things 
like CDs and Snickers and a wild paint job for your car. (Or, OK, the rent, but 
that gets into a grown-up realm.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs are something all kids should go through while they are finding 
themselves and eating fast food and going out with people just because they 
like the way they dress. 
</P>
<P>
 So if a job is a date, a career is more like tying the knot. And you should 
definitely date before marriage. Try out some jobs in different fields before 
you settle down. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as your parents always said, you'll find one that's right. That's when 
your on-the-job attitude will start to change. It doesn't actually matter what 
the job is. You'll think maybe it could work out, shall we say, into something 
Long Term. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll think about this job begetting another (but better) one, and another, 
and maybe another after that. 
</P>
<P>
 It goes something like this. You start working at the florist shop after 
school, start making special arrangements and customers notice your touch. A 
competitor hires you away, and before too long, you get backers to open your 
own shop.  
</P>
<P>
 And by now, you've got a resume (very careerish). Before you know it, you 
might as well be married with kids, in a manner of speaking. Committed, in 
other words. You've got a career! 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, nobody's ever come out and said that careers are better than jobs. But in 
the argot of responsible parenthood (circa 1994), you bet we're telling our 
kids they are. A career, we convey in words or in attitude, is something they 
should have. Or maybe that they must have. 
</P>
<P>
 People are always wanting to know if you have one, or why it is that you do 
not. A career is not just a series of jobs. It is a definition of who you are. 
(Florist: Creative. Intuitive. A green thumb. Good with plants, cash.) 
</P>
<P>
 Which, clearly, if phrased in the right way, is something that children of all 
ages can relate to. Nobody ever asks a kid what job she wants to do when she 
grows up, or at least nobody should. 
</P>
<P>
 It is being that is all-important to a child, as in "What do you want to be 
when you grow up?" 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the stuff of toil but of transformation: caterpillar to butterfly, 
ugly duckling to swan. The word job would definitely spoil the dream. 
</P>
<P>
 So when asked correctly, the question "What are you going to be when you grow 
up?" usually elicits responses that follow familiar paths. 
</P>
<P>
 They are going to be a) President of the United States, b) a ballerina, c) a 
firefighter or d) none of the above, because they are not planning on growing 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 My 7-year-old daughter, incidentally, volunteered "d." 
</P>
<P>
 This is why I didn't bother involving her in "Take Our Daughters to Work Day" 
last year. I figured it was a waste of time, hers and mine. I can see she's 
already considering a career like her mom's.

Q & A

<TEXT>
<P>
 DON BARTELSON 
</P>
<P>
 Owner, Ontario Ice Skating Center 
</P>
<P>
 Don Bartelson, 53, is a district representative of the Ice Skating Institute 
of America, a rink owners' trade group based in Illinois. His district includes 
Southern California. A former skater and instructor, Bartelson bought the 
Ontario Ice Skating Center in 1984 and transformed it from a business on the 
verge of collapse to a going concern. Bartelson spoke last week with Times 
staff writer Chris Woodyard about the effect of the Olympic Games and the 
growing popularity of professional ice hockey on the ice-rink industry. 
</P>
<P>
 *  
</P>
<P>
 Question: The ice-rink industry is on a high. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: There are four ingredients that will never happen again. We are never 
going to have two Olympic Games 24 months apart. No. 2, the Kings are not in 
the immediate future headed to the Stanley Cup playoffs again. No. 3, we are 
never again going to have the Mighty Ducks being a new (National Hockey League) 
franchise. No. 4 -- the kicker, which is responsible for 30% of the new 
business we have had -- we are never again going to have the Nancy 
Kerrigan-Tonya Harding situation. What our industry is wondering is, are we 
going to return to the normal four-year cycle? We hope not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why not? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Business declines. It's peaks and valleys. For the health of the industry, 
we have to try to reach more of a level. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has business picked up in the past year because of the Mighty Ducks? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. Usually we can do percentages and say the Olympics brought in this 
much new business, or NHL hockey brought in this much. This year, it's a little 
hard to break that one down. A year ago the majority of our enrollment was in 
hockey. This month, it's five to one in figure skating. . . . We have had 
approximately 30 hours of ice sports in front of people forthe past three weeks 
during the Olympics. If it weren't for that, none of (the increase in business) 
would take place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the Kerrigan-Harding affair? 
</P>
<P>
 A: That situation bothers me, sportsmanship-wise. And a verdict, guilty or not 
guilty, does not matter. I am concerned about that type of image being 
portrayed to youngsters. I feel a very strong moral situation there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are rinks doing anything to get away from having to depend on events like 
the Olympics to bring in new skaters? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We have done an incredible job of creating public awareness to ice sports. 
You will find now that rinks do cable-TV advertising, particularly on Mighty 
Ducks and Kings games. (The Ducks' founder, Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael) 
Eisner is a genius, and he really offers more. When you go to a Mighty Ducks 
game, it is more than a hockey game.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Hockey took years to catch on in Southern California. Why did it finally 
take hold? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Wayne (Gretzky) brought hockey to Southern California. I don't think 
there's a doubt in anybody's mind. Wayne is really responsible for major public 
awareness of the sport of ice hockey. Look at his image. He's wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you find there are a lot of older people who are interested in hockey? 
</P>
<P>
 A: This is a market we are now going to be able to service better. For 
instance, there are 25-year-olds who have never been on ice skates, let alone 
hockey skates, and they want to be hockey players. We can teach them to skate, 
play hockey and become a member of a team.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does it take to be successful in the ice-rink business? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Patience and long-term goals. You need to look at the picture in a decade 
situation, not in a 48-month situation. What is going to happen to the sport? 
Where are we going to be? Certainly the visibility of ice sports is going to 
continue to increase. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are new ice rinks being built? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. There are a lot of new rinks going on line. Disney is talking about 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Ice rinks were going into shopping malls for a while. What happened? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's all due to money. Mall space rents are ridiculously high. They used to 
do it to draw people in, but now those numbers don't work. They have to have 
'X' number of dollars per square foot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the peak season for ice skating? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Thanksgiving through Easter. That's for public skating  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Because people want a wintry kind of experience? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So how do rinks struggle through the summers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: By arranging enough organized programs, which the Ice Skating Institute of 
America offers to all rink owners. I'm really family-oriented, encouraging 
people to bring the whole family. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you deal with girls who want to be the next Nancy Kerrigan? Don't 
most of them have false hopes? 
</P>
<P>
 A: This is why we offer recreational programs. If they find out they are not 
going to be Nancy Kerrigan, they can still participate and have fun in a 
healthy environment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are there a certain number of stage mothers in this business? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know which is worse, the stage mother or the hockey father. They 
are both at the same back door, beating each other up to get into the arena. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On America's fascination with Olympic ice skating. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a certain amount of mystique and glamour. It encompasses so much of 
an individual. It takes a complete package to make that Olympic team, to be 
able to stand under those five rings." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the effect of the in-line roller skating fad on ice rinks. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It increased our business. Once you step on a pair of skates, it's friction 
versus non-friction." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the future of the industry. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a possibility that we are going to see the world of ice skating 
change. I'm not sure how -- perhaps more of a family experience." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On areas for expansion. . . 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still room for growth in certain markets. The most explosive market 
we have in this country is the Sun Belt states, Florida especially."

 Douglas Yates performs a special kind of legerdemain. 
</P>
<P>
 In a shop hidden away in a corner of Costa Mesa's industrial district, Yates 
makes fireworks displays that illuminate picturesque harbors, submarines that 
dive into coral reefs teeming with marine life, and rockets that fly to

 Yates does not work for Disneyland -- though he once did. And he does not work 
for a movie studio -- though Universal Studios is one of his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Yates is one of a handful of local industrial model makers, artists whose job 
it is to transform two-dimensional architectural and engineering drawings into 
miniature slices of life -- or at least a believable facsimile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our business is illusion," said Yates, who is president and owner of Model 
Technics Inc., an 18-year-old, privately held model-making firm. "We have to 
create reality out of illusion." 
</P>
<P>
 When it came to building his $450,000-a-year business, Yates created reality 
out of hard work, attention to detail and miles of pavement pounding. Yates had 
once aspired to be an architect, but he quit his studies 32 years ago when he 
realized that the only part of the profession that really inspired him was the 
model making. 
</P>
<P>
 He hasn't looked back since. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was still in his early 20s, Yates began knocking on the doors of 
building contractors, promising to build models for the same price that 
architectural firms were charging for their conceptual drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked for several model-making firms, including one in Europe, finally 
landing a position at Disneyland, where he helped develop the Anaheim amusement 
park's master plan in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a year, Yates struck out on his own, driven by a desire to take full 
control of the creative process and be flexible enough to adapt to the 
evolution of the industry. He began honing his skills as an architectural model 
maker as well as branching out to other areas of the field, such as creating 
full-size prototypes ranging from missile and computer components to portable 
radio housings and auto parts. 
</P>
<P>
 He once turned out a model for Irvine-based Allergan Inc., a maker of eye and 
skin-care products, designing a new version of a contact lens holder. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his most recent models is a battery for a camcorder being designed by a 
division of Irvine-based Western Digital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Digital spokesman Bill Frank said the company needed the model to help 
engineers conceptualize how the battery pack would fit into the new product and 
if it would impede its operation. "The quality of the samples we received back 
far exceeded what we expected," Frank said. "Models are very important to us," 
he said. "His were very beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 For the 18 years that Model Technics has been around, the art of industrial 
model making has evolved into a complicated science. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Yates said, static models and prototypes were enough to satisfy 
most customers. Today, adding special effects to models, especially 
architectural ones, is much in demand. Customers eager to woo prospective 
buyers and investors want to create a mood with the models they display, Yates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing just that is the key to Yates' latest project: a model of a resort 
proposed on the shore of the Persian Gulf. Last week, Yates and his crew of 
eight employees went to work on a tabletop model of what will eventually be a 
massive salt-water aquarium several stories high. 
</P>
<P>
 To make the project as appealing as possible, Yates' group decided to "push 
the envelope," equipping the model with lights and motors that will send 
replicas of sharks and whales swimming through a mini-reef in a giant aquarium 
that will be a resort attraction; make a submarine dive and surface; and even 
take tiny tourists for strolls along a promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 On a shop table, workers studied undersea photographs from books before 
sculpting plastic rocks and coral reefs and hand-painting the hundreds of tiny 
fish that will be added to the model. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had never built an aquarium before," Yates said as workers sawed and honed 
to make the hundreds of pieces fit snugly together. "But that is the nature of 
the business. You learn as you go along." 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever the job, Yates said, he feels that the talent he has recruited -- 
artists and sculptors, mechanical engineers, architects, computers specialists 
-- is sufficient to fill any job order or satisfy any imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job is to take the vision of the clients and make it work for them," he 
said. "I have a lot of good people to make that possible. I guess you can call 
me the ringmaster."
