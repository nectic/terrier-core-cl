THEATER REVIEW; COPPERFIELD SHOW: COOL TRICKS, CORNY CHATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With his TV-induced fame and I-could-make-the-moon-go-away-if-I-wanted-to 
brio, David Copperfield has always seemed to float above other magicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The attention he has generated over the years may have been his most stunning 
trick. And now that Copperfield is romantically linked to international model 
Claudia Schiffer, his act has gained an even higher profile. These two are the 
latest tabloid couple, titillating the globe with their gossip-ready pairing. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone, including his competitors, agree that Copperfield has moved magic to 
another level, one that makes him newsworthy. Other illusionists who like their 
stunts on an epic scale (Siegfried & Roy come to mind) don't often get out of 
Las Vegas, but Copperfield appears and disappears with his technology-oriented 
arsenal all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
 He materialized Thursday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center (where he 
continues through Sunday) with his latest extravaganza, "Beyond Imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 A glimpse of Schiffer emerging from the stage fog may have been missing from 
opening night, but all manifestations of Copperfield's romance with hugely 
theatrical, hugely expensive illusions were clearly evident. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His performance, with reportedly at least $700,000 in gadgetry, is stupendous, 
spectacular, stupefying (should I stop now?) and very cool. Children sat 
dumbfounded. Their parents were thrilled. Young, snappily dressed couples gazed 
at each other with those "How did he do that?" looks. If it's all done with 
mirrors, Copperfield must have some very fancy ones. 
</P>
<P>
 He's actually improved in recent years, using the money wisely, creating even 
more lavish (but also complementary) settings for his various routines. The 
environment for his main tableaux is more Vegas than Broadway, but, with its 
Fritz Lang's "Metropolis" veneer and pulsing rock tunes, it produced the 
desired moodiness. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is as it's always been: He just doesn't know when to be quiet. The 
patter between tricks is personable but corny, and Copperfield still seems 
confused over what he's trying to project as a performer. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the "good son" David making a rose out of tissue paper for an old 
lady. Then there's the hip-jutting, horny Dave who doesn't mind a leer or two. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When his illusions are meant to be personal and revealing as well as exciting, 
he almost ruins them with syrupy reflections on his childhood. Too much gab 
about flying dreams and a love of falling snow stalled a couple of stunts based 
on those notions. 
</P>
<P>
 Copperfield probably calls it showmanship, but it detracts from the magic. And 
with tricks like these, you're eager for him to get on with it. 
</P>
<P>
 He started the two-hour performance by placing an assistant in a box, then 
removed her comely head. She smiled the entire time, proving that you don't 
need your body to have a good time. Next, Copperfield put himself through a few 
contortions, using a coffin-sized contraption that collapsed in sections, 
leaving the magician about five feet shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 It picked up from there. 
</P>
<P>
 He invited another assistant to crawl through his abdomen (she obliged, of 
course, with a wicked grin) and a third endured having her arm and leg 
systematically "erased." Copperfield obviously has a thing about body parts, 
and later split a woman in half, then brightly assembled her again. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the maudlin setups were out of the way, Copperfield took to the air, 
while burly male accomplices pulled rings across him to show there weren't any 
wires, at least none that we could see. 
</P>
<P>
 And then he made "snow" out of his sleeves, filling the center with bits of 
puffy foam that, in the blaze of stage lights, was surprisingly pretty as it 
cascaded on the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 One worry, though: That stuff doesn't stain the carpet, does it? 
</P>
<P>
 * David Copperfield in "Beyond Imagination" continues today at 1, 4:30 and 8 
p.m. and Sunday at 1, 4:30 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. $19.50 to $35, with $7 
discounts for children younger than 7. (714) 740-2000 or (213) 480-3232.

COMEDY REVIEW; JEFF DUNHAM AND HIS DOLLS ARE GROWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comedian-ventriloquist Jeff Dunham prides himself on growth. Unlike too many 
performers in the field, the Dallas native constantly turns his act over, 
separating the lemons from the laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 The show you saw a year ago is not the show you'll see now. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night at the Brea Improv was Exhibit A. He was last there eight 
months ago, and that show was splendid. This show is even better. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Peanut, a light purple woozle with big red lips and a splotch of 
green hair, and Walter, sort of an elderly Don Knotts with a chiseled-on scowl, 
were the dependable chassis to which Dunham added some bells and whistles, the 
latest being Bubba the redneck. Bubba will not be enrolling at Auburn 
University soon. This red-haired, big-eared, round-faced, baseball-cap-wearing 
Southern man is, after all, a "Hee Haw" reject (Walter's words) who met his 
corndog-eating wife at a family reunion as the sun reflected off her curlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Also new to the show is the Dear Walter segment, in which the grouchy Walter 
answers audience questions. Few of his better answers, however, are fodder for 
a family newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching a Dunham show, which the comedian has over the years been trying to 
give a sitcom feel to through character development, it's easy to take for 
granted what other ventriloquists labor at. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunham's voices are clear and distinct, featuring foreign accents, drunken 
slurs, animal noises and guttural moans. He also does a fine job separating 
himself from the act, especially with Peanut, who pretty much works the crowd 
himself, including his remark about one male patron going bald: "In a few more 
years, it'll be like his neck is going to be blowing a bubble." It's easy to 
overlook that those were Dunham's insults, not Peanut's. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunham is prone to use the term we (as did the legendary Edgar Bergen and 
Muppetman Jim Henson), which helps him and the audience believe his puppets are 
people. The price a ventriloquist pays for that, though, is personal obscurity. 
While Peanut and Walter might be recognized at the mall, Dunham is not. He 
acknowledged at much in his opening 10 minutes, before bringing out his 
right-hand men. "I've reached anonymous fame," he told the crowd, adding that 
he was recognized once in a men's room. 
</P>
<P>
 But with success and growth come growing pains. And though Bubba's nine-minute 
portion of the 75-minute show was good and certainly has potential (unlike 
Bubba), there were some empty spots (much like Bubba), mainly in the first few 
minutes when Bubba was grazing in the political-topical field. 
</P>
<P>
 Other minor gripes include:  
</P>
<P>
 * In his pursuit of perfection, Dunham has thrown the baby out with the 
bathwater. In previous shows, part of his brief opening monologue included a 
sketch in which Dunham is holding a blanket and talking to a cooing baby. It 
was not in Thursday's show. It was a fine piece.  
</P>
<P>
 * He omitted one of his most impressive feats, a rapid-fire six-way 
conversation that must be heard to be believed. 
</P>
<P>
 But overall, the focus on growth has paid off. In a recent interview, Dunham 
used the analogy of a one-dimensional juggler: If all he can do is juggle, then 
the tricks had better be stupendous if he wants to hold a crowd. Dunham, though 
recognized as being among the most highly skilled ventriloquists today, prefers 
not to rely only on tours de force to succeed. He prides himself on his comedy 
and his characters. 
</P>
<P>
 If his stand at the Brea Improv is any indication, he's on track. All seven of 
his shows are sold out. Orange County fans are no dummies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jeff Dunham continues through Sunday at the Brea Improv, 945 E. Birch St. 
Tonight: 8:30 and 10:30; Sunday , 7:30 and 9:30. Sold out. (714) 529-7878.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; OFFSPRING TAKES MORE CHANCES -- AND REAPS THE REWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Offspring, Orange County's hard-core-punk offshoot, isn't just a garage 
band anymore, as the group's suffocatingly packed show Thursday at the Whisky 
revealed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the 7-year-old, four-member band, which came out of O.C.'s surf-rat 
rock scene, is beginning to get radio airplay nationwide, a rare occurrence for 
even the most hyped of indie rock bands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Offspring was inspired by such early hard-core bands as T.S.O.L., Agent 
Orange and the Adolescents. But unlike a lot of its current-day peers, it 
doesn't just ride the wave of nostalgic punk. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the band takes more chances, adds long-haired rock riffs, pure power 
chords, poppy kid stuff, a little funk and actually sings rather than 
machine-guns out lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 The band is on the tiny Epitaph label, started by members of L.A.'s Bad 
Religion and home of the equally popular but more conventionally hard-core band 
Pennywise. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the more straight-ahead political and social comments made by its label 
mate, the Offspring tackles the frustration of living in conservative suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids responded to that angle when alternative-rock radio station KROQ-FM put 
"Come Out and Play," a song off the Offspring's third album, into high 
rotation. The album, "Smash," has gone on to sell 75,000 copies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whisky was scorching hot on Thursday and packed tighter than any show in 
recent memory, as the band played its first local show since "Smash" was 
released earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 After a long delay, the group came on stage and launched into a fiery number 
about a crazed freeway shooter. The crowd immediately broke open into a massive 
slam pit that consumed most of the lower floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Bryan Holland, his long blond hair in tiny braids, unleashed flexible 
vocals seemingly with ease. His charismatic voice went from shrill, Robert 
Plant-like highs to bratty, attitude-laden Circle Jerk-type sneers to 
poppy-sweet harmonies of Cheap Trick. He was backed by anthem-like shouts of 
his band, pumping up the strength of already catchy choruses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have more than just one song and one album," Holland said after the 
group did "Come Out and Play." But the crowd seemed to know more than just this 
year's material. Rarely a song was played that at least a third of the audience 
didn't shout along to. 
</P>
<P>
 The music went from booming hard-core to fast pop and sometimes even a tinge 
of '60s garage rock. The band kept the energy level consistently high and held 
the songs together in tight, neat blasts. 
</P>
<P>
 On album, the Offspring is good but less dimensional than it proved to be 
live. It may just be the band is unable to capture that abandon on disc yet, a 
small ailment that experience may cure. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's fun, teen-age rock is charismatic enough to take it beyond a 
hard-core crowd but never so compromised as to alienate its base of Angst- 
hungry fans.

 I couldn't let Leonard Feather's review of the Roy Hargrove Quintet's 
performance at Ambassador Auditorium ("Hargrove Quintet Delivers a One-Note 
Performance," May 21) go by without comment. 
</P>
<P>
 I was struck by his criticism that Hargrove's performance was "too determined 
to please the audience at all costs." Well, excuse me, but isn't that the point 
-- to please the people who pay hard-earned money to buy the tickets? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the Imperial Critic should request private concerts in the future so he 
won't have to be subjected to the "audience-milking" and much enjoyed 
performance put on by these five exceptionally talented young musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Feather, methinks thou arte full of thyself.

MISLED BY STATISTICS OR 'HUMAN' ERROR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re Robert W. Welkos' article "Why 'Being Human' Misfired" (May 17): 
</P>
<P>
 His portrait of why the film is failing to reach audiences is revealing of the 
business machinations of Hollywood, but not very telling about the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Welkos explains that when National Research Group asked people how they'd like 
to see a movie about a man searching for his place in the world, "only 2% of 
males over 25 said it was their first choice of a film to watch this weekend 
while 1% of males and females under 25 said it was their first choice." 
</P>
<P>
 That's it, case closed. The film "Being Human" is doomed to arrive stillborn 
in the imagination of the public because overnight polls have shown 
conclusively that the audience tracking scores are under "minimum." "In other 
words," as an anonymous studio marketing source declared to Welkos, "people 
just didn't like what they saw." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, as Mark Twain said, "There's lies, damned lies and then there's 
statistics!" I went to see "Being Human" -- and I liked what I saw. Robin 
Williams' performance as the five wandering Hectors moved me in a way he hasn't 
since playing the memorable Dr. Oliver Sacks character in "Awakenings."  
</P>
<P>
 After viewing the movie, I tried to reconcile what I had read with what I had 
seen with my own eyes. I began to wonder about this no-man's land we seem to be 
selling ourselves on, a place where being human doesn't seem to count for much 
anymore.  
</P>
<P>
 ERIC L. VOLLMER 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Welkos got it all wrong. The failure of Robin Williams' non-movie had nothing 
to do with bad advance hype and everything to do with word of mouth. A lot of 
us Williams devotees told our friends and neighbors: "Don't waste your time or 
money by punishing yourself trying to make sense out of 'Being (sub) Human.' 
Politely put, it's a dud."

MUSIC REVIEW; 'SEASONS' CLOSING L.A. PHILHARMONIC SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Closing its 30th concert year in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion -- not to 
mention its 75th anniversary season -- the Los Angeles Philharmonic brings, for 
the first time in its history, a complete performance of Haydn's "The Seasons" 
to its subscription audiences this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new English version specially commissioned by the L.A. Philharmonic Assn. 
for these performances, the work, heard for the first time Thursday night, had 
the benefit of Roger Norrington's impassioned and exigent leadership to guide 
this large-scale undertaking smoothly through the complex shoals of continuity. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarly but vigorous English conductor did so in splendid manner, 
concluding the Thursday night concert series with an uplifting brilliance. The 
orchestra -- with assistant concertmaster Mark Baranov acting as leader -- 
seemed to give Norrington whatever he asked: strong but unexaggerated 
contrasts, first-rate soloism, tight balances and even textures. 
</P>
<P>
 The players of the reduced ensemble were seconded by 47 members of Los Angeles 
Master Chorale singing their strenuous assignments with sublime ease. The 
Master Chorale has seldom sounded at once so mellow and incisive. 
</P>
<P>
 Norrington applied his affectionate probing of this colorful score with equal 
energy throughout, letting its valleys speak as articulately as its peaks. This 
was not a performance during which one was tempted to watch the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 At least part of the reason for that was the excellence of the three vocal 
soloists. English-trained but Canadian-born Kevin McMillan commands a smallish 
but clear and attractive baritone, delivers words with crystalline 
understandability and sings with ardor. 
</P>
<P>
 Amanda Halgrimson's solid if undistinctive soprano -- it actually blooms 
charmingly above the staff -- and unfettered musical delivery made all of her 
contributions cherishable. Tenor John Aler, though weak in power in his lowest 
register, brought clear and pretty singing and a sense of secure musicality to 
all his assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the heroes of this evening, after Norrington, were the 
Philharmonic's brass, who splashed the walls as well as the atmosphere in the 
Pavilion with aural gold. 
</P>
<P>
 * L. A. Philharmonic and L.A. Master Chorale, Roger Norrington conducting, 
play Haydn's "The Seasons" in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music 
Center, today at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Tickets $6-$50.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; SARAH MCLACHLAN'S SOPRANO POSSESSES THE WADSWORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A perfect soprano makes up for a multitude of preciousness. And so it was 
Thursday at the Wadsworth Theater, where Sarah McLachlan's gorgeous ease in 
gliding through powerful, ethereal upper registers pretty much dispelled for 
the time being any thoughts one might have about a relative lack of chutzpah in 
the material itself. 
</P>
<P>
 On record, McLachlan's resolute prettiness too infrequently catches fire, 
framed by standard-issue alternative-adult-contemporary production values that 
downplay the rhythm section. Her live band was no less slick than the crews of 
record, but more wisely directed to put a kick in the pants of her 
old-fashioned, lovelorn musings. Moreover, the set list seemed to be designed 
to save the tunes that take full advantage of McLachlan's soprano for later, 
lending the show a subliminal sense of crescendo. 
</P>
<P>
 A Peter Gabriel-esque arrangement that had McLachlan and backup soprano 
Camille Henderson both out in front, singing together in full force, provided 
the easy vocal peak. But for most of the full house the highlight was the 
current hit "Possession," with McLachlan as Raphaelite-poet-sex-goddess, 
credibly promising to "hold you down, kiss you so hard, I'll take your breath 
away." With lungs like hers, she just could steal it. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening up was young Irish band the Devlins, who sound dreamy and -- if you're 
inclined to think so -- look dreamy, too. Singer Colin Devlin sounds a bit like 
a young version of latter-day Robbie Robertson, though Robertson probably never 
wrote any songs with as few chord changes as some of these minimalist yawners. 
The band fared better staying away from two-note dirges, the slightly peppier 
numbers boding not badly for an improved sophomore run. CHRIS WILLMAN

JAZZ REVIEW; TERENCE BLANCHARD PUTS A SHINE ON HIS SPECIAL HOLIDAY TREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terence Blanchard, now at the Jazz Bakery, has been gaining a reputation as a 
writer of superior movie scores . But because of his prowess as a trumpeter and 
leader, he remains a major force on the jazz scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanchard, whose current album is a tribute to Billie Holiday, opened Thursday 
with a slow, haunting version of "Lady Sings the Blues," a song written for and 
recorded by her. He immediately showed himself capable of a rare emotional 
poignancy. 
</P>
<P>
 His technical brilliance also is beyond question and, unlike some of his 
contemporaries, he rarely indulges in displays of fireworks. His sound is 
notable for its clarity and consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanchard has three valuable sidemen: Bruce Barth, a pianist whose crisp 
articulation provided some of the evening's most rewarding moments; Chris 
Thomas, an outstanding bassist, and the dependable Troy Davis on drums. 
</P>
<P>
 Agreeably jazz-tinged singer Jeanie Bryson completes the group, singing two 
Holiday-associated tunes on each set. Her "Detour Ahead" was prefaced by a 
beautiful Blanchard chorus. 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; PHILIP BAILEY'S FALSETTO FACADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As an R&B singer, Philip Bailey isn't what he used to be. The former Earth, 
Wind & Fire singer's falsetto -- once full-bodied, soaring and second to none 
-- has fallen on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Roxy on Thursday, that voice soared to old heights only a few times, 
sometimes either cracking or slightly off-key. And like that falsetto, the show 
never really soared. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, who has had success both in the pop and gospel fields, led off the 
night with the Beatles' "Come Together" and his 10-year-old soul-rock hit "Easy 
Lover" to show the audience right away it wasn't going to be a gospel show. But 
"Easy Lover," powered by driving rock riffs, turned out to be the best song of 
the show and it was mostly downhill from there -- despite a solid performance 
by his backup sextet. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the fans who packed the Roxy seemed to be there to hear the old hits 
from Bailey's '70s Earth, Wind & Fire glory days, but the only one he offered 
was 1975's "Reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 While it's admirable and even daring not to use EWF oldies as a crutch, it was 
also a silly decision in that it placed the burden of carrying the show 
squarely on the music from his 10-year solo R&B career -- particularly songs 
from his so-so new album, "Philip Bailey." The truth is that material simply 
isn't strong enough to rivet an audience for an entire set. DENNIS HUNT

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; OFFSPRING ENERGIZES WHISKY CROWD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's hard-core-punk offshoot Offspring isn't just a garage band 
anymore, as Thursday's suffocatingly packed show at the Whisky revealed. The 
sold-out date follows major attention for the band by alternative station KROQ. 
</P>
<P>
 Offspring, which came out of O.C.'s "surf-rat" scene, takes chances with 
traditional hard-core by adding long-haired rock riffs, pure power chords, 
bubblegummy kid-pop, a little funk and real singing rather than machine-gunning 
of the lyrics.  
</P>
<P>
 The Whisky was scorching hot Thursday as the band played its first show since 
releasing its third album earlier this year. As Offspring launched into a fiery 
kick-off number, the room broke into a massive slam pit that consumed most of 
the lower floor. Singer Dexter Holland's charismatic voice went from bratty 
Circle Jerk-ish sneers to the pop sweetness of Cheap Trick. His lyrics of 
suburban frustration were backed by the anthemic shouts from his three 
band-mates. 
</P>
<P>
 The music went from booming hard-core to fast pop and sometimes even a tinge 
of '60s garage-rock here and there. The band kept the energy level consistently 
high, and held the songs together in tight and neat blasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Offspring's fun teen-age rock is charismatic enough to cross over beyond a 
hard-core crowd, but never compromising enough to alienate its base of Angst 
-hungry fans. It's a balance that could take it far.LORRAINE ALI

RED RODNEY; LEADING FIGURE IN BE-BOP MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Red Rodney, a driving force in the be-bop movement that spread from New York's 
Birdland through the rest of the country in the 1940s and '50s, died Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Times jazz critic Leonard Feather said Rodney died of cancer in New York City. 
He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney, the trumpeter who helped make the Charlie Parker Quintet a definitive 
unit in the early days of progressive jazz, had experienced health problems 
throughout his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Parker, Dizzy Gillespie was an early influence on the young 
trumpeter from Philadelphia who was born Robert Chudnick. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney -- who was portrayed by Mike Zelnicker in "Bird," a biographical film 
about Parker -- began studying brass when he was in his teens. 
</P>
<P>
 He was working with a Philadelphia swing orchestra when he first heard the 
innovative Gillespie harmonies. Gillespie listened to him and took the 
18-year-old to New York, where he met Parker. He said the first thing the 
troubled saxophonist did was borrow $10. Rodney also was allowed to sit in with 
the Parker group. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney, who was to become a member of the elite Downbeat magazine Hall of 
Fame, joined the Gene Krupa band after learning that Parker and Gillespie were 
traveling to California, where Krupa would be performing. He returned to New 
York with Krupa, stayed a year, then began working clubs on 52nd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 He was performing with Woody Herman's band in New York in 1949 when Miles 
Davis left Parker, and Rodney took his place as part of the fabled quintet. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney -- short, redheaded and Jewish -- found that he had to pass himself off 
as a racial oddity to be accepted in a field dominated by blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, he recalled, would introduce him to audiences as "Albino Red." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney said Parker not only led him to the forefront of the bop movement but 
also "inspired" him to start using drugs so "maybe I could play that good," as 
he told Feather in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 He battled drugs for several years. By the 1970s he had put his destructive 
habits behind him and was touring Europe, playing regularly behind star acts in 
Las Vegas and recording with a group called Bebop Preservation Society. In the 
early 1980s he started working full time with his own jazz quintet and appeared 
at clubs throughout the country, including the Catalina Bar and Grill in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980 he teamed up with Ira Sullivan, who played reeds and brass, in what 
was then one of the most popular combos in jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music calls Rodney "one of the best 
be-bop trumpeters" of the period and "certainly one of the first white players 
to gain credibility and experience in the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney's survivors include his wife, Helene.

NOVELTY ACTS; FUN FABRICS WITH WHIMSICAL PRINTS TAKE CENTER STAGE. THEY'RE NO 
LONGER BEING RELEGATED TO MERE SLIPCOVERS OR ACCENTS. IN FACT, THEY'RE CLIMBING 
THE WALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By LYNN O'DELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As soon as Rene Mendoza saw it, he knew the novelty print fabric was just 
right for the vacation condo he's decorating in Rancho Mirage. But the 
Orange-based designer isn't using the whimsical print for a tablecloth or sofa 
pillows -- the usual fate of novelty fabrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the lively combination of tea cups, cafe art, fruit and pitchers is 
going up on a wall. Mendoza is upholstering a breakfast nook wall with "Cafe," 
an S. Harris fabric in yellow, moss green, blue and terra cota. He also plans 
to use it for place mats, bench cushions and a valance over the kitchen window. 
</P>
<P>
 Novelty prints are big this year. Once relegated to children's rooms or used 
solely as accents on side chair seats and pillows, they are showing up on a 
larger scale today.  
</P>
<P>
 F. Schumacher & Company's spring line boasts four instead of the usual one or 
two, said spokeswoman Marjorie McNaughton. A wall in the firm's San Francisco 
showroom is upholstered in "Les Ouefs," ($52 a yard, 53 inches wide) featuring 
a variety of speckled eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 New novelty patterns also depict bright seed packets, statue-like African 
animals framed in medallions of ivy vines, Medieval trees on worn parchment 
pages, tropical fish, stars and moons, giant buttons in vivid colors, a jumble 
of leather-bound books, even a Victorian baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Most are in 100% cotton and can be vinyl coated to withstand more wear and 
tear. Some are in upholstery-weight fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabric weight and the intensity of the design determine how a print can be 
used, said Mendoza, who is a partner with interior designer Lois Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 To demonstrate, he unfurled a sample of "Cockatiel" ($52 per yard, 54 inches 
wide) a jewel-toned S. Harris print of birds against a background of palm 
fronds. When the fabric is gathered for draperies, the bird disappears, 
blending into the allover pattern. So Mendoza is using the fabric only on his 
client's dining room chairs. He's centering the birds on the chair backs. 
Because they are slightly curved, the birds will have a dimensional look, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A print of urns detailed with Griffins and fruit, named "Classic Urns" ($100 
per yard, 54 inches wide), could be used as drapes because the bold gray and 
black design by Decorator's Walk stands out so well on the cream background, he 
said. Mendoza plans to use the fabric in a 100-year-old adobe house in Mexico. 
As for "Cafe" ($50 per yard, 54 inches wide) on the wall, Mendoza smiles and 
shrugs, "It was just more creative that way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of covering a wall with fabric? More than wallpaper, but not that 
much more, Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 He gave as an example a wall that he covered in fabric for $300 that would 
have cost $200 to cover with quality wallpaper. "A designer look for an extra 
$100? The customer is going to go for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more than one way to put fabric on a wall, but usually the walls are 
padded or lined with a plain fabric first. 
</P>
<P>
 The print fabric panels then can be sewn together, attached at the ceiling and 
baseboards and stretched. Fabrics can be attached directly to drywall, but a 
wooden frame has to be fastened first to plaster and masonry walls. In either 
case, staples or nails have to be covered with welting or trim unless blind 
tacking -- a system for heavy fabrics in which the fasteners all hidden behind 
a fold of fabric -- is used. 
</P>
<P>
 Upholstering gives walls what designers call a "crown." In other words, the 
walls bulge in the middle, sort of like a pillow. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a design technique generally seen in more urban areas, such as New York 
and San Francisco, said Jason Titus, an Irvine-based designer who has 
upholstered several rooms in Orange County. One of his projects was a 
commercial office where a tapestry fabric created an Old World look while it 
helped cut down on modern freeway noise. 
</P>
<P>
 In residences, he's used upholstered walls to achieve a more elegant look with 
a damask that had a slight sheen. He's also upholstered walls with a 
contemporary stripe for a masculine, sporty look and with wool flannel for a 
home where the design theme was modeled after a man's suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Titus thinks of upholstered walls as a good traditional look for a large room 
with hardwood floors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The result is marvelous. The sound quality becomes slightly hushed, and it 
looks very expensive, which sometimes you want," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because upholstering walls is more expensive, Titus said he tends to use a 
basic fabric that the room can be built on. When he does use novelty prints on 
the walls, he said, he often has them paper-backed and hung like wallpaper 
because there's so much intricate design it's hard to tell if the room is 
upholstered or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Why use novelty prints? They are great conversation starters, for one, Mendoza 
said. And sometimes they inject personality into a design scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 For an avid hunter, Mendoza designed a room using a Schumacher print of wild 
animals. For a sewing room that had antiques in it, he did drapes and a settee 
in a novelty pattern that featured different kinds of chairs -- Victorian 
rockers, overstuffed armchairs and stately Queen Ann chairs. Cost-wise, novelty 
prints are generally mid-range, designers say. "Cafe" retails for about $50 a 
yard (54 inches wide). Schumacher's new novelty prints range from $42 per yard 
retail for "Garden Variety" (54 inches wide) to $106 for "Medieval Trees" (55 
inches wide). 
</P>
<P>
 Because the fabric is so wide, it doesn't take much yardage to do most walls, 
Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Novelty prints can be had for less at stores such as Calico Corners, a 
nationwide chain that sells home fabrics. At the Orange store, novelty prints 
in 54-inch widths ranged from $8.99 per yard for a collage of old-fashioned 
postcards in yellow with pastel blue, green, pink and lavender to $25 per yard 
for "Literary Guild," an upholstery-weight tapestry with a book theme. The 
store's best-selling novelty print has been "Ride 'Em Cowboy," a Western print 
of a cowboy breaking a bronc on a navy denim background ($14.99 per yard, 54 
inches wide). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The drawback to novelty prints? 
</P>
<P>
 "Depending on how novel it is, you will grow tired of it quicker than anything 
else," Titus warns. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they are real current, they tend to get uncurrent real fast," he said. If 
you love a print that might fall in this category, Titus recommends using it 
for sofa pillows rather than sofa covering: It's easier to change pillow covers 
every four or five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Titus said his favorite is a novelty print that came out a year ago. It's part 
of a series printed on linen, which gives it an Old World look. Sheets of 
music, tassels, urns and garlands are thrown together in the pattern. Titus 
used it for draperies in a den and pool room. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it falls into another category of novelty prints: the kind that are 
"so wonderful you love them forever."

INSIDE & OUT; A HELPING HAND; AFTER 11 YEARS, EXTERIOR PAINT IS MANY SHADES

<P>
 Q We'll be painting our stucco and wood trim this summer, and we want to paint 
it the same colors we did 11 years ago: creamy beige and yellow. Is it possible 
to get an exact color match for paint that old? 
</P>
<P>
 R.R., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Within reason, you should be able to find a good match, but there are some 
complications, says Harold Brobst of Hal's Paint & Decorating in Fullerton. 
What you think is creamy beige and yellow is really a number of different 
shades. Over time, the walls with the most exposure to the sun have faded into 
one shade; areas that don't get much sun are another color, and there are 
variations in between. Carefully go around your house and see which area you 
like best, then take a patch of it to a paint shop. Most good shops should be 
able to mix a paint for you that matches the shade you want. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q My old sliding glass door has a three-inch crack coming down from one 
corner. I don't want to replace it now, but I don't want the crack to go down 
any further. Is there anything I can put on it to keep it in place? 
</P>
<P>
 H.H., Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Your door must be very old, because tempered glass has been required in 
sliding doors for a long time, and tempered glass doesn't break that way, says 
John Silva of Martin Glass & Mirror in Costa Mesa. If you want to stop the 
crack, you can try using a glass drill bit, which is available at most hardware 
stores. Lubricate the area and drill a small hole in the glass at the end of 
the crack. This should stop it from progressing. For safety reasons, you should 
replace the door with one of tempered glass as soon as you can. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q I'm planning to replace my asphalt driveway soon, and I'd like to have the 
new one made of cement with a pattern of brick. I'm also considering having a 
driveway made entirely of brick. Is there a certain kind of brick that should 
be used for driveways? 
</P>
<P>
 S.Y., Buena Park 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A You can use any kind of brick, as long as it's mortared in correctly, says 
Pete Gorman of Rancho Lumber in Westminster. You'll need to put mortar under 
and around the brick. If you just use a common sand underlayment, the weight of 
your cars will drive some areas deeper into the ground, and the job will be 
uneven. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q We have two toilets in our 21-year-old house, and in both the ball cock 
flushing mechanisms are failing to work properly. Should I go with one of those 
new plastic mechanisms or with the old-fashioned copper style? 
</P>
<P>
 S.B., Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Your selection will depend on the type of toilets you have, says Rod 
Albright of Albright Plumbing & Heating Supply in Los Alamitos. With the 
"low-boy" style, which doesn't have a separate tank, you may have to go with an 
original equipment ball cock mechanism, or have the old one repaired. If you 
have a two-piece toilet with a separate tank, you can use the plastic system. 
The better plastic ball cocks are a big improvement over the metal ones. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q A friend is moving and is giving us his old, heavy chandelier. We have a 
perfect place to hang it, but we're worried about it swinging during an 
earthquake and crashing down. Is there a way to secure it so it won't swing? 
</P>
<P>
 F.K., Laguna Niguel 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A As long as it's properly installed, there's little danger of it falling, 
says Tom Becker of Harbor Lites in Costa Mesa. The electrical box needs to be 
firmly secured to one of the ceiling joists; otherwise it can break free. If 
you have any doubts about whether you can do the job correctly, let a 
professional handle it.

 Anything old really is new again, according to Cathy Farrell of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the idea behind the lamps she creates using old watering cans, teapots 
or nearly any archaic object for the bases and topping them with cool, custom 
shades. 
</P>

 Farrell and her daughter, Jeannie Clayton, co-owners of Vintage Rose in 
Westminster, have a knack for taking ornaments from the past -- such as arbors, 
farmhouse cupboards, birdbaths, bistro sets and window boxes -- and restoring 
and rejuvenating them. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Farrell and Clayton, a former retailer, customize new pieces to 
give them an old look, which can add one-of-a-kind charm to any room with an 
antique or country feel to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell, an expert at needlework and a pillow designer for 13 years, keeps an 
eye out for one-of-a-kind treasures to use for her lamps, which sell for $200 
to $300. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you have a family heirloom or cherished possession you'd like to make 
into a lamp, she will electrify it for $50. Shades are extra.

 French, English, contemporary or rustic? 
</P>
<P>
 If you're not sure which country look you prefer, or how to get started 
decorating a room in the style you like, then "Make Mine Country," a videotape 
offering easy and affordable ideas, could help you decide. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotape, narrated by Ann Doby and Palie Wehman, was a way for the two 
craft and decorating experts to illustrate the tips and secrets they've been 
telling friends and neighbors over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the videotape, Doby and Wehman walk viewers through one room decorated 
three times -- each on a small budget -- in rustic, contemporary and European 
styles, using the same main pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 The "country charm" in each room comes from collectibles, such as toys, 
dishes, family photos and quilts found in an attic or basement or from flea 
markets, garage sales and auctions. The videotape, which runs about an hour, 
also offers tips on how to acquire finds at sales, with footage from an 
auction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make Mine Country" costs $19.95 plus $3 for shipping and handling and can be 
ordered by phone from (800) 738-3344 or by mail at V.J. Pea Inc., Box 7135, 
McLean, VA 22106. Not Ordinary Hardware 
</P>
<P>
 Unique pieces of hardware -- from antique reproduction doorknobs to hand tools 
of Japan -- set this hardware store apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Restoration Hardware, which opened this week in the Atrium Court of Fashion 
Island Newport Beach, stocks, among other things, arched house plaques, copper 
mailboxes, French bread saws, 1920s table fans, torchier lamps and terry cloth 
shower curtains. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first venture into Southern California for founder and president 
Stephen Gordon, who has three stores in Northern California. He came up with 
the idea for the specialty stores when he started restoring a Victorian mansion 
14 years ago in Eureka. Because he couldn't find everything he needed, he 
started searching for authentic pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, his stores evolved into today's eclectic mix of furnishings and 
gadgets.

DECORATING; SIMPLE FLEXIBILITY SUITS COTTAGE RETREATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With summer around the corner, thoughts turn to cottages at the beach or in 
the mountains. Whether it's for a summer stay or year-round retreat, cottage 
decor should be simple and flexible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike a larger house, a cottage doesn't offer the luxury of assigning a 
single function to each room or of turning over part of a room to mere 
decoration," Mary Emmerling says. "The kitchen is where everybody gathers for 
meals, as well as to chat, and there is no separate family room and living 
room." 
</P>
<P>
 The editor of Mary Emmerling's Country magazine and author of "Mary 
Emmerling's American Country Cottages" (Clarkson Potter, $25) has used her 
expertise to decorate cottages for herself in Florida and on New York's Long 
Island. She says simple solutions are usually best. 
</P>
<P>
 Plain white walls and trim are clean and provide a good backdrop for a mix of 
unpretentious furnishings. Blend just enough tint to the paint to give walls a 
slight blush. If there are hardwood floors, let them be, refinishing if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 When faced with what she calls "linoleum from outer space," Emmerling usually 
paints the kitchen floor a solid color, adds a stenciled pattern such as a 
checkerboard and tops it with a polyurethane coating. 
</P>
<P>
 Slipcovers help unify unmatched sofas and chairs. For summer, washable fabrics 
such as cotton duck, pillow ticking and white denim work best. A good choice 
for winter is classic tartan or paisley. 
</P>
<P>
 When choosing a decorating theme, go for the familiar because it's 
comfortable. It may not be original, but it always works. To make it personal, 
make a major statement with quantity or concentrate on details. Emmerling does 
both. Instead of one starfish, she might gather 10 or more in a mix of mediums. 
She fills the glass bases of kerosene lamps with shells rather than oil. She 
hangs straw hats on the wall, with a string of shells as a hat band. 
</P>
<P>
 As a decorating editor, Emmerling has visited quite a few cottages around the 
country: cottages on stilts in Florida wetlands, rustic cabins in Maine and the 
Adirondacks, bungalows in California. Once inside, a few themes prevail without 
regard for geography. 
</P>
<P>
 * The English Cotswold cottage is one popular look. Some decorating choices 
include floral slipcovers, stripped pine furniture, botanical prints and 
paisley throws. 
</P>
<P>
 * The French provincial cottage feeling is conveyed with chairs with rush 
seats, a medium blue and mustard yellow color scheme, printed fabrics from the 
south of France and French faience china. 
</P>
<P>
 * A cabin atmosphere might come from twig furniture, checked fabrics, Native 
American motif on textiles, fish decoys and old National Geographic magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the usual sources for furniture and accessories, Emmerling advocates 
flea markets and yard sales. She picked up tips from the cottage dwellers 
featured in her book. One cottager chose to disguise a threadbare sofa first 
with a mover's quilt, a fairly standard practice, then tucking a few small 
patchwork quilts into place on top. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmerling's personal favorite is the beach cottage. Several years ago, she 
bought and began renovating four modest beach cottages in Sagaponack, N.Y. The 
remodeling gave her a chance to re-create the summer rentals of her childhood 
at the beach in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tiny one-floor buildings perched on concrete blocks were like wading 
birds in a sea of grass," Emmerling says. "With their chimneys, shingle siding 
and makeshift porches, they looked like old friends gathered for a reunion." 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings are linked by a picket fence, and the garden that surrounds 
them. Otherwise each stands on its own. The largest contains the kitchen, 
living room and a guest bedroom. The three smaller cottages have been converted 
into bedrooms. Emmerling has one, and the other two are for her children, ages 
17 and 20. When the kids aren't around, the cottages become guest houses, a 
nice arrangement. Separate quarters also come in handy when the family is in 
residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It works great," Emmerling says. "My son likes to play Aerosmith a lot."

WILDLIFE; IT'S RED, IT BOBS AND IT'S ACTUALLY A THRUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From coast to coast, from south of Texas all the way to Alaska, the lovely 
robin raises nestlings on our windowsills and pulls earthworms in the spray of 
our lawn sprinklers. In spring, its song wakes us at dawn and sings us to sleep 
at dusk. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know, however, that robins are really misnamed thrushes? 
</P>
<P>
 Long ago, homesick immigrants, noting the bird's resemblance to the European 
robin red breast, adopted the name as a reminder of home. Whatever people wish 
to call them, American robins definitely look and act like thrushes. They have 
robust breasts and stout, pointed beaks. They run and forage mainly on the 
ground, lay blue eggs in nests, have spotted young and sing beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
 Few people know what robins really eat. Earthworms, actually a tiny portion of 
their diet, are taken mainly while the ground is damp and there are insatiable 
nestlings begging for soft, easily digested protein. 
</P>
<P>
 In the southeastern part of the country, robins feast on chinaberries and 
occasionally consume fallen, fermented fruit until they are quite drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one astonished homeowner has gazed onto the front lawn and seen 
inebriated robins staggering away from the chinaberry bush, unable to fly in a 
straight line. 
</P>
<P>
 Another surprising robin food is the white berry of poison ivy. Although the 
oils of this plant cause severe skin reactions in humans, they apparently have 
no effect on robins, who snap them from their stems and toss them down as 
eagerly as we would enjoy ripe strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
 Robins are not above sneaking into orchards to pilfer fruits destined for 
supermarkets and dinner tables. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to grapes, they will peck figs, pears, apples and blackberries. 
</P>
<P>
 Most robins content themselves with an ordinary lifestyle and a familiar 
back-yard behavior. Here are a few facts that will help you better understand 
and enjoy robins: 
</P>
<P>
 * Males, which have noticeably redder breasts and blacker heads than females, 
return to their breeding territories from mid-February to late April, depending 
on latitude. The spring migration follows an average daily temperature of 37 
degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two-year-old and older males usually reclaim the exact territories (about 
half an acre) in which they previously raised broods. Young males return to the 
neighborhoods in which they were raised and try to find unoccupied sites, which 
are usually poorer quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Some first-timers claim vacancies created by males, perhaps their fathers, 
that did not survive the rigors of winter. 
</P>
<P>
 * The exuberant, boisterous, cheery robin songs are not so much love songs to 
females as threats and warnings to other male robins: "Keep off my turf!" 
</P>
<P>
 * A male will court any hen in his territory by displaying his finery. Because 
an unattached hen is not yet tied to a territory, she can roam freely from one 
area to another, pulling a suitor along as if he were on a string. As soon as 
the suitor enters another males's territory, however, the fight is on. The 
fluttering battles one sees in early spring are the result of these territorial 
romances. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eventually, each hen will choose a mate, often the same one from the 
previous year, and the pair will start house hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although males lead hens to possible nesting sites and help deliver building 
materials, the female makes the choice and constructs the nest. 
</P>
<P>
 Nest sites can be anything from sturdy limbs five to 30 feet up a tree to 
fence posts, street lamps, stoplights, rain gutters or rock ledges. 
Construction time varies from one to six days.

TRENDS; CELESTIAL SEASONINGS; RIGHT NOW, WE WANT THE MOON AND STARS TO DECORATE 
OUR HOMES -- BUT WHAT'S ON HORIZON? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About the time a home furnishings trend shows up on a bathmat, it's washed up. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is with heavenly objects. Not that you'd know it by scanning the stores 
and catalogues: Suns, moons and stars still fill the shelves and cover multiple 
pages. But such is the nature of these trends -- just when they're everywhere, 
they're goners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is post-peak," pronounces Raymond Berger, vice president of 
Plummer-McCutcheon, which gave two entire pages to the celestial theme in its 
most recent catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 During the decorating-down years (on average, people replace furniture only 1 
1/2 times during their lifetimes, designer Vladimir Kagan says), we freshen our 
nests with small decorative items. They are to furniture what accessories are 
to fashion -- affordably priced additions that stretch the life span of the 
major, expensive pieces. And they're the fuel that fires yard sales of the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Where a furniture style can take five to 10 years to max out, a decorating 
theme might come and go in a matter of months. With two years on the scene, 
celestial items have had a long run. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no consensus on its exact flash point, but early signs of the 
celestial look include a snow globe at a German gift fair, a cotton throw at a 
New York gift show and needlepoint pillows at a craft fair. Within a few months 
of those isolated sightings in 1992, the sun, moon and stars motif began 
appearing on everything from clocks, dishes, candles, linens, napkin rings and 
watering cans to shower curtains. As prices go, the merchandise leans toward 
the low end. 
</P>
<P>
 If the celestial theme came out of the blue, the reasons for its popularity 
are equally obscure. The brilliant yellow and orange graphics on a dark blue 
background hardly enhance the favored furniture styles of the day, such as 
Mission, nor do they complement the reigning palette of faded colors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps it has a sense of mysticism, or escape," Berger suggests. "When it 
was at its peak, we were in a recession." 
</P>
<P>
 Mystical iconography had another brief fling last winter when angels sprouted 
wings and took off, seemingly overnight. They rated a Time magazine cover 
before degenerating into swap-meet fodder. Now, though, angels appear to be 
getting a second life. Moons, stars and suns in pastels are being mixed with 
angels for some fairly rococo combos. American country is moving toward fussy 
Victorian style, and cherubs and moons fit right in with the lacy furbelows. 
</P>
<P>
 Design trends have traditionally trickled down from such high-end sources as a 
furniture style, a designer's line or even a museum show, but these days they 
often start, as the celestial theme did, at the mass-market level. 
</P>
<P>
 "The middle level is where all the action is," says color consultant Leatrice 
Eiseman of the Eiseman Center in Seattle. "We have a three-tier system of price 
levels. There is the high end, or designer realm, the middle ground and then 
the low end, discount-price level. Now that it is trendy and permissible to 
talk about saving money and shopping at Price Club and Target, there is a lot 
more attention being paid to the middle level. The mass market is getting more 
attention, and new things are being introduced at this level." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sunflowers were another graphic phenomenon that bloomed midfield, as part of 
the American country look of several years ago. Cows and gingham also figured 
into the farm scene, but sunflowers ultimately struck out on their own to 
bedeck rugs, teapots, vases, linens, coffee mugs and candlesticks. Some are 
designed to look like folk art, others are done in dark, muted colors to 
complement Mission-style furniture, and still others are as garishly bright and 
sickeningly sweet as daisies and happy faces -- two overused devices from 
decades past. The sunflowers are also starting to fade. 
</P>
<P>
 Chili peppers, ivy and fruit have also been popular in the middle-price range 
but will probably have disappeared by this time next year. 
</P>
<P>
 On an ascent are African-inspired items. Such fabrics as kente cloth have 
caught on in the textile and fashion markets and fueled a growing selection of 
African-like prints on linens and dinnerware. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think African-themed items will be a fairly important classification," says 
Mary Morris, vice president of Ross-Simons, publishers of the home-wares 
catalogue Anticipations. Society seems to be moving toward a greater 
appreciation of ethnic influences, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinsons-May stores are already stocking dishes and table linens modeled on 
African mud-cloth designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the rise is a home-wares trend influenced by a furniture style 
referred to variously as Bloomsbury chic, palace trash, neo-ancestral and 
shabby chic. About two years ago, the severely trendy began collecting old 
chairs with moth-eaten, worn, velvet upholstery and displaying them just like 
that -- decrepitly shabby. The idea was to have furniture look as if it had 
been in the family for generations -- as in old family, old money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The decorative bits accompanying this theme are intentionally mismatched, worn 
and patched. The plates are different from the soup bowls, the mirrors need 
re-silvering, and the sofa cushions are upholstered in one fabric, the back and 
arms in another. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, furniture manufacturers are reproducing the look. "It's in the 
$1,000-sofa range now," Berger says. "I've seen slipcovers with incredibly 
creative mixes of fabrics. One piece of upholstery may have six fabrics on it." 
</P>
<P>
 The shelves of American Rag Maison et Cafe on South La Brea Avenue in Los 
Angeles are stocked with like-minded items. "We are going for a mixture of 
things, rather than one look. Stripes and patterns on pillows. We mix two 
different types of plates -- things from cafes and things from flea markets," 
owner Margot Werts says. 
</P>
<P>
 At stores with more moderately priced merchandise, wine glasses with 
mismatched stems come as a set and pillows have a mix of patterns. The Pottery 
Barn, for one, offers a sofa upholstered in ticking stripes combined with faded 
cabbage roses.

GARDENING; GET THE MOST OUT OF AIR'S NITROGEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE REICH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fertilizer is on every gardener's list of things to pick up at thestore this 
time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, nitrogen is the fertilizer nutrient generally needed most -- yet 
the air contains about 80% nitrogen, 35,000 tons over every acre. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the nitrogen in air is not in a form usable by most 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Legumes are plants that can use the nitrogen from the air. Peas, beans and 
lupines are garden legumes, while out in fields and lawns you will find clovers 
and vetches. Honeylocust and blacklocust are trees that are legumes. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to use atmospheric nitrogen, legumes must be infected with special 
strains of bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 You can make sure that your peas and beans are infected with the right 
bacteria by buying a legume inoculum when you buy your pea and bean seeds. 
</P>
<P>
 You apply this black powder (the bacteria are mixed in dry peat) either by 
shaking it with moistened seeds before sowing, or by dusting it directly over 
seeds in the furrow. 
</P>
<P>
 As soil moisture stirs seeds out of dormancy, it also awakens the bacteria, 
which then proceed to infect newly emerging legume roots. 
</P>
<P>
 The roots respond by forming nodules, which are obvious to the naked eye on 
roots of plants dug up in midsummer. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the nodules, bacteria convert gaseous nitrogen from the air into 
soluble nitrogen, which is pumped up into the plant. In return, the host plant 
gives up a portion of its energy-yielding carbohydrates to the bacteria. The 
relationship is symbiotic -- beneficial to both the host plant and the 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 In one study with soybeans, inoculated plants yielded 67% more beans than did 
uninoculated plants. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some specificity between the strain of bacteria and kind of legume, 
although for vegetable gardens, a combined pea and bean inoculum is what is 
commonly sold. 
</P>
<P>
 A different strain would be needed for soybeans or for clover, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Soil inoculated with appropriate bacteria rarely needs reinoculation. 
Inoculation is needed for new gardens, or soils in which peas or beans have not 
been grown for many years, and in soils subject to heavy chemical use (either 
fertilizer or pesticides). 
</P>
<P>
 All parts of legume plants are rich in nitrogen. As an infected plant ages, 
old nodules and roots slough off and add nitrogen to the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plants' leaves and stems are dug into the soil after the plants mature, 
the soil is further enriched. 
</P>
<P>
 In traditional agriculture, legumes are used to supply nitrogen for succeeding 
crops. Modern agriculturists are attempting to utilize this symbiosis by 
growing corn and soybeans elbow in the same field. 
</P>
<P>
 To capitalize on free nitrogen from legumes on a back-yard scale, limit your 
use of nitrogen fertilizer on these plants. Too much nitrogen fertilizer is 
wasteful because it suppresses the bacterial symbiosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Check the roots of a few plants in midsummer to see if they are 
well-nodulated. If they are not, either the plants need inoculation, or you 
have overfertilized with nitrogen. 
</P>
<P>
 In your lawn, make use of this symbiosis by allowing or by sowing some clover 
with the grass. Under ideal conditions, clover has supplied up to 100 pounds 
per acre of nitrogen to grass in a pasture. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the clover supplies only a quarter of that amount (which may be more 
realistic for a lawn), this is equivalent to spreading the nitrogen equivalent 
of more than 5 pounds of 10-10-10 fertilizer per thousand square feet of lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 In your vegetable garden, maximize use of "free" nitrogen by inoculating 
legumes and using them as part of a crop rotation. If your garden is large 
enough, set aside a portion of the area each season just for this purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual amount of nitrogen added to the soil will depend on the plant and 
the environmental conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 On the average, a legume might add about one-quarter of a pound of nitrogen 
per hundred square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 This is equivalent to almost three pounds of 10-10-10 fertilizer, which is a 
typical recommendation for fertilizer nitrogen for a vegetable garden.

INTERIORS; WALLPAPER BORDERS MAKE A FINE LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wall-covering borders can affect the mood of a room. 
</P>
<P>
 A border near the ceiling can make a room feel cozier. Installed at chair-rail 
height, it makes a room feel loftier. A border can also add interest to a plain 
room, particularly a child's room. It can fill a narrow space between cabinet 
tops and ceiling, or frame windows and doors. 
</P>
<P>
 As with any wall covering, first take samples home so that you can check them 
with your decor and lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 To hang a border, you will need a compass with pencil to draw guidelines, a 
wallpaper brush for smoothing, a utility knife, a seam roller, a sponge, a 
carpenter's level, a straightedge and a paste brush or, if the border is 
pre-pasted, a water tray or a thick paint roller. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you begin, establish both where you will start and finish hanging the 
border. Decide how you will handle potentially awkward areas such as corners 
and around windows and doors 
</P>
<P>
 Prepare painted walls by sanding them with fine sandpaper. Then wash away the 
dust and apply a coat of wall-covering primer. On covered walls, coat the area 
that will accept the border with wall-covering primer. 
</P>
<P>
 Apply a border over new wall covering only after it has dried for 48 hours. 
However, if you allow for the border while planning the wall covering layout, 
you then cut each wall-covering strip to allow the border to be inset above or 
within it. The method yields smoother seams, but it also can require more time 
and skill. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders are usually sold in five-yard rolls. Cut pieces the length of each 
wall, plus one-fourth inch to wrap into the corners. 
</P>
<P>
 At the ceiling, mark the width of the border around the room by using a 
compass and pencil. If the ceiling is irregular, use a level to determine a 
straight line and trim the excess from the top of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 For chair-rail height, mark a guideline around the room 30 inches from the 
floor. Use a level or straightedge to keep the line even. Install the border so 
that the lower edge falls on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 If the border will frame a window or door, it is best to select a random 
pattern. This will prevent having a directional pattern going sideways or 
upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 If the border is pre-pasted, re-roll it with pattern facing in and submerge it 
in a water tray for about 10 seconds. Or unfurl the strip on a table and wet 
the back with a water-saturated paint roller. 
</P>
<P>
 For a border without paste, use only an adhesive recommended by the border 
manufacturer. Place the border, with pattern facing down, on a table. Keep 
extra adhesive off the work surface (where it could damage the border); spread 
the adhesive by working out from the center of the strip toward the surface 
edge. Make sure to paste all edges completely. 
</P>
<P>
 When the border is wet or pasted, fold it loosely, accordion-style, so that 
the pasted surfaces touch each other. Be careful not to crease the folds. 
</P>
<P>
 Have someone help you hang the border sections. Push the border in place with 
your fingers. Smooth out air bubbles with the wallpaper brush. 
</P>
<P>
 To butt a seam, first overlap the ends. Cut through both layers with a sharp 
utility knife along a straightedge. Remove the wet pieces. Smooth the ends in 
place with a sponge. Wait 15 minutes, then roll the seam smooth with a seam 
roller. 
</P>
<P>
 To join borders that form a frame, make a miter cut. Overlap both pieces and 
cut through them at a 45-degree angle. Remove both waste pieces. Use a sponge 
to smooth the ends. After 15 minutes roll the seam smooth.

DO-IT-YOURSELF; MEET THE NEW FACE ON THE BUTCHER BLOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A popular feature in many kitchens is a solid-wood butcher block cutting 
surface -- usually 1 1/2-inch thick hardwood strips laminated together to form 
countertop inserts or dedicated cutting tables. 
</P>
<P>
 If you use your butcher block surface for cutting and not purely for 
decorative use, you've noticed that the wood gets scarred, dirty and stained. 
You can give new life to this surface with a lot less work than you might 
imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step involves scraping the surface using a hook scraper (also called 
a wood or paint and varnish scraper). 
</P>
<P>
 This will remove dirt and any old finish remaining on the butcher block. This 
type of scraper works much faster than sandpaper, which tends to clog until 
bare wood is exposed. For best results, use a scraper with a new, sharp blade. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold the scraper firmly, with the blade perpendicular to the wood. Press down 
as you pull the scraper toward you in a long, controlled motion. Always scrape 
with the grain and lift the blade on the return stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 After you've scraped the entire surface, go back and work on any dark areas 
and deep knife cuts. To avoid excessive hollowing, scrape the area around the 
affected spot as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanding is the next step. An orbital palm sander, especially one with a dust 
collection bag, is your best sanding tool because it's lightweight and easy to 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also use sandpaper and a sanding block -- it'll simply take longer and 
be more work. 
</P>
<P>
 Begin sanding with 80-grit paper, changing the paper often, especially if it 
clogs. To prevent marring the adjacent countertop surface and backsplash, use a 
sanding block near all edges. 
</P>
<P>
 When most of the dark areas and cuts are gone, switch to a 120-grit paper and 
finish the job. Always sand with the grain. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll find that some of the surface blemishes sand out easily, while others, 
such as deep knife marks that remain after scraping, take time to feather out. 
As you sand, vacuum the dirt and grit so you can see the true condition of the 
wood. 
</P>
<P>
 You can brighten the whole surface by using a 1-to-1 solution of household 
bleach and water. For any remaining stained areas, use the bleach full 
strength, working it into the wood with a toothbrush. Bear in mind that it may 
be impossible to get out all the dark areas. 
</P>
<P>
 When you're finished, wipe the surface with a rag soaked in white vinegar to 
neutralize the bleach. Wash the area with dish soap and water, let dry and then 
give the surface a final sanding with 120-grit paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Mineral oil is a good, nontoxic finish for the surface that will offer some 
moisture protection. 
</P>
<P>
 To apply, set the bottle in hot water for 10 or 15 minutes to thin the oil. 
Then, use a clean, dry rag to wipe on as many coats as the wood will absorb.

ARCHITECTURE; LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR A HOME THAT WILL SERVE AS HIS CASTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA DREYFUSS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Past the outer defensework and the dungeon, under the dark oak beams of the 
center hallway, John Miller was explaining where things are and will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be double doors here that will lead into the great hall, with a 
large stone fireplace on the north wall," Miller said. "Off the great hall in 
the northwest tower is a chapel." 
</P>
<P>
 In the woods and pastures of this genteel, fox-hunt country suburb of 
Washington, D.C., Miller is building his own castle. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls it Bull Run Castle, because the north fork of historic Bull Run 
stream winds through his property and the Bull Run mountains are within sight. 
</P>
<P>
 He's building it virtually by himself, brick by brick, concrete block by 
block. And if some parts, including the west wing where the chapel will be, are 
yet to be completed, this is not to doubt his dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's dream keeps him going while he bargains and scrounges for materials, 
measures and cuts, hooks up wiring and lays down floors. 
</P>
<P>
 His goal is a redoubt capable of standing off an infantry assault from any 
quarter, where defenders behind interior firing ports could pick off any 
invaders foolhardy enough to breach the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also be a comfortable bed-and-breakfast. Visitors could sip their 
morning tea or coffee in a sunny nook, ride horses on his estate, amble around 
an as-yet unplanted formal garden and perhaps visit the Walt Disney Co. theme 
park that may be constructed less than four miles down the road. He expects his 
castle eventually to pay its own way. 
</P>
<P>
 The onetime carpenter from Reading, Pa., now owns 13 acres. "I have to pinch 
myself. The title says it's mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a rare hired hand and some help from his family, the hard labor 
also is all his. But Miller is no stranger to that. Drafted into the Army in 
1951, he came up through the ranks to command construction companies and retire 
as a captain in the Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, his wife and three children started on his castle in 1986 after he 
retired. For a couple of years, until they built a 12- by 20-foot cabin, they 
spent weekends in a tent, commuting from their home near Fort Belvoir, Va., 
about 50 miles away. The cabin sheltered them until the castle was far enough 
along for them to move into. 
</P>
<P>
 The castle Miller has designed is an extension of the man -- an individual 
vision, a kind of folk art in building and architecture. "I think I'm 
artistic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But his artistry is not bound by convention. "I've never cluttered my head up 
with any college garbage, so I have no limitations," he said. "I just do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Being his own architect lets him innovate. His expansive basement shop, made 
of a single pour of concrete reinforced with steel, doubles as a bomb shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dulles International Airport is eight miles away, he notes: "Should Dulles get 
nuked, this can accept the impact load of the castle on top of it without 
losing its integrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Because it's his castle, Miller also makes sure he has his luxuries. Above the 
center hall is a ceiling of skylights that bathe the interior in sun. Jutting 
from the basement will be a 90-foot escape tunnel, through which cool air will 
be drawn to naturally air condition his home. 
</P>
<P>
 His castle will be thoroughly modern. "If the lord of the castle in the 13th 
Century could have had a refrigerator, a gas stove and a bathroom, he would 
have done it," Miller said. "I'm having it." 
</P>
<P>
 Why he wants a castle, Miller refuses to say. But he does tell briefly of a 
time while he was still in the Army, when he visited a count in the Netherlands 
and experienced a castle's day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, he shot pigeons with the game master. In the afternoon, he had 
sherry. At 8:30 in the evening, he dined at a 12-foot mahogany table 
illuminated by four silver candelabra, each with 16 candlesticks, while 
conversing with the count. 
</P>
<P>
 The American officer had entered a life that a former construction worker 
could hardly dream of. 
</P>
<P>
 He is now creating it, on his own terms. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's the lord of the castle? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," said Miller. "I guess I am."

FURNISHINGS; HISTORY'S BEEN PUTTING UP WITH FOOTSTOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON GASBARRO, 1994, Ron Gasbarro. Distributed by the Los Angeles Times 
Syndicate.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's evening. Dan Rather is on the tube, droning out the day's events. The 
daily paper surrounds you. With your feet up, you are relaxed, content after a 
vicious eight hours on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a voice smashes your peace: Get your feet off the coffee table! 
</P>
<P>
 You curse the modern decor with its glass barricades and sleek nothingness. 
Where does one put one's feet these days? On the dog's back? 
</P>
<P>
 A footstool, hassock, ottoman -- whatever they are called -- you need one! 
</P>
<P>
 You never saw Ozzie Nelson or Ward Cleaver without one back in the '50s. With 
legs stretched out, a feeling of approachable authority was imparted -- 
allowances were doled out, report cards signed, dating problems solved. 
</P>
<P>
 Footstools became trendy back in both Ancient Greece and the Byzantine Empire, 
when stools of many shapes and sizes were constructed to match the throne of a 
king or self-important local magistrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually made of bronze or iron and inlaid with African ivory, they could be 
folded up and carried by a servant or thrown into the back of a chariot to be 
transported to that afternoon's gladiator event. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 17th Century, the footstool concept had trickled down to the common 
everyday rich folk in the form of a "gout stool." Then, gout was considered a 
rich man's ailment. The gout stool was a means of elevating throbbing feet for 
relief and protection. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the questionable class assignments that determined who should and 
should not own a footstool, the times themselves dictated the need. Early 
Shaker settlers and Pilgrims used them because they kept their feet off cold, 
drafty floors and closer to toasty fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it was during this early Colonial period when the three-legged 
footstool evolved. Three legs balanced better than four on uneven floors of 
cobble, rough brick or earth. Eventually, these stools found their way into 
barns because they were easy to get under milking cows. 
</P>
<P>
 As furniture became more sophisticated, so did the footstool. With intricately 
designed wood inlays and embroidery and elegant brocades, they are the treasure 
of the most fortunate and persevering of those who frequent flea markets and 
antique shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are even luckier. 
</P>
<P>
 "My grandmother left me two beautiful footstools when she died," says Tom 
Myers of Baltimore. "One is hand-embroidered with a floral theme; the other has 
a wood top inlaid with silver. To me, they are priceless possessions." 
</P>
<P>
 The terms footstool, ottoman and hassock are often used interchangeably, but 
there is a basic distinction.  
</P>
<P>
 * A footstool is the most stripped-down version and is generally made of the 
softer woods, like apple, pear or sycamore.  
</P>
<P>
 * An ottoman can be part of a sectional couch and is rather large, having been 
developed at a time when the daybed was popular. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hassocks are footstools used to store things, and for this reason are more 
boxlike, with either no legs or very short legs or wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hassock is the perfect ploy for fast tidying," says Tom Kiefer of Tampa. 
"(If) I know someone is going to drop by, it's a great place to hide magazines, 
clothing and even small animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Because footstools are going to house your junk and hold your feet, they'd 
better be sturdily made. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bauhaus ottoman from Canada is 26 inches square and 15 inches high and 
comes in a variety of fabrics and colors. There is a 100% nylon version that 
gives superior wear with a high degree of shape retention. Or you can select a 
90% cotton, 10% polyester covering that has a better look than nylon and is 
resistant to wrinkles and sunlight. It retails for about $180. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bernhardt ottoman, from North Carolina where much American furniture is 
made, is larger than the Bauhaus at 32 inches square. It is covered with 100% 
Herculon, a tough fabric, and is on wheels for movability. The Bernhardt costs 
less than $300 and features a removable top cushion for cleaning and can be 
used with a couch to form a chaise. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Bauhaus and the Bernhardt have spring construction within their bases 
and paddings made of polyurethane and Dacron. Their interior frames are 
fashioned from kiln-dried wood to thwart splitting and warping. All joints are 
doubled-doweled, glued, screwed and corner-blocked for maximum strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy construction is essential for ottomans so that they can withstand the 
use and abuse of children who use them to watch TV and adults who grab them for 
stepladders. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate ottoman, however, is part of a reclining chair set designed by an 
orthopedic surgeon from Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the Stressles chair and ottoman, it is heralded as one of the world's 
most comfortable chairs because it gives the back and legs more natural 
support. But with an $800 price tag, you may opt to put your feet back up on 
the coffee table and hope no one yells at you.

 INDY INSIGHT: The odds are certainly against Northridge's Mike Groff for 
Sunday's Indy 500. To be exact, his chances of winning are 15 to 1, according 
to Harrah's in Reno. He's in the last row, and that's not a good place to 
start. . . . But that doesn't deter his backers. "Anyone can win it," said Jim 
Prescott, manager of Groff's racing team. "Mike has a good car and a good 
engine, and we're going to try." 
</P>
<P>
 QUAKE CHANGE: It wasn't as bad as they thought. Caltech has put out the word 
that Wednesday's early morning aftershock, originally thought to be 4.5 
magnitude, was actually only a 4.2. Says Caltech: "We've had the time to 
consider more data." . . . Well, that's all fine and dandy, but they also tell 
us to expect one 4.0 or larger about once a month. 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD TEACHER: Teaching at a community college is a tough job, so those who do 
it should gladly accept the credit for it. And that includes Pierce College's 
Patricia Gammage Siever (above), who was given an annual Excellence Award this 
week by the University of Texas. . . . "The community college faculty are the 
true teachers of excellence," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 HATE STUDY: Glendale is going after hate crime. Two weeks ago, vandals painted 
swastikas and "Asian-looking" characters on the walls of the Armenian-American 
Boy and Girl Scouts Club building, and now the city will appoint a committee to 
study the problem (B3). . . . Councilman Larry Zarian says the action doesn't 
mean the city is racist, but that "there are some racists and bigots among us." 
</P>
<P>
 CIVILITY: The new law against denying women access to abortion clinics may 
actually be a good thing if it promotes "Christian civility," says Richard J. 
Mouw of the Fuller Seminary in Pasadena. The most ardent, he says, also can be 
the most obnoxious (B15). . . . Recently, Pastor Jack Hayford of the Church on 
the Way in Van Nuys complained about the "self-righteous salvos" among 
Christians today. Michael Arkush

 CLOSING BY DESIGN: If you haven't seen the dream house of Orange County 
interior designers, your last chance is today or Sunday. The 8,000-square-foot 
House of Design, in Anaheim's Peralta Hills, displays the talents of about 20 
local interior designers. The $17 for your tour is a charitable donation, for 
the Orange County Philharmonic Society. . . . More than 6,000 people have 
toured since it opened April 30. You can reach it only by shuttle bus. Parking 
details are at (714) 840-7542.

 FOR JOSE: Jose Aguirre had many dreams: become a pro boxer, get a college 
degree, and help stop gang violence in his Anaheim neighborhood. Solevar, a 
Latino solidarity group, had even secured $10,000 in state grants for his 
education. But the 19-year-old Golden Gloves competitor was killed in a 
drive-by shooting last month. . . . Now Solevar plans to raise scholarship 
funds for others in his name. First step: a carwash today at the St. Boniface 
Church in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 NETWORKING: Folks at the Volunteer Center of Greater Orange County are always 
trying to get others involved in community projects. Now, its executive 
director, Carol Stone, has carried her message about as far as she can -- to 
Moscow. . . . She's there for three weeks, to help put together a volunteer 
management workbook for the Russian government. She and a colleague are staying 
at the Russian Charity House, which assists the disabled in Moscow.

<P>
 CYCLING COUNSELOR: When Ken Francis, 31, bicycled cross-country in the 
mid-'80s, he says he met so many people with sad stories it propelled his 
desire to become a counselor. Now Francis, a counselor at Garden Grove and Los 
Alamitos high schools for the nonprofit social services group Straight Talk, is 
on the road again. . . . He left Friday to travel the country again by bicycle, 
this time as a fund-raiser to help Straight Talk's tight budget. He expects to 
raise about $60,000 through sponsors of his trip.

DOROTHY H. DAVIS; PILOT IN WW II 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dorothy H. Davis, one of the first women to fly military combat aircraft 
overseas during World War II, has died at age 77 in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said the veteran of the Women Air Force Service Pilots had suffered 
from Parkinson's disease and cancer.She died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Davis was among about 1,000 who earned wings to fly with WASP, a special 
unit activated to allow more men to fly in combat. WASPs flew trackings and 
searchlight missions, towed targets for male pilots and ferried planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Davis, a retired Veterans Administration official, was born in Illinois, 
reared in North Carolina and moved to San Francisco after her tour of duty, 
which lasted from 1942 to 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the first," Miss Davis recalled in a 1993 interview, commenting on 
reports that the Air Force was poised to train American women to fly military 
combat aircraft. "We were flying combat planes and just about every other plane 
they had back then." 
</P>
<P>
 The WASPs were disbanded as World War II wound down, but the nation refused to 
recognize them as veterans for the purpose of disability and other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s, Miss Davis led a successful campaign to have the government 
recognize WASP fliers as military service veterans.

GEORGE BALL; FOUGHT VIETNAM POLICY UNDER KENNEDY, LBJ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Ball, whose tenure as undersecretary of state in the John F. Kennedy 
and Lyndon Johnson administrations was marked by his outspoken but unsuccessful 
arguments against expansion of the Vietnam War, is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball's personal assistant, Karen Vaseduva, said he died at New York Hospital 
on Thursday evening. He had been admitted Wednesday and doctors discovered that 
he was suffering from terminal abdominal cancer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't the type to complain. The cancer was in an advanced stage and he 
never said a word to anyone," she said. "We feel his loss very deeply." 
</P>
<P>
 He was 84 and lived in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball often found himself the lone voice protesting U.S. military involvement 
in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 As early as 1961, he advised Kennedy not to send 15,000 American troops to 
Vietnam, saying 300,000 more men would have to be dispatched later to get them 
out. His advice was rejected but turned out to be prescient. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball, who was seen by President Johnson as a kind of anti-war "devil's 
advocate" in the Administration, held on to the No. 2 job at the State 
Department from 1961 until he resigned in frustration in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their differences, the highly respected international and corporate 
lawyer returned to government service in 1968, when Johnson named him 
ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson left office the next year and Ball returned to private banking. He was 
senior managing director of Lehman Brothers until his retirement in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 In his memoirs, "The Past Has Another Pattern," published in 1982, Ball said 
that U.S. intervention in Vietnam had been a "defeat for our political 
authority and moral influence abroad and for our sense of mission and cohesion 
at home." 
</P>
<P>
 Ball also became a center of controversy because of his strongly voiced view 
that U.S. Middle East policy in the 1970s and early '80s was tilted too much in 
favor of Israel and against the Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
 A leading U.S. pro-Israel lobbying organization included Ball in 1983 on a 
list of 21 groups and 39 individuals it said were "active in the effort to 
weaken bonds between the United States and Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 Ball also was a sharp critic of President Richard Nixon, whom he admitted 
disliking intensely. He accused Nixon of compounding all of Johnson's mistakes 
in Vietnam and adding many of his own, thus intensifying the American 
involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball, born in Des Moines, Iowa, began his career in public service in the 
Treasury Department after graduating from Northwestern University in 1933. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent seven years practicing law in Chicago before joining the World War II 
Office of Lend-Lease Administration in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 He also directed the Strategic Bombing Survey, ordered by President Franklin 
D. Roosevelt to assess the effects of the Allied air offensive on Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, Ball was an adviser to Jean Monnet in negotiations that led to 
creation of the European Coal and Steel Community and, later, the European 
Common Market. 
</P>
<P>
 Ball worked as a lawyer in Washington from 1946 until 1961, when he was named 
by President Kennedy as undersecretary of state for economic affairs. Less than 
a year later he became undersecretary of state, the second-highest position in 
the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his other books was "The Passionate Attachment," published in 1992, 
about U.S.-Israel relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back at the Vietnam years, Ball testified to a House panel in 1985 
that both Johnson and Nixon said they did not want to be the first American 
President to lose a war. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our honor was not served by the unedifying spectacle of the world's most 
powerful nation trying to beat to death a small, poor, weak adversary, using 
napalm and defoliants and killing thousands of civilians in a war we could not 
win," Ball testified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our honor would have been far better preserved had we, by stopping the 
killing, demonstrated a clear sense of compassion, perspective, priority and 
balance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last years, Ball continued to pursue his interests, including history 
and economics. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaseduva, Ball's assistant, also said he was beginning to plan his next book. 
It was going to be "about the state of the world, the information superhighway 
and other modern conveniences or inconveniences, and he jokingly referred to it 
as 'a book of prejudices,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by two sons, John and Douglas, and two grandchildren. His wife 
died in 1993.

MAN WHOSE WIFE SET HIM AFIRE IN '92 DIES OF PNEUMONIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Carter, the 64-year-old cancer patient whose caretaker wife set him on 
fire two years ago after he ate her chocolate Easter bunny, has died of 
pneumonia, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's death Thursday was unrelated to the burns he suffered in 1992, said 
the Orange County coroner's office. He died at Western Medical Center-Santa 
Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter had been in the care of doctors since April 16, 1992, the day his wife, 
June, set him afire. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter had a rare form of breast cancer that had spread to his lungs and bones 
and was inoperable. He was also partially paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, his small, frail wife of 30 years had come home 
from a trip to the store to find that he had eaten the chocolate bunny. 
</P>
<P>
 Enraged, she poured rubbing alcohol on her husband and lit a match. Paul 
Carter sustained second- and third-degree burns over 20% of his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally charged with attempted murder, June Carter, then 69, pleaded guilty 
in July, 1992, to felony elder abuse and was sentenced to a year in jail and 
five years probation. Because of good behavior, she served nine months at the 
Central Women's Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to reach June Carter Friday were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are assessing the possible criminal ramifications of Paul Carter's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Police Lt. Bob Helton said that despite the coroner's conclusions, 
"we'll still run the case by the district attorney's office." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Rosanne Froeberg, who prosecuted the case, said she did not 
have enough information to decide whether June Carter should face further legal 
action. But Deputy Coroner William King said there was no reason to believe 
prosecutors could make a case against June Carter based on Thursday's autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He died as a result of (respiratory) obstruction, . . . a natural death not 
related to the burning," King said. "I don't think there is (a case)."

ONLY IN L.A.

 Maybe they had it No. 301, too: A Los Angeles magazine article, "300 Reasons 
Not to Leave L.A.," drew a letter from Paul Gommi, who pointed out:  
</P>
<P>
 "You forgot the biggest reason of all. . . . YOU CAN'T SELL YOUR HOUSE!" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It shook us awake: Incidentally, the editors of L.A. magazine wanted to make 
sure that no reader's attention wandered while reading the Top 300 list. So a 
certain high-salaried news anchor was included in this fashion: 
</P>
<P>
 "No. 199 -- Paul Moyer (only kidding!)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A reason to leave or stay in L.A.?Near Pacific Coast Highway, Santa Monica 
College spokesman Bruce Smith saw a woman walking two pets on leashes -- both 
llamas. 
</P>
<P>
 You've had enough, Lisa: Skip Lau found a classified ad for a dancer who seems 
to be admitting that she has a problem. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It was tough to find a saloon with a no-smoking section, though: If you're 
struggling to kick the tobacco habit, you might take some consolation in the 
fact that people have been trying to break the habit for at least a century, as 
readers Clyde and Carolyne Hostetter found while perusing an 1894 newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a short time Anti-Nicotine cures the tobacco habit," the ad said. "Is 
perfectly safe and harmless. Price reduced to 75 cts. per 4 oz. bottle; $1.25 
for two bottles; $2.50 for four bottles." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not all. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad continued: "Anti-Nicotine is also a first-class aphrodisiac, or 
restorer of lost or declining masculine vigor. . . . Send orders to Dr. H.P. 
Shove." 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows? Anti-Nicotine might even cure Lushes Lisa. 
</P>

 they'll change the lyric to "Welcome to the Motel California" in her honor: 
c,pl,8.5 We're not sure this had anything to do with the decision of a famous 
band to reunite, but it should be noted that the opening line to the Amy Fisher 
autobiography is: "The Eagles are my all-time favorite group." (You'll have to 
read the book if you want to find out who Joey Buttafuoco's all-time favorite 
was.) 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher's opening may be the most stirring in a literary work since "The Big 
Love," Florence Aadland's story of the romance between her 15-year-old daughter 
Beverly and a famous actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's one thing I want to make clear right off," Aadland wrote. "My baby 
was a virgin the day she met Errol Flynn."

 Say it ain't so, Lassie!June Lockhart of Santa Monica, who starred in the 
"Lassie" TV show from 1958 to 1964, recently traveled to Niagara Falls, N.Y., 
where she was the guest of honor at a specialty show featuring 1,000 collies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe one was named Lassie," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Lockhart, by the way, publicly confirmed a bit of gossip that has circulated 
throughout Hollywood for years. Of the four dogs that portrayed the brave, 
faithful female, all were males. 
</P>
<P>
 "Male dogs are easier to train," she explained. "They're bigger and they don't 
have the problem, to delicately put it, of coming into season." miscelLAny:

 The $167,000 first place prize in the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas was

AL MARTINEZ: ONE SMALL STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As commencements go, it wasn't much. The ceremony was held in a classroom, and 
the main speaker had to squeeze his brief talk in between meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The graduates came mostly in work clothes. There was no stage, no caps and 
gowns, no vast audience and no public address system. The best they could 
muster were a few balloons pinned to the wall and a computerized sign that 
said, "Congratulations Spring 1994 Graduates." 
</P>
<P>
 But make no mistake, there was a kind of glory here. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 students who stepped to the front of the room one by one were making 
tentative moves toward goals every bit as important in their lives as Ph.D.s. 
They were guaranteeing themselves jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion was the completion of an apprenticeship preparation program 
sponsored by the Los Angeles Unified School District, a small step in the 
direction of the rest of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Commencement was held in an inconspicuous corner of the Maxine Waters 
Employment Preparation Center in the South-Central section of the city. The 
students were blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve weeks of intensive study had prepared them to take apprenticeship tests 
in the building trades, from drywalling to carpentry. An estimated 70% of the 
1,800 students who have completed the course have passed the tests and gotten 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal of the Maxine Waters Center told them after they'd received 
their certificates, "You're holding hope in your hands." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I was invited to the ceremony by Hank Springer, an ex-print shop teacher who 
is now apprenticeship coordinator for the school district. He served as 
president of the L.A. teachers union in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Springer wanted me to see that not all blacks and Latinos were gang members 
and not all of them were willing to survive on charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had students living in cars who came in to take this course," he said. 
"They've gotten themselves careers and gone on to better lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, this was not a commencement for those who drive to ceremonies in BMWs 
and celebrate later at lavish receptions. The pale green room held maybe two 
dozen people, including the students and their guests, and I doubt there was a 
USC grad among them. 
</P>
<P>
 They sat in straight-backed chairs with writing boards attached, the kind 
students use during classroom sessions. It reminded me of parents night at a 
public school. 
</P>
<P>
 The course is no piece of cake. Those who take it have to learn good English, 
as well as algebra, geometry and trigonometry . . . and they don't come from 
the kinds of backgrounds where trig and good grammar prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have more to overcome because they have more to deal with in their 
world," an instructor said. "There's competition out there. They know that." 
</P>
<P>
 What drew me here was the nature of the event. We all need to see pockets of 
achievement in a city that seems to be giving up on itself. There was no talk 
of surrender here. 
</P>
<P>
 "For people who want to leave Los Angeles, I say go," school board member 
Warren Furutani told the graduates. "No one's saying everything's perfect. But 
there's a challenge here too, an opportunity to change. There's a window to 
step through." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I can't count the number of commencement ceremonies I've attended, including 
those I've covered and those I've gone to for personal reasons. Visions of 
success were shaped in lofty prose, and parents cried when the strains of a 
recessional marched their kids out the door and on to tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't that kind of event. Blue-collar ceremonies are rarely inspiring 
and hardly ever visionary. Parchment wasn't the goal here. Jobs were. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Mathews is a handyman who wants to operate a pile driver. Michele Payan 
is a part-time cashier who wants to be a plumber. Kevin Ross has been out of 
work for a year and wants to be an electrician. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good," Payan told me later. "I've taken the first small step." 
</P>
<P>
 Pride is an element of completion, Springer said to them. He's a blunt, 
white-haired man of 58 who created the program eight years ago. "I began it 
when the unions came to me and said they weren't getting qualified African 
American and Latino applicants. . . . They didn't want them. Now the law says 
they have to." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "But if no one hires you, if you never get a job, still feel better 
about yourself. Show them you do in the way you carry yourself, the way you 
walk around." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone has a goal. They vary in magnitude according to conditions. 
What I saw in that small room down a long hall was a goal made grander by its 
simplicity: self-improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't beat that.

ENVIRONMENT WATCH; FOIL OIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many do-it-yourselfers will use this long holiday weekend to catch up on 
chores around the house. Those who decide to change the oil in their automobile 
will no doubt be pleased to discover that they are now eligible for a small 
reward for disposing of their used oil responsibly. 
</P>
<P>
 The City of Los Angeles, the American Oceans Campaign and Unocal Corp. this 
week kicked off an 18-month campaign to encourage residents to recycle motor 
oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by a $1.1-million grant from the California Integrated Waste Management 
Board, the city's used motor oil recycling program provides oil changers in the 
Los Angeles area with recycling centers at 42 Unocal 76 stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers may take the oil to participating stations for a rebate of four 
cents per quart or 16 cents per gallon. It must not be contaminated with other 
chemical products. Call (800) 98 TOXIC to learn the location of the nearest 
participating station. 
</P>
<P>
 A quart of used motor oil hardly seems like a major waste problem. But 
multiplied by millions, it is. The city Board of Public Works estimates that 
every year up to 8 million gallons of used motor oil are poured down storm 
drains and flushed into the ocean or dumped into the ground, threatening 
underground water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The recycling program gives residents a convenient alternative to improperly 
dumping this potentially hazardous waste product, and one that encourages 
recycling. The state program also helps fund re-refining of the motor oil 
collected. A good deal all around.

COMPASSIONATE DEPUTIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently I was contacted by a deputy from the City of Industry Sheriff's 
Station.He and his partner had been dispatched to meet an emergency call. A 
wife had returned from work to find her husband dead on the living room floor. 
When I arrived at the home of the deceased, I was greatly impressed by the 
compassion, professionalism and concern of the two young officers. They were 
consoling the bereaved wife, assisting in locating family members, contacting 
the coroner, etc. Their calm presence brought a certain peace and order to a 
distressing situation. My gratitude to law enforcement.

FAREWELL TO A MAN OF MORALS; SOLZHENITSYN'S MESSAGE RINGS CLEAR, FOR RUSSIANS, 
FOR AMERICANS, FOR ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the most controversial of all the Russian emigre 
writers of the Cold War, has gone home. His departure from the Vermont retreat 
where he had worked in virtual solitude for 18 years made quiet news. Noisier 
was the rapidly developing story of organized crime in Russia and its alarming 
attempt to gain access to the Russian nuclear arsenal. Could Solzhenitsyn have 
foreseen this outcome when, a generation ago, he detonated "The GULAG 
Archipelago" inside the walls of the then-impregnable Soviet fortress? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, almost certainly, is yes, for Solzhenitsyn has always been less a 
writer than a moralist. Art, including his own literary art, is not ultimate 
for him; morality is ultimate. This alone -- his insistence that morality must 
be the central topic, the topic of topics -- was more than enough to make him 
the designated mourner at the American literary world's endless wedding. It 
didn't help that he so often seemed condescending toward the moral and 
political traditions of the society that had afforded him refuge.  
</P>
<P>
 Communism, as Solzhenitsyn saw it, was not just a gigantic economic mistake 
but also a moral atrocity whose program included the deliberate destruction of 
those very people who by their courage and sensitivity hold any culture back 
from its worst excesses. "Annihilation was not visited upon people in our 
country in a purely random fashion," reads his valedictory in the current New 
Perspectives Quarterly, "but was directed at those with outstanding mental and 
moral qualities. And so the picture in Russia today is bleaker and more savage 
than if it were simply the result of the general shortcomings of our human 
nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Do some people have "outstanding . . . moral qualities"? Solzhenitsyn has 
never been in doubt on that point, and his certainty has made Americans 
exceedingly uncomfortable. But Soviet communism did indeed degenerate into a 
war against the good because they were good. Solzhenitsyn may have been blind 
to much, but he was blindingly aware of that truth and searingly prophetic 
about it. For that alone, as he ends his long exile, Americans have every 
reason to wish him Godspeed.

LOUD VOICE FROM U.N.'S BULLY PULPIT; BOUTROS-GHALI CAMPAIGNS FOR RWANDA MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali refuses to let the genocide in 
Rwanda go unchallenged. He scolds the West for not responding to the crisis. He 
chides Africa for not sending more troops to stop the killing. It's a good use 
of his international bully pulpit. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he met Friday with President Clinton, Boutros-Ghali can't drum up the 
political support he did when he finally persuaded George Bush and other 
nations' leaders to send troops to Somalia. That thankless operation soured 
much of the West on the idea of dispatching troops to another bloody foreign 
power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 The American casualties in Somalia prompted the Clinton Administration to 
develop a new and stringent policy on peacekeeping, Presidential Policy 
Directive 25, which Clinton signed May 5. Even when no U.S. troops are 
promised, the new policy calls on the secretary general to answer a series of 
tough questions posed by the United States, such as which countries will send 
troops, what role the troops will play on the ground and when they will leave. 
Washington demands satisfactory responses because Americans pay one-third of 
the U.N. peacekeeping budget; although U.S. lives might not be on the line, 
U.S. tax dollars would be. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to comply with the new U.S. directive, the U.N. Security Council 
delayed sending 5,500 troops to Rwanda to allow time for a study of what can be 
accomplished in the Central African nation while the fighting rages. The troops 
would go only if the secretary general determined that the combatants would 
cooperate with the United Nations by agreeing to a cease-fire, that foreign 
troops were indeed available and that any mission in Rwanda would be 
short-lived.  
</P>
<P>
 Additional delays have been caused by the refusal of most African nations to 
commit troops to a U.N. peacekeeping force. So far, only Ghana, Ethiopia, 
Senegal and Zimbabwe have committed. Boutros-Ghali has tried to put together an 
all-African contingent to secure Rwanda's Kigali airport, ensure the flow of 
relief supplies and create safe havens for fleeing Rwandans. The reluctance of 
neighbors to get involved is not unusual in Africa, where isolationism is 
encouraged by the charter of the Organization of African Unity.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the deaths of Burundi's President Cyprian Ntayamira and Rwanda's 
President Juvenal Habyarimana in a suspicious plane crash April 6, more than 
200,000 people have been killed in fighting between members of the Tutsi and 
Hutu tribes. U.N. officials will try again on Monday to negotiate a cease-fire. 
That's a start, but only a start. 
</P>
<P>
 What would it take to get more help for Rwanda? Neo-colonial meddling is 
inappropriate, but for so many African nations to sit by while hundreds of 
thousands of neighbors die is unconscionable.

DEBATE OVER ABORTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was delighted to see the inherent fallacy of the pro-abortion position 
finally exposed in the side-by-side articles May 17.  
</P>
<P>
 At one and the same time we read a "Path Cleared for Abortion Pill Use" and 
"Assault Causing Miscarriage Can Be Murder Case." The very plain truth is that, 
as the California Supreme Court held, the fetus is a human life worthy of 
protection, and therefore the taking of its life (by a third party as opposed 
to by its own mother) is a crime which may lead to a conviction of murder. 
California's tough fetal murder law places the abortion debate in a new and 
brilliant light: The fetus has rights. Ironically, a woman is free to abort her 
fetus while a third party causing a miscarriage would be convicted of murder. 
The legal (and moral) issue has finally been clarified in the courts: In having 
an abortion a woman takes the life of her own unborn fetus in what would 
otherwise be considered an act of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Stanley Mosk's dissent that this creature "roughly the size of a 
peanut . . . (whose) appearance remains less than human" is a very poor 
argument favoring abortion. Is a 1-month-old child "less than human" because it 
cannot walk, reason, communicate verbally or wear a size six shoe? Its 
appearance is that of a baby -- but still a human life. In the same way the 
appearance of human life in the womb is that of a fetus. Happily, the court has 
determined that whatever one desires to call life in the womb -- a fetus, an 
embryo or an inconvenience -- it is a human life, for it cannot be otherwise. 
Now that this life has rights that protect it from an assault by a third party, 
maybe we should consider the serious and deadly assaults upon this life by its 
mother and the RU-486 abortion pill. 
</P>
<P>
 THE REV. JEROME T. KARCHER 
</P>
<P>
 St. Joachim Catholic Church, Costa Mesa 
</P>
<P>
 * No doubt you will receive many letters on the court decision regarding 
murder of a fetus. And many will comment on the juxtaposition of this news item 
with the one about RU-486, the abortion pill. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro-choice activists are worried that the court has cleared the way for 
restricting or even illegalizing abortion. Anti-choice proponents are cheering 
the court's decision, for the same reason. But both sides of the debate are 
missing the point. The key words in the court ruling are "third party killing." 
</P>
<P>
 The court decision is not about "when life begins"; it is about the right to 
choose. A woman may choose to carry a fetus to term, or she may choose not to. 
This has been the law since the Roe vs. Wade decision of 1973. Having made her 
choice, no other person has the right to take that choice away. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the question of when life begins, it certainly doesn't begin at 
conception -- it merely continues. A woman creates eggs; a man creates sperm. A 
woman who does not become pregnant ends a potential human life every month. A 
man ends millions of them every time he ejaculates. 
</P>
<P>
 If a woman is pregnant, she may choose to have the fetus removed (therapeutic 
abortion). But if she chooses to carry the fetus to term, it is a crime for 
another person to commit an action which causes the fetus' death (spontaneous 
abortion). 
</P>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court has reaffirmed that it is the woman who has the 
right to choose. This is as it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 JOEY CRAWFORD 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * Justice Mosk, in his "lengthy and graphic" dissent to the California Supreme 
Court decision concerning fetal murder, tried to describe the ugly non-humanity 
of the fetus in order to buttress his position that a post-embryonic fetus is 
not a person. I think he utterly failed when he used the words "creature," 
"head," "eye," "nostril," "feet," "tail," "hands" in this description. Perhaps 
his point would have been better made if he had meticulously avoided any 
mention of fetal anatomy and its relation to adult human anatomy. Then again, 
perhaps not. 
</P>
<P>
 DOUGLAS CAMPBELL 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City 
</P>
<P>
 * Regarding your editorial on RU-486 (May 17), I resent the statement, "That 
opens the door for widespread use of this valuable but controversial drug in 
this country," used by you and others. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not the drug that is controversial; it has been shown to be highly 
effective. It is, in actuality, the very minor group of those who oppose it 
that are controversial, not RU-486. 
</P>
<P>
 SHELDON BROWN 
</P>
<P>
 Sun Valley 
</P>
<P>
 * The abortion pill RU-486, when declared safe by the Food and Drug 
Administration, will assist President Clinton in "ending welfare as we know 
it." Although single mothers with dependent children will still need government 
aid provided by the AFDC program, the government will be able to refuse AFDC 
aid to indigent newcomers when RU-486 is approved by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have demonstrated against the abortion clinics should have their 
workload substantially diminished when RU-486 cuts down on the number of 
pregnant women seeking to terminate their pregnancies.

L.A. COUNTY HIV TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We are writing in response to "L.A. County Record Worst in HIV Detection 
Program" (May 10) and your editorial "Sizing Up the True AIDS Problem" (May 
11). In his critique of the Los Angeles County HIV testing and counseling 
program it is not clear why your reporter did not include 1993 data (available 
from this office.) Had he done so, he would have found that in 1993 there was a 
significant expansion of the confidential HIV testing and counseling program in 
Los Angeles County. The number of testing sites increased from 67 in the first 
quarter of 1992 to 130 sites by the fourth quarter of 1993. HIV tests at these 
sites increased 71%, from 25,577 in 1992 to 43,804 in 1993. Testing in Los 
Angeles actually exceeded all other cities in 1993, including New York City, 
which performed 43,532 tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, the number of HIV-infected persons identified in Los Angeles 
versus the number of persons tested increased from 1.3% to 1.8% (796 
HIV-infected persons were identified in 1993 compared to 345 in 1992). Your 
comparison of "hit rates" in the seven targeted cities ignores important 
epidemiologic information. The HIV-infection rates in the general population in 
Los Angeles and in our highest risk groups, i.e., homosexual men and injection 
drug users, are lower than in the other seven cities. For example, we estimate 
that approximately 0.5%, or 1 in 200 persons, in the general population of Los 
Angeles are HIV infected, while homosexual men treated in L.A. County STD 
clinics have HIV-infection rates of approximately 35%. In comparison, the 
estimated HIV infection rate in the general population of San Francisco is 4%, 
or 1 in 25 persons, while homosexual men treated in San Francisco STD clinics 
have infection rates of 50%. In addition, the infection rate among injection 
drug users in Los Angeles is under 10% compared to rates between 50% and 60% in 
New York City. Given this lower background rate of HIV infection in Los 
Angeles, it is not surprising that we will have to test more people, even in 
our highest risk groups, to identify the same number of HIV-infected persons. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, your comparison of confidential HIV testing with anonymous testing is 
inappropriate because it confuses two distinct populations. Anonymous test 
sites provide service to a group of highly motivated, HIV "informed" persons 
who have made a conscious decision to seek testing. In contrast, the county's 
confidential testing program targets persons who are less knowledgeable about 
HIV, are unaware that they may be at risk of HIV infection, and are not likely 
to seek testing.  
</P>
<P>
 As the HIV epidemic shifts increasingly into low-income and minority 
populations, reaching those who are infected will be more labor intensive and, 
upon superficial analysis will appear to be less "cost-effective." However, it 
is imperative that we continue to refine and expand our efforts to reach these 
populations to allow early identification and referral to treatment as well as 
to provide education to prevent new infections. Confidential HIV testing 
targeted to high-risk individuals who are not likely to utilize anonymous 
testing services is an essential component of this activity.

BIG INNING PROPELS TITANS IN FIRST ROUND; NCAA BASEBALL: FULLERTON SCORES FIVE 
IN EIGHTH TO BEAT NORTHWESTERN STATE (LA.), 11-3, IN REGIONAL OPENER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nobody could have mistaken it for classic baseball. But at this stage of the 
season, the most important thing is to win, and Cal State Fullerton did that 
Friday in the opening round of the NCAA Midwest I regional. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans (42-13) rocked Keith Moore, the top pitcher for Northwestern State 
(La.), for 12 hits and went on to an 11-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Six errors by the Demons helped Fullerton. The Titans had three errors, but 
they also had stronger pitching from Dan Ricabal (9-1) and reliever Ted Silva, 
who recorded his 12th save. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody could seem to catch it very well in this game," Fullerton Coach Augie 
Garrido said. "Both teams had their troubles from that standpoint, but the key 
to our success was that Dan got us off to a good start and gave us a little 
better momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, winning its regional opener for the sixth time in its last seven 
appearances, advances into the second round at 5 p.m. (PDT) today against Texas 
Christian. TCU turned back Memphis State, 11-3, with Nolan Ryan's son, Reid, 
getting the victory as his father looked on. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal gave up four hits in 6 2/3 innings, and the Titans led, 6-2, through 
the seventh. But Northwestern State of Natchitoches, La., didn't seem out of it 
until the Titans scored five times in the bottom of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it was 6-3, I thought we still had a chance to win," Northwestern State 
Coach Jim Wells said. "But you can't beat anyone when you make six errors. They 
made errors, too, but they came back from them." 
</P>
<P>
 Garrido said the infield at Allie Reynolds Stadium was more difficult to deal 
with defensively than most. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dirt seemed to come up in clumps, and it was more dusty. That made it 
tricky. We'll just have to be more aggressive on ground balls here in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton got rolling early against Moore, who came into the game with a 1.25 
earned-run average, one of the best in the nation. The Titans scored one run in 
the first. Northwestern State's second baseman, Daniel Tomlin, who had 
committed only one error this season, made a throwing error in the first inning 
that allowed Mark Kotsay to reach base. Bret Hemphill's two-out double drove in 
Kotsay. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal sailed through three innings before having control problems in the 
fourth. He walked Rob Landstad and Marco Guajardo and both advanced on a passed 
ball. With two out, Matt Donner reached on an infield single and a run crossed 
to tie the score, 1-1. Ricabal escaped without further damage, however, when 
Hemphill, the Titan catcher, caught Guajardo off third on Donner's attempt to 
steal second. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans regained the lead with three runs in the fourth. Jeff Ferguson 
singled, advanced on a sacrifice and went to third when Sal Mancuso reached on 
an infield error. Adam Millan's bouncer over third drove in Ferguson, and 
Jeremy Giambi doubled to deep left center, driving in Mancuso. Jason Gill's 
sacrifice fly drove in Fullerton's final run of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricabal cooled another mild threat in the fifth. After Scotty Stafford walked 
and Brad Duncan reached on an error by shortstop Jack Jones, Ricabal got Tomlin 
to bounce into a double play to end the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton came back with two runs in the fifth. Dante Powell and Kotsay had 
back-to-back doubles to open the inning and score Powell. Hemphill also singled 
and Kotsay scored when the ball was mishandled in right field. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern State picked up another run in the seventh. Donner was hit by a 
pitch and Zack Watts singled. The run scored on an error by Ferguson, the Titan 
second baseman. At that point, the Titans went to the bullpen with two outs. 
Chad Rolish got the final out in the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolish got into trouble in the eighth when two hits and a walk loaded the 
bases with one out. Silva got the Titans out of the inning with only one run, 
thanks to a sparkling play by Craig Skyberg, who replaced Jason Gill at third 
base. Skyberg made a leaping grab of Watts' high bouncer to get the out, 
although Donner scored on the play. Silva then got Stafford to pop up, ending 
the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "That play by Skyberg had a great deal to do with us holding them off," 
Garrido said. "That could have been a big inning for them." 
</P>
<P>
 And the Titans' five-run eighth ended any Northwestern State hope for a 
comeback. A two-run triple by Jones and an RBI single by Skyberg were the big 
hits, but the Demons also made three of their six errors in the inning.

JAZZ TAKES GAME TO A NEW HEIGHT; NBA PLAYOFFS: UTAH BEATS ROCKETS, 95-86, TO 
CUT WEST SERIES DEFICIT TO 2-1. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Far from their muggy home Friday night, the Houston Rockets saw their enemy up 
close and personal. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, it was them. 
</P>
<P>
 Their most valuable player turned human and their guards turned cold. By 
halftime, they had already said enough to the officials to draw four technical 
fouls. Their deportment improved but their game didn't, and they fell, 95-86, 
to the Utah Jazz, which now trails in the Western finals, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets' four-man guard corps made 10 of 38 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Hakeem Olajuwon, coming off 31- and 41-point games, started zero for eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He missed some shots," said Jazz center Felton Spencer, the sacrificial lamb 
assigned to guard him. "I was starting to think he wouldn't miss any." 
</P>
<P>
 What, him discouraged? 
</P>
<P>
 "Olajuwon scores on everybody," said Spencer, cheerily. "Here I am, a lowly 
no-name guy who isn't supposed to have a prayer against him." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz's big-name guy, Karl Malone, had a sore ankle and a bad case of flu, 
but the other lowly no-name guys stepped up. Forward David Benoit made six of 
his eight shots and scored 14 points, and reserve Jay Humphries was six for 10 
and scored 15 points in 27 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jazz led, 25-20, after one quarter; 52-40 at the half and led by as many 
as 18 points early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets made only a token rally after that, never getting closer than nine 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought our intensity level coming out wasn't what it should have been for 
the situation we were in," said Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich. "And it set the 
tone for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were just little things the fans wouldn't recognize -- running our 
plays, being alert, getting the hammer on those guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "(When) they came out, their intensity level was way higher than ours. This 
was a game they had to have, but we discussed that at practice. We didn't want 
to lose this game because of energy. We all say the right things -- we're going 
to do this, we're going to do that, but we really didn't execute them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets won Game 1 easily, leading by 22 points before halftime, and took 
a squeaker in Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone twisted an ankle in Game 2, then for good measure got flu on the 
off-day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called me up and told me he was sick," said Utah Coach Jerry Sloan, "and 
he very seldom calls me. I told him to do what he had to do, but he wanted to 
play. So he came and gave us 45 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Malone: "It's playoff time now, and we have a rule in our locker room 
that any time you suit up, that means you're ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Malone went two for 10 in the first half but kept firing and finished with 
Mailman numbers: 22 points, 16 rebounds, five assists. 
</P>
<P>
 An upbeat Olajuwon discounted the Jazz's defensive effort on him. He bumped 
into two Jazz players every time he made a move Friday, but said that was to be 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the same kind of defense," said Olajuwon, "but when you get tired, you 
don't have the energy to fight back, to fight for position. That was because of 
the altitude and I know that." 
</P>
<P>
 Salt Lake City is 4,200 feet above sea level. The bad news for the Rockets is 
that Game 4 will be here, too, and Malone has two days to sip chicken soup 
first.

DREIFORT CLOSES OUT PIRATES, -- WITH BAT; DODGERS: RELIEF PITCHER PINCH-HITS IN 
THE 10TH INNING, DRIVES IN WINNING RUN WITH A SINGLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Darren Dreifort is only a rookie from Wichita State, but he is already a hero 
to the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 With Mike Piazza and Delino DeShields unable to swing a bat, in the 10th 
inning Manager Tom Lasorda called on the relief pitcher, who hit 22 home runs 
in college last year, to pinch-hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreifort hit a 1-and-2 pitch for a two-out single to drive in the winning run 
in a 6-5 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates at Dodger Stadium on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was no accident I sent Darren up to hit," Lasorda said. "Every time I face 
him in batting practice, he nails me. I figured if he can hit me, he can hit 
any left-hander they throw in there." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers had blown a 4-0 lead in the ninth and seemed about to lose when 
Jay Bell homered in the top of the 10th. But the Dodgers pulled it out when 
Dreifort's sharp single drove in Carlos Hernandez from second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't last through many more games like this," Lasorda said. "I'm too old. 
Things really looked good the way Ramon (Martinez) was pitching. It's a shame 
he didn't get the victory. I don't know what happened on the fly ball that they 
let fall for a hit in the ninth." 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler and Cory Snyder let a routine fly fall for a base hit by Brian 
Hunter in the ninth. Instead of Martinez needing one out for a 4-1 victory, the 
Pirates rallied and tied the score. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my fault," Butler said. "When I waved my glove, he backed off. I 
thought I heard a yell, but it must have been from the stands." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dreifort: "I was a little nervous when I came up, but after a pitch or 
two I was all right. It was really exciting. I just hope I can continue to 
contribute." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Karros, who came out of a slump earlier in the game, had his fourth hit 
of the night, a single to keep things going in the 10th, and Mitch Webster 
singled in the tying run before Dreifort became a hitting star. 
</P>
<P>
 This Pirate team had been in trouble most of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only a few players remaining from the Pirate team of a few years ago 
that dominated the league. Two of them, Andy Van Slyke and Jay Bell, 
contributed to the early departure of Pirate rookie Jon Lieber, making his 
third major league start after beginning the season in the Southern League. 
</P>
<P>
 The only mistake the rookie made in the first three innings was on a 
second-inning pitch to Karros. The first baseman had been in a 15-at-bat slump, 
but he drilled a Lieber pitch into the left-field bleachers for his sixth home 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Slyke had a chance to get the youngster even in the fourth. But with 
runners on first and third and nobody out, he took a called third strike. The 
next two batters popped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell made a poor play on Raul Mondesi's grounder in the third inning, and the 
double set up the two-run fourth that gave Martinez a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Offerman opened the rally with a single to right. Bell hesitated on 
Mondesi's sharp grounder, then saw it bounce off of his glove into center 
field. The Dodgers had runners on second and third. 
</P>
<P>
 After fouling off several two-strike pitches, Tim Wallach went with the pitch 
and singled to right-center to make the score 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked like an easy victory and possibly the 14th shutout for Martinez 
going into the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 But with one out, Van Slyke hit his fourth home run, the first ball hit hard 
by the Pirates all night. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Dave Clark rapped a single to right and Hunter lifted his seemingly 
harmless fly ball to left center. 
</P>
<P>
 When Al Martin walked to fill the bases, Worrell replaced Martinez. One run 
scored on Don Slaught's long fly to right. 
</P>
<P>
 The weak-hitting Kevin Young, batting only .197, was next. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers were so sure Worrell would get the last out, they let Martin steal 
second without a play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Young looped a single into right-center to make the score 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 And the stage was set for a rookie to become a hero.

 Bell, a light-hitting, good fielding shortstop, made a poor play on Raul

two-run fourth that gave Martinez a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 After fouling off several two-strike pitches, Tim Wallach went with the pitch 
and singled to right-center to make the score 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile the Dodger rookie second baseman, Garey Ingram, starting his first 
game, was fielding flawlessly. In the first five innings, he handled seven 
chances and twice was the pivot on double plays. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked like an easy victory and possibly the 14th shutout for Martinez 
going into the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 But with one out in the ninth, Van Slyke hit his fourth home run, the first 
ball hit hard by the Pirates all night. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Dave Clark rapped a single to right. Brian Hunter lifted a harmless fly 
ball to left center, but Cory Snyder, who entered the game for defensive 
purposes, and Brett Butler both thought the other would catch it. Neither did. 
</P>
<P>
 When Al Martin walked to fill the bases, Worrell replaced Martinez. One run 
scored on Don Slaught's long fly to right.

</P>
<P>
 But Young, fighting off a two-strike pitch, looped a single into right-center 
to make the score 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Young then was caught in a rundown.

DE LA HOYA GETS EARLY SCARE; BOXING: HE'S KNOCKED DOWN ALMOST AT THE OPENING 
BELL BUT GETS UP TO STOP CAMPANELLA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a night that celebrated rising stars and falling opponents, Oscar De La 
Hoya performed an unscripted, scene-stealing combination of both. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 4,116 at the MGM Grand Friday night, De La Hoya stunned everybody by 
getting knocked down almost at the opening bell, then got up and won in the 
first and last defense of his World Boxing Organization junior-lightweight 
title against Giorgio Campanella. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, International Boxing Federation lightweight champion Rafael Ruelas 
and IBF middleweight champion Roy Jones Jr. scored early-knockout victories in 
both fighters' initial title defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 But De La Hoya, taking trainer Robert Alcazar's warnings lightly, was 
cold-cocked by a short left hook from the hard-charging Campanella about 15 
seconds into the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, told him, told him," Alcazar said. "This guy is a little Mike 
Tyson. He's going to be coming right at you." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second first-round knockdown De La Hoya has suffered in his last 
three fights, and this one was significantly harder than his flash fall last 
Oct. 30 before he got up to knock out Narciso Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya (13-0, 12 knockouts) was stunned by the blow, but popped up, was 
yelled at after the round by Alcazar, then dominated Campanella (20-1) by 
staying away from the challenger's left hook and scoring from the outside with 
a quick jab and hard overhand rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started out trying to be that big, macho fighter, bang with this great 
banger," De La Hoya said. "By the second round, I realized that I could easily 
outbox him, get him from the outside using my reach advantage, and stay away 
from that left hook." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya knocked Campanella down late in the second round and fired four 
more shots when Campanella was already on his knees, for which De La Hoya 
admitted he should have been penalized. Campanella was knocked against the 
ropes as the second-round bell sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the third, De La Hoya knocked Campanella down with a flurry of lefts 
to the head and a final clean overhand right. Another series of hard shots 
after Campanella got up triggered the corner to throw in a towel and referee 
Joe Cortez to stop the fight with 38 seconds left in the round. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ruelas, who survived two first-round knockdowns in his title-winning 
victory over Freddie Pendleton last February, there would be no problems Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Evgen, six inches shorter and slower, chose the odd strategy of standing 
directly in front of Ruelas (41-1, 32 KOs), who punished him relentlessly from 
the opening moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Among many other telling shots, Ruelas snapped a left hook to Evgen's chin in 
the first, triggering a devastating array of inside shots that had Evgen's face 
swollen before the first was over. 
</P>
<P>
 Though trainer Al Bonanni was screaming for referee Mitch Halpern to stop it 
from the second round on, Evgen (25-3) absorbed the blasts without falling 
through the second and most of the third, when Halpern finally stopped it at 
2:53 of the round. 
</P>
<P>
 According to PunchStat totals, Ruelas threw 432 punches -- a stunning average 
of 49 a minute -- and landed 212. He threw 342 power punches, landing 180. 
Evgen landed only 52 total punches. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones (26-0, 23 KOs), who had been seething all week about being relegated to 
the undercard and about Tate's brash talk, ended the bout with his first punch 
of the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 After battering Tate with counterpunches in the first, Jones let Tate (29-3) 
walk into him in the second and fired the hook crisply into Tate's right cheek, 
knocking him directly on his back.

A WARNING TO FUTURE RAM FANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The writers of this letter have been longtime Ram fans and season 
ticket-holders. We have watched a team rich with history, pride and leadership 
descend to a level of selfish disarray under the ownership of Georgia Frontiere 
and parsimony of John Shaw.We speak for a much larger group of Ram fans who 
still live and die with and support the team but who have had their enthusiasm 
and pride stripped away. There is no joy in being a Ram fan anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans of Baltimore and St. Louis are understandably filled with great 
expectation and hope. Please be warned in advance, however, that in time your 
expectations and hopes will be dashed. Georgia and John will settle into your 
new stadiums, but ultimately, after they line their pockets, the Rams will seek 
more. They will rip your hearts out and move to another city that may offer a 
better deal.

STRAWBERRY CASE SHOWS DODGERS SHOULD GROW PLAYERS ON THE FARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The release of Darryl Strawberry might be the end of an era in which the 
Dodgers enter the free-agency market. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Stanhouse, Dave Goltz and Strawberry are on the negative side of the 
equation.Granted, Kirk Gibson, Brett Butler, Kevin Gross, Tom Candiotti and Tim 
Wallach (this year) have been good pickups, but now that their minor league 
system is producing so well, as evidenced by the Dodgers' good start in 1994, 
this is the way to go. The great Dodger teams of the past were built from the 
organization, and now they are back on the right track.

NO MUSIC IN CAPRIATI COLUMN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's too bad Mike Downey took a day off from his normally high editorial 
standards when he wrote his column about Jennifer Capriati. 
</P>
<P>
 To make his main point, that we shouldn't pity prodigies, no matter how 
obvious their pain, Downey needed to assume that prodigies are somehow immune 
from the human need for an emotionally secure childhood and adolescence. Downey 
seemed to be saying that if you make enough money and have enough fame, you 
don't need those things. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, is he wrong. I competed on the women's pro tennis tour for 10 years, and 
I know how stressful it can be. The world is strewn with many prodigies whose 
lives became an emotional mess, including some of the people Downey mentioned 
in his column. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey compared Capriati to Mozart, apparently figuring that we would 
understand how the world benefited from his status as a prodigy. Downey must 
have forgotten that Mozart died at 35, severely emotionally disturbed and an 
alcoholic. We would all have benefited more had he lived a long and productive 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Capriati's childhood and adolescence have not served her well. Her father 
shoved a racket at her when she really needed a rattle and sent her off to play 
hardball in the big time when she really needed to spend time learning how to 
make and keep friends. Let's hope she can do so now.

</P>
<P>
 The Times' abandonment of quality reportage is further evidenced in Sports, 
where Mike Downey continues to find an outlet for his intestinal disquiet. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's column on Jennifer Capriati further defames a fine athlete whose 
alleged crime, the possession of marijuana for her personal use, is not the 
heinous societal attack the media makes it out to be. Instead, it is healthy 
teen-aged rebellion. For years the Capriati family breadwinner, this child has 
not disgraced tennis or herself but advanced both to a higher plane of 
excellence.

<P>
 My compliments to Mike Downey for his excellent column, "Sing No Sad Songs for 
Her" and my thanks to The Times for publishing it. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is drowning in a sea of victimization; nobody is willing to 
assume responsibility for their own lives and actions. 
</P>
<P>
 The column rightly decried the obscenity of making Capriati a victim because 
she had enough talent to earn an enormous amount of money playing tennis. She 
is a victim of her own irrationality and stupidity, nothing more or less. 
</P>
<P>
 To imply that the sport and business of tennis is in any way at fault for her 
difficulties is to insult the people mentioned who have succeeded at life as 
well as tennis, as well as those who perhaps didn't achieve as much fame in 
tennis, but still turned out to be productive, honest human beings.

REALIGNMENT MEANS A BREEZE FOR DODGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dodgers have a good team, and this is usually the part of the season in 
which we get to see if they can take the next step and become a great team that 
contends for a division title. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, this year, thanks to realignment and the added playoff teams, it doesn't 
look like they will have to take any steps and could possibly win the division 
title. Welcome to the '90s. Just think, it's only a matter of time before we 
root, root, root for the Dodgers to be the first eighth-seeded team to beat a 
No. 1 seed.

KNICKS SHOULD CLEAN UP ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Come on Pat Riley, you didn't used to have to win this way. After having just 
witnessed the Knicks-Bulls series, I am left with a feeling of real concern 
regarding the outright dirty tactics used by the Knicks.I don't know how many 
times I saw John Starks, Charles Oakley, Derek Harper and some of the other 
Knicks throw opposing players to the ground, kick them while they were down or 
shove them hard while they were off balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Aggressive basketball is OK in the NBA, but there is no place for these kinds 
of dirty and dangerous tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Riley is not encouraging his players to play like this, he should make 
them stop.

TENNIS / FRENCH OPEN; RAFTER LEADS NEWCOMER FLOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tennis world got a look, if not exactly at its future, then at some new 
faces Friday at Roland Garros Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 In a third-round upset, Patrick Rafter of Brisbane, Australia, who has not won 
a singles title in his four-year career, ousted No. 11-seeded Thomas Muster of 
Austria, 6-4, 5-7, 6-3, 6-3, in one of the most mean-spirited matches of the 
early rounds of the French Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafter was but one of the relatively anonymous players to come to the 
forefront Friday. Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden, who had not qualified for a pro 
tour event this year and had never played in a Grand Slam tournament, upset No. 
16 Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands, 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, 6-3, and will face 
top-ranked Pete Sampras in the fourth round. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a lot of fun," said Tillstrom, ranked 226th. "I hope I can 
make him play a very tight match." 
</P>
<P>
 And on Center Court, Greg Rusedski of Pointe Claire, Quebec, who had never 
played at Roland Garros or advanced past the first round of a Grand Slam event, 
impressed No. 4 Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine in a 2-6, 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just played great," Medvedev said. "I don't know if he can play better, 
but today he was great." 
</P>
<P>
 Rusedski was the first Canadian to reach the third round of the French Open 
since 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 The play of Rafter, Tillstrom and Rusedski overshadowed dominating 
performances by some of the game's biggest names -- Sampras, Jim Courier and 
Sergi Bruguera of Spain. Sampras' big serve was at its best in a 6-1, 6-4, 6-1 
victory over Paul Haarhuis of the Netherlands. No. 7 Courier defeated Jonas 
Bjorkman of Sweden, 6-3, 6-1, 6-1, and No. 6 Bruguera ousted Ronald Agenor of 
Haiti, 6-3, 6-3, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was on Court 1 where the day's most compelling drama unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
 Muster, whose left knee was mangled five years ago by a drunk driver in a 
Miami parking lot, began complaining about line calls late in the first set and 
continued into the tight second set, igniting the crowd against him. He made 
circles in the red clay with his racket where he thought balls had hit out in 
an effort to get chair umpire Dana Loconto to overrule the line judges. 
</P>
<P>
 As the match went on, fans started whistling at Muster's challenges. And when 
Rafter mocked Muster by marking obvious long balls, they clapped. At one point 
Muster cursed to himself, "It's a . . . sewer here." 
</P>
<P>
 "(It) shouldn't happen after 11 years to get upset with the crowd," Muster, 
26, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although showing little poise, Muster won the second set. With Rafter serving 
at 2-3, Muster yelled at Loconto about a called ace. When Rafter finally won 
the game, he leaped over the net and used his racquet like a pen to mark the 
spot where the winning shot landed. As Rafter walked away, Muster appeared to 
spit at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I was spitting," Muster said later. 
</P>
<P>
 Three games later he rubbed two tennis balls in the clay before throwing them 
to Rafter as the Australian was about to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just made them slower," he said in defense of his actions.  
</P>
<P>
 Rafter, 21, who reached the third round of Wimbledon last year and the third 
round of the Australian Open last January, said he enjoyed the show. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Rafter who was warned by Loconto after the Australian leaped over 
the net in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me to settle down a little bit," Rafter said. "I told him I wasn't 
too over-impressed about (Muster's) little drawing of the marking." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the niggling, Rafter and Muster played a hard-hitting match that 
turned on the Australian's tough serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time Muster tried to take control of the tempo, Rafter, who faces 
Bruguera next, came back with a big serve or a big volley.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; WILD THING HAS WILD HOMECOMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wild Thing was at it again Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, his team escaped the trouble he created. On the night of his return 
to Philadelphia, Mitch Williams hit a batter and walked another in the ninth 
inning, but the Houston Astros held on to beat the Phillies, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Williams, who has struggled this season after giving up the World 
Series-winning home run to Joe Carter last year, repeated his belief that the 
Astros are getting ready to release him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's time for Mitchy-poo to take it to the ranch," he said, referring 
to his cattle ranch in Hico, Tex. "The way it looks, I'm not going to be here 
past Monday. . . . I just threw bad. I haven't thrown good all year." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, traded to Houston on Dec. 2 after giving up the World Series-winning 
home run to Carter, was greeted by a standing ovation as he took the mound in 
the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 He promptly walked Jim Eisenreich, then hit Mickey Morandini in the back 
before getting Kim Batiste to fly to left. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston Manager Terry Collins saw enough and brought in rookie John Hudek, 
prompting boos from the 41,013 in Veterans Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Hudek struck out pinch-hitter Wes Chamberlain, loaded the bases with a walk to 
Lenny Dykstra, then got Mariano Duncan on a game-ending popout to first for his 
fifth save. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillie Manager Jim Fregosi admitted it was a little weird watching Williams 
pitch into trouble in the ninth. "I've seen it many times before but I wasn't 
thinking about Mitch," Fregosi said. "I was thinking about the game." 
</P>
<P>
 New York 10, Cincinnati 2 -- Pete Smith pitched an eight-hitter and Todd 
Hundley drove in three runs as the Mets beat the Reds at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith (3-5), who lost five of his last six decisions, struck out four and 
didn't allow a walk in his first complete game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 7, Chicago 2 -- Greg Maddux won his eighth game and David Justice hit 
a two-run homer as the Braves battered Mike Morgan and beat the Cubs at 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux (8-2) gave up five hits, two runs, walked two and struck out seven in 
seven innings. He won his fourth consecutive decision and the Braves won for 
the fifth time in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 4, Colorado 2 -- Rookie Gabe White pitched six strong innings in his 
major league debut as the Expos defeated the Rockies at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 White, a 22-year-old left-hander recalled from the minors on Friday, gave up 
four hits and struck out six before leaving for a pinch-hitter in the seventh. 
He gave up one hit and a walk through 3 1/3 innings before Andres Galarraga hit 
his 17th homer. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco 4, Florida 3 -- The first grand slam of John Patterson's career 
lifted the Giants to a victory at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson's grand slam off Dave Weathers (5-3) in the fifth inning brought the 
Giants back from a 1-0 deficit. Returning home from a 3-7 road trip, San 
Francisco won its third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 8, St. Louis 6 -- Phil Clark's homer led a barrage of six extra-base 
hits in two innings by the normally light-hitting Padres, who handed Cardinal 
ace Bob Tewksbury his second loss this season at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the worst outing of the year for Tewksbury (8-2).

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; NEW YORK PUT A QUICK END TO CONE'S STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Cone's 28-inning scoreless streak ended really fast Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl Boston hit a three-run homer in a five-run first inning, as Jimmy Key 
won his sixth consecutive decision to lead the New York Yankees past the Kansas 
City Royals, 5-2, at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Cone (8-2) was coming off three consecutive shutouts and was trying to become 
the first nine-game winner in the majors. But left fielder Vince Coleman had a 
double error in the first and Boston hit a three-run homer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did have a little bit of an emotional letdown," Cone said. "Boston's 
three-run homer was really the killer. You can't spot Jimmy Key five runs in 
the first inning and expect to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Cone pitched his fourth straight complete game, allowing eight hits, striking 
out two and walking two. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 5, Seattle 2 -- The Brewers ended their club record 14-game losing 
streak, beating the Mariners at Milwaukee on the strength of B.J. Surhoff's 
three-run homer in the eighth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee hadn't won since May 10, when the Brewers were tied for first place. 
The previous club record of 12 losses was set in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 3, Oakland 2 -- Paul Sorrento led off the ninth inning with his 
fifth home run of the season as the Indians beat the Athletics at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland, returning from a 2-4 trip, won its seventh consecutive home game 
since May 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 5, Detroit 2 -- Kevin Tapani won his fourth straight start and Scott 
Leius drove in three runs as the Twins won at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapani (5-2) allowed four hits in 7 1/3 innings, struck out five and walked 
none. Rick Aguilera pitched the ninth for his 10th save in 11 chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 3, Baltimore 0 -- Wilson Alvarez tied a White Sox record by winning 
his 15th consecutive decision, pitching a six-hitter as the White Sox won at 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarez (8-0) struck out six and walked none in his first shutout this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 4, Boston 3 -- Hector Fajardo, making his first start in three seasons, 
got his first big league victory as the Rangers rallied to beat the Red Sox at 
Arlington, Tex. Fajardo (1-0), who missed most of the last two seasons with arm 
trouble, gave up four hits in seven innings.

DIVISION III; LA QUINTA'S LIVERNOIS COOLS OFF ST. JOHN BOSCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Livernois didn't carry the world, a chip or the La Quinta High School 
baseball team on his shoulders Friday. Instead, he had fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs defeated Bellflower St. John Bosco, 11-2, to reach the Southern 
Section Division III semifinals Tuesday against Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Livernois, the sometimes-volatile, always-competitive senior pitcher, 
even the easy victories can fuel his fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday at La Quinta, however, he was almost tranquil. Livernois even had one 
bad inning, a customary flash point. But all he did was grin and bear it. 
</P>
<P>
 Livernois (13-3) went six innings, giving up four hits and two runs, for his 
37th victory, second-best total in Orange County history. 
</P>
<P>
 Heck, he didn't even mind being replaced by Steve Combs in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 "I handed Steve the ball and said, 'Go get 'em,' " said Livernois, who played 
center field the last inning. "He can do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the same guy who was angry about being pulled from a game after 
walking eight batters. The same guy who has fumed and fussed at times, even 
when things were going well. The same guy who dragged the the Aztecs to the 
Division III title game a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But that guy is relaxed now. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him, with all his accomplishments, he should be enjoying himself out 
there," Coach Dave Demarest said. "He enjoyed himself today." 
</P>
<P>
 Livernois, The Times player of the year last season, was handed a 5-0 lead in 
the first inning and had a ball. He allowed Gerry Bueno's leadoff single in the 
first, then retired the next 11 batters. Not one ball was hit out of the 
infield. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fifth, the Braves (20-7) twice loaded the bases. They scratched out two 
runs to pull within, 5-2. Livernois got Ryan Williams to pop out to end the 
inning, then pumped his fist as he ran off the field smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I walked a couple guys or else they wouldn't have scored any runs," 
Livernois said. "It was fun out there." 
</P>
<P>
 That La Quinta (26-3) scored five runs in the first certainly helped. The 
Aztecs' first six batters reached base before Braves center fielder Ryan 
Williams made a sliding catch of Corey Fox's line drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Livernois and Sean Carlson had run-scoring singles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting ahead early certainly helps," Livernois said. "You can relax and 
pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 He could put his feet up when the Aztecs scored six in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson, a senior first baseman, led off the inning with a home run to right 
field, which took the fight out of the Braves. It also took the legs out from 
under Carlson; he fell on his face after touching first base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was watching the ball and my knee locked up," Carlson said. "But I got to 
see it go over the fence before I fell. It would have been a lot more 
embarrassing had I fallen on a fly out." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was an eager Livernois waiting to greet Carlson at home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "First I asked him, 'How can you fall down on a home run,' " Livernois said. 
"I then told him thanks for getting us excited again and helping me out."

DIVISION I; LAKEWOOD MAKES THE MOST OF MATER DEI'S POOR DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sound defense and ace pitcher Adam Harris are usually enough to send Mater Dei 
baseball fans home happy. Unfortunately for the Monarchs, they lost half of 
their winning formula when they needed it most. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei committed four errors that led to four unearned runs, which were too 
much for Harris to overcome in an 8-5 loss to Lakewood in the Southern Section 
Division I quarterfinals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-seeded, Moore League-champion Lancers (23-6) play Sherman Oaks 
Notre Dame on Tuesday in the semifinals at Blair Field in Long Beach. South 
Coast League-champion Mater Dei (18-9-1) is the second Orange County team to 
have its season ended by Lakewood. The Lancers routed Katella, 14-1, in the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just didn't make some plays," Mater Dei Coach Bob Ickes said. "It was hard 
for our guys to get their timing down on this field because it's a lot slower 
than ours. We knew we had to make some adjustments and attack the ball more." 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs' problems began in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading, 1-0, with one out, shortstop Erik Mattern made consecutive errors 
that allowed two runs to score. Usually a slick fielder, Mattern made 
successive wild throws to first base while hurrying to field balls that seemed 
to slow down significantly as they rolled toward him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei tied the score in the fourth when Mike Waugh singled to drive in 
Matt Treanor. Treanor, who doubled to open the inning, provided a spark for 
Mater Dei, going three for four with two doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lakewood scored three runs in the bottom of the inning to take a 5-2 lead, 
scoring one of its runs on Mattern's third error. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were putting my best pitches in play," said Harris, who finished the 
season 9-2. "They're real good hitters." 
</P>
<P>
 But just when it looked as though the Lancers had things in control, they 
started looking foolish in the field, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakewood allowed Mater Dei to tie the score, 5-5, with three runs in the top 
of the fifth -- on one hit. Right fielder Art Martinez and center fielder Jon 
Weber dropped fly balls that would have enabled the Lancers to get out of the 
inning unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our right fielder has been with us for two years, and he's never dropped a 
ball before," Lakewood Coach Spud O'Neil said. "He usually plays great defense 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The miscues provided some momentary mental relief for Harris. His comfort 
zone, however, would leave as quickly as a booted ground ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris gave up another run in the fifth inning when first baseman Tim Wetzel 
couldn't handle a sharp grounder hit by Weber. 
</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs' final error helped chase Harris from the game. Mattern relieved 
him and gave up another run in the inning and one in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei made things interesting in the seventh by getting runners to second 
and third with two outs. But Steve Immel (8-1), who relieved starter Luke 
Fitzpatrick in the sixth inning, got Waugh to pop out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have really liked to go out winning my last one," said Harris, a 
senior who has committed to Stanford. "But I guess most of us don't get to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 In another Division I game: 
</P>
<P>
 Crescenta Valley 4, El Dorado 3 -- Benito Flores' double in the third inning 
drove in two runs for El Dorado (21-8). Crescenta Valley (19-5) responded 
scoring four runs in the fourth. Jesse Mitchell's single at the top of the 
fourth scored the winning run for the Falcons.

DIVISION II; TEMECULA VALLEY LEAVES CANYON STUCK AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "what ifs" piled up pretty quickly in the last two innings as Canyon lost 
to Temecula Valley, 5-2, in a Southern Section Division II quarterfinal 
baseball game Friday at Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 1 question: What would have happened had Eric Valent completed his 
seventh-inning at-bat? 
</P>
<P>
 Valent, Canyon's No. 3 hitter who had six home runs and drove in 35 runs this 
season, was the potential tying run when he came up with two on and two out. 
</P>
<P>
 With the count one ball and two strikes, pitcher Kevin Wyatt threw a ball that 
went off the glove of catcher Roddy Friar. Canyon's baserunners started toward 
second and third but were trapped when Friar quickly recovered and ran toward 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey Wilson was tagged out to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sort of ran ourselves out of that last inning," Canyon Coach Mike Najera 
said. "I guess we were a little impatient." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and Darren Chandler had singled with two outs to bring up Valent. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to wonder what would have happened with Valent up there," Temecula 
Valley Coach Rich Emard said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second consecutive year that Temecula Valley has beaten Canyon in 
the quarterfinal round at Canyon. Last year, the score was 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon also missed a chance in the sixth. Valent, who had two hits, already 
had scored on a wild pitch to cut the lead to 5-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Lopez was up with two outs and chopped a ball up the middle. On the 
swing, Lopez appeared to have made contact with catcher Friar's glove but none 
of the three umpires saw or heard it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez beat the play at first but Josh Gutierrez, who was on second when the 
play started, was thrown out trying for the plate. Had catcher's interference 
been called, there would have been two on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely catcher's interference," Najera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temecula Valley's Jason Gause did a majority of the damage to Canyon (22-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Gause had a two-run double in the sixth to put the Bears ahead, 4-1. He also 
scored on the play when the relay throw, intended for third base, went into the 
Canyon dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth, Gause was up with two outs and runners on second and third. 
Canyon starter Gunnar Strunz was ahead in the count, one ball and two strikes. 
Strunz threw a fastball that was called a ball, although it appeared it could 
have just as easily been called Strike 3. 
</P>
<P>
 On the next pitch, Gause lined a single to center to put Temecula Valley 
ahead, 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon had scored its first run in the second when Strunz doubled in the gap 
in left-center and Todd Wyatt followed with an RBI single to right. 
</P>
<P>
 Strunz (5-2) gave up five hits and five runs, four earned, in 5 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Wyatt (11-2) gave up nine hits in the complete-game victory. Temecula 
Valley (20-8), which has won 11 of its last 12 games, will play Cerritos Gahr 
in the semifinals Tuesday.

PONCHAK'S GRAND SLAM HELPS FOUNTAIN VALLEY POUND SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kary Kozlowski said the fateful pitch he threw to Fountain Valley High's Chris 
Ponchak was "up and away," a reference to the ball's location in the strike 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 He was right. And then some. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was an OK pitch," Kozlowski said. "I didn't even think it was a 
strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Up, up and away also described the ball's trajectory after Ponchak muscled it 
over the right-field fence for a grand slam. Fountain Valley's ascent likewise 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak's slam sparked a five-run first inning and right-hander Luke Hudson 
pitched five scoreless innings as Fountain Valley pounded Simi Valley, 12-1, in 
a Southern Section Division I quarterfinal Friday at Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley, the top-seeded team in the division, will face La Crescenta 
Crescenta Valley in the semifinals at 7 p.m. Tuesday at Blair Field in Long 
Beach. Crescenta Valley (19-5) beat El Dorado, 4-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak, a burly junior, couldn't help but think about the long ball when he 
walked into Simi Valley's cozy ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to keep (the size of the field) out of my head," Ponchak said, 
grinning. "Sometimes, when you get in a little park, it gets to you and you try 
to hit everything out. That can mess you up." 
</P>
<P>
 Kozlowski (8-1) entered the game with eight consecutive scoreless innings in 
postseason play. Fountain Valley (25-3-1) messed that up in a hurry. The first 
three batters singled to load the bases and a one-out single from Dan Hoppie 
gave the Barons a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 With two outs, Kozlowski threw a 2-and-2 fastball to Ponchak, who hit it onto 
the Simi Valley football field. Before the blast, Kozlowski was one pitch from 
escaping the jam with minimal damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I was 400 feet from getting the third out," Kozlowski said, dejectedly. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-run lead didn't seem all that large when Hudson (8-1) wobbled through 
the first inning. The junior right-hander walked two and threw three wild 
pitches to put runners at second and third with one out. 
</P>
<P>
 Clean-up hitter Bryan Wall then sent a fly ball to medium right field, but Tim 
Nykoluk was thrown out at the plate on a 9-3-2 relay for an inning-ending 
double play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the thing to do in the first inning," said interim Simi Valley Coach 
Russ Stephans, whose team lost for the first time in seven games since he took 
over for the suspended Mike Scyphers. "No question, with your leadoff hitter 
(Nykoluk) on third, you send him." 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley added two runs in the second and three in the third to take a 
10-0 lead. Hudson He allowed three singles, walked five and struck out four in 
five innings before he was replaced.

HIGH SCHOOL TRACK / MASTERS' MEET; SPEED PAYS FOR HOWARD, WHO CASHES IN ON 
SPRINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bryan Howard is enjoying his status as the nation's top high school sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the 200 meters at the Southern Section Division I finals last 
week, the Moreno Valley Canyon Springs junior collected $500 for a bet with his 
grandfather, Harold Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Howard bet his grandson he could not break 21 seconds in the 200. 
Bryan's 20.76 last week is the nation's fastest prep time this season. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the 100 and 200 at the Southern Section Masters' meet Friday 
night at Cerritos College, Howard reflected on an enjoyable week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got the check and put half in the bank and spent the other half on a new 
set of speakers," he said. "Getting that money has been a real motivation. I 
wanted to break 21." 
</P>
<P>
 That motivation continued Friday night when Howard edged rival Pat Johnson of 
Redlands in the 100 and 200 with times of 10.44 and 20.98 seconds, 
respectively. The two traded victories in several meets earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Team scores were not kept Friday, but the top five finishers in each event 
qualified for the State meet, next Friday and Saturday at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard is the defending State champion in the 100 and runner-up in the 200. He 
said he has never felt stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've fully recovered from my hip injury earlier this season, and I've been 
getting stronger each week," he said. "I expect great times at State." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Howard will be the sprint favorite next weekend, Pasadena Muir is 
expected to win the boys' team title. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs had few disappointments Friday, winning the 400 and 1,600 relays. 
Hurdler Ken Haslip slipped to a surprising second in the 110 highs, but avenged 
the loss with a first-place finish an hour later in the 300 intermediates. 
</P>
<P>
 Obea Moore, a Muir freshman, was expected to run 400 because he had the 
fastest qualifying entry time of 47.79. But Moore scratched in the event to run 
the 800, and finished third in 1:52.91. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Granville of Bell Gardens won the 800 in 1:50.76, a week after he set 
a national sophomore record of 1:48.98. 
</P>
<P>
 In the girls' competition, Aminah Haddad of Long Beach Poly helped make her 
team the early State favorite with victories in the 100, 200 and on the 1,600 
relay. Teammate Andrea Anderson, nursing a hamstring injury, finished third in 
the 100 and 200. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanna Hayes of Riverside North set the meet's only record, a 14.34-second 
clocking in the 100 low hurdles, breaking the old mark of 14.5 set by Cheaza 
Figueroa of Quartz Hill last year. Hayes also won the 300 low hurdles in 43.31.

TRACK / NAIA CHAMPIONSHIPS; AZUSA PACIFIC GETS LEAD IT WANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific's men's track and field team needed to score most of its points 
on Friday to have much chance of winning the National Assn. of Intercollegiate 
Athletics Track and Field outdoor championship this weekend at Azusa Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 It did. 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific, which has a limited number of competitors today, has 62 points, 
19 more than second-place Western Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
 If Azusa Pacific can maintain its advantage, it will win its 10th NAIA title. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did about as good as we could do today," Azusa Pacific Coach Terry Franson 
said. "This allows some room for us tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly important were strong performances in the shotput, decathlon and 
triple-jump.  
</P>
<P>
 Rene Bustamante won the shot-put at 57 feet 6 inches.  
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific's David Pope and Tage Peterson finished second and third in the 
decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Li won the long jump for Azusa Pacific with a jump of 52-10, more than a 
foot longer than his season best of 51-9. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's competition, Doane (Neb.) took a 45-34 lead over Wisconsin 
Parkside. Azusa Pacific is in fifth with 25 1/2. ARA NAJARIAN

SOFTBALL / COLLEGE WORLD SERIES; NORTHRIDGE TAKES STEP CLOSER TO SHOWDOWN WITH 
ARIZONA

<P>
 Although there are at least six games to play before the championship game of 
the Women's College World Series, many are already gearing up for a possible 
Monday final between favorites Arizona and Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams took another step toward that matchup with second-round victories 
Friday in front of 2,793 at Hall of Fame Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-ranked Northridge (51-8) jumped on Utah in the first inning with Beth 
Calcante's two-run home run and never looked back in a 5-1 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors' eight-hit performance reinforced Utah Coach Jo Evans' opinion of 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Northridge is a great team," Evans said. "They have great pitching, they're 
solid defensively and they hit the ball like crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're going to give Arizona a great game. I couldn't say who's 
going to come out and win that one because I think they can both compete.' 
</P>
<P>
 Utah is 51-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona defeated Fresno State, 3-0, in another game of Series unbeatens.

BASEBALL / NCAA REGIONALS; FLORES SHUTS OUT TULANE TO KEEP USC UNBEATEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 USC left-hander Randy Flores continued the nation's most impressive freshman 
season Friday night by shutting out Tulane, 5-0, in the second round of the 
NCAA South Regional at Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, a walk-on from El Rancho High in Pico Rivera, gave up six hits, struck 
out five and walked two in his fourth shutout and sixth complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't find out I was pitching until about an hour before we left the hotel 
for the game, so there was no tossing and turning last night when I went to 
sleep," said Flores, who improved to 11-1 and lowered his earned-run average to 
1.66. "I didn't have rhythm with all my pitches in the first three innings, but 
I got more comfortable as the game went on." 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Boone had a two-run single in the second inning and Jacque Jones drove 
in two runs with a bases-loaded single in the eighth for USC, which plays 
defending national champion Louisiana State today. If USC wins, the Trojans 
will be one victory away from advancing to Omaha for the College World Series 
for the first time since 1978. If they lose to LSU, they will play again 
tonight against the winner of the game between Tulane and North Carolina 
Greensboro. 
</P>
<P>
 In other games involving Southland teams, three Cal State Fullerton pitchers 
combined on a six-hitter and the Titans took advantage of six errors to defeat 
Northwestern (La.) State, 11-3, in the first round of the Midwest I Regional at 
Stillwater, Okla. Fullerton plays today against Texas Christian, an 11-3 winner 
Friday over Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington defeated Long Beach State, 10-4, in the first round of the Midwest 
II Regional at Wichita, Kan. Long Beach plays Connecticut, a 7-0 loser to 
Georgia Tech, today in an elimination game. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington overcame a 3-0 deficit by scoring six unearned runs in the fourth 
inning.

THIRD PLACE A CHARM FOR WOODBRIDGE SPRINTER YOUNG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELANIE NEFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most athletes would be disappointed to always finish in third. Sprinter Gary 
Young of Woodbridge is just the opposite. He uses it as motivation to do 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 Young ran in the 100- and 200-meter races Friday night at the Masters Meet at 
Cerritos College and came in third in each, behind Bryan Howard of Moreno 
Valley Canyon Springs and Pat Johnson of Redlands, the two top high school 
sprinters in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing new to me," Young said. "It's fun running against those guys. It 
gives me confidence. I'm always catching them at the end, I just run out of 
room." 
</P>
<P>
 The third-place finishes qualified Young for the State meet June 3-4 at 
Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I accomplished what I wanted here," Young said. "When State rolls around, 
it's going to be a great race." 
</P>
<P>
 Young finished the 100 in 10.81, behind Howard (10.44), and Johnson (10.61). 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disappointed in my 100. It was my own fault," Young said. "I didn't get 
a chance to warm up. I had a great start, but the next thing I knew my legs 
weren't turning like they should." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 200, Young ran a 21.71. Howard finished in 20.98 and Johnson 21.38. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get tired of looking at their backs," Young said. "Just once, I wish they 
would have to look at mine." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, a senior, is new to the spotlight this season. In his sophomore year, 
he just missed the cut for the Southern Section finals and then in his junior 
year, a nerve problem, which caused his foot to go numb, took him out of action 
before the Sea View League finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really rewarding for him. He was nowhere around last year," 
Woodbridge Coach George Varvas said. "He is probably the best sprinter we have 
ever had and one of the best in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Young intends to be the best. He currently holds the top times in the county 
in the 100 (10.52, wind-aided) and the 200 (21.39). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to break both Orange County records next week at State," Young 
said. "I'm nipping at their heals." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Martin of San Clemente set the 100 record (10.56) in 1991. Marina's Chip 
Rish set the 200 record (21.01) in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the times and I know I can do it," Young said. "I'm just going to have 
to get out of the blocks harder than ever before."

SOUTHERN SECTION MASTERS TRACK AND FIELD; HEADS, TIFT AND GONZALES LEAD WAY TO 
STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't tell Newport Harbor throwing coach Tony Ciarelli that three is a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Sailor throwers Wade Tift, Steve Gonzales and Gina Heads advanced to next 
week's State meet by finishing in the top five in their events. 
</P>
<P>
 Tift, who finished fourth in the shot put last season at State, cruised to 
victory Friday in the Masters Meet at Cerritos College. The UCLA-bound senior 
put the shot 59 feet 8 1/2 inches on his second of four attempts to win by over 
two feet. Phil Fonua of Manhattan Beach Mira Costa finished second (57-5). 
</P>
<P>
 "I just came in here hoping that I could make it to the State meet," said 
Tift, who has lost only twice this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have got a lot more in me. I just need to hit the right positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Heads, who finished second in the shot put and discus, advanced to the State 
meet for the fourth consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stanford-bound senior launched a personal best of 143-1 on her third throw 
to finish behind Nadia Lopez of Arroyo Grande (151-11). Heads' 44-8 1/2 for 
mark in the shot put was good for second. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gina's definitely the veteran of the group,' said Ciarelli, quick to point 
out that his star joined the track team in late February after fulfilling 
commitments on the Sailors' State tournament-qualifying basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Heads: "I had a good week of practice, so I was hoping to maybe open some 
eyes today." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales, the reigning county and Sea View League champion, finished second in 
the discus, tossing 169-4 on his opening throw. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the beginning, we've been working toward getting to State, so I'm 
happy," Gonzales said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A first and three seconds at the Masters Meet . . . that's about as good as 
you can get," Ciarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other county highlights included: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Buena Park senior Carrie Garritson, who finished second in the 1,600 
(5:01.90) and won the 3,200 (10:45.52). 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to break five minutes in the mile and I came here just to qualify in 
the two-(mile)," Garritson said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Edison's Julie Koudelka, the Southern Section Division I and county 
champion, out-kicked Laguna Hills junior Tiffany Boykin to win the 800 in 
2:12.99. Boykin was second in a personal best of 2:13.83. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh my gosh, I can't believe it, a four-second PR," said Koudelka, whose 
previous best was 2:16.40 in last week's divisional race. Santa Margarita 
freshman Katie Nuanes (fourth in 2:15.41) and Esperanza junior Courtney Pugmire 
(fifth in 2:15.50) also posted personal bests in moving on to next week's State 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Orange senior Jaime Martinez dominated the 3,200 from the opening gun, 
racing to a personal best time of 9:06.08. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the competition is going be here next week, so as soon as I can get 
some company up there, I'll be ready to go," said the Century League and 
section Division III winner in the event. 
</P>

SOUTHERN SECTION INDIVIDUAL BOYS' TENNIS CHAMPIONSHIPS; TOP DOUBLES TEAMS TAKE 
A BEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Tim Mang knew he might be in for some trouble when he made out the Southern 
Section individual doubles draw. But he couldn't have figured it would turn out 
this bad: after two rounds, all four seeded teams are history. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year in doubles, forget it," said Mang, Corona del Mar's tennis coach 
and a member of the seeding committee. "Just like at Ojai, anybody could beat 
anybody. We proved it right here." 
</P>
<P>
 University's Jason Meyers and Robbie Wilkins proved a No. 1 seeding doesn't 
mean much as they easily upended Santa Barbara's Jimmy Walker and Ian Carrera, 
6-2, 6-2, in the quarterfinals Friday at Seacliff Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys won Ojai, but they never played us," Meyers said. "Seeding doesn't 
mean anything. Who cares? They drew us, which is tough luck for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpinteria Cate's Jon Chang and Shep Smith, the second-seeded team, also had 
some tough luck when they drew San Clemente's Daniel Roditi and Jeff Shoemaker 
in the first round. Roditi and Shoemaker are both coming off injuries, but they 
showed Friday they are quickly rounding into form. They beat Chang and Smith, 
6-3, 3-6, 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 They then took apart Diamond Bar's Mark Yeh and Sangay Roy, 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the seeds and I knew that once we got past the first round, it'd be 
easier in the second round," said Roditi, who won the tournament two years ago 
with Jeff Marsden. "I was kind of surprised when the seedings came out. I don't 
know who does them, but so much for the seedings." 
</P>
<P>
 Roditi and Shoemaker will play Corona del Mar's unseeded team of Jed Weinstein 
and Tyler Stonebreaker, who upset Dos Pueblos' third-seeded team of Omar 
Atesman and Bryan Golledge, 6-1, 6-4, in this morning's 10:30 semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers and Wilkins will play Corona's Darren Auld and Dave Robles, who knocked 
out fourth-seeded Bryan Johnson and Nolan Cooper of Trabuco Hills, in the other 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 As crazy as the doubles draw went, the singles draw was rather predictable. 
All four seeded players are still alive and none had any serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Nathan Jackmon of Santa Barbara will play fourth-seeded Sandy 
Gentile of Temple City in one semifinal and third-seeded Geoff Abrams of 
Newport Harbor plays Jakub Pietrowski of Ocean View in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackmon struggled briefly with Sunny Hills' Joseph Gilbert before winning, 
7-5, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert trailed 5-2 before breaking Jackmon twice and tying the game score, 
5-5. But Jackmon held his serve and finished out the set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really thought I had a put away at 30-30, but he got that lob on me and 
then another one," Gilbert said. "I was sort of thinking about that first set 
during the second set. I was kind of down. I should have just forgotten about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pietrowski, who reached the semifinals last year, had the easiest time of the 
seeded players by losing only 10 games in four sets. Villa Park's Ryan Hollis 
was Pietrowski's first victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the one person I didn't want," Hollis said. "It's so unfortunate. I was 
playing so well. He's so fast and he gets to everything. He has no flaws in his 
game. I'd put my money on him to win."

COMMUNITY COLLEGE STATE BASEBALL PLAYOFFS; MINICI MAKES A DEAL, AND IT BENEFITS 
RANCHO SANTIAGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jason Minici was a member of Rancho Santiago's team that won the State 
baseball championship last season. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit .329 and drove in 19 runs, but down the stretch Minici's role was 
reduced to pinch-hitter and reserve outfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 After the season, Minici said he made a deal with himself to work harder than 
ever, so that if the Dons made it back to the tournament, his memories would be 
made in the field and not on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a really hard challenge for me," Minici said about being on the bench. 
"But that was where I really learned about the savvy part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Minici contributed a home run last Friday to help Rancho Santiago beat Los 
Angeles Harbor, 2-0, and start the Dons toward the regional title that earned 
them a berth in the State tournament, which starts today at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 His recent success can be traced to last summer, when Minici went to work to 
make sure he was going to be in the lineup on a full-time basis. Minici, a 
football and baseball standout at Irvine High School, was already in good shape 
but wanted to make sure he was in excellent condition. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent his summer working as an umpire in an age-group summer league at 
Rancho Santiago and between games he lifted weights, ran and took fly balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Minici had been a starting catcher since he was 10, but began last season 
splitting time with Darren Troilo at catcher. Minici was later asked to move to 
left field by Coach Don Sneddon, so both could be in the lineup at the same 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Troilo was a freshman and would be back this season, so Minici continued to 
work on his outfield play. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times last season when I was a wreck out there," Minici said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the summer, he improvised a batting tee out of an orange traffic cone and 
spent about an hour most nights hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 Minici saw the results of his work over the fall and winter when he was among 
the Dons' most productive hitters. His performance drew the interest of several 
colleges. When his success continued into the season, Long Beach State made a 
scholarship offer and he accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an old-fashion self-made ballplayer," Sneddon said. "He's a very 
dedicated athlete who might not be the most talented guy but has earned every 
honor he's gotten through his hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 Minici is hitting .374 with nine home runs and has driven in 39 runs and 
scored 49 this season. He has 12 doubles and four triples and will be starting 
in left field today when Rancho Santiago (38-11) plays Chabot (33-12) at 11 
a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited," Minici said. "I can't wait. I doubt I'm going to be able to 
sleep the night before."

COURT: O.C. CHEERLEADER A VICTIM OF BIAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY and DAVAN MAHARAJ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appeals court ruled Friday that an Irvine high school student was 
wrongly excluded from cheerleading for failing a class, and that cheerleaders 
cannot be held to a higher academic standard than athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we sympathize with the attempt to impose high academic standards on 
cheerleaders, the distinction between cheerleading and athletics cannot pass," 
wrote Presiding Justice David Sills for the unanimous 4th District Court of 
Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's decision could have far-reaching implications because it was 
certified for publication, meaning that it can be cited as a precedent in 
subsequent lawsuits against other school districts in the state. Many districts 
in Orange County and elsewhere set higher grade standards for cheerleaders than 
for athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 The court awarded legal costs to Melissa Fontes, a former cheerleaders captain 
at Woodbridge High School and now a college student in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Unified School District's board of trustees will meet Tuesday night 
to decide if they should petition the state Supreme Court to review the 
appellate court's ruling. Less than 10% of these petitions are granted. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one board member said Friday night that she will vote to appeal to 
the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the principle of the thing," said Margie Wakeham, a school board member 
for nine years. "I'm enormously disappointed because it's not a 
sex-discrimination issue, but it's an issue of two different activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Wakeham's son, Dean, was an offensive tackle and president of the student body 
at Irvine High before he accepted a football scholarship to Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheerleaders are semi-ambassadors of the schools, and that is why they are 
held to a higher standard," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another school board member, Michael B. Regele, said he was "a little 
surprised" by the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The California Interscholastic Federation sets the policy for athletes, and 
we set the policy for cheerleaders and other activities," he said. "That made a 
lot of sense to us then, and it make a lot of sense now." 
</P>
<P>
 An appeal to the state Supreme Court "is certainly an option," Regele said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Parham, a lawyer for the Irvine school district, acknowledged that if 
left intact, the decision means that school districts in California cannot have 
disparate standards for non-academic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Parham, who was a football coach at University High in Irvine before becoming 
a lawyer, said he was disappointed at the justices' decision, calling it 
"judicial activism at its worst." 
</P>
<P>
 "Here you have judges who are substituting their opinion for the opinion of 
the school board," Parham said. "It's a witty, well-written opinion, but they 
misunderstand their role. They should leave it to the politicians to set these 
standards. That's why we elected them." 
</P>
<P>
 Parham said the district set higher academic requirements for cheerleaders 
because they are "leaders" in their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pep squad members are leaders who are held to a higher academic standard so 
people will look up to them," Parham said. "The district believes that people 
who are on front stage are people who are performing well academically." 
</P>
<P>
 Fontes could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 She was excluded from the cheerleader squad in the fall of 1990, after failing 
a chemistry course. Although her overall grade-point average was 2.9 out of a 
possible 4.0, the Irvine Unified School District maintain a "no F" requirement 
for cheerleaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletes were required to maintain a 2.0 average, and pass at least four 
courses in the previous quarter. Non-academic activities, such as cheerleading 
and student government, required a 2.5 average and no failures. 
</P>
<P>
 In her suit against the school district, Fontes challenged what she said were 
unequal standards, but did not ask for any monetary damages. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-day trial, which was heard without a jury, Superior Court Judge 
Robert Gardner dismissed Fontes' challenge in a biting decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sorry vehicle to advance a worthy cause," Gardner wrote. "Anyone 
can get a D, but it takes an all-out application of irresponsibility to get an 
F," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 But the appeals court found Fontes' point had merit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Interscholastic sports and cheerleading are both non-academic extracurricular 
activities," the court said. "There is nothing about cheerleading that makes it 
qualitatively any more or less scholarly than football, baseball or some other 
sport." 
</P>
<P>
 The justices emphasized that they had no intention of making school policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Their ruling, wrote Sills, "does not mean the school board must necessarily 
lower the standards for the pep squad. They could raise them for the athletes. 
That choice is left to the district." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not attempting to micromanage school activities," wrote Justice Sheila 
Prell Sonenshine, in a concurring opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Sills and Sonenshine strongly defended cheerleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheerleading is not so much less intellectually challenging than football or 
basketball that the latter two can be said to be 'academic' while cheerleading 
is not," Sonenshine said. "There is an obvious rational basis for supporting 
academic eligibility requirements for sports, if only to keep a sense of 
proportion between the basic aims of education and the collateral benefits of 
interscholastic athletics. The tail should not wag the dog."

OVERTON IS JAILED UNTIL NEW TRIAL; COURTS: JUDGE SAYS ENOUGH EVIDENCE EXISTS OF 
THE DANA POINT MAN'S GUILT IN HIS WIFE'S DEATH TO REVOKE BAIL. HIS ATTORNEY 
SAYS THE RULING CREATES THE APPEARANCE THAT GUILT IS A FOREGONE CONCLUSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An Orange County judge Friday revoked the $100,000 bond for a Dana Point 
computer consultant accused of poisoning his wife with cyanide, ruling that 
there is enough evidence of Richard K. Overton's guilt that he should await his 
second trial behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Overton, 66 -- who denies any involvement in the Jan. 24, 1988, death of his 
wife, Janet, a popular trustee of the Capistrano Unified School District -- 
appeared stunned and bewildered by the decision Friday as deputies led him 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 The development added yet another strange twist to one of Orange County's most 
complex and unusual murder cases. Overton's first case ended in an August 
mistrial after an unprecedented, yearlong recess, when Overton's first attorney 
suffered a mental breakdown and accused his client of perjury. An appellate 
court removed the attorney and later removed the trial judge as well, ordering 
a fresh start for Overton's second trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans had sought the bail revocation hearing 
because of the seriousness of the charges and changes in state law that 
restrict bail in the most serious of murders -- so-called "special 
circumstance" murders. In Overton's case, prosecutors said that the special 
circumstances were murder by poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Richard Schwartzberg argued that Overton should remain free 
on bond -- as he has for much of the case -- because there is evidence that 
Overton may be found innocent of the charges. Schwartzberg noted that Overton 
has made all his court appearances and is not a flight risk. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald rejected those 
arguments, saying there is sufficient evidence of Overton's guilt to warrant a 
bail revocation. Fitzgerald scheduled a Nov. 14 trial date, but told defense 
attorneys he would set an earlier hearing to review any evidence that points to 
their client's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are taking these charges very seriously," Evans said outside of court. 
"The state of the law is (Overton) is not entitled to bail." 
</P>
<P>
 But Schwartzberg said outside of court that the defense team will be hampered 
in its preparations for trial, adding that Overton's jailing unfairly creates 
the appearance that his guilt is a foregone conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an enormous burden to us, having a case as complicated as this and 
having a client who is unavailable to us," Schwartzberg said. "I am very 
disturbed that people who know he has been taken into custody will assume he is 
guilty and assume that there is all this evidence against him, and that is not 
the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Janet L. Overton died Jan. 24, 1988, after collapsing in her driveway. An 
initial autopsy failed to uncover a cause of death. Six months later, one of 
Overton's previous wives told investigators that Overton had once tried to 
poison her and suggested they check the dead woman's body for signs of poison. 
</P>
<P>
 Another examination uncovered traces of cyanide in Janet Overton's body. 
Prosecutors then filed charges alleging that Overton had killed his wife 
because he was upset over her extramarital affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Overton admitted lacing his first wife's coffee with prescription drugs, 
calling it a "neat joke." But he has repeatedly denied any role in Janet 
Overton's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys told Fitzgerald on Friday that their expert witnesses will 
testify the cyanide found in Janet Overton's stomach was not the result of a 
poisoning, but a byproduct of medication she was taking at the time of her 
death. The prosecution disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual twists and turns of the case continue to drag it out. Overton's 
first trial attorney, Robert D. Chatterton, began suffering from depression in 
the midst of the 1992 trial. 
</P>
<P>
 He also told Orange County Superior Court Judge David O. Carter that his 
client had tampered with evidence and lied on the witness stand, allegations 
that have not been substantiated. The complications resulted in a yearlong 
recess in the middle of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4th District Court of Appeal in August removed the attorney from the case, 
and also concluded that the lengthy delay could lead jurors to unfairly decide 
the case. In response, Carter declared a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
 Overton's new attorney, George A. Peters Jr., then sought to remove Carter 
from the case, contending that the first trial may have prejudiced the judge. 
Carter resisted, arguing that a new trial before a new judge would cause 
further delays and expense. 
</P>
<P>
 But the same court of appeal in February removed Carter from the case, which 
has since been assigned to Fitzgerald.

VOLUNTEERISM IN VALLEY PLUNGES AFTER QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Count hundreds of Girl Scouts and Girl Scout hopefuls among the victims of the 
Jan. 17 earthquake. Ever since then, the number of adults offering to lead and 
help with troops in the Central and West Valley are down by almost 75%, 
according to the San Fernando Valley Girl Scout Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is much the same for the Big Brothers of Greater Los Angeles, 
the San Fernando Valley Interfaith Council and the Volunteer Center of the San 
Fernando Valley, the Valley's main clearinghouse for people who want to donate 
their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Valley, many organizations that want your time more than your 
money are reporting an alarming drop-off following the Northridge quake -- a 
trend unmatched in metropolitan Los Angeles with the exception of a few 
organizations. Although all charities have been hurt significantly by the 
lingering recession, Valley organizations that rely on committed volunteers say 
they are not getting nearly enough help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inquiries are down and we're attributing it partly to people's financial 
situation and their emotional situation after the quake," said Amy Diamond of 
Big Brothers of Greater Los Angeles. "They're just not feeling very giving 
right now, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 At Big Sisters of Los Angeles, administrators said they are feeling the same 
pinch in both the Valley and the rest of Los Angeles. Inquiries about the 
program, which serves about 325 girls in Los Angeles County, are down about 13% 
from this time last year, said Carol Holben, the Big Sisters' director of 
program services. 
</P>
<P>
 "People still have the impulse, but a lot of their initial desire to help was 
funneled into agencies that helped with the quake," Holben said. "It's been 
harder for people to make an ongoing commitment because it's like their lives 
are still uncertain." 
</P>
<P>
 And for the Valley, where there has been a growing reliance on volunteers to 
supplement shrinking social service budgets, the situation is particularly 
stark. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had sufficient social and human services to begin with in the area," 
said Sally Hoover, a senior planner with United Way's North Angeles Region, 
which includes most of the areas hardest hit by the quake. "But now the needs 
are even greater and the gap between the two are wider. The numbers of 
volunteers are dropping off at a time when the needs are high." 
</P>
<P>
 In an average year, the Valley's Volunteer Center places as many as 50,000 
individuals, groups and corporate teams with the organizations that need their 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the quake, numbers of new recruits have tumbled 20% to 25%, 
estimated Alethea Ludowitz, one of the center's directors. In contrast, the 
Volunteer Center of Los Angeles has seen little in the way of drop-off, said 
Sandra Lopez, director of Volunteer Services. 
</P>
<P>
 For individual volunteers between 18 and 55, the drop has been even more 
pronounced, according to the Volunteer Center's Carlos Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is that the traditional source of recruits -- the more affluent 
West Valley -- was among the hardest hit by the temblor. People who used to 
have the most time on their hands to help, he said, are the same ones who now 
are forced to use every spare moment to reconstruct their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Girl Scouts in the West Valley are perhaps the worst off -- in contrast to 
the Angeles Girl Scout Council, which serves metropolitan Los Angeles and had a 
only a three-week drop-off in new recruits following the quake. Likewise, the 
Boy Scouts in the Valley and elsewhere were largely unaffected. 
</P>
<P>
 Scouting requires an ever-replenished pool of volunteers because groups are 
small, local and fluid. Girl Scout troops are usually composed of 15 girls, two 
or three leaders and two to four support volunteers, said Chris Edwards, the 
San Fernando Valley Council's membership and marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical period of January through May, the Valley's Girl Scout Council 
needs 100 to 200 new troop leaders and support volunteers from Northridge and 
surrounding areas to help serve the Valley Council's 7,000 girls. But from the 
quake until now, Edwards said, no more than 50 have volunteered.  
</P>
<P>
 "People are recuperating, they're catching their breath," Edwards said. "But 
Girl Scouting is in the business of serving girls and meeting their needs. 
These numbers mean there are 1,000 or more girls that didn't get touched this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley's Interfaith Council, a network of about 270 congregations that run 
a variety of volunteer programs, has experienced a 20% decrease in volunteers 
following the quake. The new recruits who have appeared have not made up for 
those people forced to leave the group to deal with the destruction wrought to 
their own lives, said Barry Smedberg, the council's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the casualties is the Meals on Wheels program, which is being cut back. 
The number of volunteers who use their own cars to deliver meals to people with 
disabilities has declined 35% to 40%. To compensate, Smedberg said, those 
remaining volunteers have been asked to double their load and work longer 
hours. New clients requesting meals have been turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases we've had to deliver every other day to at least get them some 
meals," Smedberg said. "They probably don't eat that day" when there is no 
delivery, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 New recruits for Big Brothers of Greater Los Angeles, which will serve about 
800 boys this year, have also declined. In 1993, the group received 321 calls 
in the first part of the year from men wanting to be part of the program. This 
year, they have gotten 225, said spokeswoman Nancy Rose Dufford. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Valley office had eight inquiries per month. This year, the 
group has gotten an average of one per month. If all the men are approved, that 
means that the Valley will have 12 new Big Brothers at the end of the year as 
opposed to 96. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even some of our currently matched Big Brothers are trying to get their homes 
back together and don't have the opportunity to be with their little brothers 
as much," Dufford said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1992 Los Angeles riots, Dufford said, her office had a surge of 
requests to help. But with this latest disaster, Dufford is begging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please, we need Big Brothers," Dufford said. "There are a lot of kids 
waiting. If the boys in our program don't get good role models, who are they 
going to look to?" 
</P>
<P>
 As they go about trying to provide the services that often serve as a crucial 
buffer between declining income and depravation, the leaders of the 
hard-pressed volunteer groups say they are trying to keep a positive outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludowitz of the Valley's Volunteer Center said nonprofit organizations have 
become increasingly resilient in the past few, tough years. And Smedberg of the 
Interfaith Council said he takes solace in seeing his own troops pull through 
their troubles and return to ease the burdens of others. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the back of my head, I sense it's temporary," Smedberg said. "I'm 
beginning to see some folks come back who weren't available after the quake, 
but it's not nearly where it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope its temporary, but I don't know."

25-CENT HIKE IN BUS FARES URGED; TRANSIT: CULMINATING HEATED DEBATE, MTA SEEKS 
TO END DISCOUNT PASSES AND CUT SERVICES, WHICH WOULD TAKE EFFECT SEPT. 1. 
OFFICIALS FEAR THE POOR WILL BE HIT THE HARDEST.

<P>
 In an effort to balance its budget, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
on Friday recommended raising bus fares for the first time in six years from 
$1.10 to $1.35, eliminating most discount passes and cutting service on some 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The only route to be affected in the San Fernando Valley is Line 94, which 
travels along San Fernando Road through Burbank, Sun Valley, Pacoima and San 
Fernando. After moving eastward through San Fernando, the route continues along 
Foothill Boulevard to Sylmar Juvenile Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials said service on Line 94 will be greatly cut back, but not 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the MTA's 1.1 million daily bus riders would feel the impact of the 
proposed changes. For the first time, blind passengers would be asked to pay 
fares, and college students would be excluded from special rates. Senior 
citizens and disabled passengers would still be eligible for discount passes, 
although they would have to pay $2 more for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to the proposed fare increases, which must be approved by the MTA 
board of directors, was prompt and furious. City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg 
condemned the fare increase as "unconscionable" and predicted that many people, 
particularly minimum wage workers who stretch their budgets to pay for monthly 
passes, would no longer be able to ride the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you will find people who will not be able to go to work," she said. 
"The result of that will probably be more pain and probably more disorder in 
the society." 
</P>
<P>
 For workers such as Mario Vazquez, the proposed fare increase means further 
scrimping. Vazquez sometimes takes four buses a day to commute from his home on 
the Eastside to job sites throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe now I'll have to walk more," said Vazquez, 36, a day laborer from 
Mexico. "We rely on the buses. There's no alternatives for those of us who 
don't earn a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed fare increase is expected to reduce the number of bus riders 7%, 
or 75,000 passengers, primarily among the poor. Sixty-two percent of bus riders 
earn less than $15,000 a year, according to an MTA survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed changes, which could take effect as early as Sept. 1, come as the 
MTA is spending hundreds of millions to create a subway and rail system that 
offers quicker commutes for suburban workers but lacks the expansive reach of 
the region's buses. To encourage ridership, fares on the Metro Rail Red Line 
subway are only 25 cents -- and will not be affected by the fare increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rail has higher political visibility," said Tom Sovinec, 39, a city engineer 
who takes the bus to City Hall from his home in North Hollywood. "We need rail 
lines, but we need better bus service too. . . . Buses have been ignored 
somewhat." 
</P>
<P>
 The budget allows for continued construction of the Pasadena Blue Line trolley 
and the Green Line trolley, which will run between Norwalk and El Segundo. It 
allocates $752.3 million for rail construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials defended their actions, saying it is necessary to help eliminate 
a $126-million deficit in the agency's $2.9-billion budget for the coming 
fiscal year. They emphasized that the budget calls for belt-tightening 
throughout the entire agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "You either raise the fare to retain the service or you cut service," said 
Frank White, the agency's chief executive officer. "The reality is you cannot 
buy anything in 1994 for the price you paid in 1988 (when the fare was last 
increased)." 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA board will review the proposed budget at its June 22 meeting. The 
board could adopt it then, or decide to make changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal the following changes would take place: 
</P>
<P>
 * The standard fare for bus and rail lines will increase 25 cents from the 
current $1.10 fare. Transfers will remain 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Discount fare tokens will be available for $1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 50-cent zone surcharges will be started on express bus lines and the Blue 
Line trolley. The surcharge will also apply to the Green Line when it opens. 
</P>
<P>
 * Monthly passes, which cost $42 for unlimited use, will be eliminated, except 
for those for the elderly and schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials said eliminating monthly passes will lead to a more equitable 
fare system. About 100,000 passes are issued each month, which drives the 
average fare down to 55 cents. But low-income riders, often unable to afford 
$42 for the pass, pay the full $1.10 fare. In effect, the monthly passes have 
resulted in subsidizing more affluent riders, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposal seeks to provide equity to all persons using our services, and 
at the same time recognizes the economic needs of those most dependent on 
transit," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said there is a significant forgery problem involving monthly passes, 
and busy drivers are often unable to detect fakes. "The present way we use 
passes is as close to pouring money out the window as you can get," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 By raising the fares, the MTA is merely catching up with other major urban 
transit agencies, which have a fare base of $1.25, White said. The proposed 
fare increases would generate $51.4 million a year for the MTA, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners had originally suggested raising fares by a third, to $1.50. But bus 
riders and critics say even raising the price by 25 cents would create an 
enormous hardship for low-income riders, many of whom rely on buses as their 
only means of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Alva Velasco worried how she would survive in an already costly city. Velasco 
takes Line 424 from Downtown to her $175-a-week job as a domestic worker in 
Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 "My salary isn't going up any," said Velasco, 30. "It's going to be difficult 
for me to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, transportation officials raised bus fares from 50 cents to 85 cents. 
Three years later, fares were increased again to the current fare: $1.10. Those 
increases resulted in about a 20% drop in ridership, said MTA alternate board 
member Marv Holen. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, MTA officials say they expect a 7% decrease in ridership as a 
result of the fare increases as well as proposed cuts in service. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have recommended a 5% cut in service, which would represent a $21 
million savings for the agency. Of that, $5 million will be reallocated for use 
on inner-city bus lines, which have not yet been selected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of those routes that will get an increase in service are definitely in 
the Valley," MTA spokesman Jim Smart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts involve the cancellation of three peak-hour express lines and two 
local routes. The lines to be reduced or cut are those that cost the most per 
rider. The express buses considered for cancellation are Line 443 (traveling 
between Union Station, North Torrance, Redondo Beach and Palos Verdes), Line 
445 (traveling between Union Station, West Torrance, Rolling Hills and Rancho 
Palos Verdes), and Line 457 (traveling between Los Angeles and the Long Beach 
Park-n-Ride Express). 
</P>
<P>
 The local service lines recommended for cancellation are Line 208 (Beachwood 
shuttle) and the Line 152 shuttle. In addition to the cutback in service on 
Line 94, portions of Lines 104, 225 and 320 are also under consideration for 
service reductions, as well as special lines such as the Dodger Stadium and 
racetrack service. 
</P>
<P>
 Several MTA board members predicted that the budget will be altered to provide 
a more politically palatable solution than cutting service and raising fares. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in favor of the increased fares," said county Supervisor Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke, an MTA board member. "I recognize that we have to just bite 
the bullet and make some cuts but I do want to look for alternatives to the 
kinds of fare increases they are talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a fare increase but one that is fair and balanced," said MTA 
alternate board member Nick Patsaouras. "But there is not equity here. Yes, bus 
riders have to carry their fair share of the burden but the burden is not being 
spread." 
</P>
<P>
 Others said the proposed budget was the agency's best solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank White's budget brings a dose of reality to the spendthrift policy of 
the past budgets," said county Supervisor Mike Antonovich, an MTA board member. 
"It really focuses on why the MTA needs to move ahead on innovations like 
monorail and privatization that will allow us to improve service, lower fares 
and reduce the bloated capital and operating expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 Some bus riders said a fare increase would not pose a hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think $1.35 is OK, as long as they don't raise it further," said Abel 
Rodriguez, 24, who lives on the Westside, riding a bus back from his job as a 
gas station attendant in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's a quarter?" asked Patrick Vick, a 61-year-old cook, as he waited for a 
bus in Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 But most bus riders interviewed Friday vigorously opposed the increase and 
worried that it would discourage potential passengers from using public 
transportation and make life harder for those already struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybil Morrison rides the bus not from necessity but because she is worried 
about L.A.'s smog problem. She believes the raise is giving people like herself 
the wrong message. But Morrison is especially concerned about the low-income 
people she sees on the bus who are clearly unable to afford any other means of 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand why they would cancel the monthly passes for the working 
class," said Morrison, riding the bus on her way back to her home in Hancock 
Park after getting her hair done in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Miguel Bustillo, Henry Chu, Patrick McDonnell and Ted 
Rohrlich contributed to this story. On the Rise 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials want to increase the bus fare 
from $1.10 to $1.35, which would be the first increase in six years. 
</P>

<P>
 As part of the San Fernando Valley's first major bus-system overhaul in 20 
years, local transit officials are inviting residents to learn and comment 
about possible changes to routes, schedules and vehicles that planners are 
considering to make bus service more efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of 12 workshops around the Valley starting Tuesday, officials will 
present preliminary findings of a bus restructuring study that has been under 
way for a year. The study also will address the Santa Clarita and Antelope 
valleys, as well as the Glendale area and parts of eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideas under consideration touch upon "everything from changing the routes (to) 
providing smaller buses, providing more community-based types of services and 
tying the bus routes together in different ways," said Mike Uyeno, a senior 
engineer with the Los Angeles Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Buses in the Valley have operated on a grid system for two decades, traversing 
major east-west and north-south streets. "The grid works pretty well," Uyeno 
said. "But we're trying to modify it to meet (the needs of) employment centers 
a little better." 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley's revamping may borrow elements of bus patterns in Downtown Los 
Angeles, which operate more along a "hub-and-spokes" design, where buses 
radiate out from a central location. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshops will give residents a chance to hear the recommendations and 
offer comments. Workshops will be held at the locations below. There will be 
two at each site, the first from 2 to 4 p.m. and the second from 7 to 9 p.m. 
unless otherwise listed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tuesday: Pacoima Boys & Girls Club of the San Fernando Valley, 11251 
Glenoaks Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wednesday: The Gas Co. regional headquarters, 9400 Oakdale Ave., Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thursday: Burbank Public Library, 110 N. Glenoaks Blvd. Second workshop is 
from 6:45 to 8:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 7: Texaco Building, 10 Universal City Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 8: Kaiser Permanente Hospital, 5601 De Soto Ave., Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 9: Kaiser Permanente Hospital, 13652 Cantara St., Panorama City.

ROSTENKOWSKI TO REJECT DEAL, REPORT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Rostenkowski has decided to reject the offer of a plea bargain by 
prosecutors and fight allegations of misusing government funds, the Chicago 
Sun-Times is reporting today. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski informed prosecutors Thursday of his decision and, barring any 
last-minute changes will be charged Tuesday, the newspaper said, citing unnamed 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, is under 
investigation by the U.S. attorney's office over his use of office and campaign 
accounts. He could face indictment, raising speculation he might resign from 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors plan to ask a federal grand jury in Washington to return an 
indictment accusing Rostenkowski of defrauding the government of hundreds of 
thousands of dollars over a period of two decades, the paper said. 
</P>
<P>
 No negotiations are scheduled over the Memorial Day weekend, but Rostenkowski 
could still change his mind and accept the plea bargain by the Tuesday 
deadline, the Sun-Times said. 
</P>
<P>
 In their final plea bargain offer, prosecutors demanded that Rostenkowski 
plead guilty to a felony, serve a short prison sentence, resign from Congress 
immediately and make restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Eric H. Holderman Jr. and a spokesman for Rostenkowski declined 
Friday to comment on the status of the plea bargain offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Kenosha, Wis., Rostenkowski came under scrutiny because records 
show he owes $3,300 in property taxes on a lakeshore home. Officials say they 
are convinced the tax delinquency is a simple, unintentional mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenosha County Treasurer Frieda Jacobson said Friday that no drastic action 
was planned to collect the money and that Rostenkowski usually pays his taxes 
"accurately and on time."

CSUN, ARIZONA MAINTAIN PACE; SOFTBALL WORLD SERIES: MATADORS DEFEAT UTAH, 5-1, 
AND COULD BE HEADED FOR SHOWDOWN WITH THE WILDCATS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Although there are at least six -- and possibly eight -- games to play before 
the championship of the Women's Softball College World Series, many are already 
gearing up to watch the favorites, Arizona and Cal State Northridge, in a 
possible matchup in Monday's final. 
</P>
<P>
 After second-round victories Friday, only Arizona and Northridge remain 
unbeaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Calcante got Northridge started Friday with a two-run home run in the 
first inning, and the Matadors stayed on course to earn a 5-1 victory over Utah 
in front of 2,793 at Hall of Fame Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 For Northridge, it was a much more impressive showing than its first-round 
victory over Missouri on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors' eight-hit performance Friday reinforced what Utah Coach Jo Evans 
already had realized about the Utes' Western Athletic Conference rival.  
</P>
<P>
 Northridge had edged Utah (51-12) for the WAC title on percentage points in 
the final week of conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Northridge is a great team," she said. "They have great pitching, they're 
solid defensively and they hit the ball like crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Northridge came out and played hard. We know they hit the ball well. There's 
no surprises when you play Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're gonna give Arizona a great game. I couldn't say who's gonna 
come out and win that one because I think they can both compete." 
</P>
<P>
 Calcante hit her 33rd career home run, just inside the foul pole down the 
right-field line with one out and Jen Fleming (two for three) aboard in the 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 For Calcante, Northridge's all-time home run leader, it was a redemption shot 
that helped her keep pace with her hard-hitting teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was exciting because I haven't felt like I've done my part this year," 
said Calcante, who uncharacteristically hopped when she rounded first in a show 
of excitement. "I don't feel like I put forth my effort as much as I did last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think my team looks down at me, but I look down at myself." 
</P>
<P>
 The third-ranked Matadors (51-8) added another run in the fourth when 
pinch-runner Kari Hazlett, running for Shannon Jones who had walked to lead off 
the inning, scored on a sacrifice fly by Vicky Rios. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah rallied in the fourth with the bases loaded and one out. Freshman Cyndee 
Bennett, a Glendale High graduate who had three of Utah's five hits, hit a 
bloop single to right to score Stacie Reynolds.  
</P>
<P>
 But junior right-hander Kathy Blake (17-6) retired the next two batters on an 
infield popup and a grounder to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake allowed one unearned run on five hits with two strikeouts and one walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Calcante and Fleming scored in the fifth on an illegal pitch and a sacrifice 
fly by Scia Maumausolo, respectively, to take a 5-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 For Northridge, the motivation to win was having a free day. Northridge will 
face either Oklahoma State, Missouri or Fresno State in a semifinal game Sunday 
at 12:30 p.m. CDT. 
</P>
<P>
 If Northridge loses Sunday, it will play the same team later that night and 
the winner will advance to Monday's final. Northridge has not lost two 
consecutive games in the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah freshman right-hander Ali Andrus (32-7), who had thrown a one-hitter 
against Oklahoma State a day earlier, had plenty of problems with the Matadors. 
Northridge had a runner on base in all but the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their pitcher, I think, is one of the better ones in the country," Northridge 
Coach Gary Torgeson said. "The only edge that we had is we came in with the 
determination to have the day off tomorrow. (The Matadors) didn't want to play 
tomorrow. They wanted the day off." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleming echoed Torgeson's sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is big business here. You get in the losers' bracket and you're playing 
forever all day."

MONROE CRIES WOLF AFTER LOPSIDED LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 What can a team do to score runs against a talented and composed pitcher like 
El Camino Real High's Randy Wolf? 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe Coach Kevin Campbell searched for an answer in Friday's first-round 
City Section 4-A Division playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't find one, and Monroe lost, 10-1. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a nightmare relived for the Vikings, who lost by the same score when 
the teams met earlier this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when Wolf gets himself in trouble, he comes right back so it's tough to 
get anything against him," Campbell said. "He was just great today. He was too 
tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf (10-3), a senior left-hander who has accepted a scholarship to attend 
Pepperdine, pitched a complete game and gave up only five hits. He struck out 
14 and walked three.  
</P>
<P>
 Monroe's Joel Zamudio (5-3) lasted four innings and gave up nine hits and 
eight runs. He struck out five and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not up to what I've seen him pitch before," El Camino Real Coach Mike 
Maio said of Zamudio. "He was throwing hard, but kind of off." 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real (20-7) took advantage, scoring four runs on three hits in the 
first inning. Billy Burnette drove in the first run with a single to right 
field and Matt Tays brought in the last three with a two-out triple to right. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf, Burnette and Joey Maiden scored. Wolf and Maiden had walked. Wolf, who 
bats third in the lineup, walked in all four of his at-bats -- twice 
intentionally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a bit disappointed on my walks," he said. "But I guess it really 
doesn't matter. We came out intense and that's why we won."  
</P>
<P>
 The Conquistadores, defending City champions, added four runs in the fourth 
inning. Justin Martin scored on Steve Riback's double to right and Riback came 
home on Craig Carlton's single to center.  
</P>
<P>
 Burnette drove Wolf in with a double to right and later scored on an infield 
single by Maiden. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe (9-14) scored its only run in the fifth inning when Eric Huitink's 
infield grounder drove in Jaime Dorado. Dorado doubled to center and stole 
third base. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real retaliated with a run in the bottom of the inning on doubles by 
Marvin Jones and Riback. In the sixth, the Conquistadores struck again on 
Joseph Baum's double to left that drove in Maiden from second base. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Nix had three hits, including two doubles, for Monroe. He also came in 
to pitch in relief of Zamudio in the fifth and gave up two hits and two runs.

ROMAN'S HIT BOOSTS RIO MESA PAST HART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sun was beginning to set on the strawberry-covered Oxnard plain Friday 
when Rio Mesa High's best batter, Vince Roman, stepped to the plate against 
Hart's best pitcher, Luis Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 It was late and cooling off, with the wind from the coast getting stronger. 
But nobody in the crowd at Rio Mesa seemed to mind. This matchup was a fitting 
climax to a three-hour pitching display in a Southern Section Division II 
quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
 With runners at second and third base and two out in the bottom of the ninth, 
Sanchez wound up and delivered a tailing fastball that appeared to catch the 
outside corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Umpire Steve Bommarito called the pitch a ball. Sanchez winced. 
</P>
<P>
 With the count 1-and-0, he feared falling further behind Roman. Sanchez wound 
up and threw another fastball, this one over the middle of the plate. Roman was 
ready for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rio Mesa designated hitter slapped a hard grounder up the middle just 
beyond the glove of shortstop Chad Ott. Pinch-runner Brian Normington raced 
home with the game's only run -- it was unearned. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1-0 victory sends the Spartans (21-6) to Tuesday's semifinals against 
Riverside J.W. North, which defeated Moreno Valley Valley View, 14-12, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fully thought it was a strike," said Sanchez (7-2, 2.50 earned-run average) 
of his next-to-last pitch to Roman. "That made me throw another cut fastball on 
the next pitch, but more over the plate." 
</P>
<P>
 Roman, who batted .500 during the regular season, had struck out in his three 
previous at-bats Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected him to go right after me," Roman said. "The first pitch didn't 
look good, but the one I hit was a fastball over the plate. That's what I was 
looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Spartan junior left-hander Richard Soliz (8-1) pitched a five-hit shutout with 
seven strikeouts and three walks. It was his third complete game in as many 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart senior left-hander Eric Spindt struck out eight, walked four and allowed 
two hits through 6 1/3 innings before giving way to freshman left-hander Bobby 
Graves. 
</P>
<P>
 With one out and runners at first and second, Graves picked Eric Flores off 
first base and struck out Roman on a full-count curveball. 
</P>
<P>
 But Graves (2-1), who suffered the loss, was lifted with none out in the ninth 
after he walked Chad Snyder and threw wildly to first on a sacrifice bunt by 
Manuel Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Mesa sent in Normington to run for Snyder at second base and Hart summoned 
Sanchez, who pitched a three-hit shutout against Beverly Hills on Tuesday. 
Sanchez got Donald DiDomizio on a grounder to short with the runners moving to 
second and third. He then struck out Flores before facing Roman. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the best game I ever played in and this is by far my best pitching 
effort," said Soliz, who yielded three hits in the first two innings when Hart 
(21-6) stranded four of its eight base runners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't going to end after the ninth inning. I was ready to go for the 
10th."

FOUNTAIN VALLEY POUNCES ON KOZLOWSKI AND ENDS SIMI VALLEY'S SEASON; SOUTHERN 
SECTION BASEBALL: PONCHAK BLASTS GRAND SLAM IN FIVE-RUN FIRST INNING TO FUEL 
VICTORY OVER PIONEERS IN QUARTERFINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Kary Kozlowski said the fateful pitch he threw to Fountain Valley High's Chris 
Ponchak was "up and away," a reference to the ball's location in the strike 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
 He was right. And then some. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was an OK pitch," Kozlowski said. "I didn't even think it was a 
strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Up, up and away also described the ball's trajectory after Ponchak muscled it 
over the right-field fence for a grand slam. Fountain Valley's ascent likewise 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak's slam sparked a five-run first inning and right-hander Luke Hudson 
threw five scoreless innings as Fountain Valley trounced Simi Valley, 12-1, in 
a Southern Section Division I quarterfinal Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley, the top-seeded team in the division, will face Crescenta 
Valley in the semifinals Tuesday at 7 p.m. at Blair Field in Long Beach. 
Crescenta Valley (19-5) defeated El Dorado, 4-3. Simi Valley finished the 
season with a record of 20-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak, a burly junior, couldn't help but think about the long ball when he 
walked into Simi Valley's cozy yard.  
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to keep (the size of the field) out of my head," Ponchak said, 
grinning. "Sometimes, when you get in a little park, it gets to you and you try 
to hit everything out. That can mess you up." 
</P>
<P>
 Kozlowski (8-1) entered the game with eight consecutive scoreless innings in 
postseason play. Fountain Valley (25-3-1), ranked second in the state by Cal-Hi 
Sports, messed that up in a hurry. The first three batters singled to load the 
bases and a one-out single by Dan Hoppie gave the Barons a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 With two out, Kozlowski threw a 2-and-2 fastball to Ponchak, who belted it 
onto the Simi Valley football field. Before the blast, Kozlowski was one pitch 
from escaping the jam with minimal damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I was 400 feet from getting the third out," Kozlowski said, dejectedly. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-run lead didn't seem all that large when Hudson (8-1) wobbled through 
the first inning. Hudson, a junior right-hander, walked two and threw three 
wild pitches to put runners at second and third with one out. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup hitter Bryan Wall then sent a fly ball to medium right field, but Tim 
Nykoluk was thrown out at the plate on a 9-3-2 relay for an inning-ending 
double play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the thing to do in the first inning," said interim Simi Valley Coach 
Russ Stephans, whose team lost for the first time in seven games since he took 
over for suspended Mike Scyphers. "No question, with your leadoff hitter 
(Nykoluk) on third, you send him." 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley added two runs in the second and three in the third to take a 
10-0 lead. By then, Hudson was finding the strike zone. He allowed three 
singles, walked five and struck out four in five innings before he was 
relieved.

DEBIASE'S 1-HITTER HELPS CHATSWORTH ELIMINATE GRANT; HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL: 
TOP-SEEDED CHANCELLORS STYMIE LANCERS' BID FOR CONSECUTIVE UPSETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thanks to ace Jim DeBiase, Chatsworth High avoided being the second 
consecutive upset victim of Grant on Friday in the opening round of the City 
Section 4-A Division baseball playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 DeBiase, a senior right-hander, allowed only three batters to reach base while 
tossing a one-hitter with five strikeouts to lead the top-seeded Chancellors to 
a 3-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth (26-4) will play host to Birmingham (15-13) on Wednesday. 
Birmingham needed nine innings to down San Pedro, 9-8, in another first-round 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 DeBiase (10-1) yielded a leadoff walk and a bunt single in the first inning, 
then retired 18 of the final 19 batters, including the final 10. "I've seen him 
strike out more, but I thought he did a real nice job today," Chatsworth Coach 
Tom Meusborn said. "Once he got a lead, he was nails." 
</P>
<P>
 Grant (11-13), which defeated Valley Pac-8 Conference champion Sylmar on 
Monday to gain a playoff berth, held Chatsworth scoreless through four innings 
with the pitching of right-hander Marc Scorza and flashy running catches by 
center fielder Adam Frank and left fielder Diego Ferriera. 
</P>
<P>
 Scorza struck out three and scattered three singles over four innings. Frank 
chased down two line drives to thwart a potential rally in the fourth and 
Ferriera made a running catch near the line in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth scored all its runs in the fifth off right-hander Tony Iovino 
(4-5), who walked two batters and committed two throwing errors. Tony Montiel's 
one-out, bases-loaded double drove in Ray Daryabigi and Bryan LaCour. Mike 
Amado followed with a sacrifice fly to drive in Brandon Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told our kids that we really turned it around this year," Grant Coach 
Jeremy Lawrence said. "Chatsworth learned that Grant's gonna be a program to 
watch in the years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Meusborn held a lengthy team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a few mistakes and I don't think we did a good job in certain 
situations," Meusborn said. "At this time of year, it's the little details that 
make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth managed only six hits and stranded nine runners. At least DeBiase 
was impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it was one of my better games today," he said.

SANTA CLARITA'S HERTA HALF A DYNAMIC DUO; AUTO RACING: FORMER HART HIGH 
CROSS-COUNTRY RUNNER AND GO-KART RACER TEAMS WITH A.J. FOYT IN 78TH RUNNING OF 
INDY 500. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One is a four-time winner of the Indianapolis 500, arguably the greatest 
race-car driver of all time. 
</P>
<P>
 The other is only a few years removed from the Santa Clarita Valley, where he 
raced go-karts at Saugus Speedway, ran cross-country at Hart High and held a 
part-time job at Magic Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 So why are A.J. Foyt, 59, and Bryan Herta, 24, being mentioned in the same 
sentence? 
</P>
<P>
 They are a match made in Indianapolis. On Sunday, the unlikely pair will be 
teamed among the 33 entries in the 78th running of the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
 Foyt, who in 1958 made the first of a record 35 consecutive starts at 
Indianapolis, retired from Indy car racing only days before last year's race. 
He is now a car owner. Three weeks ago, he found a protege in last season's 
Indy Lights champion, Herta, who has zoomed to the zenith of motor racing since 
graduating from Hart in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Herta will make his Indy 500 debut behind the wheel of Foyt's Lola-Ford 
Cosworth. Herta will start in 22nd position, seven rows behind pole-sitter Al 
Unser Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I really have come a long way in a hurry, going from go-karts to Indy 
in only five years," said Herta, who resides in Dublin, Ohio, and attends Ohio 
State. "But it's been a dream of mine for such a long time. I've never said I 
wanted to be here by this year or that year. I just wanted to hit each stop 
along the way and be successful at every level I was competing at. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indy is absolutely unbelievable. It's so different than anything I've ever 
done. Speeds are so much higher. You have to teach yourself to look much 
farther down the race track." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Herta competed in cross-country for four years and placed third in 
the Foothill League junior varsity finals as a junior, his passion always has 
been racing cars. He began driving on dirt at Indian Dunes north of Valencia 
shortly after his family moved to Newhall from his native Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always a better driver than I was a runner," Herta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Herta may be Indy's new kid behind the wheel, but he's hardly wet behind the 
ears. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very impressive for a rookie," Foyt said. 
</P>
<P>
 In six years racing go-karts throughout California, Herta won six 
championships. In 1988, he won 14 of 18 main events. Herta also competed for 
two years in the Barber Saab Pro Series, winning the championship in 1990 with 
four victories in 12 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Herta moved up to Indy Lights. Last season, he took the series by 
storm, winning seven of 12 races, including the final four of the season. He 
also won a series-record eight pole positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Herta planned to join the Indy Car World Series this season as a driver for 
owner Steve Horne. But when Horne contacted Foyt about conducting Herta's 
orientation program at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Foyt was impressed by the 
young driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the chance to work with Bryan and I had taken him around the track and 
showed him the groove I always liked," said Foyt, who last won at Indianapolis 
in 1977. "He ran a real nice pattern. The computer showed he was consistent. 
And when I made a change to the car, he could read it back to me, even if it 
was a small change." 
</P>
<P>
 Foyt had just released Davy Jones as a driver and was looking for a 
replacement. Herta was eager to sign. "It was a great set of circumstances," 
Herta said. "I was absolutely thrilled from the beginning. A.J. is a 
fascinating man. He knows more about this place, probably, than anybody ever. 
There's a lot I'm going to learn from him. He puts you at ease right away. He's 
got that sort of Southern charm." 
</P>
<P>
 Herta will need to be a quick study if he expects to take the checkered flag. 
His qualifying time of 220.992 m.p.h. is slowest among the field of 33 drivers. 
On the final day of qualifying, Herta watched nervously as Willy T. Ribbs, 
Geoff Brabham, Mark Smith and Gary Bettenhausen all failed to qualify ahead of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, only six rookies have won at Indy, the last in 1966. But Herta's 
hopes are high. "Our goal is to win," Herta said. "Anybody who tells you 
otherwise is a liar. I don't think we expect to (win), but we've got the right 
equipment. We feel we've got all the pieces."

BIRD LIFTS HIGHLAND'S FLEDGLING PROGRAM TO LOFTY PERCH; BOYS' VOLLEYBALL: COACH 
LEADS BULLDOGS INTO SOUTHERN SECTION TITLE MATCH AGAINST PERENNIAL POWER ROYAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Royal High boys' volleyball Coach Bob Ferguson has seen the future of Southern 
Section Division II volleyball, and it looks like. . . . a crew cut? 
</P>
<P>
 Sort of. Mike Bird, proud new owner of a buzz haircut, coaches the hottest and 
most surprising team around, Highland. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks in large part to the sudden success of Bird's fledgling program, 
volleyball has spread its wings in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? He took a team in only its third year at the varsity level to the 
brink of the mountaintop. And what a view: an undefeated season, the Golden 
League championship, the Poway and Redondo Beach tournament championships and, 
now, to the section final. 
</P>
<P>
 Highland (18-0) will face perennial power Royal (17-3) at 5 p.m. today at 
Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great coach," Ferguson said. "I'm really impressed with the program 
that he's put together. He's really a class guy, and I've told him that too. 
I'm not just saying that for the press." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was Bird's haircut a staged photo opportunity. Win the Golden League title 
and you can give me a haircut in front of the whole school, he told his 
players. They did, and so they did. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Ferguson, he is more accustomed to championship matches. This is the 
sixth consecutive season in which the Highlanders have advanced to the division 
final, and they have won three times. But this is Royal's last season in 
Division II; the team moves to Division I next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson knows how that void will be filled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The desert area has just gone crazy," Ferguson said. "They're going to 
dominate Division II." 
</P>
<P>
 An example of the fever pitch: Highland reserve James Gonzaga cheered so 
wildly at the Redondo tournament, he passed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Such fervor has come quickly and could grow if other high desert schools lure 
energetic, talented coaches to spread the gospel of the bump, set and spike. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of talent up there," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 And clearly, a Bird in the sand is worth quite a bit when starting a 
volleyball program. 
</P>
<P>
 Highland opened only five years ago. Enter Bird, fresh off a one-year stint 
coaching the boys' and girls' teams at Agoura High. He had moved to the 
Antelope Valley in search of affordable housing and a teaching/coaching job at 
either Highland or Littlerock highs. 
</P>
<P>
 He was offered employment at both and chose Highland. The first two years, the 
newly opened school fielded only junior varsity teams in volleyball. The past 
three, Bird's teams have soared. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a complete surprise and it just keeps getting better and better," he 
said. "I knew we were good but by no means did I expect this." 
</P>
<P>
 But unexpected success is not altogether new for Bird, 29. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, Bird, who played basketball at Calabasas High, was 
languishing on the bench at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realized there wasn't a whole lot of room for a 6-foot-2 white guy who 
wasn't real quick and couldn't jump very high," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But by chance, Dave Rubio, a Cal State Northridge men's volleyball assistant, 
saw Bird setting volleyballs in a gym one summer day. 
</P>
<P>
 Bird was killing time between refereeing some youth volleyball matches. Rubio 
took a look and offered him a tryout with the Matador program. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems Northridge was entering NCAA Division I and needed bodies. Though Bird 
had never played organized volleyball -- he was an avid beach player -- he 
became the team's starting setter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were horrible," he said. "But I was forced to learn so much so quickly it 
helped me become a student of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The student decided he wanted to teach. He played at Northridge from 1984-87 
and was a graduate assistant there in 1988. He earned his teaching credential 
and set out to teach physics and volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 His first coaching task at Highland was not to make the players good. It was 
to make them like volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-described volley-a-holic, Bird transmitted his love for the sport to 
his desert dwellers -- none of whom play club volleyball, considered de rigueur 
for serious players. 
</P>
<P>
 Convention be damned. Two-on-two grass tournaments in the summers would 
suffice, and let the spikes fall where they may -- which more often than not 
has been on the opponents' side of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Highland's strength is its talented middle blocker duo, Ryan Millar (6-7) and 
Mac Wilson (6-8), and dependable outside hitting by Neal Scott and Robert 
Nester. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal, which has lost only one league match in six years, is led by senior 
setter Josh White and opposite hitter Matt Olsen (6-6). Eric Carlsen and 
Garrison Chaffee man the middle, and Scott Hambly and Danny Rizzo play on the 
outside. 
</P>
<P>
 White is the team's lone returning starter -- making Royal's return to a 
championship match surprising in its own way. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a total tribute to their program," Bird said. "And to Bob and 
(assistant) Sandy Ferguson. Both of them live the game like I live the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Bird may live the game somewhere else in a few years, because he plans to move 
to the San Diego area sometime soon. Bye, bye, Birdie? Not yet. For now his 
attention is focused on the present. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're enjoying all the success we're having, because it doesn't come that 
often," he said. "It makes it so much more fun than if we expected to do it."

A QUICK STUDY, MEDEARIS PACES 5 AREA MASTERS' CHAMPIONS; HIGH SCHOOL TRACK AND 
FIELD: HART HIGH SENIOR BREAKS FAST AND IS NOT HEADED IN HIGH HURDLES. FISCHER 
SQUEAKS OUT WIN IN HIGH JUMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 He has been described by his coach as a student of hurdling. Apparently so. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Medearis of Hart High learned from a week-old mistake and won the boys' 
110-meter high hurdles in the Southern Section Masters Meet at Cerritos College 
on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis finished a disappointing third in the highs in the Division I 
championships at Long Beach Veterans Stadium last week. His miscue in that 
outing was breaking from the blocks slowly and then compounding his error by 
paying too much attention to rivals Kenny Haslip of Pasadena Muir and Tyson 
Murphy of Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, he shot out of the blocks and never looked back, recording a time 
of 14.21 seconds and defeating Division I champion Haslip (14.34) for the 
second time in seven meetings this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a real good feeling because I didn't see anyone on either side of me at 
the start of the race," Medearis said. "And that acted as motivation to keep it 
that way for the rest of the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Haslip bounced back to defeat Medearis in the 300 intermediate 
hurdles, 36.65 to 36.80, the Hart senior couldn't complain about his time. It 
was a personal best by more than half a second and moved him into third on the 
yearly national high school list behind Lee Hutton (36.5) of La Marque (Tex.) 
High and Haslip. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the fastest time by an athlete from the region since 1976, when 
Charles White of San Fernando timed 36.4 to win the 330-yard intermediates in 
the now-defunct International Prep Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week definitely helped me tonight," Medearis said. "It made me think 
more this week about what I had to do, about what I wanted to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis was among five athletes from the region who posted victories in the 
meet in which the top five finishers in each event qualified for the state 
championships at Cerritos, June 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The others were Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo in the high jump, Esa Sallinen of 
Burroughs in the pole vault, Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill in the triple jump and 
Dolores Tuimoloau of Channel Islands in the girls' shotput. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer and Arthur Lloyd of Rialto Eisenhower each cleared seven feet in the 
high jump, but Fischer won because he cleared the height on his second attempt 
while Lloyd needed three tries. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer also finished third in the long jump at 22-9 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Sallinen, a senior exchange student from Finland, cleared 16 feet on his 
second attempt in the pole vault before missing three times at 16-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase was a double qualifier, finishing second in the long jump (22-10 1/4) 
and winning the triple jump at 48-10 3/4, his best outdoor mark of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau, the state leader in the girls' shotput at 49-2, won that event with 
a mark of 45-1 3/4. She also placed fourth in the discus at 137-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau and Palmdale sophomore Kristi Rose both produced clutch throws on 
their final attempts in the discus to advance to the state meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose was last in the field of nine after the three of the four rounds, but she 
threw a personal best of 135-10 on her final effort to temporarily move into 
fourth and push Tuimoloau (131-11) into sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfazed, Tuimoloau calmly stepped in the ring and unleashed an even better 
throw. 
</P>
<P>
 In other events, Brett Strahan of Hart, Antonio Arce of Palmdale, Kim 
Mortensen of Thousand Oaks, Cathy Prater of Agoura and Liz Giltner of Chaminade 
placed second in their respective events. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase leaped 22-10 1/4 to finish second in the long jump before winning the 
triple jump at 48-10 3/4, his best outdoor mark of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Strahan ran 4 minutes 14.70 seconds to finish behind Eric Dunn (4:14.47) of 
Arroyo Grande in the 1,600. Arce timed a yearly region-leading time of 9:09.21 
in the 3,200 to finish behind Jaime Martinez (9:06.08) of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen ran a region-leading 10:53.65 in the girls' 3,200; Prater ran the 
second fastest time (43.96) of her career in the 300 low hurdles; and freshman 
Giltner cleared a personal best of 5-8 in the high jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica De La Cerda of Hart was a notable non-qualifier. She placed ninth in 
the girls' 1,600 with a time of 5:47.00.

</P>
<P>
 Parque (12-2) allowed four hits and struck out four after pitching four 
innings in Tuesday's victory over Rowland. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Mitchell's single scored Brian Peterson with the go-ahead run to cap a 
four-run fourth inning to lead the Falcons (19-5).  
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons preserved the victory in the sixth when second baseman Kasey 
Canale threw out Spencer Frost at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Pruitt had three hits and Kirk Hagge added two for Crescenta Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons will play Fountain Valley in a semifinal Tuesday.

I game at Nogales. Igou (11-2) scattered three singles and struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame (21-5) scored all of its runs in the fifth inning. Chris Crowley 
broke a scoreless tie with a single that scored Brian Benner. Jabbar Craigwell 
then drove in Joey Orlando with a sacrifice fly and Justin Bunch closed the 
scoring with a single to drive in Crowley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights will play Lakewood in a semifinal Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 West Torrance 6, Antelope Valley 5 -- The Antelopes rallied from a 5-0 deficit 
to tie the score in the fifth inning, but committed a crucial fielding error 
that led to the winning run in the seventh inning of the Division III game at 
West Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors led off the seventh with a single, but Antelope Valley reliever 
Jason Storm induced the next batter to hit a ground ball to third baseman Kevin 
Barlow. He threw to second to start a possible double play, but second baseman 
Jeff Langham dropped the ball and both runners were safe. 
</P>
<P>
 After a single loaded the bases, Grady Sain singled over a drawn-in outfield 
to score the winning run. 
</P>
<P>
 After Antelope Valley (14-10) cut the deficit to 5-4, Chris Tapia led off the 
fifth with a solo home run. 
</P>
<P>
 San Marino 6, Montclair Prep 5 -- Montclair Prep held a 5-4 lead entering the 
bottom of the seventh inning, but the Titans rallied for two runs to win the 
Division IV game at San Marino (21-1-1)  
</P>
<P>
 With no outs and the bases loaded, San Marino's Brian McClintic singled to 
drive in Pete Paciorek. 
</P>
<P>
 Jared Sandler (10-2) took the loss for Montclair Prep (18-9). 
</P>
<P>
 In City Section 4-A first round playoff games: 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar 12, Gardena 2 -- Art Diaz hit his third home run of the season as the 
second-seeded Spartans romped. Diaz's two-run shot came during a six-run third 
inning. Sylmar (25-5) took advantage of eight walks and three hit batters en 
route to an early 11-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Velazco (11-2) struck out five. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans will play host to Kennedy in a second-round game Wednesday.

inning as the 13th-seeded Toreadors won at Poly. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Dusty Cook (6-3) held fourth-seeded Poly (22-5) to five hits and 
walked two. Mike Ferguson and Nick Andrisano each had doubles for Taft. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft (15-15) will play at Granada Hills on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham 9, San Pedro 8 (9 innings) -- Birmingham used clutch hitting in

Trailing 8-5 with two outs in the seventh, Birmingham (15-13) scored three runs 
to send the game into extra innings. 
</P>

 Danny Arnold's two-out single in the ninth scored Pedro Rodriguez with the 
winning run. Rodriguez had four hits, scored three runs and had four RBIs.

home runs to rout the Comets. Jimmy Landress hit a grand slam, and Jim O'Brien 
hit a three-run shot. Granada Hills (16-7) built a 15-1 over Westchester 
(17-13). 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Goldberg (8-4) pitched five innings to earn the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy 13, University 2 -- Kevin Serr's two-run home run highlighted 
Kennedy's seven-run fourth inning at University (19-9). He was two for five 
with three RBIs to give him 39 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 University (19-9) used six pitchers, but could not stem the Kennedy hitting 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Devin Connolly and Richie Prieto both were two for three and scored twice for 
Kennedy (15-1).

BARTELS DOESN'T STALL IN RETURN TO RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stock car racing returned to Ventura Raceway Friday night after a three-week 
layoff because of rain, a rock concert and a motorcycle race. 
</P>
<P>
 The break paid off for Bill Bartels. The Los Angeles resident grabbed his 
first Street Stock main event victory of the season in the 20-lap feature race. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last outing, Bartels led the first 11 laps before his car stalled in 
the second turn, flames shooting out from under his fenders. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around, Bartels had better luck. He grabbed the lead on the fifth 
lap and cruised to an easy victory over defending series champion Paul Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 Adail Gayhart of Malibu took the torch from Bartels, forcing a caution flag on 
the 11th lap while the track crew attempted to snuff out an under-hood fire 
that became noticeable three laps earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartels had a quarter-lap lead over Moore before the caution came on, allowing 
Oak View resident Moore to close the gap and give Bartels a run for his money 
after the restart. 
</P>
<P>
 The two were bumper-to-bumper until the 16th lap, when Moore lost traction and 
slid off the track in the second turn, slowing just enough to allow Bartels to 
open a five-length lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a war of attrition -- only seven cars were running at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 James Weston of Santa Barbara, a previous winner, was eliminated on the second 
lap after locking bumpers with Adam of Westlake in front of the grandstand. 
</P>
<P>
 Weston, Adam and Bob Carpenter, the eventual third-place finisher, were 
running three abreast when Camarillo's Joel Remmenga brushed the wall in front 
of Carpenter, who was able to avoid the ensuing three-car crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The street stock feature was less spectacular than the 15-lap Mini Stock Main. 
The race was restarted four times before the first lap was officially run 
because of two crashes, a false start, and a crash involving a false start. 
</P>
<P>
 Harried officials finally had the racers line up single-file to start the 
event, which was won by Gary Swenson of Ventura, who barely edged out Tim Gill 
of Somis. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 15-Lap Pony Stock Main, Mira Cook of Camarillo won by a half lap over 
Scott Boucher of Oakview. Cook and Boucher were the winners in the seven-lap 
heat races. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Cole of Santa Maria won his second 15-lap IMCA Modified main event and 
Ventura's Gary Howard captured the 10-lap IMCA Sprint feature.

CONCERT REVIEW; GROUNDED FOR 14 YEARS, EAGLES PROVE THEY CAN STILL SOAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Does America's premier rock band of the '70s still deliver in the '90s? 
Absolutely. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles wasted little time Friday night at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre 
in passing Test One in the band's celebrated reunion campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 By midway through the opening show in the Southern California quintet's first 
concert tour in 14 years, the band demonstrated that it remains the master of 
such trademarks as sweet, seductive harmonies and flavorful but concise 
musicianship.  
</P>
<P>
 And the capacity crowd appeared enthralled listening to songs, including the 
opening "Hotel California" and "New Kid in Town" -- songs that speak of 
personal and social morality in ways that are still relevant. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even the band must realize in performing the old hits of the reunion that 
the real challenge will be if the group can move beyond the celebration of the 
old days to write songs that give listeners new reasons to believe. That answer 
will come in Test Two next year, when the band will have a new album. For now, 
however, the Eagles are once again flying high. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hilburn's full review of the Eagles' performance will appear in 
Monday's Calendar section.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; LIBRARIES' RISING WOES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Public libraries are an important component of a free society. For those who 
cannot afford the cost of higher education, for example, they represent one of 
democracy's best outlets for becoming self-taught and improving one's lot in 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 But as this week's Orange County Grand Jury report confirmed, the county's 
library system is reeling, as others are, from budget cuts mandated by shifts 
in local property tax money to pay for California's public schools. The 
viability of the library system, according to the ominous words of the report, 
"is in the hands of the public." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury found that some of the county system's 27 branches are in danger of 
having to close next year because of the shortfalls. Library officials expect a 
budget next year that will be $9 million less than what was allocated two years 
ago. Last year, more than $6 million was cut from the library budget, 
necessitating substantial reductions in service hours and the elimination of 75 
full-time positions. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this makes even more urgent the work of the 15-member library task 
force recently created by the Board of Supervisors to recommend new sources of 
revenue for the system. It seems inevitable that there will be some increased 
fees for such things as overdue books, and a new charge for placing personal 
book orders for publications not available in some local branches. The 
challenge will be to find those new sources of revenue that somehow still will 
preserve the spirit of public libraries and keep them accessible.

MORNING BRIEFING: WHITEN'S ARM IS SURPASSED ONLY BY HIS BAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 St. Louis outfielder Mark Whiten was being praised recently for his long-ball 
bat as well as his throwing arm. 
</P>
<P>
 In Busch Stadium, a yellow seat in the upper deck has a black marker on it. 
That's where Whiten's blast landed last August, one of only 11 upper-deck 
homers at the stadium in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Pirate coach Rich Donnelly said: "Thing is, he could throw one up there, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Wrote Pittsburgh columnist Gene Collier: "(Whiten's) arm moves people to 
statements that flaunt local blasphemy ordinances." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Pirate coach Tommy Sandt: "If (Roberto) Clemente had a better arm than 
his, I'd like to have seen it. I mean, how good can you throw it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Donnelly: "We were in St. Petersburg in spring training, and he went into the 
corner for a ball and made a 300-foot throw, no hops, and nailed Carlos Garcia 
at third.  
</P>
<P>
 "He eggs you on. He'll lope after a ball to see if he can get you to run, 
picks it up . . . and bam, you're dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Cardinal coach Red Schoendienst, a onetime contemporary of Clemente's: 
"As far as arm strength goes . . . it's a tough call between Clemente and 
Whiten." 
</P>

 Trivia time: What was Willie Mays' salary in 1973, when he retired from 
baseball? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It worked once: The last time the Pittsburgh Steelers signed a player who had 
never played college football, he wound up in the Pro Bowl. He was guard 
Carlton Haselrig, a college wrestler who was their 12th choice in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 They tried it again this week, signing free agent Elbert Ellis, a 6-foot-5, 
218-pound hurdler from the University of Pittsburgh. He hasn't played football 
since the eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 In a workout, the Steelers said, Ellis ran a 4.38-second 40-yard dash, did a 
10-foot-5 standing long jump and caught every ball thrown to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a longshot, but the kid is big, fast and a good-looking athlete," said 
the Steelers' Tom Donohoe, director of football operations.

 Toronto right fielder Joe Carter is on a pace to shatter Hack Wilson's record 
for runs batted in during a season. Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle is on pace to 
break Roger Maris' home-run record. And New York Yankee right fielder Paul 
O'Neill is bidding to become the first hitter since Ted Williams to hit .400. 
What would be the greatest feat? 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely the RBI record," Angel designated hitter Chili Davis said. "You've 
got to be consistent the whole year and always have guys in front of you. The 
home run record would be next, and then hitting .400. I think O'Neill has the 
best chance because he can afford to sit back and take walks. Joe and Griffey 
have got to keep swinging away." 
</P>
<P>
 What does Carter, who has 56 RBIs, consider the greatest feat? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I'd take the home run record any day," Carter said. "That's the 
toughest. There's a lot of ways you can drive in runs, but there's only one way 
you can hit a homer. After awhile, guys will just stop pitching to you. I mean, 
190 RBIs would be something, but to hit 61 homers, that would be the ultimate."

 Although Blue Jay Manager Cito Gaston was in full uniform and hung around 
until game time, he was forced to go home once the lineups cards were exchanged 
Friday. Gaston has been suspended for three games by American League President 
Bobby Brown for arguing a play with first-base umpire Rick Reed on April 15 
against the Angels. Bench coach Gene Tenace will manage the Blue Jays during 
the three games.

 Billy Ashley, a 23-year-old outfielder who is tearing up the Pacific Coast 
League, is one reason Executive Vice President Fred Claire is happy with the 
way the Dodger organization is developing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley is batting .373 for the Albuquerque Dukes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The young players from our system are helping us now, and we have several 
more who will eventually be Dodgers," Claire said. "That's the way we want to 
go. It just makes sense economically, and there is the thrill of seeing a 
player we developed playing at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "That isn't to say we won't ever sign a free agent. . . . But I'd much rather 
see a Billy Ashley make it than sign a $20-million free agent."

 Toronto right fielder Joe Carter is on a pace to shatter Hack Wilson's record 
for runs batted in during a season. Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle is on pace to 
break Roger Maris' home-run record.And New York Yankee right fielder Paul 
O'Neill is bidding to become the first hitter since Ted Williams to hit .400.

<P>
 So what would be the greatest feat, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 "Definitely the RBI record," Angel designated hitter Chili Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Blue Jay hitting coach Larry Hisle: "To break the (190) RBI record might 
be the greatest feat in history." 
</P>
<P>
 Just what does Carter, who has 56 RBIs, consider the greatest feat? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I'd take the home run record any day," Carter said. "That's the 
toughest. There's a lot of ways you can drive in runs, but there's only one way 
you can hit a homer."

HOLLYWOOD PARK; FILLY ANDESTINE IS STEPPING UP IN THE HAWTHORNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood Wildcat won an Eclipse Award as the nation's top 3-year-old filly in 
1993, a year capped by a narrow victory over Paseana in the Breeders' Cup 
Distaff. Golden Klair and Likeable Style are multiple-stakes winners. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these fillies, however, will be the hottest 4-year-old running in the 
$106,000 Hawthorne Handicap Sunday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Andestine, a California-bred daughter of Native Prospector, enters the 1 
1/16-mile stake with five consecutive victories. Since finishing a distant 
fifth in her debut on April 10, 1993, Andestine has made no mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning four sprints for owners Raymond and Betty Rosen and Donna Klerer 
and trainer David Hofmans, Andestine tried a mile for the first time in the 
$100,000 Sonoma Handicap at Golden Gate Fields on April 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Native Prospector's offspring tend to be most effective in sprints, 
she had little problem, beating favored Soviet Problem by two lengths in 1:34 
2/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Andestine will try a bit more distance and stiffer competition in the 
Hawthorne, the first of a three-race series for older fillies and mares on dirt 
at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's doing great," Hofmans said Friday. "She worked seven furlongs in 1:27 
2/5 the other morning and went nice. She finished well and she's coming into 
this race strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'll get tested (Sunday). This is going to be her first-class test." 
</P>
<P>
 Win or lose, Andestine has already provided a major success story for the 
Rosens, who bred the filly. They own her dam, Here's To Love. 
</P>
<P>
 A chemical industry consultant, Rosen and his wife were casual racing fans 
before meeting Jeff Siegel, a syndicated handicapper and longtime horse owner, 
about 13 years ago. They became more involved and have been partners with 
Siegel and others in many horses. Winsome Eris, Floriano, Mandy Mack, Straight 
Story, Hollyfrankie and Lifaregal are among other horses the Rosens have raced, 
but Raymond Rosen said Andestine is the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been unbelievable," he said. "I've never had an experience like it. To 
watch a horse you bred and see it develop and have it exceed all your 
expectations is something you can't put into words. It's hard to describe." 
</P>
<P>
 Andestine's first start in nearly 14 months was less than auspicious. After 
trailing early in a six-furlong race against California-bred maidens, she 
finished 11 3/4 lengths behind heavily favored Charmalotta. 
</P>
<P>
 Brought back four weeks later, she overcame some early trouble and went on to 
a 3 1/2-length victory. Andestine suffered bucked shins in the race and didn't 
return until last Jan. 7 at Santa Anita. Ridden by Chris McCarron for the first 
time, she won by eight lengths. The two lengths by which she won the Sonoma was 
the smallest margin of victory during her streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's surprised me a little bit," Hofmans said. "I thought she was a going to 
be a nice filly who tried real hard every time, but I didn't know she would be 
this good. She's done everything right so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Wildcat hadn't done anything right in California until her last 
start, the La Canada Stakes at Santa Anita on Feb. 5. After being unbeaten in 
five starts for trainer Neil Drysdale since being shipped from Florida by 
owners Irving and Marge Cowan, the Kris S. filly finished third as the 1-2 
favorite behind Stalcreek and Alyshena. 
</P>
<P>
 That was Hollywood Wildcat's first race since the Breeders' Cup Distaff and 
she seemed uncomfortable over a track slowed by rain. She came down with a 
cough, but has been training well for her return. 
</P>
<P>
 Likeable Style, one of the most promising 3-year-old fillies in the country 
early last year, ran poorly in the Hollywood Oaks and the Del Mar Oaks. After 
being away since Aug. 22, the daughter of Nijinsky II worked five furlongs in 
59 4/5 Wednesday and has also been timed in 1:36 3/5 for a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's come back well and she's doing good," trainer Richard Mandella said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other entrants in the Hawthorne are Golden Klair, who won the Silver 
Belles and the A Gleam in her only two starts at Hollywood Park, and Potridee, 
who has three victories in eight starts since arriving from South America.

DENIKES LIKE CHANCES IN LA PRIMERA DEL ANO

 Carol and Edward DeNike appear to be in a good spot for the $113,000 La 
Primera del Ano Derby tonight at Los Alamitos. They own Her First Cin and 
Streakin Millie, the winner of one trial and third-place finisher in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first La Primera trial, on May 14, Her First Cin defeated Jumpin Tac 
Flash -- last year's champion 2-year-old filly with earnings of more than 
$100,000 -- and Totally Illegal, both trained by Blane Schvaneveldt. 
</P>
<P>
 Her First Cin, at 12-1, won the 400-yard race in 20.06 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The second trial was a battle between Artesias Special Gal and Pretty 
Sensation, won by Artesias Special Gal in 19.91. Pretty Sensation was second in 
20.05. Streakin' Millie's time was 20.18. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward DeNike, who lives in Seattle, watched the races, looked at the times 
and decided that the numbers didn't tell the real story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was worried about Jumpin Tac Flash and Totally Illegal, but now I feel 
we're the one to beat," he said. "The first race was better, even though the 
second time was better." 
</P>
<P>
 As a 2-year-old, Her First Cin ran second to Totally Illegal in the Governor's 
Cup Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the field and qualifying times: The Money Crunch, 20.09 seconds; 
Irish Effort, 20.14; Untamed Heart, 20.20; KC Dashing Deb, 20.24; Intimate 
Encounter, 20.26, and Beds Last Star, 20.34. JODY BERGER

POLICE CONCLUDE SCYPHERS PROBE; CHARGES MAY BE FILED; INVESTIGATION: SPECIFICS 
OF ALLEGATIONS ARE STILL A MYSTERY MORE THAN THREE WEEKS AFTER POPULAR SIMI 
VALLEY COACH IS SUSPENDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Detectives said Friday they will ask the Ventura County District Attorney to 
consider filing criminal charges against Simi Valley High baseball Coach Mike 
Scyphers, who is under investigation for allegedly mishandling his team's money 
and discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement wrapped up a weeks-long probe by Simi Valley Police into 
allegations against Scyphers that school officials and police still refuse to 
reveal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter that should be reviewed by the District Attorney's office, and 
it's also potentially a personnel matter for the school district," said Lt. 
Mark Layhew, head of Simi Valley Police detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials also were mum on the police investigation and their own 
internal investigation. Susan Parks, assistant superintendent of the Simi 
Valley Unified School District, refused to discuss the case and referred all 
inquiries to the personnel office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not releasing any internal information until we've got all of our facts 
together," said Leon Mattingley, the district's assistant superintendent for 
personnel. "I think like everyone we're waiting for the outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers, 41, still on administrative leave with pay from his coaching post, 
also declined to comment. The highly successful coach who has brought the 
baseball program to national prominence has filed a grievance against the 
district, claiming he was suspended without five days' notice as required by a 
union contract. District officials say he is not entitled to that notice 
because he was suspended only as a coach, not as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting out of uniform in a lawn chair down the third base line Friday 
afternoon, a Pioneers' cap on his head, Scyphers watched his team lose to 
Fountain Valley, ranked second in the state, in the Southern Section Division I 
quarterfinals, 12-1. 
</P>
<P>
 His players wore black caps they bought to protest their coach's May 3 
suspension. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian O'Neill, Scyphers' attorney, said Friday in a phone interview, "I'm not 
going to comment on what (the police) are doing. . . . That's the nature of the 
world. They do an investigation, and the prosecutorial assessments are made by 
the D.A.'s office." 
</P>
<P>
 In the stands, sympathies ran strong in favor of Scyphers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a witch hunt," said Fred Boyer, father of Brett Boyer, a junior 
reserve first baseman. "This man never stole anything from anybody. I think 
when all's said and done, I don't think they've got anything, and I know at 
least 25 other people sitting here who you couldn't convince otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Hankins, father of senior third baseman Ryan Hankins, added, "They're 
still going to have to prove to me that he's done something wrong. . . . My 
opinion is still the school district is out to get him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald Grant said he will meet Tuesday with 
Simi Valley Police detectives to review the allegations school officials made 
against Scyphers and the results of the police probe. 
</P>
<P>
 Players and assistant coaches said that detectives have grilled them 
specifically on Scyphers' use of field rental fees to pay his assistant coaches 
and on a traditional team discipline practice called "the block." 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers has admitted he accepted a field rental fee from an adult baseball 
league last summer, which school district officials said violates their 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers has said he cashed the league's check and in turn paid his assistant 
coaches -- $500 to Darin Furlong and $300 to Shaun Murphy, including $100 from 
Scyphers' own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Scyphers also has admitted using "the block," a discipline system in which 
players bid small amounts of money for the chance to give teammates who break 
team rules a swat with a wooden paddle. State law forbids the use of corporal 
punishment in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But players and assistant coaches said the detectives' questions also strayed 
far from the topics of discipline and finance -- even touching on whether 
Scyphers let his underage players indulge in adult vices such as alcohol, 
gambling and tobacco on road trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were on a fishing expedition," said Murphy, a former Simi Valley player 
who worked as an assistant last year. "They were asking about everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Layhew replied, "The questions asked by the detectives were specific to 
the investigation." But he declined to say more on the scope of the questioning 
by Detectives Robert Hopkins and Kathy Shatz. 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing questioning about vague and secret allegations initially shocked 
the players and stirred their parents to launch an angry campaign of meetings, 
court filings and even newspaper ads to try to keep Scyphers on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's police announcement only further angered his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the police) are full of . . .," Fred Boyer said. "I have known the 
man for quite a while and I just don't believe it."

CITYSCAPES / CECILIA RASMUSSEN: A REMNANT OF A PIONEER PAST WILL SOON BE 
SURROUNDED BY CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE: DEVELOPMENT.; GLENDORA CEMETERY A TINY 
ISLAND AMID STREAM OF CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Off a path that meanders through a vast sea of potted plants, some bursting 
with the smell of citrus, sits a tiny, forgotten cemetery -- an island of 
consecrated tranquillity in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidden from view, surrounded by a commercial nursery, the 118-year-old 
Fairmount Cemetery, the area's first Protestant graveyard, still survives. It 
is a remnant of a sometimes violent pioneer past that will soon be surrounded 
by California's future: development. 
</P>
<P>
 The lonely little cemetery on San Felipe Hill in Glendora began in 1876, when 
settler James Carson Preston donated the two-acre parcel -- a former Native 
American burial site -- as a public graveyard. The need arose after a German 
immigrant and woodcutter named Nelson was killed protecting his wood from a 
thief. 
</P>
<P>
 Many early settlers followed Nelson into the little graveyard, most of them 
under more peaceful circumstances. They were from such families as the Wrights, 
Doughertys, Pollards and Griswolds, who carved the first farms and towns out of 
the San Gabriel Valley. The northeast slope of the cemetery was set aside for 
Latino farm laborers, Native Americans and outlaws. Higher ground was reserved 
for the graves of whites. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The land was once part of the old Rancho Azusa, owned by another noted family, 
the Slausons. 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, part of the ranch was broken up, mostly for houses. One 
heir sold her land to the Manresa Jesuit Retreat Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Another section became property of the Monrovia Nursery Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the nursery -- the world's biggest commercial grower of potted plants -- 
is selling off the old Rancho Azusa land for residential and commercial 
development, joining a major home builder in a plan to develop the 600 acres, 
which lie along the border of Azusa and Glendora. The project would be one of 
the largest in the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been little public opposition to the project, which will preserve 
the cemetery but take away the dense plants and shrubs on the nursery grounds 
that have shielded its 200 graves for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Fairmount Cemetery Trustees, a court-appointed body that oversees 
the graveyard, couldn't be happier. Elizabeth Shorey, president of the 
trustees, said, "We're kind of anxious to see the development get started, as 
long as the developers take care of certain conditions, such as proper grading, 
building an access road, wall and parking spaces." 
</P>
<P>
 The cemetery is so remote now that the only way to get there is through the 
nursery entrance at Foothill Boulevard and Palm Drive, which splits into twin 
driveways lined with 226 California fan palm trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the cemetery to be respected and (want to) be a good neighbor to it," 
said Randall Lewis, executive vice president of Lewis Homes Management Corp. 
"It will take six or seven years to develop the property. We are still working 
out the details." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1900s, picnickers enjoyed the fragrance of citrus trees and the 
songs of the birds that flitted among the tombstones. Years later, teen-agers 
used the graveyard as a hangout. Their imaginations ran wild as they read 
inscriptions on the tombstones. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the cemetery became weed-choked and overgrown. Several times, 
Junior Marines, a battalion of 60 martially disciplined and khaki-uniformed 
volunteer youths, stormed the hillside with hoes, rakes and shovels to spruce 
up the cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees put up a fence in the 1950s after some local boys on horseback 
lassoed several headstones, carrying them as far away as El Monte. Other 
vandals broke headstones, stole copper markers, dug up graves and even beheaded 
one skeleton. Someone rolled up a large stone, solemnly if incorrectly 
engraved: "Fairmont Cemetary." 
</P>
<P>
 Amateur filmmakers once made a Western using the cemetery as a backdrop. "A 
stunt man fell off his horse riding through the cemetery as desperadoes -- 
hiding behind the tombstones -- jumped him and stole the box of gold on the 
back of his horse," recalled Christopher Wilmans, a Glendora resident who 
played in the cemetery as a child. Wilmans recalls catching tarantulas and 
playing cowboys and Indians amid the cactus, sagebrush and eucalyptus trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Always, there were jokers. Shorey said that several years ago, "as a prank, 
someone deposited my husband's great-grandmother's tombstone on the lawn at 
City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Each trustee has ancestors buried in the cemetery, and Glendora declared the 
burial ground a historic landmark in 1991. "We also give about five cemetery 
tours a year for local groups, including elementary schools," Shorey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The small plot of land is so crowded that only descendants of the original 
dead can be buried there. The last burial took place seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Every Memorial Day for four decades or so, the trustees have arranged for a 
21-gun salute and the playing of taps to honor the score of veterans buried 
there, soldiers from the Civil War to World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Development plans or no, they will do the same this Memorial Day. Monday's 
ceremony begins at 11:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But the neighboring Manresa Retreat is planning to close its doors later this 
year, unwilling to live with the disruption and noise of development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just moving, we're closing down for good," said Ruben Quezada, a 
spokesman for the retreat. "Without peace and quiet, this will not be a 
suitable area for a retreat house, once the development goes in."

CITY INVESTIGATING DELAYS IN FIRE SAFETY REFORMS; REGULATIONS: MEASURES SOUGHT 
AFTER PICO/WESTLAKE BLAZE WOULD FOCUS ON MAKING LANDLORDS MORE ACCOUNTABLE. 
COUNCIL ORDERS HOUSING OFFICIALS TO EXPLAIN LACK OF PROGRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sweeping fire safety reforms ordered by the City Council in the wake of a 
fatal apartment house fire last year have been mired in the city bureaucracy 
for at least six months, although most would cost little, if anything, to 
implement, city officials confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated with the lack of progress on several reforms to improve the fire 
safety of apartment buildings, City Council members recently ordered top city 
housing officials to return with a report explaining "the reasons for delay, 
and the time frame for accomplishing the work." 
</P>
<P>
 One measure would allow city building officials to sanction landlords who put 
their tenants in jeopardy by not maintaining the proper fire safety equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate set of reforms proposed by the Fire Department also has not been 
implemented after an arson blaze that killed 10 residents at 330 S. Burlington 
Ave. last May. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am impatient that we are not moving fast enough and hard enough to make 
sure these buildings are . . . brought up to a standard of being clean, safe 
and sanitary," said Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg, who sponsored the motion 
ordering housing officials to account for the lack of progress. "We need to get 
all this done at once." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported Thursday that another set of reform measures proposed by 
fire officials, such as plans for a fire safety inspection task force and a 
computerized safety record system, have not been implemented despite being 
proposed a year ago. Even cameras to document violations, and file cabinets to 
store new records, have not been purchased. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said they have been hamstrung by budget cuts and other 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, a city fire commissioner questioned that response, and said he 
plans to ask fire officials why they have not acted on those proposed reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am outraged by the snail's pace approach that the Fire Department is 
taking," said commission member Larry Gonzalez. "I intend to bring this up at 
our next commission meeting. Things aren't getting done." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said fire officials have not made the issue a high enough priority, 
and that he did not agree with the Fire Department's position that budget 
constraints are to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't buy that argument whatsoever," said Gonzalez, who was appointed by 
Mayor Richard Riordan two months ago. "This is an emergency situation where 
many of these people are unsafe." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Goldberg and other city officials have quietly expressed 
frustration at the lack of progress on the City Hall-based initiatives giving 
new authority to building officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the proposals are an important weapon in the effort to prevent 
so-called "fire trap" buildings because they focus on making landlords 
accountable for conditions in their buildings, which frequently lack fire 
extinguishers and fire hoses and have broken or locked fire escapes. Fire 
officials have conceded that they are too understaffed to police the buildings 
day and night, and that it is up to the property owners to maintain them. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 18, the council, acting on Goldberg's motion, ordered that officials of 
the city housing department appear before the council's Housing and Community 
Redevelopment Committee to answer questions as to why none of the reforms have 
been implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fire safety plan, approved by the council Dec. 21, called for progress 
reports starting in mid-January, but none have been forwarded, according to 
Ralph R. Esparza, head of the housing department's rent stabilization division. 
</P>
<P>
 Esparza said the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake has been the primary reason why 
the improvements have not been implemented. He added that some improvements 
would take changes in city ordinances and further study. 
</P>
<P>
 But Esparza acknowledged that the improvements are desperately needed to help 
protect the residents of the city's densely populated urban areas like Pico 
Union/Westlake, where the fire occurred. He said he expects to have a progress 
report by the time he appears before the council's housing committee June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a concentrated effort to target recalcitrant property owners with the 
various initiatives (we) either have in place or are pursuing," Esparza said. 
"We were working on it when the earthquake hit, but since then all our 
resources were tied up. In recent weeks we have tried to put these initiatives 
back on track." 
</P>
<P>
 One measure calls for expanding and strengthening two low-income housing 
programs by allowing city housing department officials to swiftly withhold rent 
monies from landlords who do not maintain critically important fire safety 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, apartment building owners can be penalized for building and safety 
violations under the Rent Escrow Account Program and the Rent Reduction 
Program, but they cannot be penalized for fire safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Burlington Avenue fire provided a tragic and graphic illustration of the 
need to strengthen both of these pioneering programs," according to a motion 
made by Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky last year, after The Times reported that 
many buildings in the Pico/Westlake area had serious fire safety violations. 
"Other changes can be made . . . that will dramatically assist in our efforts 
to abate slum housing citywide." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The council also ordered officials of the city's housing, building and safety, 
and fire departments to "develop a plan for overall coordination of the city's 
slum abatement programs." Critics have said a lack of coordination among the 
agencies fostered a system of lax oversight of fire prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 To make landlords more accountable, Esparza said his department is considering 
a system of licensing property managers, creating some type of "housing court" 
and getting the authority to place slum buildings into receivership -- where 
they would be taken from their owners if problems persist. 
</P>
<P>
 Some apartment managers told The Times that they must padlock doors -- a fire 
safety violation -- to keep the homeless and gang members out. Some managers 
blame tenants for violations, saying they deactivate fire alarms when frying 
food, and some steal the fire extinguishers. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Atty. Richard M. Bobb, head of the city's multi-agency slum 
housing task force, said such excuses often come from landlords who do not want 
to spend the time and money keeping up their buildings.

CHARGES FLY IN RANCOROUS JUDICIAL CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A rancorous campaign for Downey Municipal Court judge has swerved from the 
genial path most judicial elections follow because one candidate is digging 
into his opponent's past, clamoring about an attempted payoff not to run and 
trying to spark a debate over family values. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest pits Roy L. Paul, a veteran civic leader, against Benjamin R. 
Margolis, a political newcomer who has shown he is not afraid to cast stones. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul, a court commissioner and former Bell Gardens City Council member, 
accuses his opponent of probing into his personal life and spreading tales 
about him having multiple girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolis, a pharmacist and part-time attorney, concedes only that his campaign 
workers questioned Paul's ex-girlfriend and insists that he is the victim of 
underhanded tactics, including an attempted payoff to bow out of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolis' attacks have dismayed political observers accustomed to more 
dignified judicial races, including the retiring judge whom Margolis and Paul 
hope to replace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very seldom are there attacks like this," said Judge Richard C. Cumming, who 
supports Paul. "Judicial races tend to be of higher elevation." 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the June 7 election will represent the judicial district serving 
Downey, Norwalk and La Mirada, and will preside, for the most part, over minor 
civil cases and misdemeanor prosecutions for drug violations and petty thefts. 
It is one of the lower rungs in the judicial order, but the job does carry 
prestige, a $90,680 annual salary and a six-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Margolis and Paul both promise to be tough on drunk drivers, drug offenders 
and other troublemakers who enter their courtrooms. They have spent more than 
$65,000 apiece on flyers, cable television commercials, newspaper 
advertisements and political consultants to get their messages across. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolis, 49, is a self-proclaimed political outsider who says he refuses to 
accept political contributions, including an alleged $10,000 donation to bow 
out of the race and pursue another office. Margolis said the offer came during 
a recent fund-raiser for a local hospital, but he cannot substantiate the 
allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 A 25-year resident of Pacific Palisades, he became the chief pharmacist at 
Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in Downey in October. He also operates a 
part-time law practice out of his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul, 44, campaigns hard on local ties. His mother was the first mayor of Bell 
Gardens in 1961, and he took over her law practice when she died in 1978. Paul 
served on the Bell Gardens City Council from 1980 to 1984, and on the Downey 
City Council from 1986 to 1991. He resigned from the council when he was 
appointed to the commissioner's post in Downey Municipal Court, where he tries 
accused traffic scofflaws and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul questioned his opponent's qualifications because Margolis is a full-time 
pharmacist and lives outside the area.  
</P>
<P>
 Margolis points out that judges do not have to live where they serve. He 
suggests that his family values are superior to those of Paul, who has no 
children and whose 18-month marriage was annulled in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 In a campaign flyer, Margolis describes himself as a married man of 22 years 
with an 11-year-old son. Concerning Paul's family values, the flyer offers no 
specific details but advises: "You be the judge!" 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a family, you have stability; you're not going to do something 
erratic," Margolis said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Margolis said he has no interest in Paul's personal life, he admitted 
that his campaign workers approached Gracie Gonzalez, Paul's ex-girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, a personal trainer who competes in national fitness competitions, 
said she was called once by Ruth Merchey, Margolis' campaign manager, and four 
times by campaign volunteer Lucille Saunders. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez said that they "wanted dirty laundry" and that Saunders alluded to a 
reward. "She said it would be worth my time," Gonzalez said. "I said, 'I don't 
have anything negative to say.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In separate interviews, Saunders and Merchey denied offering Gonzalez money. 
"The word was that she had something on him," Saunders said. "We wanted to get 
as much information as we could." Margolis said he only wanted to find out 
whether Paul had ever misused city funds as a city councilman.  
</P>
<P>
 Paul said the Margolis campaign "is trying to use the fact that I'm single as 
a weapon and insinuating that something is wrong."  
</P>
<P>
 In a debate Thursday, Paul complained that Margolis supporters were taking 
pictures of people entering his house. The existence of one such picture has 
been confirmed. It reportedly shows a woman entering Paul's house with a key. 
The photo was taken by Paul's neighbor, a Margolis supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchey, Margolis' campaign manager, says the woman in the photograph is 
someone Paul continues to see even while involved in another relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul identifies the woman as his housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolis also has publicly suggested that Paul "might be guilty of a 
misdemeanor" because he continues to advertise his law practice in the phone 
book even though he is a court commissioner. Paul said that his law practice is 
defunct and that the purpose of the advertisement is to direct former clients 
to a new attorney who now holds their wills and other documents. The ad is 
legal, Paul said, because the new attorney pays for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The series of scuffles has thrust the campaign into the local spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more lawn signs and heat about it than about the City Council 
campaign," said Downey Councilwoman Joyce L. Lawrence.

OUTCRY OVER SHOOTING GROWS; DISPUTE: FAMILY CALLS FOR FURTHER INQUIRY INTO 
WOUNDING OF TEEN-AGER BY A LYNWOOD GROCER. PROSECUTORS DEFEND DECISION NOT TO

 Aldo Vega opened his collar to show the jagged patch of fresh scar tissue 
where the bullet hit his right clavicle, explaining that the bone deflected it 
into his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 His family agonized last month during the hours he was in surgery. Doctors had 
told them Vega could be paralyzed. But the teen-ager pulled through and is 
recovering, although he sometimes uses a cane to steady himself. And what he 
calls a "strange sensation" in his right wrist comes and goes. 
</P>
<P>
 A banner with dozens of signatures was stretched above a doorway in the Vega 
family home in Lynwood this week, reading: "Happy Birthday Aldo. Get Well Soon. 
From All Your Boxing Friends." 
</P>
<P>
 The family's living room was filled with more than a dozen trophies Aldo and 
his identical twin brother, Bardo, have won as amateur boxers. Two pairs of 
boxing gloves -- one decorated with the Mexican flag, the other with the U.S. 
flag -- hung on a living room wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening and closing his right fist, Aldo Vega said it is too soon to tell 
whether he will be able to continue boxing. He said he knows how close he came 
to being killed, and he is angry that the Lynwood grocer who shot him April 2 
during a confrontation over a package of cookies he allegedly stole will not be 
prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not good," said Vega, who turned 15 on April 14. "He committed a 
crime. He tried to kill me." 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting has put Vega at the center of a growing controversy pitting 
prominent Mexican Americans against the district attorney's office. They feel 
there are sufficient grounds to charge the grocer with assault with a deadly 
weapon, and have asked state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren to conduct an independent 
investigation of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts of this case scream for a second opinion," attorney Alex Jacinto 
wrote to Lungren. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said he has no problem with the call for Lungren to 
investigate. "This is frankly not that difficult a case from a legal 
viewpoint," Garcetti said. "If the attorney general wants to spend the time 
looking at it, I'm sure he'll arrive at the same decision we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Pamela Frohreich, who evaluated the case, said prosecutors 
do not condone Kim's actions. But, "the obstacles to successful prosecution 
were just enormous," she said. "We looked at it so closely. It disturbs us that 
merchants are taking off after kids over cookies." 
</P>
<P>
 Vega, a ninth-grader at Lynwood's Vista High School, said he did not steal 
anything from the market, and that he never threatened Kim. The teen-ager said 
he left the market with the cookies because Juan Gonzalez, a friend who 
remained in the store, said he would pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 As Vega and Miguel Torres, 18, walked down the street eating the cookies, Vega 
said he heard tires screeching. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard foul language, someone shouting, 'Stop! (epithet)!' " Vega said. "I 
turned and I felt something hard on my neck, like something grabbed me. But I 
didn't know I had been shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres ran away, Vega said. "I walked across the street, and I fell down," 
Vega said. "Then I knew I had been shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynwood grocer Su Yong (Michael) Kim gave authorities a different version of 
the shooting. He said he believed that Vega and Torres had stolen cookies and 
potato chips from his store. Armed with a handgun, Kim chased the teen-agers in 
his car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kim confronted the youths a few blocks from the store where, he said, Torres 
threatened him with what he thought was a knife. Vega raised his shirt as 
though he were reaching for something in his waistband, Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Originally, Kim claimed that he fired in self-defense," prosecutors said in a 
report concluding that there was insufficient evidence to charge the grocer. In 
a later statement, prosecutors said, Kim told them the gun accidentally 
discharged as he moved it from one hand to the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega, his friend Gonzalez, who was in the grocery when the incident began, and 
a man who said he witnessed the shooting disputed several points in Kim's 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the story Gonzalez is telling now is different from what he 
and others told investigators earlier. And other witnesses have confirmed Kim's 
account, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, 16, said he told Kim that he was paying for everything. But the 
grocer insisted that Vega and Torres had taken more than Gonzalez was paying 
for, and refused to accept the money, Gonzalez said in an interview with The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Mr. Kim that everything was together," said Gonzalez. He said he told 
Kim that Vega had not taken anything, but the grocer "got his gun and his car 
keys." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Frohreich said Gonzalez told police a different version. "There was 
a lot of confusion about who was supposed to pay, but this is the first time 
I've heard from Gonzalez that Mr. Kim refused to accept any money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five boys were in the store together, and Gonzalez said he was paying for all 
of them, Frohreich said. Vega and Torres held up their items for the grocer to 
see and walked out of the store, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But once Vega and Torres left, Gonzalez said he was not paying for their 
items, Frohreich said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Torres verified that," Frohreich said. "He said he knew Gonzalez didn't have 
enough money to pay for all of the stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 She conceded that in the confusion, Vega may not have known Gonzalez was not 
going to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's account of how the shooting occurred was challenged this week by a man 
who said he initially refused to talk to detectives, telling them he did not 
want to get involved. Roberto Hinojos, 30, said he was less than 100 feet away 
when Kim shot Vega. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega and Torres "were just walking," Hinojos said from Idaho, where he was 
visiting friends. "I didn't see them threatening the man. He got out of his 
car, shouted at these kids and started shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinojos, who said he is now willing to talk to investigators, said he heard 
four or five shots. But Frohreich said only one shot was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Vega family members told a social worker at Martin Luther King Jr./Drew 
Medical Center that Vega said he was shot when he was reaching for change, 
Frohreich said. But Vega's brother, Elvis, 19, said, "We never told them that," 
adding that "Aldo couldn't speak" at that time because of the bullet wound. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said an independent eyewitness stated that Vega's pockets were 
pulled out and his shirt flipped up just before the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 No weapon was recovered, but a screwdriver was found about 12 feet from where 
the shooting took place, prosecutors said. Aldo Vega said in an interview that 
Torres had shown him the screwdriver, saying he carried it for protection.

LOCAL ELECTIONS; HISTORY OF FLUKES IN ASSESSOR'S RACE DRAWS A CROWD OF HOPEFULS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can lightning strike a third time? 
</P>
<P>
 That's what 15 of 16 candidates for county assessor are hoping for in the June 
7 primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching mid-level employees of the assessor's office win the powerful 
post in back-to-back election flukes, the hopefuls are running long-shot 
campaigns and waiting for another bolt to blast them out of obscurity and into 
the $151,000-a-year job. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign for tax assessor has been marked by constant mudslinging, a 
lawsuit and large field of competitors that includes 14 current and former 
employees of the assessor's office who think they can do a better job than the 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Assessor Kenneth P. Hahn won the election four years ago in an upset 
attributed to his having the same name as a popular county supervisor. He was a 
deputy assessor at the time and political neophyte. 
</P>
<P>
 He is trying to dampen any sparks from his competition by running an 
aggressive campaign with a war chest of more than $300,000 and endorsements 
from the political Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn has been endorsed by all five members of the county Board of Supervisors, 
all 15 members of the Los Angeles City Council and groups ranging from the very 
liberal Service Employees International Union, Local 660, to the very 
conservative Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 He has even been endorsed by the other Kenneth Hahn, the retired longtime 
county supervisor who is not related to Assessor Hahn. "He won last time with 
the name and not 5 cents worth of advertising," Supervisor Hahn said. He is now 
endorsing Assessor Hahn because "he's run a smooth and efficient office. He's 
the best man for the job." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a change from four years ago, when Supervisor Hahn and most of the 
political Establishment supported then-Assessor John Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch won the seat in 1986 on what political analysts said was the strength of 
his ballot designation as "deputy assessor" -- which looked impressive to 
voters but is actually a fairly low-level position in the office. He was one of 
12 candidates running for the seat that was being vacated by two-term Assessor 
Alexander Pope. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch narrowly lost to Hahn in 1990, pulling 48.5% of the vote to Hahn's 
51.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch wants the top job back and he has joined the pack in hopes of forcing 
Hahn into a runoff and another November showdown. "I can do a better job than 
the man who's there," Lynch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the rules of the nonpartisan race for assessor, a candidate must receive 
50% of the votes plus one to win the post outright in the primary. If no 
candidate receives that much, the two top vote-getters will face off in a 
general election in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessor is primarily responsible for preparing property tax valuations. 
The department's 1,800 employees locate taxable property in the county, 
identify its ownership and establish the value, including reassessments because 
of changes in ownership, market conditions, new construction or damage, such as 
in the recent fires and earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The office lost much of its clout when California voters approved Proposition 
13 in 1978. The assessor used to have wide latitude in determining the value of 
property, but Proposition 13 reduced most assessments to a simple arithmetic 
calculation based on the sales price of a property. 
</P>
<P>
 For Hahn and Lynch, the campaign is the continuation of political grudge match 
that began nearly a decade ago over some personal slights. Hahn said he ran in 
1990 only to make the campaign difficult for Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the upset election in 1990, Hahn proceeded to send half a dozen 
anonymous cards and applications to Lynch's home. They were often insulting, 
and Lynch found them to be harassing. He filed a lawsuit against Hahn seeking 
an injunction and damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn acknowledged sending the mail, saying Lynch deserved it after the 
bullying manner in which he ran the department when he was assessor. During his 
tenure, Lynch made headlines when kicked county auditors out of his office and 
when he allegedly roughed up an employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn has publicly apologized and acknowledged that his actions were, at best, 
silly. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Englander, Hahn's campaign manager, said he does not believe the 
episode has been politically damaging. Since the lawsuit was disclosed by The 
Times, Hahn has lost none of the endorsements he had received from more than 
100 elected officials, Englander said. 
</P>
<P>
 But other candidates say Hahn's actions show he is not fit for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially I just thought he was incompetent," said Robert Burman, a principal 
appraiser in the assessor's office and candidate for election. "But now I 
question his emotional well-being." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Burman, like many of the candidates, said the department is top-heavy and 
faulted Hahn for not fixing the problem-plagued computer system that was 
purchased and installed by Hahn's two predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's nothing more than a figurehead with a big salary," said Marsha Tuton, a 
supervising deputy assessor who is in the race. "He got there on a name, 
someone else's name," she said, referring to the confusion with the former 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the candidates are running shoestring campaigns with, at most, a few 
thousand dollars of their own money. Most have been making the rounds of 
business and political clubs, speaking wherever and whenever they can get an 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the candidates privately acknowledge that they are running only to 
draw support away from Hahn, in the hopes that it will help Lynch. It is the 
same strategy employed by Lynch's enemies, who packed the ballot with half a 
dozen candidates in the 1990 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the candidates contacted say they are resentful of Hahn's taking large 
campaign contributions from special interests and they are frustrated by their 
own inability to reach large numbers of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean they have lost hope. 
</P>
<P>
 John Carl (Broggy) Brogdon, a retired assessor's office employee, said he is 
the clear choice in a crowded field with better-known candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got the longest name, that's how you can remember to vote for me," he 
said. Despite high hopes and slogans, Brogdon received 6% of the vote when he 
ran in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Hahn defends his record, saying that the department is less top-heavy than 
when he took over and that the computer system's problems are just about 
solved. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he went further than any assessor in the state to give lower property 
reassessments to homeowners hurt by the decline in real estate prices and the 
recent series of natural and man-made disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 And, Hahn says, morale has improved, despite the large number of employees 
challenging him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I only get one term, I feel I've done a lot," Hahn said. "If I get two 
terms, I can do a lot more." 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates on the ballot are: Alan Bato, deputy county assessor; Burman, 
manager in the assessor's office; Brogdon, taxpayer appeals representative; Roy 
Z. Cossio, supervising deputy assessor; Ruben Vasquez Chagoy, deputy assessor; 
Richard B. Forsch, attorney; Khalil Khalil, engineer; Dennis (Dan) C. Kumaus, 
deputy assessor; Roy R. Sharman, assessor's chief appraiser; Tuton, supervising 
deputy assessor; William R. Lenney Jr., deputy assessor/contractor; Harley Lee 
Outten, assessor representative; Nick Stansfield, deputy assessor, and Janet 
Woods, businesswoman.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; OFFICER 
BARRED FROM LAPD JOB ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge issued a restraining order Friday against a Los Angeles police officer 
who is believed to be organizing a mass sickout planned for Monday, but other 
officers said the action is expected to go ahead as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Police Chief Willie L. Williams said he supports the officers' 
fight for a pay raise but urged them to report to work as scheduled and 
remember the communities they are sworn to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is both legally and morally wrong," Williams said of the planned job 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 As negotiations continued Friday in City Hall in an effort to end the labor 
dispute, Deputy City Atty. Art Walsh won the order preventing Officer Gary 
Morgan from participating in the so-called blue flu or urging his colleagues to 
join. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan resigned from the Police Protective League's negotiating team this 
month to protest his union's handling of the talks. Later, officers voted by a 
3-1 margin to reject a contract deal proposed by the city and the union 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 That deal would have given officers a 3% raise over each of the next two 
years.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; FELONY SEX 
CHARGES AGAINST EX-JUDGE REDUCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Felony charges against a former judge accused of fondling a female lawyer in 
his chambers were reduced to misdemeanors this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Samuel Feinstein, who has been fired from his job as a workers' 
compensation judge, was originally charged with felony false imprisonment and 
felony sexual battery. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Court Judge Mary E. Waters instead ordered him to stand trial on 
misdemeanor charges of unlawful touching and false imprisonment. Defense 
attorneys had argued that the alleged conduct did not warrant felony charges. 
The prosecution disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel his conduct rose to the level of a felony violation," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Carol Straughn. Defense attorney Philip D. Israels called the 
evidence flimsy. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint was made against Feinstein, 61, by a 40-year-old attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 She testified at the preliminary hearing that Feinstein invited her to his 
office in the Van Nuys State Office Building on March 28 to give her the next 
date of a lecture series they had previously attended. She said that as she was 
leaving, Feinstein told her to close the door because he had something else to 
tell her, and when she did, he pushed his body up against her and reached 
inside her clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she struggled free, grabbed her briefcase and left. State officials 
fired Feinstein in April after he refused to cooperate with an internal 
investigation.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MANHATTAN BEACH; 
DETAINEE NOT RULED OUT AS SUSPECT IN OFFICER'S SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man wanted for questioning in the Dec. 27 murder of Manhattan Beach Police 
Officer Martin Ganz has not been identified as the killer by witnesses who were 
shown photographs of him. However, Phuc Huu Nguyen, 25, being held on federal 
charges in Virginia, has not been eliminated as a suspect in the case, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Witnesses in the case were shown photos of the suspect," Los Angeles County 
sheriff's spokeswoman Irma Becerra said. "They did not identify him as the 
killer, but he has not been completely disregarded as a suspect by homicide 
detectives." The suspect in the case has been described as an Asian man, 
possibly Filipino, 25 to 39 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen was named as a possible suspect in one of more than 1,800 telephone 
tips received by the task force investigating the slaying. He was arrested in 
Virginia by immigration agents Monday for failing to obey a federal deportation 
order, and is expected to be returned to California for questioning in the Ganz 
case.

VETERANS HUNT FOR THEIR HEROES; HISTORY: D-DAY EVENT PLANNERS HAVE CHURCHILL 
AND IKE IMPERSONATORS AND ARE LOOKING FOR A PATTON AND AN F.D.R. BUT THEY 
DECIDE THEY CAN DO WITHOUT A HITLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eisenhower, Churchill and their troops pursued him 50 years ago. But they gave 
up the hunt for Hitler on Friday in South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of an 800-member veterans group planning to have a Hitler look-alike 
take a mock drubbing from Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower and Prime Minister Winston 
Churchill impersonators at a D-day anniversary celebration say the enemy is no 
longer invited. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't find a decent Hitler," said Bob Stane, president of the B-17 
Combat Crewmen & Wingmen's Assn., which is co-sponsoring the June 6 event at 
the South Gate Post Office. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then, there never was a decent Hitler." 
</P>
<P>
 The veterans said they plan now to hunt instead for Gen. George Patton and 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt look-alikes who can give the 11 a.m. event a 
more festive look. 
</P>
<P>
 The uninviting of the enemy is probably just as well, considering the 
dimensions the D-day gathering was taking Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 What began two months ago as an informal commemorative stamp-canceling 
ceremony for veterans at the post office has mushroomed into a celebration that 
is attracting local, state and federal officials, a marching band, a Reserve 
Officers' Training Corps drill team and military color guards from the four 
branches of the armed services. 
</P>
<P>
 D-day veterans will display medals, memorabilia and wartime uniforms they no 
longer can fit into, and listen to a speech by Whittier banker David Hoffman. 
He was a Vietnam War combat pilot and spent 15 months as a prisoner of war. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're honoring WWII veterans, so why not do something splashy?" said South 
Gate Postmaster Prescilla Buckley, who has ordered a tent and folding chairs 
for her parking lot at 10120 Wright Road and has persuaded the local Rotary 
Club to bring refreshments for hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans who actually hit the beaches during the invasion of Europe are being 
invited to autograph commemorative cachets postmarked with a special "D-day 
June 6 1944-1994 50th Anniversary" cancellation stamp and tell war stories, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A hundred of the canceled envelopes autographed by a local celebrity -- World 
War II bomber pilot turned car dealer Cal Worthington -- will be sold for $10 
each as a fund-raiser for the B-17 group. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of a Hitler look-alike probably won't bother the Sir Winston 
Churchill impersonator. That's because he's a scowling English bulldog that the 
veterans say may be kept busy licking stamps during the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The dog's owner, Diane Wuertemburg of Arleta, said her bulldog -- whose real 
name is Archie -- may show up wearing a miniature English bowler hat for the 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eisenhower look-alike Robert Beer may be disappointed. He is a civil 
engineer from Glendale who tried to enlist during World War II but was assigned 
instead by the government to ride herd on the production of U.S. warplanes at 
Lockheed and Hughes aircraft plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Beer said he learned he was a dead ringer for Ike in 1943 when Eisenhower was 
named supreme commander of Allied troops fighting Hitler's Nazi forces. "The 
day he was appointed I came to work and a newspaper with his picture in it was 
on my desk and I thought it was me," Beer said. 
</P>
<P>
 During Eisenhower's days in the White House, Beer was often mistaken for the 
President by people asking for autographs -- and then asking where his Secret 
Service bodyguards were. More recently, he portrayed Ike in four movies. A 
World War II bomber pilot buddy got him to volunteer for the South Gate event. 
</P>
<P>
 B-17 combat group president Stane, an Altadena resident and former owner of 
Pasadena's Ice House, said he's happy to forget about Hitler.

MANY CHINESE IN U.S. BACK TRADE PRIVILEGES; FOREIGN RELATIONS: SOME BUSINESS 
LEADERS HOPE CHINA'S MOST FAVORED NATION STATUS WILL OPEN IT UP TO DEMOCRATIC 
IDEAS. BUT ACTIVISTS FEAR THE GIANT NATION WILL IGNORE HUMAN RIGHTS ISSUES.

 Many Chinese American business leaders in Southern California expressed 
support for President Clinton's decision to grant most favored nation status to 
China, but pro-democracy activists called it an ominous signal about human 
rights on the eve of the fifth anniversary of the Tian An Men Square massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the Chinese community with links to mainland businesses expressed hope 
that in addition to boosting trade, the move will open borders and expose the 
Chinese to democratic ideas that could spark political change down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 "China is loosening up; human rights are not as bad as they were before, but 
you have to give them time. You can't just say, 'Hey, you can't do that,' " 
says Danny Joe of Hacienda Heights, who was born in mainland China and now 
sells communications equipment in his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Pan, manager of the Hong Kong Supermarket in Monterey Park, typifies 
the hesitant support that many Chinese Americans have for Clinton's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good thing to do," Pan says. "Of course, the human rights 
issue is pretty important, but . . . we should not mix the issues together." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Ou, 36, a commercial appraiser shopping at the market Friday afternoon, 
had a different take. "Nothing has improved since Tian An Men Square happened," 
Ou said. "If Clinton really enforced sanctions, something would be improved." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of their stand on the issue, many Chinese Americans believe the 
Administration erred in linking most favored nation status to human rights in 
the first place. They say it left no graceful way out and failed to take into 
account Chinese concern about saving face. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton had to eat his own words," says David Ma, a vice president in the 
Paris-based Federation for a Democratic China, which has an office in Monterey 
Park. "During his election campaign he criticized Bush for coddling the 
'butchers of Beijing' and asked China to make significant improvements in human 
rights. Well, China didn't do anything and they still got MFN." 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by Clinton's decision, several pro-democracy groups plan 
demonstrations in front of the Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles on June 3 and 
4, the anniversary of the massacre, when police opened fire on students 
rallying for democracy and killed an unknown number. 
</P>
<P>
 But those against the decision seem to be in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very surprising. Last year people were up in arms, but this year I've 
rarely heard of an individual who doesn't support" the status for China, said 
Llewellyn Chin, an Alhambra attorney active in the Chinese American community. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chinese Americans who support Clinton's decision say the United States 
must now develop a comprehensive trade policy with China. Yen Lu Wong, whose 
firm, Global Consortium, consults with businesses looking to trade with China, 
hopes Chinese Americans can serve as bridge-builders between the two 
governments. She says U.S. officials need a better grounding in Chinese 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, Dorothy Hom, whose family has been prominent in the Chinese 
American community for generations, said she endorses Clinton's decision. Hom 
is a partner in the family's real estate business; her husband, Tom, served on 
the City Council and in the California Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to continue communicating with people if you are to help them to 
change," Hom said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Andy Lam, owner of San Choy restaurant and a member of Mayor Susan 
Golding's Asian advisory board, expressed his disappointment: "I would like it 
if America would push harder to make China change. Too many people died at Tian 
An Men Square." 
</P>
<P>
 Most members of Ventura County's growing Chinese community said Clinton had 
little choice but to take the action he did. 
</P>
<P>
 Some said Clinton should have pressed his original position, but conceded that 
the president faced enormous pressure from the business community to renew 
China's Most Favored Nation status. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised that President Clinton reversed his position," said Allan 
Jue, whose family owns a grocery store in Ventura. "We have to realize that 
this world is shrinking and we're dependent on each other for our economic 
well-being and survival. And as the old regimes begin to fade out . . . we'll 
see human rights improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Peggy Lee in Ventura County and Tony Perry in San Diego 
and special correspondent Deborah Sullivan in the San Gabriel Valley 
contributed to this story.

TRADITIONAL BANS ON TOBACCO FIND A NEW RELEVANCE; HEALTH: THE 19TH-CENTURY 
DOCTRINES OF MORMONS AND SEVENTH-DAY ADVENTISTS PUT THEM AT FOREFRONT OF 
ANTI-SMOKING EFFORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a century and a half ago, Mormon Church founder Joseph Smith said 
God warned him that tobacco was harmful to human beings. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's 1833 revelation -- in which alcohol, tea and coffee were also 
denounced -- surprised many followers, some of whom tried unsuccessfully to 
give up tobacco when they were told it was against God's will. 
</P>
<P>
 But the legacy of Smith exerts a profound influence. The Mormon Church is in 
the forefront of an aggressive campaign to educate against tobacco use. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of the surgeon general's accusations against the tobacco industry 
and the public's growing disenchantment with smoking, Smith seems like a 
genuine prophet on at least one important health issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah, which is 66% Mormon, consistently has one of the lowest tobacco-use 
rates in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Mormons were not the only ones ahead of the curve in the holy war 
against tobacco. Ellen G. White, founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, 
wrote about the dangers of secondhand smoke as early as 1851. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to Stoy Proctor, associate director for the health and temperance 
department of the General Conference of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, White 
first spoke publicly of the harmful effects in 1848. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 30 years ago, in 1959, the Seventh-day Adventists introduced the 
nation's earliest stop-smoking program, according to Proctor, who also serves 
as executive director of the "Breathe Free Plan to Stop Smoking." 
</P>
<P>
 That five-day plan was the predecessor of "Breathe Free," the program to stop 
smoking that was updated last year by the School of Public Health at Loma Linda 
University, a Seventh-day Adventist school. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, "Breathe Free" receives governmental endorsement in many countries, 
including China, Taiwan, Poland, Hungary and Germany. Its program includes nine 
sessions over a four-week period. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-five percent of "Breathe Free" participants are still not smoking a year 
after taking the program, Proctor said. 
</P>
<P>
 For members of the Mormon Church, known formally as the Church of Jesus Christ 
of Latter-day Saints, Smith's revelation regarding tobacco and alcohol is 
referred to as the Word of Wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard E. Turley Jr., managing director of the church's historical department 
in Salt Lake City, said the prophecy was not followed as strictly in the early 
years as it is today. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this century, the Word of Wisdom has been promoted with considerable vigor 
and has become in many ways one of the characteristics for which Latter-day 
Saints are known," Turley said. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, the Coalition on Smoking and Health, a group with representatives 
from the American Lung Assn. and American Cancer Society, identified Utah as 
one of the nation's five most successful states at implementing tobacco control 
laws, along with Nebraska, Minnesota, Hawaii and New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah prohibits free distribution of cigarettes and is the only state that bans 
any form of tobacco advertising, according to the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition also honored a Mormon public service radio series titled "Time 
and Seasons" for raising public awareness about the dangers of tobacco use. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time and Seasons" follows a 30-minute format and is aired on more than 800 
U.S. stations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Pond, the series' executive producer, says the program explores a broad 
range of moral issues on topics such as religious tolerance, the nurturing 
father, pornography and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Pond said the programs steer clear of proselytizing and instead are "an 
educational effort using experts from various faiths to get the general public 
interested in topics that are socially and morally relevant." 
</P>
<P>
 Requests for a free transcript of a church series on smoking among teen-agers 
have been second only to those for a series produced years ago on facing death, 
Pond said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All churches have a responsibility to deal with these real issues," Pond 
said. "We can go to church and learn about nice Gospel stories, but if the 
churches don't take seriously moral and social issues like teen-age tobacco 
use, who will do it?" 
</P>
<P>
 National statistics demonstrate the success Mormons have had in tackling 
teen-age smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Bahr, professor of sociology at Brigham Young University in Provo, 
Utah, has for years been tracking the behavior of Utah teen-agers and comparing 
them to national averages. 
</P>
<P>
 Bahr identifies the Word of Wisdom and the church's strong youth programs as 
two major reasons Utah youths typically show lower rates of consumption of 
alcohol and tobacco when compared to those in other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked in a survey if they had consumed alcohol in the last 30 days, 34.5% of 
Utah teen-agers said they had, compared to 60% in the United States as a whole, 
according to a Bahr analysis.

CLERGY POLISH COUNSELING SKILLS TO AID PARISHIONERS; PSYCHOLOGY: SOME RETURN TO 
COLLEGES OR SEMINARIES TO LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND NEEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Mounting personal pressures often send people to their religious leaders for 
help first, but the days of clergy merely sending troubled individuals home to 
study and pray are long gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with issues ranging from relationships and sexuality to elder abuse 
and alcoholism, a growing number of clergy are offering new levels of 
encouragement through crisis intervention and short-term counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are returning to colleges and seminaries to update their skills and learn 
effective counseling techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is not simple and people cannot be given simple answers," said the Rev. 
Cecil Murray of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Clergy ordained before this psychological awakening often feel ill-equipped to 
deal with many of today's issues. In response to this concern, Fuller 
Theological Seminary in Pasadena created a new Ph.D. program in practical 
theology. Introduced last fall, the doctoral program, which heavily emphasizes 
pastoral counseling, filled up 21 spaces immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Gwen Garrison, Fuller's dean of academic advisement, believes that the program 
will better equip practicing clergy to deal with contemporary problems. "Those 
re-entering school who have been working in the community are coming back with 
more pertinent questions based on their life experiences," Garrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard Blackmun, a clinical psychologist who teaches a class at Fuller to 
help clergy deal with practical issues and daily stresses, said many pastors 
feel increasing pressure to become specialists where their predecessors were 
generalists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many clergy feel inadequate doing the things that make up the bulk of their 
day, such as administration and counseling," Blackmun said. "There is an 
incredible amount of burnout within the religious community, and the burnout is 
happening at younger ages." 
</P>
<P>
 But those clergy who refresh their skills find themselves better able to serve 
their congregations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the emotional needs are great within the communities, often the 
resources are not. In small congregations, up to 60% of the clergy's time is 
given to counseling members. And although larger congregations such as All 
Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena and First AME often have resources to 
retain professionals, a great demand for qualified, affordable religious 
counseling still exists. 
</P>
<P>
 At the First Presbyterian Church of Hollywood, Herb Robinson, an ordained 
Presbyterian minister and licensed clinical psychologist, is the executive 
director of the Creative Counseling Center, one of the first church-based 
counseling centers in the country. Started in the late 1970s, the center offers 
sliding-scale counseling with four therapists available. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson believes that clerical counseling has immeasurable value to those in 
religious organizations. "Oftentimes, an individual is referred to a 
practitioner who doesn't honor or respect a person's faith," Robinson said. 
"For many, the issues worked on in therapy -- such as marriage and family -- 
dovetail with the person's faith and value commitments. Practitioners use a 
much different approach when they understand their client's faith." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A married couple who attend therapy at the Creative Counseling Center agree. 
They had first gone to an outside therapist who immediately began leading them 
toward a separation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although our problems were pretty serious at the time, divorce wasn't an 
option we were ready to consider," the woman says. Through religious-based 
counseling, the two have learned coping techniques that they can use, in 
accordance with their faith, to strengthen their marriage and help them through 
the rocky times. 
</P>
<P>
 At First AME, Murray and four other ministers do most of the personal 
counseling, although the church also retains two clinical psychologists for 
referrals. Murray said he intends to go back to school to enhance his 
counseling skills and bring them up to date. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sheer numbers could require, in a large church such as this, a separate 
individual who does nothing else (but provide counseling) from 7:30 in the 
morning to 10:30 at night," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much talk of suicide in this community that we know that people 
are hurting in great quantity," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 At the University Synagogue in West Los Angeles, Rabbi Allen Freehling offers 
crisis counseling, particularly on marital issues. Although he has a psychology 
doctorate, which he earned shortly after completing Rabbinic school, Freehling 
believes that it is often wiser to refer his members to other therapists who 
can more fully explore the issues at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Freehling, who is an AIDS activist and co-founder of the Los Angeles County 
Commission on AIDS, is often approached by parents of gay and lesbian children 
who have questions or confusion about their child's health or sexuality. 
"Within this role, I discuss many issues relating to the AIDS epidemic as well 
as death and dying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Death is overwhelmingly the main concern at West Hollywood's Metropolitan 
Community Church, an ecumenical congregation that, although open to all people, 
ministers primarily to gays, lesbians and bisexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Nancy Wilson heads the church, which offers group counseling sessions 
to help facilitate the grief and loss resulting from AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many cases, people in the groups will have lost 10, 15, 20 friends to the 
epidemic," Wilson said. "We are always in the process of learning new 
techniques, new support issues, active listening, and anything that will 
provide comfort to our members." 
</P>
<P>
 Freehling agrees that clergy must be open to learning new ways to help their 
congregations. "It's necessary for clergy to extend ourselves intellectually. 
As we empty out our treasury of ideas, it is imperative that we replenish it."

S. AFRICA'S ARCHBISHOP TUTU TO SPEAK AT PASADENA CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa will be the guest preacher at All 
Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena on Sunday, June 5, at the 9 a.m. and 11:15 
a.m. celebrations of the Holy Eucharist. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be his first visit to the United States since the historic all-race 
elections in South Africa in April that ended white minority rule and 
catapulted former political prisoner Nelson Mandela to the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 After the elections, it was Tutu who introduced Mandela as that nation's new 
president on the Grand Parade in Cape Town after he was sworn in May 10. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Anglican archbishop of Cape Town and Anglican primate of Southern 
Africa, Tutu had long fought for an end to apartheid and minority white rule in 
South Africa. For his efforts, Tutu was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 The archbishop has had ties with All Saints since his first visit to the 
parish in 1984. The Rev. George Regas, rector of All Saints parish, and members 
of his staff have visited Tutu's archdiocese over the years.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Tim Safford of the parish staff said both services are expected to 
draw overflow crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 All Saints is at 132 N. Euclid Ave.

RELIGION BRIEFS: CATHOLIC CHARITIES REFUSES TO DISCLOSE NUMBER OF GAYS ON ITS 
BOARD, STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Catholic Charities' refusal to disclose the number of gays and lesbians on its 
board and staff is threatening $1.5 million the agency receives from San 
Francisco each year for AIDS projects. 
</P>
<P>
 A city Health Commission rule, passed four years ago, allows contracts only 
with agencies whose staff and board are "representative of the target 
population" with respect to sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Catholic Charities has refused to ask its AIDS program staff and 31 board 
members about their sexual orientation. "To ask about something so private as 
sexuality is wrong," said Arthur Hudson, the agency's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has delayed for at least two weeks its approval of the Peter 
Claver Community's next six-month, $320,000-contract with the city.

RELIGION BRIEFS: WEEKLY ATTENDANCE AT SERVICES DECREASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of Americans who say they attend a church or synagogue at least 
weekly has declined, according to a recent Harris Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the adults polled, 43% said they attend once a week or more, compared to 
51% in a 1986 Harris Poll.The number who said they never go to church, 23%, was 
not a significant increase from 21% in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be noted that church attendance is notoriously over-reported as a 
socially desirable activity, so true attendance figures are surely lower than 
those reported here," said a May 23 release by Louis Harris and Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also possible that instead of a real decline in church attendance, the 
poll measured an increase in people's willingness to be candid on that subject 
to a stranger over the telephone. Frank discussion of personal topics has been 
on the upswing in the media and other walks of life in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll was taken April 4-7 among a nationwide random sample of 1,255 adults. 
Results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

ANGELS' LEFTWICH OFF ENDANGERED PITCHERS LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The room was virtually dark, with the only illumination coming from the TV 
set. It wasn't until 3, maybe even 4, in the morning, before the two roommates 
would fall asleep, talking sometimes until the newspaper hit their hotel door. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just a game Friday night, one of 162, but Angel pitcher Phil Leftwich 
and catcher Chris Turner talked about the Toronto Blue Jays as if cramming for 
a college entrance exam. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've prepared more for this start than any in my career," Leftwich said. "We 
went over every guy in their lineup until we fell asleep the last few days. We 
knew exactly what we wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In a game that perhaps meant more than any in his life, Leftwich staggered the 
Blue Jays, leading the Angels to a 6-2 victory before 48,244 at the Skydome. 
</P>
<P>
 Leftwich (3-4) not only solidified his spot in the rotation -- yielding seven 
hits and two earned runs in 7 1/3 innings -- but virtually guaranteed something 
much more precious to him: 
</P>
<P>
 The continued company of his wife, Ann, who is 8 1/2 months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's who I worried about more than anything," said Leftwich, 3-0 with a 
2.51 earned-run average in his last five starts. "I could see it was affecting 
her. I mean, I could have handled being sent back to the minors, but that would 
have meant that Ann would have had to stay behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would have been tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann conceded that when Brian Anderson returns to 
the rotation in 10 days, Leftwich will still be around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if anybody could pitch better than he has the last two games," 
Lachemann said. "If somebody can pitch better than that, we're in pretty good 
shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson gave up two hits in five scoreless innings Friday against Class-A 
Stockton in his first start in rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have won seven of their last nine games to remain in first place, 
and although they have a 23-26 record, it's the first time they have been this 
close to .500 since April 26. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can play with anybody in this league, and I think people are starting to 
realize that," Angel second baseman Rex Hudler said. "Teams are looking at us 
differently now. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should have seen (Blue Jay center fielder) Devon White tonight. He slid 
hard into me at second, and I just said, 'Bring it on. I love it. That's the 
way to play the game.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked at me like I was nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Who could blame him? Who would have thought that two months into the season, 
the Angels would be sitting in first place and the Blue Jays would be 10 games 
out, their largest deficit in the American League East since July 5, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just unbelievable to me," Leftwich said. "You look at that lineup and 
say, 'My God.' You know they're going to take off eventually. You just don't 
want to be around when they do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels scored all six of their runs in the sixth inning with 10 batters. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with a walk by Tim Salmon and a single by Chili Davis. Bo Jackson hit 
a ground ball so hard that it skidded past second baseman Roberto Alomar and 
went past right fielder Joe Carter to the wall for a two-run double. Eduardo 
Perez, who hadn't produced an extra-base hit since April 17, hit a run-scoring 
double. Chad Curtis hit a two-out, two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if my name is scratched off that (endangered) list," Leftwich 
said, "but at least I've probably got an asterisk by it now. If you got the 
manager on your side, it's hard to do something with you. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad I could finally show what I do after the start I had (0-4, 6.82 
ERA). I don't know what it is, but I did the same thing last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, I won't have this problem every year. If so, I'll start throwing 
scrimmage games in January."

MCNALL GOES INTO BANKRUPTCY; FINANCE: A YEAR AFTER HE IS OWNER OF A STANLEY CUP 
FINALIST, CREDITORS TAKE HIM TO COURT, WHERE HE ENTERS INTO CHAPTER 11. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruce McNall's deteriorating financial condition culminated Friday in an 
agreement whereby he reluctantly agreed to enter bankruptcy proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The action, taken in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles, caps a yearlong 
financial slide for the Kings' president, who last May was being hailed as one 
of nation's most successful and innovative sports entrepreneurs when his club 
reached the Stanley Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's development came during a hearing on efforts by four of his creditors 
-- including three banks who claim that McNall owes them nearly $162 million -- 
to force McNall into bankruptcy proceedings that would have resulted in 
liquidation of his assets. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Lisa Hill Fenning instead converted the petition to a 
Chapter 11 case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, meaning an attempt will be made 
to restructure McNall's finances and pay his creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 A trustee is to be named next week to administer the proceedings and to 
inventory McNall's assets. Operation of the Kings, with which McNall remains 
active in hockey-related decisions, is not expected to be affected, lawyers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His spin doctors are going to say he voluntarily did this to help his 
creditors," said Los Angeles lawyer Robert A. Meyer, who represents McNall's 
most aggressive creditor, the French-owned Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland. 
"That's nonsense. The reason this happened is we chased him into bankruptcy 
court." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank claims it is owed $121 million in loans made to McNall-affiliated 
enterprises, including a movie production firm, a horse racing operation and a 
coin business. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall's bankruptcy lawyer, Richard L. Wynne, said his client would have 
preferred to stay out of bankruptcy proceedings but acknowledged that creditors 
forced the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bruce didn't seek bankruptcy protection. He was trying to work out his 
problems with his creditors outside of bankruptcy court," Wynne said. He added 
that Chapter 11 proceedings will ensure "a fair and level playing ground for 
all creditors." 
</P>
<P>
 The case is expected to be slowed by a grand jury investigation into whether 
McNall has falsified financial statements. In two deposition-like hearings with 
creditors, McNall has declined to answer most questions, repeatedly invoking 
his Fifth Amendment right, protecting him against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall's creditors have argued that he is using the Fifth Amendment as a 
shield to avoid questions unrelated to his criminal case. His criminal defense 
lawyer, Tom Pollack, countered by calling McNall's taking the Fifth as "both 
prudent and appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 According to subpoenas filed in the bankruptcy case, the grand jury is seeking 
records related to loans made to McNall or his businesses by 12 financial 
institutions, including Bank of America, Credit Lyonnais, Bank of California, 
Union Bank and First National Bank of Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall's finances have suffered because of such factors as a high debt load 
and softness in the rare coin business that was the foundation of his business 
empire. 
</P>
<P>
 He was sole owner of the Kings until earlier this month, when he sold 72% of 
the franchise for $60 million as part of plan to pay off a $92-million business 
loan made by Bank of America. The team is now controlled by telecommunications 
executive Jeffrey P. Sudikoff and entertainment executive Joseph M. Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how much McNall owes is in dispute. Public records and interviews with 
creditors place the amount at about $200 million, although McNall is known to 
dispute at least half that. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the filing gives McNall some breathing room, the action nonetheless 
tarnishes his business image. A few years ago, he told reporters that he was 
worth from $150 million to $200 million. Court records show that as recently as 
nine months ago, one of McNall's businesses sent a financial statement to 
Credit Lyonnais listing his net worth as $157.7 million at the end of 1992. 
Credit Lyonnais lawyer Meyer said the bank now questions the accuracy of the 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the creditors were joined by an unusual and previously 
unknown creditor -- a trust that is liquidating former Texas tycoon William 
Herbert Hunt's assets. Hunt, along with his brother, Nelson, are former McNall 
clients who sought bankruptcy protection in the 1980s after an infamous 
collapse of their silver fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust, which formally joined the three banks in seeking to liquidate 
McNall's assets, is owed payments reimbursing it for an alleged ancient bronze 
antique bust that McNall sold to William Hunt for $915,000 in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustee overseeing Hunt's assets challenged the "antique" last year as a 
fraud, saying it was only about 30 years old. McNall, who disagreed, 
nonetheless agreed to pay the money back and still owes about $750,000, 
according to trustee Steven S. Turoff.

WORLD CUP '94 / 20 DAYS AND COUNTING; NOT QUITE ALL GREEK TO HIM; PANAGOULIAS 
COACHES THAT NATION'S TEAM, BUT HE ALSO WAS A KEY TO RISE OF U.S. SOCCER

 "Are you kidding?" 
</P>
<P>
 Like an orchestra conductor with a baton, Alkis Panagoulias is waving his 
cigar to direct the conversation as he holds court in a hotel lobby for 
reporters, friends and anyone else who happens by.  
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, it is a solo performance as the fast-talking, big-smiling coach of 
Greece's soccer team tells stories, shares his world view and occasionally 
answers questions in language that, for a family newspaper, should be described 
as colorful and left at that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you kidding?" he repeats, responding to a question about whether he is 
feeling heat from the Greek public and media because of the team's 
undistinguished record in exhibitions leading to the World Cup, which starts 
June 17. Included is a recent 5-0 loss to England. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football is actively involved in all phases of Greek life, from the prime 
minister down to the last citizen," he says. "You can't get away with a defeat. 
It's not like your country. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Pause. 
</P>
<P>
 "My country," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Pause. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our country." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite occasional linguistic entanglements, Panagoulias does not have an 
identity crisis. Far from it. He proudly proclaims himself "the only American 
coach in the World Cup." True. Even the U.S. coach is a Serb who lived in 
Mexico for 22 years before moving to Laguna Niguel three years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Panagoulias, who will turn 60 Monday, ventured from his native Greece to the 
United States in 1962 for his education, became a dual citizen and has made his 
home here for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He is barely known in the United States, although he coached the U.S. team in 
1983-85. Even his neighbors in Vienna, Va., where he has lived for 12 years, 
did not know he was an internationally renowned soccer coach until recently, 
when television crews began appearing at his door and his picture ran in a 
local newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, he is known too well in Greece. After the Greeks qualified for the 
World Cup for the first time, he was called a modern-day Ulysses. Now that the 
team is struggling, having scored in only one of its last five games, he is 
called something entirely different. 
</P>
<P>
 "We beat Russia to get to the World Cup, the first team to qualify from Europe 
and the second team in the world," he says. "We lose the first exhibition game 
and I'm a son of a -- what? -- gun. It was a national catastrophe. If Greece 
loses, every Greek loses." 
</P>
<P>
 The two cultures, as well as the two teams dearest to his heart, clash today 
at the Yale Bowl in New Haven, Conn., where Greece meets the United States in 
an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you kidding?" he says when asked if the game is special to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years later, I feel part of this (U.S.) team. I'll see certain players I 
handpicked for myself when they were 16, 17. I saw Paul Caligiuri when he was a 
sophomore at UCLA. Tab Ramos was a 16-year-old in New Jersey when I said I 
wanted him. They said, 'But he's a small boy.' I said, 'I don't care, I want 
him.' . . . Brian Bliss from Connecticut, Hugo Perez from California." 
</P>
<P>
 Like a protective parent, he is defensive when the U.S. team is criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sent two assistants to watch Saudi Arabia and the USA," he says of 
Wednesday's scoreless game at Piscataway, N.J. "They were not impressed, though 
I don't know why. They found a lot of weaknesses in the American defense, and 
they didn't see any creativity in the attack. But I beg to differ. I know 
better than those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Believing that the U.S. players on this team are more advanced than the ones 
he coached, he would have liked another chance with them. Although his U.S. 
team played respectably in the 1984 Olympic Games, it failed to qualify for the 
1986 World Cup. His contract was not renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was some speculation that I would coach this (U.S.) team, but no one 
from the federation ever asked me," he says. "They tried me, and they failed. 
Why should they turn to me again?" 
</P>
<P>
 That was one of his few soccer failures in his adopted country, which he fell 
in love with as a boy in Thessaloniki, Greece, after watching Errol Flynn 
movies. When he enrolled in college at Middletown, N.Y., in 1962, he quickly 
discovered that he was the school's only genuine soccer player. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first day, I bent over to tie my shoelaces so that I could see how the 
other players kicked the ball," he says. "I said, 'If I'm not the king, I'll be 
the prince.' Twenty-four hours later, my picture was on the front page of the 
newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 He finished college in Upsala, N.Y., moved to New York to play for a semipro 
team, married a Greek-American woman and they had two children. But he never 
really settled down, returning to Greece on several occasions to coach in the 
professional league before he was asked to take over the national team in 1971. 
 
</P>
<P>
 During his 10-year stint, Greece qualified for the European Championships for 
the first time. Unable to duplicate that success after Panagoulias left, the 
Greeks asked him to return in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been, for the most part, a happy remarriage. Leaders of the 
conservative New Democratic Party convinced him he was so popular that he 
should run for Parliament, and although he was among the victims of a landslide 
victory by candidates from the socialist PASOK Party, he says that he would 
have won if the election had come after Greece qualified for the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 PASOK is attempting to oust the conservative leadership of the soccer 
federation, resulting in a threat by the sport's international governing body 
to kick Greece out of the World Cup. But with his cigar in one hand and a cup 
of coffee in the other, Panagoulias appears to have no cares as he enjoys the 
comforts of a fine hotel near the team's temporary training camp at Adelphi 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 In every way other than miles, it is a long way from the accommodations 
somewhere off the New Jersey Turnpike provided for him and his young Americans 
by the U.S. Soccer Federation before a 1985 World Cup qualifying game against 
Trinidad and Tobago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember that we were at a hotel -- not a hotel, but a motel -- that I'm 
still ashamed about," he says, recalling that the establishment was used 
primarily by truck drivers for their amorous escapades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were the days when everybody in the world was beating us, even 
Bangladesh. I went with my young college boys to Malaysia, and of course, we 
lost. The king asked me to have coffee with him, and he said, 'What is going on 
with the U.S. team?' I told him to pick up the phone and call President Reagan. 
He just laughed." 
</P>
<P>
 Panagoulias believes that the USSF has improved since then but says there is 
still much more to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul Caligiuri still remembers me telling the team that some day U.S. players 
are going to be the protagonists, a Greek word," he says. "There are not one 
but 25 or 30 Peles here somewhere. It's up to us to find these players." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Panagoulias will be part of that effort remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you going to give me a job next year?" he yells at a Greek official who 
passes by. 
</P>
<P>
 Then returning his attention to his audience, he says: "First, I have to see 
if I want to stay in Greece. I'm a little bit tired and I miss my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning to coach the national team, he has spent no more than two 
months at a time with his wife, Vanna, and has seen his children, Debbi and 
John, only once every six months. They have remained in Virginia, where Vanna 
sells real estate, Debbi, 26, manages a record store and John, 22, is a 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after arriving with his team in New York last Monday, he did not see them 
until a family birthday party here Friday for himself, Vanna and Debbi, all of 
whom were born in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked their ages, he was temporarily confused about his daughter's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to give her back a year because she's still unwed," he says, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Greeks nearby asks if Panagoulias is saving for her dowry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you kidding?" he says. "When somebody asks for a dowry, I'll say, 'No 
way, I'm an American.' " World Cup

KINGS SAY PLAYOFF REFUNDS COMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Kings announced Friday that they are in the process of issuing 
playoff-ticket refunds to season-seat subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 Payments have been processed for those who secured their seats with credit 
cards, and checks were issued Friday for other ticket-buyers, a club spokesman 
said. The Kings did not make the playoffs, and their regular season ended on 
April 14. There is no NHL policy regarding the handling of playoff refunds. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay in postseason refunds has been a major point of contention for 
disgruntled King fans, who had been told they would receive their money shortly 
after the sale of the team closed on May 16.

SO FAR, VILLENEUVE'S RECORD IS PERFECT; INDY 500: THREE WRECKS IN THREE RACES 
THIS YEAR HAVE MARKED THE ROOKIE AS A DRIVER TO WATCH OUT FOR -- AND TO WATCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER, TIMES ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The abiding memory of Jacques Villeneuve is of him ramming his car into Hiro 
Matsushita's -- T-boning, they call it -- apparently at top speed, as 
Matsushita and Paul Tracy sat in their disabled vehicles along the wall at 
Phoenix International Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a frightening crash, ripping Matsushita's car in two while onlookers 
gasped, mentally counting the Japanese driver as a goner, hoping against hope 
that Tracy and Villeneuve might somehow survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, in one of racing's inexplicable turns, all three survived. Not 
only survived but walked away from that horrifying scene early last month. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people, though, were shaking their heads and muttering about that 
crazy Canadian, Villeneuve, wondering how anyone driving an Indy car could not 
understand the meaning of a yellow light. 
</P>
<P>
 That accident made Villeneuve two for two -- two Indy car races and two 
crashes. He and Stefan Johansson had tangled in the season opener in Australia. 
And he was soon to be three for three, because he crashed again in the Toyota 
Grand Prix of Long Beach a week later, although not so badly that he was unable 
to post his first finish. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is the man his boss, Barry Green, is touting as the best young driver 
he has seen in a long, long time? One he doesn't hesitate to compare to Al 
Unser Jr. and Michael Andretti in their formative years? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, this is Green's choice as the next major star in Indy car racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Green, team manager of Forsythe-Green Racing: "I've been with some great 
drivers -- I've been in the right place at the right time -- been with Al Jr., 
Mike Andretti and now Jacques. And I would say that Jacques is as good as 
anyone that I've worked with, and once we figure out how to win, I think you 
will see a heck of a lot of him at the front and up on the podium. I would say 
he's as close a thing to a natural that I've worked with." 
</P>
<P>
 Green is not one of those terribly exuberant guys who sees the bright side of 
everything. So what is it he sees in Villeneuve? 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, he sees him as the fastest rookie qualifier in Indianapolis 500 
history. Villeneuve qualified his Reynard-Ford at 226.259 m.p.h., which makes 
him the fourth-fastest driver in the field for Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Villeneuve qualified faster than such established stars as Michael and Mario 
Andretti, former winner Arie Luyendyk and defending Indy car series champion 
Nigel Mansell. 
</P>
<P>
 And for another, Green sees Villeneuve as a quick study who won five races, 
seven poles and rookie-of-the-year honors last year in the Formula Atlantic 
series during a season undertaken specifically to prepare him and 
Forsythe-Green for Indy car racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, for what it's worth, there is a genetic connection. Villeneuve is the 
son of the late Formula One driver Gilles Villeneuve. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Jacques Villeneuve -- it's pronounced Jack Vill-nuv -- has a reputation 
for wildness, which he does, it is undeserved, according to Green. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to talk to him about not being aggressive enough," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes, but what about Phoenix? 
</P>
<P>
 "He ran superbly (after qualifying second) up until that unfortunate 
accident," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with Phoenix is the difference between the faster cars and the 
slower cars -- the closing speed. That amazed him, how quick he would approach 
the 'back markers.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Down the back straightaway, we had just told him the lap before that he was 
approaching a bunch of slower cars. He came upon three cars as they're going 
into Turn 3. They must have seen the yellow. They lifted off (the gas). He's 
going in at 190, still. All he was doing was trying to avoid the three cars in 
front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had to go outside them and . . . was fighting for control himself. He did 
put on the brakes a long time before television said he did. He actually struck 
(Matsushita's car) at something under 100 m.p.h. The brakes locked up at 105 
m.p.h. That's when our on-board data system stopped taking data because it 
relies on the rotation of the wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same point that he was going around these three cars, I yelled, 
'Yellow!' (on the two-way radio). I was late yelling yellow. We always yell 
yellow and unfortunately we were late, and he didn't see the yellow till it was 
too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that accident stamped Villeneuve as a wild young driver. 
</P>
<P>
 He smiles at that description. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, when you race, you're not there just to sit around and wait," 
Villeneuve, 23, said. "You take chances, and when you lack experience, often 
you take chances when you shouldn't and you make mistakes. I think what's 
important is to learn from them and try not to make the same mistakes over and 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Green says that Villeneuve has learned plenty already. 
</P>
<P>
 "He takes direction very well," Green said. "Obviously, we've got to learn how 
to finish and how to win in Indy cars. I've seen him do it extremely well in 
the formulas. And he's better suited to Indy car racing than the shorter sprint 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 "His ability to read the car is uncanny. We get here and we have not got a 
good car. It doesn't take long (with Villeneuve telling the team what the car 
needs) before we have a good car. It has to be in the seat of his pants. If you 
look at the experience that he's had, it's not enough for him to have figured 
it all out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him at the start of the season that his biggest problem was going to 
be finishing the first three races. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Australia, he was a little over-aggressive. I think not knowing who he 
could pass safely hurt him. I was disappointed that Stefan turned right into 
him -- he was still going to beat him through the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phoenix -- very unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long Beach, the (cars with Reynard chassis) were all in trouble. We have yet 
to figure out why, but we didn't give him a good race car. And yet he decided 
he was going to have a go." 
</P>
<P>
 And for a few laps, Villeneuve drove as though he had the strongest car on the 
course, passing cars, working his way up the field. He eventually spun and 
backed into a tire wall, damaging the car's rear wing, but still managed to 
finish, in 15th place. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Green figured that he had to rein Villeneuve in a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was not for the other two incidents, I would have gone up and said, 'I 
love you,' " he said. "I cannot stand a driver that, when the car's not right, 
just drops to the rear. 
</P>
<P>
 "But because it was the third incident, we had to talk about it. It's not that 
he was driving recklessly, but he's a rookie driver and he's under observation 
(by racing officials) because he's had two incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 No less a critic than Mansell agrees that Villeneuve is a talent to be 
reckoned with -- in time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a little too brave at the moment," Mansell said. "He needs to temper 
his enthusiasm and give himself time to learn. If he does that, he can be 
better than even he thinks he can be. He just needs to be sensible." 
</P>
<P>
 So, Green has a fast, aggressive young driver in his car, which is starting on 
the inside of the second row. Can that combination translate to a major upset 
Sunday? 
</P>
<P>
 "We all know that the person who does win is a very, very lucky person because 
you need a lot of luck in this race," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we could win this race. The race car has performed well in every type 
of condition. What we're trying to focus on is being there for the last 100 
miles of the race. What we need to do for the first 400 is stay in touch with 
the lead. Fourth, where we're starting, I think is the perfect spot." 
</P>
<P>
 And Villeneuve may turn out to be the perfect driver, too. Provided he doesn't 
have another incident.

MARINOVICH WILL PLAY FOR WINNIPEG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Troubled quarterback Todd Marinovich, cut by the Raiders last season, said he 
has agreed to a contract with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian 
Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 No terms were disclosed, but Marinovich, who left for Winnipeg Friday, is 
expected to be introduced at a news conference there Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really going to miss the beach, but I'm excited about going up there," 
Marinovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Winnipeg has played in the last two Grey Cups, losing to Calgary in 
1992 and to Edmonton in 1993, the Blue Bombers need a backup for quarterback 
Matt Dunigan, 33, who suffered an Achilles' tendon injury late last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnipeg had reportedly offered Florida State quarterback Charlie Ward, who 
wasn't selected in the NFL draft, a three-year, $400,000 contract, but Ward 
rejected the offer because he hopes to play in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 A first-round draft choice in 1991, Marinovich lasted only two seasons in the 
NFL before he was waived last August. 
</P>
<P>
 Marinovich, who made his first NFL start in a 1991 playoff loss at Kansas 
City, started seven games in '92, but was benched after throwing three 
interceptions in slightly more than one quarter of a game against the 
Philadelphia Eagles. Marinovich was demoted to third string behind Vince Evans 
and didn't play in another game. 
</P>
<P>
 Marinovich, who played at USC for two turbulent seasons before leaving in a 
dispute with former coach Larry Smith, was arrested for misdemeanor possession 
of cocaine and marijuana shortly before he was drafted. However, he was cleared 
after completing a one-year diversion program for first-time offenders.

NATIONAL BEST-SEVEN WAGER TO MAKE DEBUT MONDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The National Best Seven, a 50-cent wager in which a player tries to select the 
winners of seven races around the country, will make its debut Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Park and all its satellite locations will offer the bet, but the 
$500,000 Hollywood Turf Handicap, which was originally scheduled to be one of 
the seven races, won't be in the package. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need the California Horsemen's Benevolent and Protective Assn.'s 
permission to offer one of our races," said Eual Wyatt, Hollywood Park's 
general manager. "As of Thursday's deadline, we didn't have that. (But) we're 
very close to an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 The races in the first Best Seven are the Metropolitan Handicap at Belmont 
Park, the Hilltop Stakes at Pimlico, the Great Lakes Handicap at Thistledown, 
the Washington Park Handicap at Arlington, the Barksdale Handicap at Louisiana 
Downs, the Memorial Day Stakes at Calder and the AKsarben Handicap at AKsarben.

<P>
 For the committed highway traveler comes the latest in summer escapes: motor 
home trading cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnebago Industries Inc.'s cards -- all 3.6 million in the first edition -- 
feature travel trailers and motor homes from the late 1950s through 1995

</P>
<P>
 Each card displays a color photo of a motor home; its vital statistics are 
listed on the back, along with descriptions such as "The D-27 had a rear twin 
bedroom and private entrance." A 10-card pack will sell for $1.29, while 
100-card packs are priced at $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest City, Iowa-based Winnebago has high hopes for its cards, gushing in 
publicity material that "this beautifully photographed, UV-coated card series 
promises to educate the novice and captivate the enthusiast."

CARTER HAWLEY BLAMES EARTHQUAKE FOR INCREASE IN FIRST-QUARTER LOSS; RETAIL: 
OWNER OF BROADWAY DEPARTMENT STORES SAYS THE $18-MILLION DEFICIT WAS AGGRAVATED 
BY THE CLOSURE OF FOUR OUTLETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carter Hawley Hale Stores said its first-quarter loss expanded from last 
year's because of sales declines associated with the temporary closing of four 
earthquake-damaged stores.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based retailer said its loss for the quarter ended April 30 
was $18 million, compared to a loss of $10.4 million for the same period a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The company -- operator of 83 stores under the names the Broadway, Emporium 
and Weinstocks -- said overall sales declined 2.6% to $431.1 million from 
$442.5 million during the year-ago period. However, same-store sales -- revenue 
from stores open for the past year -- rose 4.7% during the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction of industry analysts was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Performance-wise, the company is at or above its recovery plan pace," said 
Thomas Friedberg, an analyst at Genesis Merchant Group in San Francisco. "The 
same-store sales are quite encouraging, and the bottom line would have been 
stronger if not for closed stores."  
</P>
<P>
 However, some analysts said the loss was greater than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a disappointing performance even if you consider the mitigating factor 
of store closings," said Kurt Barnard, an economist and head of New York-based 
Barnard's Retail Consulting Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter Hawley said the decrease in sales was due to an interruption caused by 
the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, which forced the retailer to close and 
repair its stores in Sherman Oaks, Canoga Park, Northridge and Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panorama City store reopened May 21, but the other three stores remain 
closed. At the Northridge site, Carter Hawley is operating its Home Dome store, 
a 36,000-square-foot tent stocked primarily with home merchandise, until the 
store reopens. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said sales of men's clothing, cosmetics and goods for the home 
improved during the period. On the other hand, demand for women's apparel 
continues to be lackluster, said David Dworkin, Carter Hawley's president and 
chief executive.  
</P>
<P>
 "On balance," Dworkin said, "given the difficult economic climate and 
extraordinary circumstances with which we had to contend during the period, we 
are pleased with our performance and are optimistic in our ability to achieve 
substantial gains this year over 1993." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter Hawley, which emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October, 
1992, is trying to revive its business through management and marketing 
changes. The task is complicated by the flagging California economy and weak 
demand nationwide for women's apparel, Barnard said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Dworkin is trying to make changes and he is doing it with gusto and skill, 
but he has a very difficult task ahead," Barnard said.  
</P>
<P>
 Carter Hawley shares fell 50 cents Friday to $9.75 on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

DEFAULT LINES; VALLEY PLAGUED BY POST-QUAKE FORECLOSURES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Clipboard in hand, real estate agent Brett Howard moved slowly through a 
five-bedroom house in Mission Hills that had been emptied of everything except 
a wedding portrait, a pair of ragged sneakers and a few wine glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 It was easy to see why the two brothers who lived in the house packed up and 
fled to Arizona shortly after the Northridge earthquake. Cracks ran along many 
of the walls. The ceilings had lumps from water damage. The block wall was a 
pile of rubble in the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "They probably owe too much on it, so they probably just walked away," said 
Howard, who was inspecting the property for the lender. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months after the Jan. 17 earthquake, many such abandoned houses are 
appearing, adding to a pile of foreclosures in the San Fernando Valley. The 
earthquake is a major setback to a Valley market already plagued by a record 
number of recession-related foreclosures -- 20 times more last year than in 
1990 -- and falling prices. Real estate professionals fear prices will plunge 
further as lenders hold fire sales to get foreclosed properties off their books 
or homeowners are pressured into selling damaged properties at deep discounts 
to avoid defaults. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pipeline of foreclosures is beginning to fill up again," said Ron 
Prechtl, a real estate agent at Century 21 Lamb Realtors in Northridge. He said 
lenders about to foreclose on quake-damaged properties are flooding him with 
requests for opinions on likely sales prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Most lenders gave homeowners with quake damage a three-month break on mortgage 
payments, but that moratorium has expired, and banks are starting to serve 
default notices. 
</P>
<P>
 Since foreclosure proceedings typically take four months, a slew of 
earthquake-damaged properties may hit the market in late summer. 
</P>
<P>
 A major worry is the impact on prices, which are already down to 1988 levels 
-- in part because during the recession, lenders sold so many foreclosed 
properties at discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The average resale price of an existing single-family home in the Valley for 
the first four months of this year was $230,000, down 11% from the same period 
last year and down from a peak of $296,675 in 1990.

 Prices in the Valley keep falling even though sales are up. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Fay, owner of Century 21 Oak Tree in Valley Village, said her 20 sales 
agents sold 15 houses in April, a few more than a year earlier. But eight of 
them were foreclosures, Fay says, and the average price of those 15 houses was 
down about $100,000 from April, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's going to happen when we see another glut of foreclosures?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid foreclosures, some homeowners are selling quake-damaged homes "as is" 
at big discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street from the abandoned house in Mission Hills, for example, sits 
a quake-damaged three-bedroom, two-bath house that the owners sold for $125,000 
rather than default. The house was listed in November for $154,000, said the 
house's new owner, Los Angeles city employee Lance Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I got a good deal," he said, adding that he's already fixed most of 
the damage himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But reducing prices won't help many homeowners with large mortgages, a big 
quake repair bill, no insurance and little equity. 
</P>
<P>
 Seong Ho Kim, whose uninsured Newhall home was cracked in half by the quake, 
says he's told his lender to take back the house. Kim has a $250,000 mortgage 
on the property, and contractors have said it will cost at least $150,000 to 
repair it. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, the bank will take care of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks and other mortgage lenders don't want to add to their stockpile of 
foreclosed properties, which are expensive to maintain and difficult to dispose 
of without taking a big loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth-based Great Western Bank, the nation's second-largest savings and 
loan, says that if it has to take back all 250 homes on which homeowners have 
asked for temporary deferments because of major quake damage, it will lose $32 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no idea how many will be foreclosure cases," spokeswoman Linda 
Mueller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many lenders say they are trying to work with homeowners, for the good of both 
the institution and the borrowers whose credit records are damaged by defaults. 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, brokers say, more financial institutions have been 
willing to strike unusual deals with quake victims, such as "short payoffs," in 
which a lender agrees to accept less than full repayment on a mortgage if the 
property is sold. 
</P>
<P>
 However, lenders are generally not extending the three-month payment 
moratorium, and they and lawyers trying to help clients avoid defaults are not 
optimistic that many foreclosures will be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be more foreclosures on the horizon," said Leonard L. Schapira, a 
Hermosa Beach lawyer who represents many Valley homeowners struggling with 
quake repair bills and renegotiation of their mortgages. Valley Foreclosures 
</P>
<P>
 A record number of houses were foreclosed on in the Valley last year, and bank 
repossessions continue to climb because of the recession.

GREENSPAN DEFENDS FED INTEREST RATE HIKES; POLICY: CENTRAL BANK CHAIRMAN TELLS 
A SKEPTICAL SENATE PANEL THE MOVES WERE NECESSARY TO REDUCE THE THREAT OF 
INFLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan on Friday mounted his first 
public defense of the Fed's interest rate increases this year, telling a 
skeptical Congress that the central bank had no alternative but to hike rates 
to reduce the threat of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Confronted with stiff criticism from leading Democratic lawmakers, Greenspan 
told the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee that market 
pressures ultimately would have brought higher interest rates even if the Fed 
had not acted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Delaying our actions would not have been constructive," he said. While 
refusing to rule out further rate increases, Greenspan also stressed that he 
believes the Fed's actions so far should lead to solid economic growth without 
rapidly rising prices. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the government said the economy grew at a 3% pace in the first 
quarter of the year, up from an earlier estimate of 2.6% but down sharply from 
the 7% level in the fourth quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall . . . this looks like a well-balanced economy," Greenspan said. "This 
is looking to me as good as I've seen an economy evolving in a balanced form in 
a very long period of time. The economy is moving at a fairly respectable pace. 
. . . It could go on for quite a long period of time, provided that 
inflationary imbalances don't emerge." 
</P>
<P>
 Since February, the Fed has raised short-term interest rates four times in a 
controversial effort to cool the economy before it gets so overheated that it 
begins to generate a surge in inflation. Fed officials are now convinced that 
they kept interest rates too low for too long as the economy began to recover 
last year and that, before they acted in February, the economy was growing at a 
pace too rapid to be sustained without a run-up in prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan noted Friday that the central bank's easy-money policies of 1993 may 
also have led to an unhealthy increase in speculative activity in the financial 
markets, and he said Fed officials believed they had to raise rates to burst 
that bubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Some senators, however, complained that the Fed was too concerned about 
appeasing the nation's financial markets and had moved so aggressively that its 
interest rate increases are now hurting average Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) urged Greenspan to pause for 
a time. "It would be foolhardy for us to needlessly bring this economic 
expansion to a premature shutdown," Riegle said.  
</P>
<P>
 Other committee members complained that the Fed has raised rates to curb 
inflation at a time when there is virtually no evidence of rising prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) added that many of his constituents are upset 
that the Fed's actions have made it impossible for them to buy homes. "We're 
getting calls in my office from people now who can't afford to go through with 
their commitments on building new homes because they can't handle the monthly 
payments," Sarbanes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's moves to raise short-term rates have had a cascading effect on other 
market interest rates and the rest of the economy by making it more expensive 
for businesses and consumers to borrow for either investments or purchases. And 
the lawmakers noted that the U.S. economy is now more sensitive than ever to 
changes in Fed interest rate policy because so many mortgages and other 
consumer loans carry adjustable rates, which can be changed relatively quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarbanes, who is also vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, 
complained that Greenspan tightened monetary policy just after the 
Administration and Congress tightened fiscal policy with last year's 
deficit-reduction agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued that, because Greenspan had urged Congress repeatedly to cut the 
deficit, the Fed should now reward the nation by keeping interest rates low. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan disagreed that Fed policies would sacrifice the health of the 
overall economy to please Wall Street investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Friday, a senior Administration official said in an interview that, while 
the Fed's actions so far have been acceptable, he is concerned that any further 
rate increases by the central bank will begin to damage the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration so far has been careful to avoid direct criticism 
of the Fed's policies.

CANTOR FITZGERALD CHARGED WITH HELPING TO DEFRAUD INVESTORS; COMMODITIES: L.A. 
FIRM ALLEGEDLY AIDED BROKERS IN COLLECTING $4 MILLION IN FEES THEY WERE NOT 
ENTITLED TO. 
</P>

<P>
 Federal regulators said Friday that they have charged the Los Angeles-based 
Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. brokerage firm with helping a group of commodities 
brokers defraud thousands of investors of more than $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors were Germans and other Europeans from whom the brokers obtained 
$29 million in 1989, promising that they would collect a fee only if their 
commodities and securities trading was profitable for the customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In a civil action filed Thursday, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
alleges that the brokers took more than $4 million in fees even though the 
trading resulted in losses of more than $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dennis Klejna, the CFTC's director of enforcement, Cantor 
Fitzgerald's role in the alleged scheme was to transfer $950,000 of the 
investors' funds to an account held by Indianapolis-based First Republic 
Securities -- a transfer regulators say it should have known was improper. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Cantor Fitzgerald denied any wrongdoing. "The firm's 
connection to the alleged scheme was that in 1989 it transferred funds from a 
customer's securities account at the direction of such customer," said the 
statement, issued in the name of General Counsel Stephen Merkel. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the CFTC contends that Cantor Fitzgerald should have known that First 
Republic was not a legitimate recipient of the $950,000, which properly 
belonged to its customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had a sufficient level of knowledge about who this money belonged to 
that they should not have honored the request," Klejna said. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer was made at the request of Jerry W. Slusser, a Las Vegas 
commodities broker who the CFTC says was at the center of the scheme.  
</P>
<P>
 One unidentified branch office of Cantor Fitzgerald also made $1.5 million in 
commissions on securities trading generated by Slusser and his associates, the 
CFTC said. However, the agency did not charge that the trades themselves were 
illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The CFTC charged Slusser and First Republic, as well as Cantor Fitzgerald, 
with violations of the Commodity Exchange Act and of CFTC regulations. Also 
charged were Edward T. Hamlet of Highland Beach, Fla., and Hans J. Brinks of 
Berlin. Slusser and Brinks were unavailable for comment Friday, as was a 
spokesman for First Republic. Hamlet said he would not comment until he had 
seen the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The CFTC charges are subject to review by an administrative law judge. 
Violators of the exchange act face fines of as much as $100,000 for each act of 
misconduct, as well as suspension or revocation of their right to trade 
commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokers returned to the investors just $16.6 million of their $29 million. 
Some of the difference remains unaccounted for, according to the CFTC, which 
said most was lost to illicit fees, commissions and trading losses.

ECONOMY UP A SURPRISING 3% IN QUARTER; RECOVERY: ORIGINAL GDP ESTIMATE WAS 
2.6%. EARTHQUAKE MAY HAVE SPURRED GROWTH AS BILLIONS WERE SPENT TO REBUILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The nation's economy grew at a much faster rate in the first quarter than 
government analysts initially thought, as January's Northridge earthquake and 
harsh winter weather in the East failed to slow consumer spending, the Commerce 
Department said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said the economy grew at a 3% annual rate in the first three months 
of the year, up from the 2.6% rate the agency estimated last month. It raised 
some analysts' fears that inflationary pressures are still alive and triggered 
a sharp rise in bond yields in early trading. 
</P>
<P>
 But the yields began declining in the afternoon, after Federal Reserve Board 
Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that he is keeping a close eye on 
inflation and will not let it surge out of control. The yield on the benchmark 
30-year Treasury bond closed at 7.39%, up from 7.35% on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's upward revision in the growth rate of the gross domestic product -- 
which measures the value of goods and services produced in the United States -- 
surprised most economists. They had thought the earlier estimate would instead 
be lowered as the government gathered more data about business disruptions 
caused by the earthquake and the East's rotten weather. 
</P>
<P>
 But those same analysts may have failed to consider the positive -- if painful 
-- contributions the earthquake made to Southern California's massive economy, 
some West Coast analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Billions of dollars of disaster relief quickly showered down on an army of 
builders, repair companies and suppliers in the quake's aftermath, while many 
homeowners and renters used checks from their insurance companies to buy new 
furniture and appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some of those East Coast economists were basing a lot of their 
expectations on the earthquake footage they saw on TV, instead of coming out 
here and seeing how quickly L.A. was bouncing back from the quake," said Jack 
Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles Economic Development Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In another report released Friday, the University of Michigan consumer 
sentiment index rose to 92.8 for May from 92.6 in April, also signaling a 
healthy economy.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Commerce Department said an uptick in consumer spending -- which 
accounts for two-thirds of all economic activity -- was a key reason it raised 
its first-quarter growth estimate to 3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer spending grew at a $39.4 billion annual rate in the first quarter, up 
sharply from the $32.9-billion rate the Commerce Department had estimated just 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 However, corporate profits -- which soared to a $295.9-billion annual rate in 
the fourth quarter of 1993 -- slipped 3.7% to a $284.9-billion rate in the 
first three months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised 3% annual growth rate is less than half the sizzling 7% logged at 
the end of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, 3% is a pretty nice figure, because we would probably see some 
inflationary pressures build if the economy grew much faster than that," said 
Robert Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate should also take pressure off the Federal Reserve Board to hike 
short-term interest rates again in its ongoing battle to keep the economy from 
overheating, some economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has raised its federal funds rate to 4.25% from 3% over the past four 
months, discouraging businesses from borrowing more money to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Higher interest rates will bite some in the second half and slow the 
economy," said Allen Sinai of Lehman Bros. in New York. Gross Domestic Product

States. Percent change from previous quarter:

 Administration Drops Bank Regulatory Reform: The Clinton Administration has 
abandoned plans to pass legislation this year consolidating bank regulation, 
the Treasury Department said.A Treasury official who insisted on anonymity said 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen decided to shelve the proposal after failing to reach 
agreement on a compromise with Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
The Administration has proposed merging all four bank regulatory agencies into 
a Federal Banking Commission. The four agencies are the Comptroller of the 
Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
and the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board, which would be 
stripped of its power to regulate banks, has opposed the bill.

 McDonald's to Test Home-Cooking Restaurants: The company said it will test a 
new type of restaurant that features home-style cooking rather than its 
traditional fast food in a setting that resembles a single-family home. The 
company, revealing the plans to reporters after its annual meeting, also 
announced a 2-for-1 common stock split and raised its quarterly dividend by 
12%.McDonald's Corp. has often tested new concepts, but the Hearth Cafe Express 
marks a significant departure for the company because the restaurant will 
feature home-style items such as chicken, ham, meatloaf, mashed potatoes and 
gravy. The first Hearth Cafe Express will be in Darien, Ill., outside Chicago. 
Construction is to begin next week, said Edward Rensi, president and chief 
executive of McDonald's U.S.A. The cafe will have takeout service, in-store 
dining and some catering, he said.

28 restaurants in nine Chinese cities, said it plans to have 200 restaurants in 
45 cities by 1998. It expects the restaurants to generate sales of more than 
$350 million and employ 20,000 people. The news comes a day after President 
Clinton renewed China's most-favored-nation trade status, saying human rights 
should not be linked with trade policy.

 Booksellers Group Sues Publishers: The American Booksellers Assn. filed an 
antitrust lawsuit against five publishers, claiming they discriminate against 
small bookstores and favor large chains. The trade group, which represents 
4,552 bookstores across the country, said publishers offer better terms to 
chains and warehouse buying clubs. The group filed the suit in U.S. District 
Court in Philadelphia against Houghton Mifflin Co., Hugh Lauter Levin 
Associates Inc., Penguin U.S.A. Inc., Rutledge Hill Press Inc. and St. Martin's 
Press Inc. The association, whose annual convention begins today in Los 
Angeles, said it initiated the litigation after a yearlong probe it conducted 
into alleged "discriminatory secret deals and illegal practices on the part of 
the publishers."

ASSEMBLY OKS PACBELL BID FOR LONG-DISTANCE SERVICE IN STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite opposition from such unlikely bedfellows as AT&T and major consumer 
groups, the Assembly voted 60 to 1 Thursday to let Pacific Bell offer 
long-distance telephone service within California. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which now goes to the Senate, was sold as hastening free 
competition in the phone business and favoring California jobs by empowering a 
home state company to compete against such "national companies" as 
long-distance powers AT&T, MCI and Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
 "It puts the state of California on the side of open competition," said the 
bill's sponsor, Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno). 
</P>
<P>
 But critics, including the California Public Utilities Commission, called it a 
special-interest bill that would run afoul of federal directives and enable 
Pacific Bell to grab long-distance business before it faced real local 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an attempt by a monopoly to position itself to remain a monopoly," said 
Audrie Krause, executive director of Toward Utility Rate Normalization, a 
consumer watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the bill is adopted, nothing will change immediately. The bill itself 
says Pacific Bell would not be able to offer in-state long-distance service 
until federal action permitted it. In fact, Congress is working on legislation 
to open up the long-distance and local phone markets to competition nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether Pacific Bell can offer phone service between California's 
10 phone regions. The 1982 court-ordered breakup of AT&T barred PacBell from 
entering the long-distance business. 
</P>
<P>
 TURN, like the long-distance firms, notes that PacBell still controls the 
switches that give access to long-distance lines. Thus, to critics, PacBell 
would be positioned to undermine competitors.

MARKET PAUSES BEFORE HOLIDAY; DOW GAINS 3.68

 Blue chip stocks edged higher Friday on the eve of the long holiday weekend, 
in the thinnest trading since December. For the week, the Dow industrials were 
off 9.21 points at 3,757.14. They gained 3.68 in the session. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock and bond markets shrugged off Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan 
Greenspan's Senate testimony, in which he said the economy is basically strong 
but that there are uncertainties, such as the weak dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bond yields rose after the Commerce Department revised upward its 
estimate of the nation's gross domestic product, from 2.6% to 3% in the first 
three months of the year. That is much slower than the 7% rise in the fourth 
quarter of 1993, but economists had expected the revised number to be lower, 
not higher, and it signaled that the economy is stronger than thought and 
inflation a greater risk.  
</P>
<P>
 But an inflation index tied to the GDP proved tame. It rose at a moderate 
annual rate of 2.6% in the first quarter, unchanged from an earlier estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Government 
Securities Inc., said Greenspan's testimony gave the market the impression that 
the Fed won't move again in the near future to raise interest rates, suggesting 
that the central bank is sanguine about the long-term inflation outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury bond market closed early for the holiday. The benchmark 30-year 
bond's yield closed at 7.38%, up from 7.36%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts await the government's release Tuesday of data on personal 
income and spending in April, which will provide a better picture of 
second-quarter growth and inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the main British share index plunged to a nine-month low on fears 
of higher interest rates because of faster economic growth in Europe and the 
United States. The FTSE-100 fell 53.3 points to 2966.4, down 4.9% on the week. 
British Telecom, British Petroleum and British Gas together wiped about 10 
points off the index. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the German market rose slightly Friday, European markets overall fell 
through the week.  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar ended mostly lower in foreign exchange trading, while gold prices 
were higher.  
</P>
<P>
 Prices of many commodities staged modest rebounds after a week that saw a 
closely watched index climb to 3 1/2-year highs before plunging sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 Grains, coffee, cocoa, metals, oil and cattle prices all recovered some of 
their lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffee prices, which tumbled 15% from Monday's close of $1.39 a pound to $1.17 
on Thursday, rebounded 3.5 cents to close at $1.213. 
</P>
<P>
 Among market highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 The blue chips received a boost from McDonald's, which rose 1 1/8 to 61 after 
the restaurant chain's board approved a 2-for-1 stock split and raised its 
quarterly dividend.  
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris fell another 5/8 to 50. The stock fell 3 1/8 on Thursday after 
the company said it had no immediate plans to split its food and tobacco 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel stocks rose. A Wall Street Journal article said the outlook for steel 
profits is good and the stocks cheap, having lost more than 20% since Jan. 31. 
Bethlehem Steel rose 1 1/8 to 19 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 McKesson gained 3 3/8 to 84 3/4 on speculation that it may be acquired soon by 
either Glaxo Holdings or by Johnson & Johnson in a deal with Glaxo.

UNIONS SUPPORT LIFTING OF OIL EXPORT BAN; ENERGY: BRITISH PETROLEUM AGREES TO 
USE U.S. TANKERS TO MOVE ALASKAN CRUDE. DEAL CONTINGENT ON CONGRESSIONAL 
APPROVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Five key U.S. maritime unions formally agreed Friday to support lifting a 
federal ban on the export of Alaskan crude oil in a deal worked out with 
British Petroleum Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking its silence, BP confirmed that it has agreed to preserve union jobs 
by using U.S.-flag tankers to ship any BP oil "that moves off the Alaskan North 
Slope," said Rob Rehg, a spokesman for the London-based oil company. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement is contingent on Congress adding the lifting of the ban to a 
pending bill that would extend the Export Administration Act. Though opposition 
remains among lawmakers, proponents were optimistic Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make it a done deal, but it certainly makes it a viable deal," one 
congressional source said. "If the maritime unions really get behind this, they 
can sway a lot of Congress members. . . . And then if you get a good (Energy 
Department) study that says it's not going to affect national energy concerns, 
then there's no legitimate argument for the ban." 
</P>
<P>
 A still-unreleased Energy Department report on the costs and benefits of 
lifting the ban estimates that as many as 494 maritime industry jobs could be 
lost in 1994-95 if the ban were ended without a provision requiring the crude 
to be transported on U.S.-flag ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the study supports proponents' estimates that thousands of new oil 
field jobs -- and a substantial increase in investment in California and 
Alaskan production -- would result from lifting the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many high-ranking members of the Clinton Administration favor lifting 
the ban, the White House is not likely to take a formal stand on the issue 
until after the release of the Energy Department report, expected June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement made available to The Times on Friday, executives of the 
Seafarers International Union; National Maritime Union; American Maritime 
Officers; International Organization of Masters, Mates & Pilots, Marine 
Engineers Beneficial Assn. ended two decades of insistence on preserving the 
ban, declaring that lifting it will create jobs and ensure the existence of a 
U.S. tanker fleet -- "vessels that are militarily useful in times of conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 California's independent oil producers and other opponents of the ban have 
argued that it forces too much crude into the California market, depressing the 
regional price.

COLUMN ONE; ASIA'S TIGERS FLEX THEIR MUSCLES; U.S.-CHINA TUSSLE OVER TRADE AND 
HUMAN RIGHTS SHOWS HOW ECONOMIC MIGHT HAS GIVEN PACIFIC NATIONS THE CLOUT TO 
DEFY THE WEST. FRICTIONS ARE LIKELY TO KEEP RISING. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 30 years ago, the United States issued a clarion call against the 
spread of communism in Asia, and Southeast Asian nations eagerly united behind 
the U.S. initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Washington tried to pull together similar support this year to 
isolate Myanmar, where human rights violations are rife, the coalition balked. 
</P>
<P>
 Thailand said that instead of isolation it would offer "constructive 
engagement" to the military regime in Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. 
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong paid a friendly state visit to Yangon, 
the capital. The six-member Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations even invited 
Myanmar to send the leader of its military junta to its annual meeting here 
this July. 
</P>
<P>
 More and more, the economically booming nations of Asia are flexing their 
political muscle in disputes with the United States and the West, especially on 
such sensitive issues as human rights, freedom of expression and labor rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Some call it the Asian Way; others refer to neo-Confucianism or East Asian 
authoritarianism. A hybrid of traditional Asian culture and 1990s economics, 
this doctrine champions society over the individual and "family values" over 
what is seen as corroding Western influences. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, according to its ardent believers in China and the surrounding 
states of Southeast Asia, economic development requires a period of political 
stability not possible under democracy -- a notion derided by Western critics 
as justification for tyranny. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the name, the Asian Way doctrine is a distinctly post-Cold War 
phenomenon that may spell declining U.S. influence in the region and threatens 
to raise friction across the Pacific in years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the growth of their economic prosperity, East Asian countries are 
becoming more assertive politically," said Washington SyCip, a prominent Manila 
business consultant. "I think you'll see them being more and more forthright 
and stating what their values are." 
</P>
<P>
 Bearing him out are statistics showing the combined gross domestic product of 
East Asia -- Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and the Southeast 
Asian nations -- was 4% of the world economy in 1960; by 2010, it is expected 
to be 33%. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel P. Huntington, a Harvard professor, speculated in an essay published 
last year that Asia and the United States were entering a "clash of 
civilizations" that inevitably followed the clash of ideology that predominated 
in the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 "A West at the peak of its power confronts non-Wests that increasingly have 
the desire, the will and the economic resources to shape the world in 
non-Western ways," Huntington wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the Asian Way really new? After all, both Taiwan and South Korea boomed 
economically under authoritarian regimes and have made the transition to 
democracies. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the 1960s and 1970s, the United States was more willing to turn a blind 
eye to human rights abuses in the name of anti-Communist solidarity. Only since 
the Cold War ended in 1988 has Washington seemed eager to confront Asian 
countries with broader issues of democracy and labor rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The most dramatic example of Asian muscle-flexing is the debate between 
Washington and the Communist rulers in Beijing over human rights, culminating 
in President Clinton's decision, announced Thursday, to renew 
most-favored-nation trade status for China. The United States had linked 
continuation of the trade benefits with human rights improvements, but Clinton 
was forced to make an embarrassing retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 When Secretary of State Warren Christopher visited Beijing in March, Premier 
Li Peng warned him that China "will never accept U.S. human rights concepts." 
</P>
<P>
 As Christopher expressed outrage at the detention of Chinese dissidents, Li 
responded by warning that if its trade status is revoked, "the United States 
will suffer no less than China." 
</P>
<P>
 China's economy is booming, with growth at 13.4% last year, and European as 
well as U.S. businesses are scrambling to enter the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though China runs a $23-billion surplus with the United States, meaning 
it would suffer much more from a trade drop, it was U.S. business interests 
that spoke gloomily about the potential loss of 200,000 jobs if MFN status were 
revoked -- enough to sway the President. 
</P>
<P>
 While many Asian countries remain wary of a resurgent China, the U.S. linkage 
of trade and human rights did not find a sympathetic audience in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "When China becomes powerful in 20 or 30 years' time, there is no reason why 
China should behave kindly toward the West," Singapore's Goh said when asked 
about the possible effect of trade sanctions on Beijing. "That's our worry: 
China may want to flex its muscles, and then it will be a very troublesome 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Singapore will continue to invest in China no matter what the 
United States decides to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Then-Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa undercut Washington during a 
recent visit to China by declaring, "It is not sensible for Western countries 
to impose their values of democracy on other countries." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Australia, normally a champion of human rights but now courting Asia's 
business, has parted company with the United States in its dispute with China. 
</P>
<P>
 Australia's ambassador to Washington, Don Russell, urged the Clinton 
Administration in April to drop its aggressive pursuit of human rights and 
adopt a low-key dialogue with China using "constructive, non-confrontational 
engagement." 
</P>
<P>
 Southeast Asian nations are similarly assertive with the United States and 
Europe about Myanmar, because of budding economic ties and dislike of outside 
interference. 
</P>
<P>
 No one disputes the country's appalling human rights record, in which 
thousands of demonstrators have been killed and the military junta has rejected 
the results of a May, 1990, election that was won in a landslide by the 
opposition National League for Democracy. The League's chairwoman, Aung Sang 
Suu Kyi, has been under house arrest for nearly five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston Lord, the assistant secretary of state for East Asian affairs, called 
on Myanmar's neighbors to help isolate the country's generals until the human 
rights picture improved. But last month, Lord was forced to concede that "as 
friends," the United States and Southeast Asia "have agreed to disagree on the 
approaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore is the largest investor in Myanmar, followed by Thailand and Japan. 
But beyond economic questions, Southeast Asian countries are loath to allow 
outside powers to interfere in what they consider to be the internal affairs of 
a neighboring state. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were to adopt the Western approach with Burma, we would be abandoning 
our role," Thai Foreign Minister Prasong Soonsiri said. "We are neighbors, and 
we should keep up relations in order to bring them out into the world 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The other members of ASEAN -- Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia and the 
Philippines -- have agreed to follow the policy of "constructive engagement" 
toward Myanmar. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the paradoxes of the recent assertion of the Asian Way is that no two 
Asian nations are culturally identical. Corruption-free Singapore stands in 
contrast to the venality of Indonesia and Thailand, and the media are as free 
in the Philippines and Thailand as they are controlled in Malaysia and 
Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, mostly in the West, argue that there really is no "Asian Way." They 
say this is a convenient slogan seized by undemocratic rulers to justify their 
continued hold on power. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesian President Suharto, who took power in the 1960s after a military 
coup, has presided over dramatic economic growth in his crowded nation, the 
largest in Southeast Asia. Suharto has argued that it is unrealistic for his 
country to use Western standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are people of the East, so we must use Eastern standards," he said in a 
speech in May. "We cannot don Western clothes because they are too big. It 
would make us look like scarecrows." 
</P>
<P>
 One example of the "Eastern standard": 21 Indonesian students were sent to 
prison for six months this month for slandering the president by holding up 
banners outside Parliament. The sentences were considered light compared to 
another student who received four years in prison on the same charge in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia's differences with the West over human rights escalated after army 
troops killed about 200 demonstrators in the former Portuguese province of East 
Timor in November, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jakarta government announced that it would spurn further aid from European 
countries rather than have human rights strings attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed has warned Asian states against 
becoming the "slave of democracy." He asserted in a speech last year that too 
much democracy leads to moral decay, homosexuality, widespread drug use and the 
collapse of the work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
 When Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating called Mahathir "recalcitrant" for 
not attending last year's transpacific talks in Seattle, Mahathir flexed his 
country's new economic muscle by hinting at trade sanctions against Australia. 
Keating hastily apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, now a senior minister in the 
government and a political theorist whose views are much in vogue in Asia these 
days, remarked recently: "With few exceptions, democracy has not brought good 
government to new developing countries. Democracy has not led to development 
because the governments did not establish stability and discipline necessary 
for development." 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam, which like China is emerging from decades of orthodox Communist rule 
to embrace market capitalism, warned that despite the shifting economy, the 
country is not about to abandon communism for democracy or multi-party 
ideology. Vietnam is expected to be invited to join ASEAN soon. 
</P>
<P>
 When Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt visited Hanoi in April and waxed 
eloquent about free economies needing free societies, the government chopped 
the offending remarks from a translation of his speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam's hard-line attitude was demonstrated in recent months when the 
government agreed to allow Western organizations, including the U.S.-based 
Freedom Forum, to conduct seminars on journalism, and then canceled the 
meetings at the last minute without explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kishore Mahbubani, the top civil servant in Singapore's Foreign Ministry, 
published an essay in the Washington Quarterly this year in which he blamed the 
United States' current troubles on too much freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a major reversal of a pattern lasting centuries, many Western societies -- 
including the United States -- are doing some major things fundamentally wrong, 
while a growing number of East Asian societies are doing the same things 
right," Mahbubani said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Stanford University professor wryly observed that Singapore's recent caning 
of American teen-ager Michael Fay for vandalism made him the first known victim 
of the "clash of civilizations" expected to take place between Asia and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton denounced the punishment as extreme, but many Asians -- and a fair 
number of Americans -- decried the United States' crime rate and said it needed 
to adopt more stringent punishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a single fundamental difference between the Western and Asian 
world views, it is the dichotomy between individual freedom and collective 
welfare," a Singapore businessman, Ho Kwon Ping, told a meeting of lawyers this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that while Western countries might prefer to see a guilty man go free 
than convict an innocent man, Asians would prefer "an innocent person to be 
convicted if the common welfare is protected. And better for a guilty person to 
be free if conviction would inflict further harm on the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from the issue of human rights, few things make Asian leaders bristle as 
much as the Western media. 
</P>
<P>
 China, Malaysia and Singapore have banned individual ownership of satellite 
dishes to prevent direct reception of Western programming, which they view as 
an assault on Asian values. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a dispute arose this month when the respected British Broadcasting 
Corp. withdrew its news programs from Malaysia after government censors excised 
a filmed report about labor strife in neighboring Indonesia. The Singapore 
government has restricted the circulation of Western newspapers and magazines 
such as Time and The Economist because officials dislike their coverage of 
Singapore affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure from China, media magnate Rupert Murdoch announced that the BBC 
World Television program was being withdrawn from transmissions on the Hong 
Kong-based Star Television satellite service. It was replaced with 
Chinese-language movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Malaysia barred new business deals between British firms 
and the government in retaliation for a series of exposes in London's Sunday 
Times alleging corruption in the Malaysian government's awarding of contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Murdoch, who owns the Sunday Times, subsequently moved the editor of the 
paper, Andrew Neil, to a job in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the cause of the government's decision to ban new government contracts 
for British companies," Mahathir crowed after Neil's transfer was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue on which Asia and the West seem likely to collide is labor 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and France have suggested that a worldwide minimum wage be 
adopted by the World Trade Organization to stop the exploitation of workers in 
poor countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysia's Mahathir said the West's "professed concern about workers' welfare 
is motivated by self-interest," because, he said, low wages are the developing 
world's only competitive advantage against the industrialized West. 
</P>
<P>
 "Washington's new-found concern for workers' rights is downright 
hypocritical," the Bangkok Post said in an editorial. 
</P>
<P>
 Singapore's Lee even argued that the U.S. position was responsible for labor 
unrest last month in Medan, Indonesia, in which one person was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asians believe the intended beneficiaries (of the U.S. pressure) are not 
workers in Indonesia and Malaysia but American trade unions belonging to the 
AFL-CIO who fear losing jobs to low-wage countries," Lee said.

RESEARCHERS TRY TO SEPARATE SMOKING FACT FROM FICTION; HEALTH: EFFECTS OF 
SECONDHAND EXPOSURE ARE BEING STUDIED. BUT THERE IS A COLLISION OF POLITICS AND 
SCIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The big brown building, a short walk off a country road in this scenic college 
town, looks more like a barn than a high-tech university laboratory. Inside, a 
rare and curious contraption is engaged in a habit that the surgeon general 
warns is bad for your health. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Kent Pinkerton's creation: the UC Davis smoking machine. 
</P>
<P>
 As an associate professor of anatomy at Davis, Pinkerton is interested in how 
the lungs work. His specialty has landed him at the crossroads of politics and 
medicine. In his lab at the university's Institute of Toxicology and 
Environmental Health, Pinkerton and his colleagues hope their unusual smoking 
machine will inject hard science into the roiling national debate over the 
dangers of secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 How, they are eager to know, are the cells and tissues of the lungs altered by 
exposure to secondhand smoke? Are infants born smaller when they are exposed in 
the womb? Does secondhand smoke induce changes in the nasal passageways that 
lead to asthma? Is there a precise dose -- for lack of a better term -- at 
which it becomes dangerous? If so, where does the threshold lie? 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when "Secondhand Smoke Kills" billboards are popping up across 
California, and the government has classified secondhand smoke as a human 
carcinogen, nonsmokers worry that the slightest whiff of smoke could wreak 
havoc on their lungs and hearts. Cigarette companies are waging a 
counterattack, insisting that it is little more than a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth, which independent scientists say is somewhere in between, may 
emerge from the smoking machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientific truths about secondhand smoke are not easy to come by. Studies are 
difficult and expensive to conduct, and funding is limited. Moreover, ethical 
considerations prevent researchers from subjecting humans to cigarette smoke, 
at least not for days on end. Nor can they ask people to smoke for the sake of 
science. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence the busy Davis smoking machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Five days a week, six hours a day, the machine is at work, blowing smoke at 
guinea pigs and hamsters, whose body parts will later be dissected in an effort 
to identify biological reactions that may be similar in humans. The device -- 
one of just two large-scale smoking machines in the nation outside of those 
owned by tobacco companies -- smokes more precisely than any person ever could, 
and therein lies its value. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no Marlboros, Camels or Virginia Slims here. Rather, the smoking 
machine's brand of choice is one few people have heard of -- the 1R4F. These 
low-tar and nicotine research cigarettes, each manufactured from the same 
tobacco blend, are produced by the University of Kentucky. They were rolled in 
1983 and kept in a deep freeze until being shipped to Davis, where they are 
conditioned for up to 48 hours at 70% humidity before being smoked. 
</P>
<P>
 Every 10 minutes, a steel piston fires another 1R4F into a revolving cylinder. 
A small metal coil, the sort used to heat an ordinary blow-dryer, lights the 
cigarette with a tiny red glow. As ashes begin to emerge, two others are in 
various stages of being smoked. The whole mechanism is encased in a plexiglass 
box that is yellow with smoke residue. Through a series of pipes, the box is 
connected to chambers where the animals are kept. 
</P>
<P>
 With every puff, the cylinder clicks another revolution and a red light 
flashes. Each cigarette -- there are never more than three burning at any time 
-- is smoked in precisely the same fashion: one puff a minute, each puff 
lasting two seconds, eight puffs in all. To create each puff, a vacuum draws in 
35 milliliters of air -- no more, no less. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, Pinkerton says, an important reason for all this precision. 
</P>
<P>
 Soft-spoken and lanky, the scientist is a master of understatement, never 
going out on a limb. "If we are going to understand the mechanisms (by which 
secondhand smoke injures people)," he says, "we need to have well-controlled 
conditions."

 The Davis studies have been under way for three years -- a short span in 
science, when research often lasts for decades. The university scientists are 
particularly interested in the effects of secondhand smoke on young children; 
studies show infants and toddlers -- who may suffer from bronchitis, asthma and 
other respiratory diseases when exposed to secondhand smoke in the home -- are 
its primary victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Davis findings: Toxicologist Peter Witschi has shown that pregnant 
rats exposed to secondhand smoke gave birth to pups that weighed 6% less than 
those born to other rats -- not a dramatic reduction, but one that experts say 
is significant. Dr. Jesse Joad, a pediatrician, has demonstrated that newborn 
rats exposed to secondhand smoke in the womb and after birth test positive for 
asthma. Pinkerton has found that the lungs of newborn rats develop more slowly 
when exposed to secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the experiments, Joad is investigating how nerve fibers in the 
lungs of guinea pigs are harmed by exposure to secondhand smoke; the damage 
prevents the lungs from fending off other pollutants. Witschi is trying to 
determine whether a particularly strong carcinogen called NNK produces lung 
tumors in hamsters exposed to secondhand smoke, as it does in animals that 
breathe direct smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Few such studies have been done before. "This is very beginning stuff," Joad 
said, adding: "The kind of testing that we are going to do absolutely could 
never be done on children." 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco industry critics contend that the research is a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Coggins, a toxicologist for cigarette maker R.J. Reynolds, says he has 
done his own animal research on rats and found no biological changes in the 
heart, lungs or respiratory system. The only damage documented in the study -- 
which appeared last year in the journal Inhalation Toxicology -- occurred in 
the tip of the rats' noses, Coggins said, and was "completely reversible" when 
they were no longer exposed to the smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco industry consultant Gio Batta Gori, also a toxicologist, calls the 
Davis studies irrelevant. Humans, Gori argues, have the "intrinsic capacity" to 
clear their bodies of low-level pollutants, including secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can manipulate the experiments any way you want and come up with some 
results," Gori complained of the research at Davis and other animal studies. 
"You can choose a strain (of animal) that is susceptible, and you can use doses 
that are beyond the capacity of the animals to clear." 
</P>
<P>
 Witschi says the doses can be manipulated -- and must be -- if scientists are 
to learn at what levels secondhand smoke becomes dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 The animals in the Davis experiments are generally exposed at 1,000 micrograms 
of smoke particles per cubic meter of air -- levels that the researchers say 
are high, but can be found in typical smoking environments, such as bars. 
However, some studies -- including Witschi's NNK research -- employ levels as 
high as 4,000 micrograms, concentrations that he acknowledges are much higher 
than those found in the real world.  
</P>
<P>
 These concentrations are a matter of great dispute. Coggins, the Reynolds 
toxicologist, maintains that real-world concentrations average only 35 
micrograms per cubic meter in smoking homes. In bars, he says, concentrations 
would run only as high as 100 micrograms per cubic meter. His rat studies 
employed exposures of 100 micrograms, 1,000 micrograms and 10,000 micrograms -- 
and found no effects even at the highest dose, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On such minutiae hang the answers to crucial questions about secondhand 
smoke's health effects. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as 
health advocacy groups, 53,000 people die each year from exposure to secondhand 
smoke. This figure is based on epidemiology studies, which examine patterns of 
illness but do not prove cause and effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The studies implicate secondhand smoke in lung cancer and other cancers, heart 
disease, sudden infant death syndrome, bronchitis, pneumonia and asthma, 
especially in children. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, relying on the lung cancer 
epidemiology, has declared secondhand smoke a Group A human carcinogen -- a 
classification that puts it in the same category as radon and asbestos. But 
tobacco industry officials say the EPA's research is flawed because people 
overestimate the amount of smoke they have been exposed to, or lie about their 
smoking habits. 
</P>
<P>
 The animal research may settle this debate by showing what epidemiology 
cannot: precisely how secondhand smoke wreaks its havoc, and exactly how much 
exposure is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say it is not safe to assume that passive smoking affects people in 
the same way as active smoking. This is for two reasons: Those exposed to 
secondhand smoke get a smaller dose -- inhaling about 1% of the toxins that 
smokers absorb. At the same time, however, secondhand smoke is much dirtier, 
partly because it does not go through a cigarette filter, said Stanton Glantz, 
a UC-San Francisco researcher. 
</P>
<P>
 In the business of tobacco research, what smokers inhale is known as 
"mainstream smoke." What comes off the burning end of the cigarette is 
"sidestream smoke." Secondhand smoke -- also known as environmental tobacco 
smoke -- is made up mostly of sidestream smoke, but also includes what the 
smoker exhales. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidestream smoke is a complex blend of more than 4,000 chemicals -- including 
carbon monoxide, formaldehyde, ammonia, nicotine, zinc, nickel and arsenic. In 
the air, it is an elusive target; some chemicals evaporate, some condense, some 
attach to the lining of the lungs when inhaled while others do not. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA has found that five known human carcinogens and nine probable 
carcinogens are emitted at higher levels in sidestream smoke than in mainstream 
smoke. Other toxic elements -- including carbon monoxide, ammonia, nicotine and 
acetone -- are more concentrated insidestream than mainstream smoke. NNK, the 
carcinogen Witschi is studying, is one to four times stronger in sidestream 
smoke than in mainstream smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to suggest, experts say, that exposure to secondhand smoke is more 
dangerous than active smoking -- it is not. But, with the exception of tobacco 
industry scientists, researchers who are trying to assess the danger of 
secondhand smoke are finding that exposure clearly has biological effects. 
</P>
<P>
 At the University of Maryland, Dr. Rebecca Bascom has performed some of the 
few studies on humans. After exposing medical students to high concentrations 
of secondhand smoke for 15 minutes, she found that some experienced itchy eyes 
and nasal congestion, but that the reaction was not a classic allergic one -- 
meaning standard allergy medicines would not help people who are sensitive to 
cigarette smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 At New York University Medical Center, which maintains the only other large 
university-based smoking machine in the nation, researcher Arthur Penn is 
trying to figure out how secondhand smoke affects the hearts of young children 
exposed to smoke in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn and his colleagues exposed young chickens to very heavy concentrations of 
sidestream smoke -- he used five cigarettes smoked at once -- and found 
significantly larger plaques in their arteries than in a group of control 
chickens. Over time, these plaques can build up to include deposits of fat and 
cholesterol, which cause heart disease. Some of the plaque lesions were so big 
they could be seen without a microscope. All the chickens were on a 
low-cholesterol diet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a subsequent experiment, Penn ratcheted down the exposure level, this time 
subjecting the chickens to the smoke of just one cigarette -- about the same 
concentration as in a smoky bar. He found that even then, the chickens 
developed significant plaques, leading him to conclude that the same may happen 
in children of smokers. At UC-San Francisco, Glantz has conducted similar 
studies on rabbits with similar results. 
</P>
<P>
 "These results," Penn said, "clearly indicate there are real, long-term 
effects on the cardiovascular system due to involuntary exposure to cigarette 
smoke, and our recent studies show that it is at levels you could find in many 
public venues." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such research, however, does not occur in a vacuum. Politics swirls around 
these scientists in the same way that secondhand smoke swirls around the 
animals they study. Penn, Pinkerton and the others are always on guard about 
what they say, knowing that any statements might be used by one side or the 
other in the emotional debate over restricting smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 The collision of politics and science troubles Pinkerton, for he is not a 
political man. His sole interest, he says, is science. Understanding how 
secondhand smoke affects the lungs -- particularly in young children -- will 
help him better understand how all kinds of pollutants alter the respiratory 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's a very emotional issue," he said. "It's one of those things where 
we could relieve the consciences of a lot of (parents who smoke) or we could 
make them feel more guilty than ever." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the constant battles for funding. The tobacco industry, 
through its Center for Indoor Air Research, finances a good portion of 
research. Pinkerton and Penn have taken tobacco dollars, and have no qualms 
about it, saying they have never felt interference in their methods or what 
they publish. But Penn learned an interesting lesson recently: After his 
low-level exposure chicken studies came up with damning conclusions, the Center 
for Indoor Air Research told him it would not fund subsequent work. 
</P>
<P>
 He is now hunting around for a new grant. "We'll be happy to take money from 
almost anybody," he said, "with no strings attached." 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkerton relies on a grant from Proposition 99, the anti-smoking initiative 
adopted by California voters in 1988. But that money, too, may run out; in a 
move that is angering many scientists, Gov. Pete Wilson wants to redirect the 
research dollars to medical care. The money comes from the same pool that pays 
for a massive education campaign about the dangers of tobacco, including the 
ubiquitous secondhand smoke billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkerton says he doesn't think much about who foots the bill or what their 
agenda might be. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to be driven by trying to come up with proof for legislative 
ideas," he said. "I know that may sound contrary to what our sponsors want, but 
. . . if that is our only objective to doing research, then I think we are not 
doing justice to science, and to our whole creative process of trying to 
understand how things in life work." In the Air 
</P>
<P>
 Secondhand smoke accounts for 85% of all indoor air pollution, according to 
researcher James Repace. Pollution is measured in micrograms of "respirable 
particulates" -- breathable particles -- per cubic meter of air. The federal 
standard for clean air is 50 micrograms per cubic meter. Although the tobacco 
industry disputes his work, Repace's measurements show that smoky indoor air is 
more polluted than a busy highway.

UNZ JABS AT WILSON IN RADIO DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking the offensive in the only debate scheduled before the Republican 
primary, political neophyte Ron Unz on Friday assailed Gov. Pete Wilson for 
raising taxes, being a hypocrite on immigration and going soft on ex-convicts 
who violate the conditions of their parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz, a 32-year-old Silicon Valley entrepreneur who has never before run for 
public office, coolly described his libertarian-leaning agenda for California 
and had the veteran incumbent alternately defending his record and crying foul 
but unable to present his vision for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson at least five times accused Unz of distorting his record as governor 
and twice invoked the name of Ronald Reagan, who, Wilson noted in his own 
defense, also signed a big tax increase when he was governor of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-term chief executive -- a former U.S. senator and former mayor of 
San Diego -- dismissed the significance of polls showing the previously unknown 
Unz getting 30% of the Republican vote. Anyone who put a name on the ballot 
against him, Wilson said, probably could do as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz got some help from the debate moderator, KABC talk radio host Michael 
Jackson, who repeatedly chided, at times almost rudely, the often wordy Wilson, 
telling him to stop lecturing and to keep his answers to the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forgive me, sir," Jackson said as he interrupted Wilson. "You want to go on 
making a speech, fine, then I will let him make a speech and we'll all yawn to 
death." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, Wilson, who participated by telephone from Phoenix, where he 
was attending a governors conference, told reporters he did not intend to 
debate his upstart challenger again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got better things to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates agreed on two matters during the 55-minute confrontation: that 
the proposed Ward Valley nuclear waste dump should proceed and that the death 
penalty should remain on the books and be enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 But on everything else, from economics to education and immigration, the two 
candidates clashed sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe in the principles of smaller government, lower taxes and fewer 
regulations," Unz said at the outset. "I come from the productive private 
business sector. I understand the technologies of the future. And I think my 
views, my policies and my knowledge of technology could help to revive the 
California economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Unz proposed replacing the inefficient and fraud-ridden workers' compensation 
system with private insurance, and he challenged Wilson to support his proposal 
to "massively cut" the size of government while rolling back social welfare 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked Wilson: "Do you endorse those types of massive cuts or will you 
spring a new tax increase on us just like you did in 1991?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, that's clever if dishonest, Mr. Unz," Wilson replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said that under his leadership state government has made the "deepest 
spending cuts in American history." Projections when he took office, Wilson 
said, had state spending reaching $60 billion this year, and instead it will be 
less than $40 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not mention that much of that drop occurred because of the faltering 
economy or that most of the rest came as a result of his plan to use local 
property tax revenues to relieve the state of part of its constitutional 
obligation to the public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a shell game," Unz said. 
</P>
<P>
 On immigration, Wilson attacked the Clinton Administration and Congress for 
failing to stop illegal immigrants and for not reimbursing California for the 
full cost of providing services to those illegal immigrants who get through. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is costing the state taxpayers of California virtually 10% of their state 
general fund budget," Wilson said. "We have reached the point where we are 
unable to provide needed services for legal residents . . . because of what we 
are having to provide . . . to illegal immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Unz cut Wilson off and accused him of exploiting the issue for political 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think there's a certain amount of insincerity here," Unz said. 
"You're somebody who's been governor of California for almost four years now. 
You never raised this issue until very recently. You only raised it once the 
polls started saying it was the way you could be reelected." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson denied it, saying he made demands on then-President George Bush in 
1989, 1990 and 1991 for better treatment for California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been at this for a very long time," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the two candidates agreed on the death penalty, they disagreed on 
other aspects of Wilson's criminal justice record. Unz, picking up on a charge 
the Democrats have thrown at Wilson, criticized the governor for an 
Administration policy that resulted in fewer parole violators being returned to 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Unz said: "In 1992, when people weren't as concerned about crime but they were 
more concerned about the budget, you cut $100 million from the state prison 
system. Because of that cut, a lot of vicious criminals who have been paroled 
but have violated the terms of parole have been allowed to remain on the 
streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson tried to stop Unz from completing his charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're wrong on your facts again," he said as both candidates spoke at once. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Jackson stepped in and asked Wilson if the rate of parolees returned to 
prison for violating their parole had declined from 61% when he took office to 
39%. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson's own Department of Corrections has published data showing the rate 
dropping from 60.3% in 1991 to 39.1% a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 And the head the prison system, James Gomez, recently told a legislative 
committee that budget cuts had prompted the department to reduce the use of 
drug tests and to allow parolees who test positive for drugs to more often 
remain on the street rather than be returned to prison. 
</P>

Phoenix and Times political writer Bill Stall in Los Angeles.

SOLZHENITSYN RETURNS FROM 20-YEAR EXILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Solemn and prophetic, Alexander I. Solzhenitsyn ended his 20-year exile Friday 
with an appeal to people across Russia to seize the initiative in directing 
their troubled country's post-Communist rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that I am coming to a Russia torn apart, discouraged, stunned, altered 
beyond recognition, convulsively searching for itself, for its true identity," 
the country's greatest living author told an evening homecoming rally in this 
Pacific port city, his starting point for a Trans-Siberian rail journey to 
rediscover his country and compatriots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like, after these meetings, to help you and search together with you 
for sure ways to get out of our 75-year quagmire," added Solzhenitsyn, who 
exposed his Soviet tormentors with powerful writings that earned him the Nobel 
Prize in 1970 -- and expulsion from his homeland Feb. 14, 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,000 people waited three hours on a gray, blustery evening in a seaside 
plaza for his dramatic return on an Air Alaska commercial flight from the 
United States. They applauded when his brief speech ended with the words, "I 
bow to you." 
</P>
<P>
 "We bow to you!" someone shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, answering a question from the audience, the author said that Russia's 
revival after seven decades of Soviet rule and two years of tumultuous, 
divisive and stalled democratic reforms would be "difficult, not soon," and 
would ultimately depend on Russians taking responsibility for their own fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been through other difficult times," he said, recalling the Time of 
Troubles in the 17th Century, when resistance from the hinterlands freed Moscow 
from Polish rule. "What great initiative we had then! 
</P>
<P>
 "In reality, our fate is in our hands, starting with every step of life . . . 
the little choices taken at the grass-roots level," he said, warming to the 
populist theme of his journey. "The turn life takes depends on us, not from the 
decisions bestowed on us from somewhere on high, somewhere in Moscow." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's true!" called another voice from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from his remarks and his ambitious travel plans, the bearded, 
craggy-faced author intends, at age 75, to play a guiding role in Russian life 
-- even though he has forsworn seeking elective or appointed office. His voice 
could provide a rallying cry for regional and local leaders seeking to wrest 
more autonomy from the central government of President Boris N. Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with Russia's Itar-Tass news agency, Solzhenitsyn was more 
categorical about his mission and blunter in his criticism of Moscow, which he 
said "is leading a privileged life compared with the provinces." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he was returning home east to west because "to begin with Moscow means 
to lock oneself in a concrete box." 
</P>
<P>
 "My literary task is fulfilled," he added. "Now I will have no time to write. 
It's time to get down to the hard work of rebuilding and reviving Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 Many who turned out to see Solzhenitsyn, such as Galina N. Petrovna, said they 
are ready to follow his prescriptions as those of a sage. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrovna, a graying, bright-eyed woman of 69, came to the square bedecked with 
Soviet medals earned for underground resistance in a Nazi prison camp. But she 
was a reluctant hero, having lost her father in the Stalin regime's political 
executions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been waiting for this moment all my life," she said at the rally for 
Solzhenitsyn. "Here is a great man who can show us how to rebuild our country. 
If we had worked like he does, by the call of our souls and hearts, we would 
live now in a different, much happier country." 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating the writer's long journey home in a front-page headline, the 
Moscow newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta declared, "Solzhenitsyn, like the sun, 
rises in the east." 
</P>
<P>
 The trip began Wednesday in an Oldsmobile station wagon, lumbering down the 
unpaved driveway from the hilltop country home in Cavendish, Vt., where 
Solzhenitsyn spent the last 18 years writing in near-seclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 With a newly issued Russian passport, the author flew to Anchorage, Alaska, 
with his wife, Natalia, and Stephan, 20, the youngest of their three sons. They 
left behind the middle son, Ignat, 21, and Natalia's mother, Yekaterina 
Svetlova, who will join them later. The eldest son, Yermolai, 23, flew here, 
5,700 miles from Moscow, ahead of his parents to help arrange the overland 
journey to the capital, which he called "the greatest road trip you could do." 
</P>
<P>
 Air Alaska's first touchdown in Russia came at Magadan, once a main receiving 
point for those destined for the Soviet gulag prison camp system. Solzhenitsyn, 
who spent eight years in the gulag and exposed its evils in his best-known 
works, once described Magadan as the site containing the most human bones on 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepping off the jet, Solzhenitsyn stooped, touched the tarmac with both hands 
and crossed himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, in the heat of political change, those millions of victims are too 
lightly forgotten, both by those who were not touched by that annihilation and 
even more so by those who were responsible for it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under ancient Christian tradition, land where innocent victims are buried 
becomes holy. We shall consider it so, in the hope that the light of Russia's 
coming recovery will reach (this) region." 
</P>
<P>
 Landing in Vladivostok, he accepted an offering of bread and salt -- a Russian 
symbol of hospitality -- and raised the loaf to his lips. 
</P>
<P>
 He also kissed Igor P. Lebedinets, the acting territorial governor, who 
postponed an official visit to South Korea to organize a welcome. The city's 
Russian Orthodox bishop was on hand to give his blessing. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the best people are leaving Russia, and Solzhenitsyn is the one coming 
back," said Antonina N. Detyareva, 39, who was selling dried squid and imported 
apples just off the puddled airport parking lot. "Maybe that will set a good 
example." 
</P>
<P>
 The writer returned a controversial figure, however, scorned by many who miss 
the old order and condemn him for helping destroy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll get no warm welcome from me," said Vladimir A. Gornoslal, 45, a taxi 
driver at the airport. "I don't like traitors." 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in the seaside square, the writer found it still dominated by a 
Stalinesque statue, four stories high, of a proletarian soldier-hero. "To those 
who struggled for Soviet power in the years 1917-1922," the caption reads. 
</P>
<P>
 But this raucous city of 700,000, closed to outsiders until 1992, is a leading 
arena of post-Soviet transformations, good and bad. Hundreds of joint ventures 
with Japanese, South Korean, Chinese and U.S. firms are under way. But crime 
and corruption are flourishing, and the gap between newly rich and newly 
impoverished is growing. City services are crumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Solzhenitsyn turned down offers by the local authorities to stay in more 
luxurious quarters and chose the Vladivostok, a $90-per-night hotel that, along

CLINTON REJECTS FOREIGN POLICY TEAM SHAKE-UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 President Clinton, concerned by a loss of public confidence in his leadership 
on foreign policy, said Friday that he has consulted widely but has rejected 
recommendations that he replace Secretary of State Warren Christopher and White 
House National Security Adviser Anthony Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials had told The Times that Clinton was considering a 
major shake-up of his foreign policy team by the end of the year. But Clinton, 
in a telephone interview late Friday, said that the root of the problem is 
communicating his foreign policy to the American people. And that, he said, is 
not the responsibility of Christopher or Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said that he has talked with "a huge number" of people about his 
foreign policy problems, perhaps more than 100, and that he could understand 
how some of them might have drawn an inference from the conversations that he 
planned to change his foreign policy team. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has come under criticism from some leading Democrats as well as 
Republicans for apparent inconsistencies in foreign policy. Most recently, he 
was faulted for his decision after weeks of semipublic deliberations to renew 
China's most-favored-nation trade status, despite the Beijing regime's failure 
to meet human rights conditions that he had set forth last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The President conceded Friday that he had made mistakes in the way he has 
articulated his foreign policy and that he needs to do a better job of that. 
But on most major policy issues, he said, he believes the Administration has 
been on sound footing. 
</P>
<P>
 His consultations inside and outside the Administration, he said, were about 
policy on Bosnia, Haiti and -- most recently -- on China's trade privileges in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The interview was hastily arranged by White House counselor David Gergen, who 
was concerned about comments that other senior Administration officials had 
made to The Times. At times, Clinton sounded frustrated by what he called the 
"relentless criticism" of his foreign policy. "I'm doing the best I can with 
some fairly intractable problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two senior Administration officials had said earlier that Christopher and Lake 
probably would be replaced by the end of this year or early in 1995. Several 
other officials in the State Department and National Security Council had said 
that they had no specific knowledge of plans to replace their bosses but that 
the expectation was spreading that either Christopher or Lake -- or both -- 
would be out of office by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a natural response, when you're taking a beating, to think about what 
you can change," one senior official said. "The political people look at the 
polls and say: 'Hey, we'd better do something about this.' And, since you can't 
discard the policies that you presumably are serious about, you shuffle people 
around instead." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has suffered a series of embarrassing setbacks in foreign policy from 
Somalia to Haiti and Bosnia -- problems that, in the public mind, have 
overshadowed his claims of success in Russia and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The President has publicly defended Lake and Christopher when they have come 
under fire in the past and aides in their offices said they believe that the 
President still has confidence in them. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent polls, however, have shown Americans losing confidence in the 
President's management of foreign affairs and Clinton's political aides are 
concerned that there may be an impact on his domestic policies and his 
reelection chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a Los Angeles Times poll showed that only 43% of Americans 
approved of Clinton's handling of foreign affairs. And last week, a Washington 
Post/ABC News poll showed only 40% approved, his lowest rating since the crisis 
in Somalia last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, Christopher and other aides have been pushing for a shift in 
emphasis by Clinton, who had sought to focus on domestic issues and minimize 
the time he devoted to foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 One official said that as a result of high-level discussions that have 
followed the release of some polls, Clinton agreed to devote more time and 
personal visibility to foreign policy leadership. An early reflection of that 
shift, he said, was Clinton's 90-minute appearance at a CNN foreign policy 
"town meeting" earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview Friday, Clinton said that the nation is "in a period of 
transition" in international relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got delicate negotiations in the Middle East right now," he said. "The 
secretary of state is involved in that and China and the last thing in the 
world I need to be doing is to be considering changing my team. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I need to be doing is considering changing whatever it is that is not 
inspiring people's confidence in me and, if we've made some mistakes, we need 
to fix it. That's what I'm working on." 
</P>
<P>
 If he does "a better job of communicating our foreign policy," Clinton said, 
Americans will be "much more understanding of what I'm trying to do and that 
will give me the flexibility I need." 
</P>
<P>
 Republican attacks on the President's foreign policy began almost as soon as 
Clinton took office and have intensified in recent weeks as he and his aides 
have reacted unevenly to problems in Bosnia, Haiti, North Korea and China. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Democrats in Congress increasingly have assailed Clinton on foreign 
policy. Last month, Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) warned: "If we dawdle, if we 
equivocate any longer and if this President doesn't stand up forthrightly and 
put some backbone behind our policy, then I don't see how we're ever going to 
stand for human rights and democracy anywhere else in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have spent months trying to strengthen the foreign 
policy apparatus with little evident success. 
</P>
<P>
 In both the State Department and the White House, aides speak of Christopher 
and Lake with affection and respect -- but sometimes go on to describe them as 
miscast in their present roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have worked "long and hard," said one senior official, suggesting that 
after two punishing years, they may be happy to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Another senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the 
Administration desperately needs a single, forceful spokesman on foreign 
policy. But Clinton has preferred to spend most of his time on domestic affairs 
and neither Christopher nor Lake has succeeded in taking control of the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher has proven a gifted negotiator and conciliator but an indifferent 
public spokesman and global strategist, the official said. And he has been 
overruled by White House officials on several issues, including his opposition 
to granting a U.S. visa to the leader of the Irish Republican Army's political 
arm, and his desire to pressure Greece over its blockade of neighboring 
Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, 68, has maintained a punishing schedule of world travel, and has 
appeared fatigued after some of his recent trips. One official said that the 
secretary's wife has complained privately that he is working too hard and has 
said she is eager to take him home to Los Angeles, where he was a leading 
lawyer before coming to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But Christopher has said that he is intent on seeing through his current 
effort to negotiate a peace agreement between Israel and Syria -- and has set 
an informal deadline for the peace talks of early next year. "He is pursuing 
programs and planning that will take him beyond a first (Clinton) term," one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the self-effacing Lake, 55, aides described him as tireless and 
brilliant but no bureaucratic guerrilla in the mold of Henry A. Kissinger or 
Zbigniew Brzezinski. "Poor Tony," one of his own aides said with a sigh 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem has been reflected in the fragmentation of authority over key 
foreign policy issues. Christopher takes the lead on Bosnia and the Middle 
East; Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott on Russia; Talbott and Lake's 
deputy, Samuel (Sandy) Berger on Haiti; Defense Secretary William J. Perry on 
Korea; the National Economic Council, chaired by Robert E. Rubin, on Japan and 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 Another result, officials said, has been rising tension among the State 
Department, the National Security Council staff and the Pentagon on the working 
level -- the kind of rivalry that Lake and Christopher, scarred by the 
internecine dogfights of the Jimmy Carter Administration, had promised to 
avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge facing Clinton's foreign policy team is to manage a dizzying 
array of international problems at a time when there is no clear consensus on a 
new, post-Cold War foreign policy, and to do it for a President who wants to 
spend his time on other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side, Clinton, Christopher and Talbott have managed a difficult 
relationship with Russia and the other former republics of the Soviet Union 
with considerable finesse. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a wave of nationalist feeling, Russia's President Boris N. Yeltsin has 
continued to cooperate with the West and is bringing his country into a new 
security partnership with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Ukraine has 
agreed to dismantle its share of the Soviet nuclear arsenal and has already 
deactivated the most dangerous nuclear missiles that were targeted on the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has succeeded in reorienting U.S. foreign policy toward promoting 
American economic interests abroad. He won ratification of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement and a compromise deal in world trade negotiations, despite 
significant pressure from within his own party. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Middle East, Christopher has played a key role in helping turn last 
year's Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement into real changes in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip and has patiently mediated between Israel and its most 
implacable enemy, Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 The setbacks, however, have been more visible. Many have revolved around the 
thorny issues of where and how to use U.S. military force in the post-Cold War 
world and how the United States can exert leadership when traditional allies 
are less inclined to accept a subordinate role. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign policy experts said that any President would find those problems 
difficult -- but Clinton, with little military experience and 
sometimes-conflicting policy goals, has stumbled painfully several times. 
</P>
<P>
 In Somalia, Clinton and his aides allowed U.N. and U.S. commanders to expand 
the mission of American forces to seek the capture of warlord Mohammed Farah 
Aidid without recognizing that they were being drawn into an urban guerrilla 
war. When Aidid's forces ambushed and killed 18 Americans last year, Clinton 
quickly announced that he was abandoning the fight and reining in all U.N. 
peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bosnia, Clinton and his aides sought to persuade U.S. allies in Europe to 
lift a U.N. arms embargo against the Bosnian government but failed. Since then, 
the Administration has tried to increase both military and political pressure 
on both sides to reach a settlement but with little evident success. 
</P>
<P>
 In Haiti, candidate Clinton sharply criticized the George Bush 
Administration's policy of returning Haitian refugees without a full hearing as 
"immoral." But once in office, he renewed that policy to avoid seeing thousands 
of Haitians set sail for Florida. He has tried to escalate economic and 
political pressure to force the island's military rulers out of power, again 
without much success.

THE TIMES POLL; MANY VOTERS UNDECIDED IN 6 STATEWIDE RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the campaigns for the June 7 primary entering the home stretch, an 
overwhelming number of California voters still have not made up their minds in 
six contested statewide offices, a Los Angeles Times poll has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Many voters probably will wait until the final days or until they reach the 
polls to make their selections in these contested races for lieutenant 
governor, insurance commissioner, treasurer, secretary of state, controller and 
state schools chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters remain undecided even though spirited campaigns for most of these 
offices are being mounted for the first time in years. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, The Times Poll found that the most clearly defined 
race is the nasty contest for state treasurer, in which state Sen. David A. 
Roberti (D-Van Nuys) holds a 40% to 26% edge among likely Democratic voters 
over Phil Angelides, a Sacramento developer and former state Democratic Party 
chairman. But even here, 34% are undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 The statewide survey was conducted from May 21 to Wednesday -- when Angelides 
was airing some of the strongest attack TV ads of the political season, linking 
Roberti to corruption in the Capitol and criticizing his anti-abortion stance. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll questioned 1,471 registered voters, including 326 likely Democratic 
voters and 268 likely Republican voters. The margin of error is 6 percentage 
points in either direction among likely Democratic voters and 7 percentage 
points among likely Republican voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the GOP race for lieutenant governor, among all registered Republicans, 
state Sen. Cathie Wright enjoys a 25% to 15% advantage over Assemblyman Stan 
Statham, a rural north state lawmaker. However, 60% of Republicans have not 
made up their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 The race tightens to a dead heat among those Republicans who say they will go 
to the polls, with both aspirants drawing 21%. Still, nearly six out of 10 
likely voters were undecided. The winner will face Controller Gray Davis, who 
has only token opposition in the Democratic primary to succeed retiring Lt. 
Gov. Leo T. McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the future of public education is hotly debated, the contest for 
state schools chief seems to have generated the least interest of all, with 
seven in 10 of likely voters undecided even when offered the names of five 
major candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among likely voters, the poll found no clear front-runner to succeed former 
Supt. of Public Instruction Bill Honig, who left the nonpartisan office after 
being convicted on conflict-of-interest charges. 
</P>
<P>
 But the top tier of candidates is bunched like this: Maureen DiMarco, Gov. 
Pete Wilson's education adviser, 9%; Joseph Carrabino, former state school 
board president, 7%; Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont), 6%; Wilbert 
Smith, a former Pasadena school board member, 5%, and Gloria Matta Tuchman, an 
Orange County elementary schoolteacher, 2%.  
</P>
<P>
 With such a high number of undecided voters, the gap between candidates is 
considered statistically insignificant, according to John Brennan, director of 
The Times Poll. This is the one statewide race in which voters of all parties 
can cast ballots for any candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin, with strong support among Democratic politicians, and other candidates 
are banking on a flurry of last-minute mailers and TV spots to boost their name 
identification enough to capture the primary contests. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Brennan, who supervised the statewide survey, said: "An ounce of added 
name recognition or a favorably received occupation label on the ballot can 
shift results one way or the other. So things could change a great deal between 
now and Election Day and many voters will probably not choose a candidate until 
they are actually in the voting booth." 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan noted that voters could be swayed by a variety of factors, including 
the way candidates are identified on the ballot. He said that as a policy The 
Times Poll does not provide respondents with a candidate's ballot designation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambitious politicians can turn these lesser statewide jobs into steppingstones 
to higher office the way Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. used the secretary of 
state's office 20 years ago as a platform to run for governor. Or, as usually 
happens, these obscure posts can turn into a ticket to political oblivion. 
</P>
<P>
 But the old political calculus about these jobs may be changing. 
</P>
<P>
 With politicians facing voter-imposed term limits, a large field of state 
legislators, such as Roberti, have jumped into races for statewide offices. 
</P>
<P>
 One obstacle they face is grabbing the attention of voters likely to be 
focused on the lively Democratic campaign for governor or the U.S. Senate 
primaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Another wild card for Democratic candidates is that women outnumber male 
voters. In 1992, 54% of those voting in the primary were women, according to a 
Times exit poll. But whether they will favor female candidates over men is 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Democratic race to succeed Davis as state controller, political unknown 
Kathleen Connell, a Los Angeles financial consultant, registers 23% among 
likely voters -- more than her two male rivals, Assemblyman Rusty Areias of San 
Jose and longtime Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata. Areias is favored by 
15% to Perata's 12%. Forty-nine percent are undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 Areias said "Connell gets a bump because she's a woman" running against two 
men. But Brennan said there is no evidence from the poll that Connell is 
particularly strong among women. 
</P>
<P>
 In the GOP fight for controller, even more voters are undecided. Of those who 
say they plan to go to the polls, 62% have not made up their minds. Of these 
likely voters, 26% favor former Assemblyman Tom McClintock, a strong 
conservative from Thousand Oaks, to 12% for John Morris, a Los Angeles investor 
in shopping centers and son of the founder of Mervyn's department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 One post that is up for grabs is that of insurance commissioner. The job is 
being vacated by Democrat John Garamendi, the state's first elected 
commissioner, who is seeking his party's nomination for governor after four 
years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Democratic side, veteran state Sen. Art Torres of Los Angeles holds a 
commanding advantage over his main rival, Assemblyman Burt Margolin of Los 
Angeles. Of those who say they plan to go to the polls, Torres captured 44% in 
the poll to Margolin's 14%. Forty-two percent said they were undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will square off against one of three Republicans vying for their 
party nomination. Among likely GOP voters, Assemblyman Charles Quackenbush is 
ahead with 18%, followed by Wes Bannister, the party's 1990 nominee, 11%, and 
Jim Conran, Wilson's former Department of Consumer Affairs director, 7%. 
Sixty-two percent of Republicans are undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for secretary of state, nearly half the likely Democratic primary 
voters say they are undecided. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the combatants, former Los Angeles City Councilman Michael Woo's 
support, at 29%, is more than double his closest rival, acting Secretary of 
State Tony Miller. Miller gets 13% of the likely voters, with Assemblywoman 
Gwen Moore of Los Angeles following at 10%. In the Republican primary, 
Assemblyman Bill Jones of Fresno is running unopposed. How the Poll Was 
Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,984 California adults, by telephone, from May 21 
through 25. The sample includes 1,471 registered voters, 662 of whom are 
Democrats and 542 Republicans. Of those groups, 326 are likely Democratic 
voters and 268 likely Republican voters. Telephone numbers were chosen from a 
list of all exchanges in the state. Random-digit dialing techniques were used 
so that listed and unlisted numbers could be contacted. Interviewing was 
conducted in English and Spanish. The sample is weighted slightly to conform 
with census figures for sex, race, age and education. The margin of sampling 
error for the total adult and registered voter samples is plus or minus 3 
percentage points. For all registered Democrats and Republicans it is 4 and 5 
points, respectively; for likely Democratic and Republicans voters it is 6 and 
7 points, respectively. For certain other subgroups the error margin will vary. 
Poll results can also be affected by other factors such as question wording and 
the order in which questions are presented.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CHINA KNEW U.S. POLITICAL BOTTOM LINE: MONEY TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONE TEMPEST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the end, China's success in overcoming human rights opposition to win 
renewal of trade privileges from the United States boiled down to one simple 
truth: The Chinese regime demonstrated a much better understanding of the 
American political system than the Clinton Administration did of the Chinese 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to Beijing's strategy was to divert attention from human rights issues 
by using the blinding lights of China's booming economy and huge potential 
market. By doing this, Chinese officials said, they successfully broadened the 
terms of the debate inside the United States. As a result, the Clinton 
Administration found itself fighting back on many fronts, often against some of 
its own most powerful citizens.  
</P>
<P>
 Time and again during the last year, the Chinese effectively called on U.S. 
big business to do most of the heavy lifting in carrying their case to the 
American public and President Clinton himself. Major league companies such as 
Boeing, AT&T, General Electric and United Technologies were more than happy to 
go to bat for the Chinese with their powerful public relations machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that a few huge companies had more at stake than in the past," 
said Anne Stevenson-Yang, Beijing director of the U.S. China Business Council. 
American executives, for example, lobbied hard for a last-minute meeting 
between Clinton and Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua in early May that was one 
of the turning points in the dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 When confronted with allegations of human rights abuses, the Chinese 
leadership coolly responded by changing the subject, citing the thousands of 
U.S. jobs that depend on Chinese orders for commercial aircraft and 
telecommunications equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 This approach was used in November when Chinese President Jiang Zemin held his 
first summit with Clinton during a Seattle visit. Jiang ostentatiously made a 
point of visiting the family of a Boeing worker. His Chinese staff noted for 
all who would listen that China buys one out of every seven Boeing aircraft 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 This effort continued right up until Clinton's news conference Thursday 
announcing renewal of China's most-favored-nation trading status -- the same 
rights that the United States grants all but a few pariah states. The same day, 
the Wall Street Journal reported that China is "within weeks" of finalizing an 
agreement to buy 50 new aircraft from Boeing, an order worth $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 On another front often very embarrassing to the Clinton Administration, the 
Beijing regime romanced U.S. allies with attractive business opportunities to 
accentuate the U.S. isolation on the human rights question. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, at the same time Clinton was in Seattle presenting Jiang with a 
list of human rights concerns, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl traveled to 
Beijing with German business leaders to sign $3.5 billion worth of contracts. 
This spring, French Prime Minister Edouard Balladur arrived in Beijing with a 
similar entourage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese government made the point abundantly clear: Only the United States 
put human rights conditions on trade. If the Clinton Administration kept 
insisting, China could take its business elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, during the year leading up to the Clinton decision, China hosted and 
feted hundreds of American political and business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 During all of 1992, for example, only 11 members of Congress -- eight 
representatives and three senators -- came to China. But between June, 1993, 
and May, 1994, Beijing was swarmed by 47 U.S. representatives and 14 senators. 
</P>
<P>
 The influx of American politicians was partly the result of the efforts of 
U.S. Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy, who encouraged Congress members to visit 
China and witness its development firsthand. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chinese were quick to welcome the visitors, spending thousands of 
dollars to feed them and show them the sights. As a result, they may have won a 
few extra votes for their cause. Many Congress members indicated that the bleak 
land of torture and abuse described in news reports appeared instead to be a 
land in the throes of rapid, healthy development. 
</P>
<P>
 By consistently outmaneuvering Clinton's Asia policy-makers, China was finally 
able to win the "de-linking" of human rights questions and trade relations, 
while making only a handful of mostly token concessions to the American side. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the prize they wanted most but had been unable to win from a hostile 
Democratic Congress during the George Bush Administration, despite President 
Bush's personal support for separating trade and human rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Several officials in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, architects of the 
Chinese strategy in the trade versus human rights debate, rose early Friday, 
China time, to watch Clinton's news conference live on the satellite CNN 
network. 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton pronounced the magic word de-link , the Chinese knew that their 
efforts had paid off. They listened contentedly as the American President used 
some of China's own arguments to justify his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining why the Chinese had not fully responded to American demands on 
human rights, for example, Clinton said that China was under great strain from 
tensions between its far-flung provinces and the central government. This is a 
common argument espoused by senior Communist Party leaders when they explain 
the need for measures to ensure "stability." 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowing another common Chinese argument, Clinton noted that Asian societies 
such as China have a more authoritarian tradition. He cited as an example the 
recent case of American teen-ager Michael Fay, sentenced to several strokes of 
a rattan cane for a vandalism charge in Singapore. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the Chinese did make concessions to the Americans, such as the 
release earlier this month of prominent dissidents Wang Juntao and Chen Ziming, 
they skillfully timed them to win maximum possible credit from the Clinton 
Administration, which in the later stages of the game was desperate for any 
such sign from the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 During the months leading up to Clinton's MFN decision, business delegations 
from the United States were welcomed in Beijing like heads of state by Chinese 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who came to China in March 
ostensibly to tie up the package on human rights, was given one of the 
frostiest receptions an American diplomat ever received in the Chinese capital. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department's special human rights envoy, Assistant Secretary of 
State John Shattuck, who came to China to prepare for the Christopher visit, 
was accused by authorities of breaking Chinese law because he met with 
prominent dissident Wei Jingsheng during the visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding insult to injury in the Shattuck episode, the Chinese authorities 
subsequently jailed Wei for allegedly telling Shattuck that China's 
most-favored-nation status should not be renewed unless improvements in the 
rights arena were made. Wei was still in jail when Clinton renewed the trading 
status Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 By ignoring the diplomats and concentrating on the business lobby, the Chinese 
gambled successfully, if somewhat cynically, that money talks louder than 
morality in the American political system. 
</P>
<P>
 When cornered on some tough points -- such as the thousands of political 
prisoners in Chinese jails and labor reform camps -- Beijing turned the tables 
on the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to U.S. objections to the export of goods made in Chinese prisons, 
for example, China commissioned a series of reports in respectable 
international publications documenting examples of American prison exports to 
other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a barrage of human rights allegations from the West, China responded 
that its first obligation to human rights is feeding and housing its people, 
something the United States so far has been unable to do with its enormous 
homeless population. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the Chinese adopted a strategy of aiming their diplomatic efforts 
directly at Clinton, while shunting aside his most prominent emissaries, even 
Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 Although American policy on the human rights-trade question was denounced in 
the Chinese press, Clinton himself was never personally attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, when the Chinese authorities released dissident Wang in May, they 
made it clear that it was because Clinton had requested the release on medical 
grounds. Wang suffers from hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
 Confident that it had already won the diplomatic matchup over human rights 
through its other efforts, particularly by marshaling U.S. business interests 
in its cause, China viewed the releases of dissidents Wang and Chen as a way of 
"giving face" to the young American President, still a neophyte in 
international affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 During his campaign for the presidency, Clinton repeatedly attacked Bush for 
"coddling dictators" in China. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, however, Clinton succeeded where Bush had failed -- removing 
human rights conditions from trade matters between the two countries.

25-CENT HIKE IN BUS FARES URGED; TRANSIT: CULMINATING HEATED DEBATE, MTA SEEKS 
TO END DISCOUNT PASSES AND CUT SERVICES, WHICH COULD TAKE EFFECT SEPT. 1. 
OFFICIALS FEAR THAT THE POOR WILL BE HIT THE HARDEST.

<P>
 In an effort to balance its budget, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority 
on Friday recommended raising bus fares for the first time in six years from 
$1.10 to $1.35, eliminating most discount passes and cutting service on some 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the MTA's 1.1 million daily bus riders would feel the impact of the 
proposed changes. For the first time, blind passengers would be asked to pay 
fares, and college students would be excluded from special rates. Senior 
citizens and disabled passengers would still be eligible for discount passes, 
although they would have to pay $2 more for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposition to the proposed fare increases, which must be approved by the MTA 
board of directors, was prompt and furious. City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg 
condemned the fare increase as "unconscionable" and predicted that many people, 
particularly minimum wage workers who stretch their budgets to pay for monthly 
passes, would no longer be able to ride the bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you will find people who will not be able to go to work," she said. 
"The result of that will probably be more pain and probably more disorder in 
the society." 
</P>
<P>
 For workers such as Mario Vazquez, the proposed fare increase means further 
scrimping. Vazquez sometimes takes four buses a day to commute from his home on 
the Eastside to job sites throughout the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe now I'll have to walk more," said Vazquez, 36, a day laborer from 
Mexico. "We rely on the buses. There's no alternatives for those of us who 
don't earn a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed fare increase is expected to reduce the number of bus riders 7%, 
or 75,000 passengers, primarily among the poor. Sixty-two percent of bus riders 
earn less than $15,000 a year, according to an MTA survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed changes, which could take effect as early as Sept. 1, come as the 
MTA is spending hundreds of millions to create a subway and rail system that 
offers quicker commutes for suburban workers but lacks the expansive reach of 
the region's buses. To encourage ridership, fares on the Metro Rail Red Line 
subway are only 25 cents -- and will not be affected by the fare increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rail has higher political visibility," said Tom Sovinec, 39, a city engineer 
who takes the bus to City Hall from his home in North Hollywood. "We need rail 
lines, but we need better bus service too. . . . Buses have been ignored 
somewhat." 
</P>
<P>
 The budget allows for continued construction of the Pasadena Blue Line trolley 
and the Green Line trolley, which will run between Norwalk and El Segundo. It 
allocates $752.3 million for rail construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials defended their actions, saying it is necessary to help eliminate 
a $126-million deficit in the agency's $2.9-billion budget for the coming 
fiscal year. They emphasized that the budget calls for belt-tightening 
throughout the entire agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "You either raise the fare to retain the service or you cut service," said 
Frank White, the agency's chief executive officer. "The reality is you cannot 
buy anything in 1994 for the price you paid in 1988 (when the fare was last 
increased)." 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA board will review the proposed budget at its June 22 meeting. The 
board could adopt it then, or decide to make changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal the following changes would take place: 
</P>
<P>
 * The standard fare for bus and rail lines will increase 25 cents from the 
current $1.10 fare. Transfers will remain 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Discount fare tokens will be available for $1. 
</P>
<P>
 * 50-cent zone surcharges will be started on express bus lines and the Blue 
Line trolley. The surcharge will also apply to the Green Line when it opens. 
</P>
<P>
 * Monthly passes, which cost $42 for unlimited use, will be eliminated, except 
for those for the elderly and schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials said eliminating monthly passes will lead to a more equitable 
fare system. About 100,000 passes are issued each month, which drives the 
average fare down to 55 cents. But low-income riders, often unable to afford 
$42 for the pass, pay the full $1.10 fare. In effect, the monthly passes have 
resulted in subsidizing more affluent riders, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposal seeks to provide equity to all persons using our services, and 
at the same time recognizes the economic needs of those most dependent on 
transit," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said there is a significant forgery problem involving monthly passes, 
and busy drivers are often unable to detect fakes. "The present way we use 
passes is as close to pouring money out the window as you can get," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 By raising the fares, the MTA is merely catching up with other major urban 
transit agencies, which have a fare base of $1.25, White said. The proposed 
fare increases would generate $51.4 million a year for the MTA, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners had originally suggested raising fares by a third, to $1.50. But bus 
riders and critics say even raising the price by 25 cents would create an 
enormous hardship for low-income riders, many of whom rely on buses as their 
only means of transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Alva Velasco worried how she would survive in an already costly city. Velasco 
takes Line 424 from Downtown to her $175-a-week job as a domestic worker in 
Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 "My salary isn't going up any," said Velasco, 30. "It's going to be difficult 
for me to make it." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, transportation officials raised bus fares from 50 cents to 85 cents. 
Three years later, fares were increased again to the current fare: $1.10. Those 
increases resulted in about a 20% drop in ridership, said MTA alternate board 
member Marv Holen. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, MTA officials say they expect a 7% decrease in ridership as a 
result of the fare increases as well as proposed cuts in service. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have recommended a 5% cut in service, which would represent a $21 
million savings for the agency. Of that, $5 million will be reallocated for use 
on inner-city bus lines, which have not yet been selected. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts involve the cancellation of three peak-hour express lines and two 
local routes. The lines to be reduced or cut are those that cost the most per 
rider. The express buses considered for cancellation are Line 443 (traveling 
between Union Station, North Torrance, Redondo Beach and Palos Verdes), Line 
445 (traveling between Union Station, West Torrance, Rolling Hills and Rancho 
Palos Verdes), and Line 457 (traveling between Los Angeles and the Long Beach 
Park-n-Ride Express). 
</P>
<P>
 The local service lines recommended for cancellation are Line 208 (Beachwood 
shuttle) and the Line 152 shuttle. Portions of Lines 94, 104, 225 and 320 are 
also under consideration for service reductions, as well as special lines such 
as the Dodger Stadium and racetrack service. 
</P>
<P>
 Several MTA board members predicted that the budget will be altered to provide 
a more politically palatable solution than cutting service and raising fares. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in favor of the increased fares," said county Supervisor Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke, an MTA board member. "I recognize that we have to just bite 
the bullet and make some cuts but I do want to look for alternatives to the 
kinds of fare increases they are talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a fare increase but one that is fair and balanced," said MTA 
alternate board member Nick Patsaouras. "But there is not equity here. Yes, bus 
riders have to carry their fair share of the burden but the burden is not being 
spread." 
</P>
<P>
 Others said the proposed budget was the agency's best solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank White's budget brings a dose of reality to the spendthrift policy of 
the past budgets," said county Supervisor Mike Antonovich, an MTA board member. 
"It really focuses on why the MTA needs to move ahead on innovations like 
monorail and privatization that will allow us to improve service, lower fares 
and reduce the bloated capital and operating expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 Some bus riders said a fare increase would not pose a hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think $1.35 is OK, as long as they don't raise it further," said Abel 
Rodriguez, 24, who lives on the Westside, riding a bus back from his job as a 
gas station attendant in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's a quarter?" asked Patrick Vick, a 61-year-old cook, as he waited for a 
bus in Koreatown. "The basic service here is superb. They do a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 But most bus riders interviewed Friday vigorously opposed the increase and 
worried that it would discourage potential passengers from using public 
transportation and make life harder for those already struggling. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybil Morrison rides the bus not from necessity but because she is worried 
about L.A.'s smog problem. She believes the raise is giving people like herself 
the wrong message. But Morrison is especially concerned about the low-income 
people she sees on the bus who are clearly unable to afford any other means of 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand why they would cancel the monthly passes for the working 
class," said Morrison, riding the bus on her way back to her home in Hancock 
Park after getting her hair done in Encino. "The working class are the ones 
that are going to be impacted by this the most. These people can barely afford 
to get to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Pablo Aguilar of Santa Monica rides the bus to Encino, where he works as a 
dishwasher in Maria's Italian Kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a car, so I have no choice but to ride the bus," said Aguilar, 
56, who planned on purchasing a monthly pass for June. "I only work about 30 
hours a week, so this will affect me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Miguel Bustillo, Henry Chu, Patrick McDonnell and Ted 
Rohrlich contributed to this story. On the Rise 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials want to increase the bus fare 
from $1.10 to $1.35, which would be the first increase in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 1980: 85 cents 
</P>
<P>
 1982*: 50 cents

BOYS OF BEDFORD: A TOWN RECALLS ITS D-DAY HEROES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long gone are the boys of Bedford, gone these 50 years, lost in the roiling 
English Channel and on the sands of Omaha, cut down by German pillboxes and 
artillery shells that blew men and machines and whole boats out of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone a half century now, these were the Gold Stars of Bedford, the young men 
who would never marry their sweethearts or raise families, who would not return 
to the farm, who would never gather Saturdays at Green's Drug Store and dazzle 
the younger boys with stories of heroism on D-day, June 6, 1944. 
</P>
<P>
 These men -- 19 sons of Bedford killed on D-day alone, the largest proportion 
of casualties for any community in the nation -- lie under great oak trees at 
the town cemetery and under white crosses on the fields of Normandy. For one of 
them, Raymond Hoback, all that was found was his Bible, tossing in the surf, 
scooped up by another soldier trudging onward into France. 
</P>
<P>
 John Wilkes would never again drive down Main Street in his tan station wagon 
with the wood siding, ferrying his buddies and their dates to picnics out on 
Smith Mountain Lake. Elaine Coffey and Bedford Hoback, engaged to be married 
after the war, would never move into their little farm home. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Stevens would not shake his brother's hand in France, and Earl Parker 
would never ever see his baby daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a high price for one small town. In 1944, Bedford had just 3,400 
residents, and only one taxi driver, one undertaker and one sheriff. It fell to 
them to deliver the telegrams, driving past the farm fields rich in summer 
grain, the hillsides covered with loblolly and hardwoods, the clay foothills at 
the break of the Blue Ridge Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 They went to the Deane home and the Schenk home and the Reynolds home, and 
stopped twice at the Hobacks; they lost two sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, their names are engraved in granite on a memorial on the lawn of the 
Bedford County Courthouse. The granite was carved out of a Vierville-sur-Mer 
cave where the men of Company A, 116th Infantry, the "blue and grey" 29th 
Division, landed on Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be a modest courthouse ceremony to mark the 50th anniversary, as 
there have been at other times, because even after all these years, the grief 
is still borne by their loved ones in this still small town of widows and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddest among them, perhaps, was Frank P. Draper Sr., so overcome with sorrow 
that he built a large stone monument atop his son's grave in Bedford. For Frank 
Jr., "Juney" as he called him, the father poured out his broken heart on that 
marble sarcophagus: 
</P>
<P>
 "We loved you Juney, dearly loved you, but God loved you best." 
</P>
<P>
 But even that did not cool the grief. One cold January day 20 years ago, Frank 
Sr. shot himself to death. He now lies buried next to the son he gave to 
France. 
</P>
<P>
 There had been happier times. Bedford back then was known by its motto, the 
"World's Best Little Town." 
</P>
<P>
 Local news that first week of June, 1944, was like most of small town America. 
County Home and Demonstration agents were giving poultry culling lessons. The 
school board was reorganizing. The Tobacco Growers Assn., big in this part of 
southwest Virginia, was planning a courthouse meeting later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 And 40 local businesses put out a full-page ad in the Bedford Democrat calling 
for readers to support the war effort and "Buy Your Invasion Bonds." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a day coming when the enemy will be licked, beaten, whipped to a 
fare-thee-well; every last vestige of fight knocked out of him," the ad 
proclaimed. "And there's a day coming when every mother's son of us will want 
to stand up and yell, to cheer ourselves hoarse over the greatest victory in 
history." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the day when Elizabeth Teass, working the Western Union machine at 
Green's Drug Store, was suddenly inundated with wires that began "The Secretary 
of War regrets to inform you. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 This was on a Sunday morning in July, six weeks after Bedford families were 
not only not getting any more letters from their soldiers fighting in Europe, 
but their own letters to the men were being sent back unopened. Something was 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "Green's used to be a happy drugstore," Teass said about the local hangout, a 
combination drugstore-diner. "It was a lively affair. Everybody was happy 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "But on this particular morning, Roanoke wired that they had casualties to 
give us and then they started coming. There was a crowd gathering around, and 
after the wires had been delivered it was affecting everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody now was coming down to the drugstore and when it was over, this was 
a calm, blue Bedford. This was a blue town. So many young men killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettie Wilkes learned from a passer-by downtown that her husband, John, who 
had dreamed of a military career, was killed. "Nothing has been the same since 
we lost all the men here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Viola Parker lost her husband, Earl, and did not know how she would ever tell 
their 16-month-old daughter. So distraught, she spent the rest of the day 
indoors, dusting and redusting the furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hoback home, where the family was dressing for Sunday services at the 
Center Point Methodist Church, the news came that Bedford Hoback was dead. Soon 
their home was filled with parishioners from the church across the road, 
offering comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, while the Hoback children were cranking home-made ice cream 
in the cellar for their grieving parents, they learned that another brother, 
Raymond, had also been killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some time later, Raymond's family Bible arrived in the mail, with a letter 
from Pvt. H.W. Crayton addressed from "Somewhere in France." Crayton had 
plucked the Bible out of the water, convinced that Raymond was alive and 
probably had just dropped it in the surf. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have by now received a letter from your son saying he is well," Crayton 
wrote. "I sincerely hope so." 
</P>
<P>
 So sure was he that Raymond was safe, Crayton went on to describe the success 
of the invasion and the "peaceful and quiet" Normandy beachfront now that the 
German guns had been silenced. 
</P>
<P>
 "The birds have begun their daily practice," he wrote, "all the flowers and 
trees are in bloom, and especially the poppies and tulips which are very 
beautiful at this time of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Bible, Raymond's body was never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just too much for us," recalled Lucille Hoback Boggess, a sister who 
was just 15 at the time. "My mother was never the same. She later suffered a 
stroke and lived another 10 years but she couldn't speak or remember anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took all of the joy out of our family. No more family picnics. No more 
family get-togethers. And my mother never forgave the Germans. Once a German 
missionary came to our church, and she wouldn't go see him. It was the first 
time she ever refused to go to church." 
</P>
<P>
 The local newspaper eulogized the dead. In printing their names under the 
headline "These Bedford Men Will Not Return," the Democrat said: 
</P>
<P>
 "The names of sons of neighbors living next door or on the adjoining farm may 
be found in this list. Or there may be the names of boys who sat next to some 
of the readers at school or lads who sold groceries over the counter at a local 
store." 
</P>
<P>
 They were among 197 men in the company assault group on D-day. In all, 30 of 
them were from Bedford. They were assigned to several landing craft and then 
launched across the English Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Stevens, now 74, remembers speaking with his twin brother, Ray, before 
splitting up on the landing boats. They talked about home and Ray was shaking 
and he seemed convinced he wouldn't make it. Ray suggested they shake hands 
goodby. "No," Roy told him. "We'll shake hands in France." 
</P>
<P>
 Some days later, Roy was walking through a makeshift graveyard near the beach 
when he stumbled across his brother's dog tags nailed to one of the crosses. "I 
saw several Bedford boys buried up there," he said. "None of them made it." 
</P>
<P>
 He also remembers Earl Parker staring at his little girl's photograph the 
night before D-day, and his misgivings about the invasion. "If I could only see 
my baby daughter, I wouldn't mind dying," Parker told his buddies. He too 
perished on Normandy. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Taylor N. Fellers, before the war a state highway foreman in Bedford, 
skipped out of an Army hospital to make the landing. He had earlier written 
home about his men: "I'm beginning to think it's hard to beat a Bedford boy as 
a soldier." 
</P>
<P>
 At the beach, Fellers and his boat crew were hit by an artillery shell that, 
to Bob Slaughter, a soldier from nearby Roanoke, "looked like it made Capt. 
Fellers just evaporate into thin air." 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Nance, one of the few who did return to Bedford, can still see John 
Reynolds running ahead of him up the beach. "He went down on his knees, and he 
brought his rifle up as if he were searching for something, and then he fell 
forward. He was dead." 
</P>
<P>
 He can still hear J.D. Clifton screaming into his pack radio near the cliffs. 
"Suddenly he yelled that he'd been hit and he died." And he can see John Wilkes 
and John Schenk taking heavy sniper fire near their boats, cut down at the 
waterline. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," Nance said, "us Bedford boys, we competed to be in the first wave. 
We wanted to be there. We wanted to be the first on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got our wish."

MIDEAST; PHONE TAPS TAKE IN ISRAELI WHO'S WHO; TWO PRIVATE EYES ARE CHARGED 
WITH LISTENING IN ON HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE'S CELLULAR CALLS. THE INCIDENT IS 
VIEWED AS A WARNING TO A SECURITY-CONSCIOUS COUNTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 What do Israeli President Ezer Weizman, Tel Aviv Mayor Ronni Milo, the editors 
and publishers of the country's best-selling newspapers, two bank managers, the 
manager of the Maccabees soccer team, several big building contractors and the 
owner of high-fashion clothing stores have in common? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is that they were all on a list of 231 Israelis -- many politically 
prominent, some financially powerful but a few relatively obscure -- whose 
cellular telephones are said to have been methodically tapped for eight months 
by two Tel Aviv private investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real riddle -- why? -- so far has no answer. 
</P>
<P>
 The two investigators, arrested in April and facing charges of illegal 
wiretapping, are refusing to tell police who hired them or what they overheard. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafi Friedan, one of the investigators, initially told police that he had been 
asked "to gather data" and that he was confident that his clients' reasons were 
"personal and family related," according to court records. But Friedan has said 
nothing further, on his lawyers' advice. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of those whose calls were regularly monitored, according to 
preliminary evidence given Tel Aviv courts, is a veritable Who's Who of 
Israel's movers and shakers -- and a warning to a security-conscious country of 
the risks many of its leaders are running in unguarded conversations on their 
always-in-use cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police have found records of some conversations of some of our people 
that are, well, rather embarrassing in their content," a senior Israeli 
official commented, asking not to be quoted by name. "Things were said that 
should not have been said on open lines, and then things were said that were 
professionally indiscreet. 
</P>
<P>
 "During World War II, Americans had a saying, 'Zip a lip and save a ship,' and 
we had better think the same way. People have gotten very, very casual in their 
use of their (cellular phones). If two guys in a Tel Aviv office building can 
listen to all that they did, just imagine what a real intelligence service is 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the phones that were monitored, according to police, were some belonging 
to the Israeli Defense Ministry, senior officials of the country's security 
services, two members of the opposition Likud Party, the state comptroller and 
the director of an airline used by the government for charter flights. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also Weizman, top executives of the country's two television 
stations, a number of lawyers, the agency that administers the Jewish Quarter 
of Jerusalem's Old City, an insurance company, staff members from the 
newspapers Yediot Aharonot, Maariv and Haaretz -- and 10 other private 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, more than 400 different cellular telephones may have been 
monitored from August until the men's arrest last month, according to 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedan and Yaakov Tsur, his partner in Agam Security Consultants, were held 
for three weeks and are now under house arrest. If convicted under Israel's 
laws prohibiting wiretapping, they would face sentences of three years for each 
conversation they monitored. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police do not believe the two monitored all conversations, they have 
had very limited success in determining which calls they did record and no luck 
in finding out what they did with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their clients did not exactly pay with company checks," one police detective 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors theorize the monitoring operation may have grown out of the bitter 
rivalry between Yediot Aharonot and Maariv, which have been engaged in a 
long-running circulation war. But they are at a loss to explain how it came to 
encompass such high-ranking officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedan, a former undercover policeman, and Tsur listened to the conversations 
with a monitor that continually scanned the radio frequencies used by cellular 
phones for calls made to and from specified numbers, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 They had rented the $200,000 monitor from its Israeli manufacturer, ECI 
Telecom, for "experimentation purposes" prior to its sale to foreign security 
services and police departments. Friedan and Tsur pledged in their contract 
with ECI to listen only to their own telephones and those of ECI. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedan has a reputation as a "tapping contractor," working for a number of 
clients and taking on cases from other private investigators, and police and 
prosecutors have suggested that ECI knew what use he would make of its 
monitoring equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even wiretapping for experimental purposes requires permission," prosecutor 
Rafi Levy told a Tel Aviv court this week, "and they did not get it."

EUROPE; SCANDAL WILTS CONFIDENCE IN LONDON FLOWER SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since 1888, the Chelsea Flower Show has been the most genteel of British 
institutions: a magnificent display of flowers, shrubs, exotic plants and 
everything else imaginable for a garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Royal Horticultural Society, the show attracts hundreds of 
exhibitors and tens of thousands of dedicated visitors to the grounds of the 
Royal Hospital in London's Chelsea for five days in May. 
</P>
<P>
 There they view orchids, violets, begonias, delphiniums, roses, azaleas, 
freesias, daffodils, lupins, clematises and dozens more in elaborate displays. 
</P>
<P>
 After visits by Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the Royal Family, 
highly prized gold medals are awarded to those exhibitors with the most 
attractive displays from nurseries across Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year -- horror of horrors! -- a scandal has rocked the flower show 
and dealt a blow to a great British tradition: It has been revealed that many 
of the exhibitors have shown flower displays not from their own gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, many of the flowers came directly from London's huge Covent Garden 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
 Worst of all, many of the flowers came from abroad -- from Holland! 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure caused an uproar this week, shocking the thousands of innocent 
visitors who assume the flowers are grown in the green fields of England. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently the practice of "buying-in," or purchasing flowers from outside 
sources for exhibition, has been going on for years with the knowledge of the 
Royal Horticultural Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers regarded the revelations as evidence marking the decline of 
another bastion of gentility. The Chelsea Flower Show, the world's largest, is 
the highlight of the year for lovers of Britain's favorite outdoor pastime -- 
gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 As one mourner noted, "First it was our disastrous cricket season. Then the 
BBC went on strike for a day. Now the flower show. What next?" 
</P>
<P>
 John Metcalf of the Four Seasons nurseries in Norwich, who displays only 
blooms he himself has grown and was awarded a silver medal, was angered by the 
buying-in and called for a ban on exhibitors displaying other people's plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like an athlete in the Olympics letting someone else run their race," he 
said, "and then going on to collect the medal." 
</P>
<P>
 More than a quarter of the 51 exhibitors who won gold medals admitted 
buying-in some of their stock. Many of the flowers displayed came from the 
"glass house" area of the Netherlands, which year-round grows lilies, 
chrysanthemums, freesias and peonies for wholesalers in Britain. Those 
wholesalers sell to Covent Garden companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chelsea organizers maintain that they have no way to monitor where blooms 
are grown, so they have not prohibited buying-in but simply asked exhibitors to 
note whether they originated their own flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, organizers argue, medals are awarded for showmanship and the artistry 
and quality of a display. 
</P>
<P>
 That explanation has been lost on many. 
</P>
<P>
 "When someone shows a product they have not grown without making it clear, 
they are cheating," one flower lover said. "It is not right. I am surprised 
they allow it at Chelsea."

FLORIDA MAN CHARGED WITH KILLING TWO; CRIME: ONE VICTIM IS FOUR MONTHS 
PREGNANT; A THIRD PERSON IS WOUNDED BEFORE PISTOL JAMS. THE 68-YEAR-OLD SUSPECT 
WAS INVOLVED IN A LAWSUIT. 
</P>

<P>
 A man involved in a lawsuit opened fire in a court reporter's office Friday, 
killing a pregnant lawyer and a man giving a deposition before the 15-shot 
pistol jammed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting suspect was identified as Julio Mora. He was chased down and held 
for authorities by the owner of the court-reporting firm where the shooting 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Mora, whose 68th birthday was Friday, was charged with two counts of 
first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder for wounding a third 
person. 
</P>
<P>
 State law also allows murder charges to be filed in the death of a fetus, but 
prosecutors had not decided whether to do that, a police spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the victims as lawyer Karen Marx, 30, of West Palm Beach, 
who was four months pregnant, and Clarence Rudolph, 56. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice Hall, 44, a lawyer and retired judge from West Palm Beach, was wounded 
in the abdomen. He was listed in critical condition after surgery at Broward 
General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred in a sixth-floor office where Rudolph was giving a 
deposition in a civil case that involved Mora, authorities said. Also in the 
office were the two lawyers -- Marx and Hall -- and a court reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifteen minutes into the deposition the gentleman pulled out a gun," said 
Bret Tannenbaum, owner of Coastal Reporting Services. "He fired six shots, two 
into each person. The gentleman's gun jammed. He ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a pre-planned thing," Tannenbaum said. "(Mora) said some pretty 
weird things yesterday." 
</P>
<P>
 He refused to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mora had filed a lawsuit against the American Assn. of Retired Persons over a 
senior job placement program. He was acting as his own lawyer and had scheduled 
the deposition, police spokeswoman Sonya Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Mora had been laid off from the association about a year ago. Rudolph 
ran the program at the time of Mora's employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tannenbaum said he heard six shots and went after the gunman, thinking the gun 
was empty. "The police told me later that the seventh shot had jammed and it 
was a 15-round automatic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tannenbaum said that Mora, who limps and uses a cane, tried to make it to an 
elevator. But he said he chased Mora, knocked him down and held him. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same building, divorce lawyer Eric Golden was shot to death on Feb. 19, 
1987, as he stepped off an elevator outside his sixth-floor office. A retiree 
was charged with killing Golden, who represented the man's ex-wife.

ALASKA OPENS PARK PAID FOR BY EXXON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alaska has a new 42,000-acre state park, paid for with $38.7 million from the 
Exxon Valdez oil spill settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Afognak Island State Park came into existence Thursday when Gov. Walter J. 
Hickel signed legislation at a reception in Kodiak. 
</P>
<P>
 The new park sits on an island north of Kodiak Island in the Gulf of Alaska. 
It includes prime habitat for animals harmed by the 1989 spill, including bald 
eagles, marbled murrelets, harbor seals and sea otters. It was purchased from 
the Seal Bay Timber Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "Habitat is protected for the birds, sea mammals and spawning salmon, yet we 
still allow the traditional activities Alaskans have enjoyed in the area," 
Hickel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Logging will be prohibited in the park, but hunting, fishing, trapping and 
recreation activities will be allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The tanker Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of oil when it struck a 
reef in Prince William Sound in 1989, creating the nation's worst oil spill.

POPE ENDS 4-WEEK STAY IN HOSPITAL FOR LEG INJURY; RECOVERY: HE IS URGED TO 
REDUCE HECTIC SCHEDULE. VATICAN SAYS HE WILL STILL RECEIVE PRESIDENT CLINTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Having battled his doctors to an amicable draw, Pope John Paul II left the 
hospital Friday to return to the Vatican and a dramatically changed papacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The 74-year-old Pope, who will be forced to modify his hectic lifestyle, left 
Rome's Gemelli Hospital four weeks after surgery to repair a thighbone broken 
in a bathroom fall at his Vatican apartment. He walked without a cane the few 
steps from the hospital doorway to a waiting limousine. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul intends to make a Sunday morning appearance to pilgrims from a 
window overlooking St. Peter's Square and will receive a visiting President 
Clinton as scheduled Thursday, the Vatican said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may lean on a cane or against a table, but the Holy Father will certainly 
be standing to greet the President," papal spokesman Joaquin Navarro said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors, who say they are pleased with John Paul's progress, originally 
estimated that he would remain two to three weeks under hospital care. They 
would have released him last week, they say, except that he insisted on 
returning to the Vatican instead of to Castel Gandolfo, the papal summer 
residence south of Rome where therapy could have included swimming and garden 
walks. 
</P>
<P>
 As the price for returning directly to a hectic and more restrictive Vatican 
life, the Pope agreed to remain longer in the hospital, Navarro said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some say the broken leg is not all bad because it forces the Pope to take 
time to rest; he works too hard," said a European bishop at the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Cardinal Bernard Law was with another cardinal and three bishops who 
traveled to Gemelli on Friday to present John Paul with a copy of the 
long-delayed English edition of their church's new catechism. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in a better state than I would have expected after such a long 
hospitalization. He was himself," Law said. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking thin but fit and obviously in high spirits, John Paul used an aluminum 
walker to leave his hospital room. He stopped along the way to chat for 20 
minutes with children being treated for tumors. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have treated me very well, and I thank you very much," John Paul told 
doctors as he left, "but don't expect to see me back here soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, John Paul has shown a remarkable ability to snap back from 
medical emergencies ranging from a gunshot wound to a colon tumor to a broken 
collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
 The leg injury, however, marked his second fall and second broken bone in five 
months. It sparked concern about the Pope's increasing frailty -- and 
speculation about a successor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must pray for the Holy Father. We can see his energies draining away as he 
tries to do more and more," one cardinal was heard to observe after Easter 
Mass, three weeks before John Paul's latest fall. 
</P>
<P>
 While he was in the hospital, the Vatican denied a report in Spanish 
newspapers that the pontiff, whose left hand shakes, is suffering from 
Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Vatican administration, largely on hold in the Pope's absence, resumes next 
week with the publication of a letter Monday reaffirming a ban on female 
priests. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hospital stay has put the papal schedule badly out of sync. An unusual 
meeting of all the church's cardinals was canceled this month; rescheduled for 
June, the conference is to discuss the state of the Roman Catholic Church and 
its policies as it enters a third millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinals are not only the Pope's closest advisers but also the electors of 
his successor. It was widely expected that John Paul planned to fill about 20 
vacancies among the 120 papal electors in the College of Cardinals by naming 
new cardinals this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Vatican sources said Friday, however, that the announcement would not come 
until December or early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 History's most traveled Pope missed scheduled trips to Sicily and Belgium 
while he was in the hospital, and the rest of what was to have been an 
ambitious year of travels is now in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Vatican sources say John Paul will probably attempt at least an abbreviated 
visit to the United States in October, where he is to address the United 
Nations. But an Africa trip in September seems out of the question, and an 
Asian visit scheduled for January is in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro said John Paul would continue therapy at the Vatican. Sources said he 
will probably go to Castel Gandolfo in mid-June. 
</P>
<P>
 John Paul's right leg, which now includes artificial parts, will recover 
completely, doctors say, but never enough to allow him to ski -- one of his 
favorite sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro said, however, that John Paul intends to return once again to the 
Italian Alps in July for a week of walking that is typically the most relaxed 
time of the papal year.

HEALTH OFFICIALS SEEK TO EASE VIRUS PANIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior British health officials sought Friday to play down the widely 
circulated press reports that a deadly bacteria is threatening the population. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public should be reassured there is no killer bug sweeping the country," 
said Dr. Diana Walford, director of the Public Health Laboratory Service, 
attacking the barrage of publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 She said there have been 15 cases of the disease, called necrotising 
fasciitis, since Jan. 1 -- a rate of occurrence that she said is not out of the 
ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 News that the disease was breaking out in parts of Gloucestershire in western 
England surfaced last weekend, and the British tabloid press painted horrifying 
visions of a virus that can devour human flesh in a matter of hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "Curse of the Killer Bacteria," bannered the Sun, Britain's largest-selling 
daily, and "Flesh Bug Ate My Brother in 18 Hours." 
</P>
<P>
 "I Watched Killer Bug Eat My Body," read another tabloid's headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more sedate papers, such as the Times of London, reported: "Bacteria That 
Eat the Flesh" and "Flesh-Eater on the Move." 
</P>
<P>
 Walford said press reports give the impression that the 15 cases -- 11 of 
which resulted in death -- all occurred in a sudden epidemic, instead of over 
the last five months. 
</P>
<P>
 She stressed that necrotising fasciitis, a virulent form of the streptococcus 
bacteria, "remains a rare disease." 
</P>
<P>
 The British scare has generated worldwide concern, with governments from 
Austria to New Zealand checking the incidence of infection. In Norway, the 
disease has killed 25 people so far this year, the country's National Institute 
of Public Health said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials estimated that up to 450 Americans may have died each year from 
1989 to 1991 from the infection, according to the World Health Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 British Health Secretary Virginia Bottomley appealed for calm, insisting that 
everything possible is being done to fight the bug. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no evidence that the numbers we are seeing are untoward," Bottomley 
said. "It is important not to get it out of proportion. This is a situation 
where everything that can be done has been done." 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials did acknowledge that the disease could be horrifying to 
those who contract it. The infection attacks the fleshy parts of the body, 
eating it away like gangrene. In the worst cases, death can occur within hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel enormously for anyone who has a member of the family involved," 
Bottomley said, "but I don't want every family in the country to be panicked." 
</P>
<P>
 The tabloid press sent reporters to find victims and their relatives, and 
recounted their stories in lurid tales that invoked images of an outer-space 
invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Financial Times suggested: "Mutant flesh-eating super-bugs, capable of 
killing a healthy adult within hours, are rampaging their way through Britain. 
Or, to put it another way, the media is indulging in one of its periodic 
frenzies of terrifying the public with a medical horror story." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Christopher Barlett, director of the Communicable Disease Surveillance 
Center, said, "Public anxiety should be allayed by the fact that we have 
examined all indicators of streptococcal infection in the country and these are 
demonstrating no change in either numbers or patterns of infection.

SPECIAL ADVISER UPBEAT ON HAITI POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The special U.S. adviser on Haiti gave an upbeat account Friday of recent 
policy changes toward that country, asserting that refugee problems are nearing 
a solution and expressing hope that tightened sanctions will restore democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 William H. Gray III, appointed special adviser by President Clinton three 
weeks ago, rejected criticism that the policy of trying to force the surrender 
of the Haitian military through sanctions is doomed to fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Appealing for patience, Gray noted that "mandatory, total sanctions" approved 
by the U.N. Security Council went into effect only last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to make a distinction between the new sanctions and the old 
sanctions," Gray said, meeting with reporters for the first time since assuming 
his new duties. 
</P>
<P>
 His comments came against a background of growing skepticism about the 
efficiency of sanctions in bringing down the military and growing concern about 
delays in implementing the newly liberalized policy on dealing with refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 8, the same day Gray was appointed, Clinton announced that he was 
abandoning his policy of forced repatriation of all refugees. The new policy 
calls for allowing refugees to make a claim for political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the Clinton Administration has chartered vessels as potential 
interview sites, while U.S. officials have been searching the Caribbean in 
search of countries willing to allow their territory to be used for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray, who just returned from the Dominican Republic where he had met with 
President Joaquin Balaguer, was optimistic about enlisting Balaguer's 
cooperation in ending the cross-border seepage of oil and other goods into 
Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very clear that he understood that this was not a voluntary situation 
but that it was the entire world community, including the Western Hemisphere of 
nations, that were saying this must be done," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the United Nations agreed to send planes, helicopters and 
motorboats to the Dominican Republic to help enforce the embargo, the Dominican 
military chief said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Constantino Matos Villanueva also ordered more of his troops to the 
border to shore up enforcement of the embargo, according to a military 
statement issued late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate development, members of the disbanded Tontons Macoutes militia 
returned to Haiti's political stage Friday, formally reorganizing to join 
Haiti's army against possible foreign attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebirth of the Macoutes dramatically illustrates the rise of 
anti-democratic elements in Haiti since the army overthrew elected President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding up a portrait of former dictator Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier, a 
Macoutes spokeswoman declared that the militia members "already occupy the four 
corners of the country. Now we are in readiness." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here to tell the army it is not alone," said Bertha Desait, cheered by 
100 Macoutes surrounding her in a downtown Port-au-Prince office.

 Union President Ottiwell Simmons said 3,000 workers from all 19 of the 
island's major hotels would be on strike until their demands are met. The union 
represents all non-government unionized employees in Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the hotels were reported to be fully booked, mostly with tourists from 
the United States. An estimated 3,000 to 4,000 tourists were affected by the 
walkout.

RWANDA LEADER MET DEATH NEAR HIS HOUSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An empty champagne bottle lies in the yard and the smell of death lingers in 
Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana's home, where he died seven weeks ago 
when his plane crashed and plowed into his own back garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels have looted the president's bar of alcohol and taken most of his 
clothes. But the house is still packed with family belongings, documents and 
mementos of 17 years as supreme ruler, until faltering moves toward pluralism 
began in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 His plane was reportedly hit by a rocket as it approached Kigali on April 6, 
unleashing an orgy of slaughter that aid officials estimate has killed at least 
200,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels who inspected the crash site just southeast of 
the airport Thursday with U.N. officers jeer at the twist of fate that killed 
him so near home. 
</P>
<P>
 Government troops had denied U.N. investigators access to the crash site for 
weeks, but the area fell under rebel control when they seized the airport and a 
nearby military barracks last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane slammed into a banana grove, losing its wings and tail before 
punching a 25-foot hole in the garden wall and coming to rest on the edge of a 
pond. 
</P>
<P>
 The leading edge of the right wing appeared to have been hit from below by a 
projectile. U.N. officers said they were assembling a team to investigate the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-declared government that took power after the president's death says it 
recovered the "black box" flight recorder but was too busy to send it abroad 
for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 It blames the rocket attack on the Rwandan Patriotic Front, which denies it. 
</P>
<P>
 An aircraft seat lay at the bottom of the empty pond in the grounds of the 
three-story luxury house, one of several presidential residences in Kigali and 
not Habyarimana's principal palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Habyarimana's wife, Agathe, and his family were staying there when 
his plane narrowly missed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Since capturing the area, rebels have partially looted the house but said the 
president's wife removed most recent official papers before fleeing to Paris as 
the civil war resumed.

SHARON DECLARES CANDIDACY FOR RABIN'S JOB -- TO 'RESCUE' ISRAEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ariel Sharon, Israel's hawkish former defense minister, launched a campaign 
Friday to oust Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in the 1996 elections, declaring 
his intention to form a broad right-wing coalition and lead "a rescue mission 
to save the Land of Israel and the Jewish people." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sharon's announcement was more a challenge to Benjamin Netanyahu, chairman 
of the opposition Likud Party, who has been feuding with Sharon. 
</P>
<P>
 Netanyahu angrily demanded Sharon's expulsion from the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arik Sharon is a permanent subversive," he declared. "The time has come for 
such a man to leave Likud." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon laughed off Netanyahu's demand, replying, "I hope Mr. Netanyahu will at 
least permit me to stay in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, defeated by Rabin two years ago, tartly 
rebuked Sharon, saying he "should find more useful things to do in the national 
interest than undermine it." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeev (Benny) Begin, the son of the late Prime Minister Menachem Begin and a 
longtime Sharon foe, said that the burly former general is as likely to win the 
premiership as he is the world tennis championship. 
</P>
<P>
 And some members of Rabin's Labor Party, noting the deep divisions in Israel's 
right wing -- Tsomet Party leader Rafael Eitan has also declared his candidacy 
-- wondered aloud whether the prime minister might not benefit by calling early 
national elections. 
</P>
<P>
 An opinion survey last week for the newspaper Yediot Aharonot showed Rabin to 
be Israelis' preferred leader, winning support from 36% of those questioned. 
Netanyahu followed with 19%, Sharon with 12% and Eitan with 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 Netanyahu has maintained that if the right unites, it could defeat Labor, oust 
Rabin and return to the Likud's concept of Palestinian autonomy in the West 
Bank and the Gaza Strip under Israeli sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sharon undermined both Begin and Shamir, and now he is undermining me," 
Netanyahu said. "He spreads the seeds of a split." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a change in Israel's political system, the next prime minister will be 
elected directly by popular vote and must win 50% of the vote, on a second 
ballot if not the first. In the past, the party that won the most seats in 
Parliament nominated the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon, 66, a retired general, is a fierce opponent of the government's peace 
talks with the Palestinians and believes that any withdrawal from the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip will endanger Israel's security and even its existence.

CHINA SEES BOOST FOR TRADE IN U.S. MOVE; REACTION: BEIJING EXPRESSES RESTRAINED 
SATISFACTION AT CLINTON'S DECISION. OTHER ASIAN LEADERS ALSO WELCOME POLICY 
SHIFT. 
</P>

 Chinese officials reacted with restrained satisfaction Friday to President 
Clinton's announcement that the United States will renew its favorable trade 
terms with China -- and, more important, "de-link" trade from human rights 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "This decision will create favorable conditions for the further strengthening 
and expansion of trade and economic cooperation between the two sides," 
government spokesman Wu Jianmin announced at a news conference. "The Chinese 
government and people welcome this decision of President Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 China had sought the removal of human rights conditions during a year of hard 
lobbying and diplomatic efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, a subdued Clinton granted the Chinese precisely what they wanted: 
the restoration of most-favored-nation trade status and the reversal of a U.S. 
policy linking MFN to human rights -- a policy that has haunted Sino-American 
relations for the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chinese held back from overt celebration over the diplomatic victory 
because Clinton also ordered a ban on the $100-million-a-year import of weapons 
and ammunition, and kept in effect some sanctions established by the George 
Bush Administration after the army crackdown on protesters in Tian An Men 
Square in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In what amounted to the only joke of the day, spokesman Wu said he heard about 
Clinton's decision by listening to the Voice of America. One of the conditions 
set by the Clinton Administration was that the Chinese stop jamming VOA 
broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hong Kong, Shanghai and Beijing, American residents and business people, 
many of whom fought strenuously for renewal of MFN, lauded Clinton's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, I think we can say we won," Frank Martin, the president of the U.S. 
Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, told the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Carmichael, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing, 
said at a news conference that he was relieved that he would now have more time 
to spend on his business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means I won't have to spend one-third to one-half of my time each year 
trying to get MFN renewed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Asian governments also welcomed Clinton's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the start, we had maintained that there should be no connection between 
trade and human rights issues," Malaysia's deputy prime minister, Anwar 
Ibrahim, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata said renewal of China's trading benefits 
is very important for the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers said Clinton's about-face could have a severe impact on U.S. 
prestige. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could call it the Clinton Administration's declaration of defeat," Koji 
Igarashi, Washington correspondent for the influential Asahi newspaper, wrote 
in its evening edition Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a 180-degree change in direction from policy up until now and leaves 
the strong impression that (Clinton) gave in completely to China's demands." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, however, White House officials made an apparent effort to show 
how hard Clinton worked to try to achieve human rights progress in China. The 
officials disclosed that a Cabinet-level meeting in April led to a plan to send 
Michael H. Armacost, former U.S. ambassador to Japan, to China as a private 
emissary. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of President Richard Nixon's funeral in Yorba Linda in April, 
three top Administration officials met with Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua in 
a private room of the Nixon Library to tell of him of the emissary's plan to 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, the feeling was that an additional channel was needed," one senior 
Administration official said Friday.

33 CAR THIEVES EXECUTED IN S. CHINA PROVINCE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Courts across southern China's Guangdong province ordered 33 car thieves 
executed Friday as part of a campaign against car theft, according to an 
official newspaper seen today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yangcheng Evening News said courts in 14 towns and cities held mass 
sentencing rallies for 101 people accused of car theft and that 33 were 
immediately executed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Car theft is steadily increasing within Guangdong province," the newspaper 
quoted court officials as saying. "In 1993 alone, it accounted for one-third of 
the major criminal incidents recorded in the province."

HUMAN RIGHTS STILL A CENTRAL ELEMENT, U.S. OFFICIALS SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration said Friday that promoting human rights will remain 
a central element in U.S. policy toward China even though the issue is no 
longer linked with trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have focused a brighter spotlight on human rights practices in China. That 
scrutiny will continue, and our human rights dialogue with China will 
intensify," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks were part of an effort by the Administration to rebut suggestions 
by opposition politicians and human rights groups that by renewing China's 
most-favored-nation trading status unconditionally, President Clinton caved in 
to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine Albright, denied that 
Clinton's shift was a sign of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the contrary, I think this is a very important step in showing American 
resolve," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Clinton's is a policy that "shows strength, that shows the ability to 
know what is important for the United States and to know the importance of how 
to pursue a policy of human rights as well as a policy of engagement with 
China." 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, in a speech to the Asia Society in New York made available in 
Washington, said the Administration will work with U.S. business leaders to 
develop principles to improve working conditions and will make it a practice to 
meet with a wide range of Chinese citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Beijing had told the United States that greater progress on human 
rights could be made even without the MFN linkage and "now we will give them a 
chance." Revoking MFN, he said, would have led to a "downward spiral in 
U.S.-China relations". 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher put the China decision in the context of what he called a 
comprehensive U.S. strategy of engagement and leadership in the Asia-Pacific 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 This also includes new trade negotiations with Japan, efforts to solve nuclear 
problems with North Korea and U.S.-Vietnamese agreement on establishing liaison 
offices in each other's capitals. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department released a summary of Christopher's report and 
recommendations that conceded that China had not made the "overall, significant 
progress" on five areas of human rights that had been required for renewal of 
MFN in an executive order signed by Clinton last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said China was complying with an agreement barring exports to the 
United states of goods made by prison labor, although officials acknowledged 
that there was "some evidence" that such exports were continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also said negotiations with the International Red Cross had not 
yielded any Chinese agreement to permit access to prisons, and Tibetans were 
continuing to be jailed for peaceful protests in support of political and 
religious independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Human rights groups have condemned Clinton's decision, accusing the President 
of caving in to big business. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy National Security Adviser Samuel Berger, speaking on ABC television's 
"Good Morning America" program, defended the new policy of engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had to decide whether to sever "a $40-billion relationship that has 
enormous importance to the security and economic" interests of the United 
States, Berger said, or "whether we pursue human rights better through a policy 
of contact, of engagement, in which we press the human rights agenda but not 
through threatening to sever the entire relationship."

RUSSIAN KIDNAPING ENDS WITH ALL HOSTAGES FREED UNHARMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 24-hour hostage drama in a wild, mountainous region of southern Russia ended 
Friday with commandos freeing four captives unharmed and recovering millions of 
dollars in ransom money. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the kidnapers were arrested, and the fourth died in a shootout, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second high-stakes kidnaping in the area in five months, 
highlighting the crime wave that is sweeping Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnapers, granted the helicopter they demanded along with a three-man 
military crew, took off Friday morning from the resort city of Mineralniye Vody 
with four hostages. 
</P>
<P>
 Army helicopters carrying anti-terrorist squads were close behind, said Maj. 
Viktor Gusakov, an Interior Ministry spokesman in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 About three hours later, the kidnapers landed near the village of Bacha-Yurt 
in Chechnya, a breakaway Russian province known for its fierce warrior culture 
and ruthless criminal gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the kidnapers were captured almost immediately, said Alexander 
Kalmykov, a police official in Mineralniye Vody. The fourth gunman tried to 
flee into the nearby woods and was killed in a shootout, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three of the gunmen were identified as residents of Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 There were conflicting reports about the size of the ransom paid, ranging from 
$4 million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chechnya, Interior Minister Apti Barsnukayev told the Interfax news agency 
the ransom was recovered in full, but there were unconfirmed reports that the 
kidnapers had burned some of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 And hundreds of thousands of dollars disappeared after the kidnapers tossed 
handfuls of bills out of the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnaping began Thursday near Mineralniye Vody, a resort 800 miles south 
of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Four men armed with guns and a grenade seized a bus loaded with 
schoolchildren, teachers and parents. Leaving the driver and most of the male 
passengers behind, they headed for the airport with 29 hostages, including 
eight children. 
</P>
<P>
 With police surrounding the bus, the gunmen threatened to decapitate the 
children, then demanded weapons and narcotics. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunmen later traded the children and one adult for four assault rifles, 
ammunition, flak jackets, night-vision devices and 100 vials of morphine, 
Gusakov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Friday, they freed all but four hostages in exchange for cash, the Mi-8 
helicopter and three more automatic rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 The kidnaping was similar to one in December, in which four gunmen swapped a 
dozen schoolchildren for $10 million and a helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 Those kidnapers took off from Mineralniye Vody, but the helicopter's engine 
stalled and they had to make a forced landing in the mountains, where they were 
captured. None of the hostages was injured.

U.N. MAY LOSE TRACK OF KOREA PLUTONIUM; ASIA: WATCHDOG AGENCY SAYS IT IS A 
MATTER OF DAYS BEFORE IT IS UNABLE TO VERIFY THAT THE NORTH HAS NOT BUILT 
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations' nuclear watchdog agency said Friday that it might not be 
able to verify whether North Korea had diverted plutonium from a nuclear 
reactor, heightening suspicions of a clandestine weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 Hans Blix, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, raised 
alarm bells in a report to Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, saying his 
inspectors had not been able to take samples properly. 
</P>
<P>
 The development created a flurry among Security Council members, with some 
wanting a meeting to warn Pyongyang to cooperate or face possible sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 The IAEA is trying to verify that fuel from the reactor has not been diverted 
in the past for a clandestine nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. official said North Korea either has to stop refueling the reactor or 
reach an agreement with the IAEA on how the removed fuel rods will be stored so 
they can be analyzed by the IAEA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not too far away from a position where the history of the reactor and 
the IAEA's ability to assess it may be lost," said a European envoy, estimating 
that the IAEA had about five days to get an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Blix said, "At the time of writing this report, almost half of the fuel in the 
reactor core has been discharged and in a pattern that has precluded the 
agency's ability to implement the full range of the safeguard measures 
required." 
</P>
<P>
 If the discharge operation continued at the same rate, "the agency's 
opportunity to select, segregate and secure fuel rods for later measurements in 
accordance with agency standards will be lost within days." 
</P>
<P>
 If that happened, the IAEA "would not be in a position to verify, with any 
degree of confidence, that all nuclear material in the DPRK (Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea) that is subject to safeguards is in fact under 
safeguards. Specifically, the agency will not be in a position to verify the 
amount of plutonium produced" in North Korea, Blix added. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem involves nuclear fuel rods being unloaded from a reactor and the 
need of the IAEA to analyze special rods so that the reactor's history can be 
reconstructed, uncovering any possible evidence of past diversion of nuclear 
material into weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The snag was the latest in a series of confrontations between the IAEA and 
North Korea over the government's secretive nuclear program and suspicions that 
it has been building nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States suspects that some fuel had been diverted several years ago 
for the purpose of making bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher indirectly alluded to the problem when 
he urged North Korea not to do anything that would prevent a third round of 
talks between the United States and North Korea on nuclear issues and more 
normal relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Answering questions after a speech in New York to the Asia Society, 
Christopher said that the United States was "holding out the prospect to North 
Korea of a more normal relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "I hope the leaders of that country will understand the tremendous 
value to their people that will come from cooperating in that dialogue and not 
do anything that will prevent us going forward with that dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has had two rounds of talks with North Korea in New York and 
Geneva, but prospects of a third round depend on North Korea's allowing 
inspections of its nuclear program to go forward.

TOTAL MECCA DEATH TOLL REACHES 829 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A total of 270 pilgrims died in a stampede during this week's symbolic 
"stoning the devil" ritual of the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Mecca, the 
government said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 An official statement released by the Saudi Press Agency said a total of 829 
people died during this year's hajj, or pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's holiest 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the 270 people trampled in Monday's stampede, the toll included 
536 who died of natural causes such as sunstroke, old age or heart attack, and 
23 who died in several isolated accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The government attributed the stampede to circumstances "beyond human 
endurance," noting that an all-time record of more than 2.5 million Muslims 
converged on Mecca for this year's rituals. Hospital sources and Asian 
diplomats earlier reported a much larger number of pilgrims killed in the 
stampede, with some putting the figure as high as 1,000.

AT A JAPANESE ROYAL TEA, REPORTERS IMBIBE CULTURE, CUSTOMS 
</P>

 Empress Michiko is not sure whether she will walk behind or ahead of her 
husband, Emperor Akihito, when the imperial couple visits the United States 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she said she had not even thought about the issue until a reporter 
questioned her at a rare tea for U.S. journalists Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother-in-law, the Empress Dowager Nagako, made news in 1975 when she 
obeyed American, rather than Japanese, custom and walked through doors ahead of 
the late Emperor Hirohito when Akihito's parents made the first visit to the 
United States by a Japanese imperial couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Michiko, who collapsed and suffered a loss of speech on her birthday last Oct. 
20, spoke vividly and freely, although in a soft voice. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that she always walks behind the emperor in Japan, and she even 
asked the reporter for his advice on what she should do when they visit the 
United States on June 10-26. The reporter fudged his response. 
</P>
<P>
 During Friday's tea with nine American correspondents, Akihito was asked what 
he thought about the Imperial Household Agency's refusal to allow ancient tombs 
of his ancestors to be opened for academic study. 
</P>
<P>
 The tombs, he said, should be treated with respect for the individuals buried 
in them and should not be opened, even for academic research. The discovery of 
many other artifacts of Japan's early history alleviates the need to study the 
tombs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the emperors' tombs predate Japan's written history, which goes back 
only to the 7th Century, and for years scholars have urged that the Imperial 
Household Agency allow them to examine their contents. Some professors believe 
that the artifacts would show a link to the culture of neighboring Korea and 
thus raise controversy in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-minute tea also served to uncover one imperial family secret. Although 
both Akihito and Michiko have been advertised as fluent in English, only 
Michiko is comfortable speaking the language. 
</P>
<P>
 She addressed all of her guests in English, while Akihito spoke in Japanese 
with an interpreter.

KILLER STRUGGLES WITH GUARDS BEFORE HANGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles Rodman Campbell went to the gallows Friday without a word -- but not 
without a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, 39, had to be subdued with pepper spray and strapped to a board 
before he could be hanged for the murders of two women and an 8-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell was convicted of murdering Renae Wicklund, her 8-year-old daughter, 
Shannah, and neighbor Barbara Hendrickson at Wicklund's home in 1982. He 
slashed the throats of all three. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities called it a revenge killing. Campbell had been imprisoned for 
raping Wicklund in 1974 and was on a work-release program at the time of the 
slayings. Prosecutors said he killed Wicklund and Hendrickson for testifying 
against him at the rape trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the execution, prison guards subdued a defiant Campbell with pepper 
spray when he refused to get off the floor of his cell to be handcuffed for the 
move to a holding cell near the execution chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they found makeshift weapons in Campbell's cell, including a 
piece of metal that was being honed into a blade. 
</P>
<P>
 He was carried to the gallows strapped to a board that held his body rigid so 
he would not collapse en route to the gallows or while waiting for the trap 
door to spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was conscious but he was being passive, like, 'If you want to move me, 
move me,' " said Mary Christensen, an assistant to the prison superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice was long in coming," said Atty. Gen. Christine Gregoire. "If anyone 
deserved the death penalty, it was Charles Campbell." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the prison, death penalty supporters outnumbered opponents by about 4 
to 1. At times, the mood was almost giddy, with people whooping and cheering as 
the execution neared. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Friday, Stephen Nethery was executed by injection in Texas for killing 
a police officer. The 33-year-old Nethery, a self-described hell-raiser who 
said he found God while in prison, recited a short prayer and concluded: "Lord 
Jesus, receive my spirit. Amen."

TOP AIDES TO CLINTON CHIPPING IN TO DEFRAY COST OF HELICOPTER OUTING; WHITE 
HOUSE: THIRTEEN OFFICIALS WILL PASS THE HAT TO HELP COLLEAGUE PAY FOR FLIGHT 
THAT LED TO HIS OUSTER. SPOKESMAN ADMITS THAT A SECOND CRAFT WAS INVOLVED.

<P>
 White House anger over an aide's golf outing by helicopter seemed to cool 
rapidly Friday, as top aides agreed to help the fired administrative chief 
reimburse the government for the cost of his ride. 
</P>
<P>
 As a "gesture of friendship," 13 top White House officials -- virtually the 
entire senior rank -- committed to help the former chief of administration pick 
up the tab, said Mark D. Gearan, the director of communications. By one rough 
estimate, that bill could run to about $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement came as White House efforts to defuse a public relations debacle 
were set back by their admission that a second Marine helicopter also had gone 
on the outing that took Watkins and two others to an afternoon of golf Tuesday 
at the Holly Hill Country Club in Frederick, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 After denying earlier that any other helicopters were part of the trip, Gearan 
conceded that there was a second helicopter. While the second aircraft's 
purpose was to conduct a "training mission," he said it would "probably not" 
have been along but for Watkins' plans to spend the afternoon at the course. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure of the trip Thursday prompted President Clinton to seek 
Watkins' resignation. Clinton said he was "very angry" at news about his 
longtime Arkansas friend and business associate and promised that private money 
would be used to reimburse the government for the trip. Some aides immediately 
expressed the view that Watkins' clumsy mistake had hurt their President at a 
moment when he could ill afford any setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But announcement of plans for the White House contributions appeared to add a 
dose of moral ambiguity to the episode, forcing officials to deny that the top 
aides were not taking the infraction seriously. To place that interpretation on 
the fund-raising effort would be "a misread of the situation," Gearan told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip reawakened voter outrage on radio and television talk shows across 
the country Friday. But at the White House, anger was barely evident in a 
series of letters, released late in the day, from Clinton, Watkins and Thomas 
(Mack) McLarty, the White House chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made only the most passing reference to the reason for Watkins' 
departure, saying: "I write to accept your resignation and to say that I 
understand your reasons for submitting it." 
</P>
<P>
 He praised Watkins' "great vigor and effectiveness" and thanked him for 
improvement in the White House telephone and computer systems. "Hillary and I 
will never forget the loyal friendship you and Ileene (Watkins' wife) have 
given to us over the years." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, the 52-year-old Watkins insisted that "there simply was no 
effort on my part to use the White House or military equipment for personal or 
recreational purposes. My sole purpose was determining how you could utilize 
Camp David more frequently and enjoy the same opportunity for relaxation in 
Maryland that you sometimes get in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 McLarty called the golf trip "an unfortunate error." But he said that he, too, 
believed the trip was made in "good faith, in the belief you were serving the 
President's interest as part of your official duties." 
</P>
<P>
 The aides who have agreed to contribute are McLarty, presidential advisers 
David Gergen and George Stephanopoulos, Gearan, deputy chiefs of staff Phillip 
Lader and Harold M. Ickes, economic adviser Robert E. Rubin, counsel Lloyd N. 
Cutler, national service director Eli Segal, congressional relations director 
Pat Griffin, Cabinet secretary Christine Varney, public liaison chief Alexis 
Herman and domestic policy director Carol Rasco. Gearan said it was unclear if 
the Clintons would contribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are awaiting word from the Pentagon on the size of the total bill 
for the use of the helicopters, which cost $2,380 an hour to operate. Gearan 
said it was undecided how the cost would be shared but said it is certain that 
Watkins and Alphonso Maldon, the White House military office head who joined 
Watkins for the outing, will "be paying something." 
</P>
<P>
 A third golfer, Navy Cmdr. Richard Cellon, who directs operations at Camp 
David, was judged to have no responsibility for the trip and will not pay 
anything. The positions of Watkins and Maldon give them authority over Cellon. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins spent his last day at the White House on Friday and surrendered his 
pass at the close of business. Maldon, a retired Army officer who formerly 
worked in the White House congressional relations office, will be reassigned, 
although it is not clear where. 
</P>
<P>
 Gearan said that the White House counsel's office had reviewed the logs of 
Marine helicopter flights and had found no evidence of other infractions. 
Officials are "not aware of any other instances," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gearan said that the Marine helicopter had taken Watkins and Maldon from 
Bolling Air Force Base near Washington to Camp David, where Watkins took part 
in a meeting that lasted about 30 minutes and conducted a "site inspection" of 
new construction at the camp. Then the helicopter dropped the three at Holly 
Hill and headed back to the air base. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the second helicopter continued its mission, which took it through 
various sections of western Maryland and to Gettysburg, Pa. Two other golfers 
at the course said they saw the second aircraft join Watkins' aircraft after 
the golfers had been picked up, although Gearan indicated that the two 
helicopters did not fly together on the return trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Gearan was asked why reporters earlier had been told that the trip was devoted 
to scout out a potential golfing site for the President. "That was the best 
information received at the time from David and Al Maldon," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton showed a flash of anger during a press conference Thursday 
afternoon, one aide said that he had not expressed anger to Watkins. On the 
contrary, he had been been sympathetic to the plight of an associate who had 
worked with him on his campaigns and in the White House and had arranged their 
participation in a personal investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Republican aides noted that in the George Bush and Ronald Reagan 
administrations only presidents used the helicopters. This was both because of 
the cost of operation and because the copters were viewed as part of the 
ceremonial trappings that should be reserved for the chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlin Fitzwater, press secretary to both previous presidents, recalled that 
Reagan Chief of Staff Donald T. Regan once had been refused permission to use 
one of the helicopters when he had asked to be flown to Bethesda Naval Medical 
Center to visit the ailing Reagan. As vice president, Bush once was offered use 
of a helicopter but turned it down, Fitzwater said.

NEW MEXICO APACHES HAVE A HOT IDEA: PROVIDING NUCLEAR WASTE STORAGE; 
RADIOACTIVITY: THE MESCALEROS' PRESIDENT SEES INCOME FOR TRIBE BY PUTTING 
INTERIM DEPOT FOR HIGH-LEVEL, SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL ON RESERVATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Wendell Chino does much of his important work while he lingers over his coffee 
in the cafeteria at headquarters of the Mescalero Apache tribe. A jovial, 
supremely confidant man with white hair, he is a formidable politician whose 
laid-back style has endeared him to constituents for a generation and 
re-elected him tribal president more than a dozen times. 
</P>
<P>
 Chino was one of the driving forces of the Native American sovereignty 
movement, now a nearly legendary figure among the people he has led for three 
decades. He is also, in the words of a longtime collaborator, "a brazen sort of 
character" with a compulsion to undertake the very things that he's told he 
can't do. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that he leads a people descended from Cochise and Geronimo, that 
is hardly surprising. It also may be a vital trait for someone who strives to 
fulfill Chino's high-stakes new project: To convert a corner of the Mescaleros' 
reservation in south central New Mexico's Sacramento Mountains into a privately 
run depot for nuclear waste. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chino's view, the Mescaleros will generate income for pressing tribal needs 
by storing about 7,000 tons of high-level radioactive waste until the 
government opens a permanent burial ground for the material, sometime after 
2010. Those wastes, in the form of spent nuclear reactor fuel, currently are 
stored around the country at nuclear reactor sites, many of which are running 
out of space. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by tribal elders, Chino proposes that utilities ship the material to a 
Mescalero storage depot in a mesquite-covered, rattlesnake-infested valley at 
the foot of a 12,000-foot mountain. There, it would remain in sealed, shielded 
canisters until the U.S. Department of Energy opens a permanent repository. 
</P>
<P>
 "You needn't worry whether the Mescalero Apache people are smart enough or 
capable enough to manage this project," tribal vice president Fred Peso told a 
House Natural Resources subcommittee recently. "We can be relied on to protect 
our lands, ourselves and our neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 But to reach their goal, the Mescaleros -- 3,200 descendants of warriors who 
held off Spaniards, Mexicans, Texans, Americans, and the Confederate army for 
60 years before they were defeated -- will have to tiptoe through the minefield 
of modern politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The project faces bipartisan opposition from the state political 
Establishment, from environmentalists, who think the idea smacks of 
environmental racism, and from tribal dissidents, who complain that Chino has 
become autocratic. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time the tribe has charted an independent course for 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Chino, a seminary graduate, entered reservation politics, the Mescaleros 
have built a reputation for aggressive and imaginative business dealings. They 
operate a 400-room luxury hotel, casino and ski resort, run a million-dollar 
sawmill, make containers for low-level radioactive waste, and keep a herd of 
6,000 to 7,000 head of beef cattle on the 460,000-acre reservation. For $7,000, 
hunters can spend a week at the tribe's Inn of the Mountain Gods and use 
Mescalero horses and professional guides to hunt elk and bear in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 On occasions, Chino has sharply clashed with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and 
with political and business leaders in Ruidoso, a nearby vacation spot which 
draws tourists with horse racing. "Everything we have, we have had to fight 
for," says Silas Cochise, a great-grandson of the famed Apache chief, tribal 
council member and Chino supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of the success, the Mescaleros see themselves in a continuing 
struggle for existence. The Apache language is disappearing, young people are 
leaving the reservation for jobs in Roswell, El Paso and Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Native American parents, says Silas Cochise, there is growing concern 
because children acquire bad habits when they leave the reservation to attend 
high school in Ruidoso or Tularosa. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to his people earlier this year, Chino explained the tribe's 
interest in nuclear waste storage, saying it could bring "long-term 
independence and prosperity for our tribe." The Mescaleros, sources say, could 
take in $15 million to $25 million a year from the enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's search for a temporary storage site began more than a decade ago 
when Congress settled on burial in deep geologic deposits as the final solution 
for high level radioactive waste. Studies are under way on a potential 
permanent repository inside Nevada's Yucca Mountain, but the site could not be 
ready before 2010, some 12 years after the government has pledged to begin 
taking care of spent fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 By the beginning of 1994, six utilities had already filled their deep pools of 
water where spent fuel rods are kept and had resorted to storing the material 
in metal casks at reactor sites -- an option that arouses concern from those 
who fear that putting the material in dry cask storage means that it will never 
be moved away. Estimates are that pools at 32 sites will be full by the year 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
 In its search for a temporary storage depot, the Energy Department under the 
George Bush Administration provided grants for tribes and local governments 
willing to consider opening a temporary site. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine tribes and several local jurisdictions lined up, applying for 
grants that began at $100,000 each. But most dropped out, often after 
encountering political opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mescaleros accepted grants of $100,000 and $300,000, and then, having 
progressed further than any other party, applied for a third grant of $2.8 
million and announced they were ready for formal negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations never took place, however, apparently because the Bush 
Administration, in the midst of a presidential election, considered the timing 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Clinton Administration took its time in plotting a course, and last 
year Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) pushed through an amendment killing the grants 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Apaches felt betrayed. "I am forced to conclude that our help was never 
really wanted," said Fred Peso. 
</P>
<P>
 So last February, Chino and the Mescalero Tribal Council met with officials of 
Northern States Power Co., a Minnesota utility facing a waste storage crisis, 
and moved to make the project a private enterprise. It was a way to break the 
gridlock of the government program and possibly make more money than if they 
hosted a government-owned facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced they could create a profitable venture if they could get 10 or 12 
partners, the Apaches sent out invitations to a meeting. To their surprise, 
executives from 33 companies showed up for a meeting in April. Before they 
left, each put down $5,000 to get the venture moving. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the potential partners will reassemble to work on details of an 
organization in which the Apaches will have controlling interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been successful beyond anybody's wildest expectation," said Miller 
Hudson, the tribe's legal adviser on the project. "What we are learning now is 
that there is a lot more fuel out there than we had thought." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are to hold a referendum seeking approval of the tribe before the end of 
the year. The organization also must prepare an environmental impact statement 
and get a storage license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a process 
that takes several years. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials, however, pledge to fight the initiative both in the state 
capital of Santa Fe and in Washington. There also is speculation that the 
state's congressional delegation might seek to prevent federal licensing by 
blocking funds the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would need to evaluate an 
Apache application. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the outcome could hinge upon the Apaches' success in asserting 
tribal sovereignty over the use of its land, and on possible efforts by the 
state to prevent transportation of the material to the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingaman says he will continue to oppose the Mescaleros. He is concerned about 
safety, opposes privatizing radioactive waste storage and argues that the state 
has already done its part to address the nation's nuclear waste problems. 
Carlsbad, N.M., is the home of a $1- billion repository where the Energy 
Department plans to entomb plutonium-contaminated waste from nuclear weapons 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Mescaleros press on, Richard Stallings, the federal nuclear waste 
negotiator, continues searching for possible sites for government-operated 
depots. Two tribes, the Goschutes of Utah and the Tonkawas of Oklahoma, which 
are more patient and less aggressive than the Apaches, have continued to 
express interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Stallings also sees potential for using the Energy Department's own laboratory 
sites and in military bases marked for closing. But he says he supports the 
Mescaleros, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be very difficult for them to get through all of the hurdles. 
But they are an aggressive, fairly prosperous tribe, and if any group can be 
successful, it will be them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department is content to watch as well. "I don't see any reason 
that this office or the (energy) secretary or the President should have any 
problem with the Mescaleros going ahead and doing what they want to do," said 
Daniel Dreyfus, director of the department's Office of Civilian Reactor Waste 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
 "The belief I have is that unless they want federal money, we have no reason 
to be involved."

7 IN CONGRESS SEEK TOBACCO INDUSTRY PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven members of Congress asked the Justice Department on Friday for a 
criminal investigation into the tobacco industry's activities for the last 40 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawmakers contend that cigarette companies may have committed fraud and 
perjury beginning in the 1950s by allegedly hiding evidence that cigarettes 
were hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 And they said the chiefs of the nation's seven largest tobacco firms may have 
perjured themselves when they testified before Congress last month that they 
had no evidence nicotine was addictive. 
</P>
<P>
 Confidential industry documents and information from congressional hearings 
now indicate that testimony was false, wrote Rep. Martin T. Meehan (D-Mass.) in 
a letter to Atty. Gen. Janet Reno. 
</P>
<P>
 Also signing the letter were Reps. James V. Hansen (R-Utah), Pete Stark 
(D-Hayward), Peter J. Visclosky (D-Ind.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.), Mike 
Synar (D-Okla.) and Thomas M. Foglietta (D-Pa.). 
</P>
<P>
 Brennan Dawson, a spokeswoman for the industry's Tobacco Institute, declined 
comment on the letter. Company officials, in interviews and congressional 
hearings since March, have insisted that they have done no wrong.

 When Jennifer Merrill faced possible surgery for a gynecological ailment, her 
new insurance plan refused to pay if she went to the specialist she had been 
seeing for nine years. He was not a member of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Merrill's insurer wanted her to see a total stranger, an 
obstetrician-gynecologist who is a participating provider in her health 
maintenance organization. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes the 23-year-old Baltimore woman one of a fast-growing number of 
Americans who, even before enactment of national health care reform, are losing 
the freedom to choose their own doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 In Merrill's case, the story does not end there. She became so uncomfortable 
with her new doctor that when the time came for the $2,000 surgery, she 
returned to her own specialist and -- with a loan from her grandparents -- paid 
the entire bill out of pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill's dilemma arose out of one of today's less-welcomed trends in health 
care: Insurance companies are aggressively imposing restricting "managed care" 
systems on their clients. 
</P>
<P>
 In the name of curtailing soaring health care costs, individuals enrolled in 
these systems receive maximum coverage only when they visit participating 
doctors who agree to abide by price controls negotiated with the insurer. 
Clients may go outside the network of participating doctors -- but only if they 
pay much or, as in Merrill's case, all of the price. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no issue has aroused so much emotion as that of whether Americans will 
be able to select their doctors. "Choice is one of the things people most 
jealously guard against erosion -- and they are willing to pay for it," said 
Edward F. Howard, head of the nonpartisan Alliance for Health Reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics complain that President Clinton's health reform plan would not do 
enough to preserve choice -- a charge that First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton 
has branded as "one of the great lies" in the health care debate. The President 
has said that the allegation, more than anything else, has "made me the maddest 
in the relentless campaign against this plan." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Clinton's prescription for change, more than any other politically 
viable reform proposal, would increase choice of doctors for most patients. 
"Clinton's plan has, if anything, bent over backward to give people the maximum 
choice," said Stanley B. Jones, a Shepherdstown, W.Va., analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a catch: People would have to pay something extra for that 
freedom, although hardly the full cost that Merrill and her grandparents had to 
bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Managed care systems have grown so explosively that there are no reliable 
figures on how many exist. "Nobody can say for sure," said Phil Caper, a New 
Hampshire physician who sells computer software programs to managed care 
networks that monitor patients and doctors. "All I know is that things have 
really taken off in the past few years." 
</P>
<P>
 KPMG Peat Marwick, a benefits consulting firm, says the percentage of American 
workers enrolled by their employers in fee-for-service plans -- the traditional 
plans that reimburse workers for a percentage of their health costs, no matter 
who the doctor -- dropped from 71% in 1988 to just 49% by last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the percentage of private employees in managed care systems 
grew from 5% in 1980 to 55% by 1992, the government's General Accounting Office 
reports. That percentage is even higher in larger firms, which have moved most 
aggressively in channeling workers into managed care networks, says Derek 
Lifton, associate director of Peat Marwick in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 And according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, the number of 
Americans enrolled in HMOs -- the most tightly run form of managed care -- rose 
from 9.1 million in 1980 to 37.2 million by 1992. The regional differences in 
HMO acceptance are stark: more than one in three Californians belong, compared 
to 7% in Texas and less than 1% in Alaska, Montana and Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, as many as 95% of Americans with private insurance are subject to some 
form of utilization review, possibly leading to a denial of coverage either 
before or after a specific treatment, according to Lewin-VHI Inc., a health 
care consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fewer than half of American workers have any choice at all over their doctors 
or their health care plan today," Clinton has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why hasn't there been a huge public outcry over the loss of choice if, as 
everyone says, it is such a potent consumer issue? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the public understands how pervasive this is becoming," said 
Dr. James Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's plan, like most other viable proposals in Congress, contains strong 
financial incentives to prod consumers into managed care systems. A central 
hallmark in such arrangements is the "gatekeeper," a primary care physician 
whose permission is needed before a patient may consult with a specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's hardly surprising that the most vocal critics of the erosion of choice 
are high-priced specialists. Last month, the American Academy of Orthopedic 
Surgeons, for example, took out full-page newspaper ads to clamor for "direct 
(public) access to specialty care." 
</P>
<P>
 "Those pushing the issue tend to be providers who don't want to be excluded," 
said Bill Custer, EBRI's research director. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen M. Shortell, a Northwestern University management professor, called 
the issue of choice -- in the context of health care reform -- "a red herring." 
</P>
<P>
 The President's proposal, which seeks to guarantee a lifetime of comprehensive 
benefits to all Americans, would increase choice by pooling most people into 
regional insurance-purchasing alliances that negotiate rates with specific 
groups of providers and insurers. 
</P>
<P>
 As an alliance member, Shortell says, "you end up having to choose your doctor 
from a panel. But in most areas, that list will be pretty long." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Clinton's proposal, each alliance must offer at least three types of 
plans -- including a traditional but costlier fee-for-service plan and an HMO 
with lower premiums, no deductibles and co-payments of $10 or less per visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Each plan also must offer a "point-of-service" option, which allows consumers 
to see any doctor outside the plan, but for a higher out-of-pocket fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Under such arrangements, says Joseph M. Davis, president of Medimetrix, a 
Cleveland-based consulting firm, consumer choice "goes up significantly." 
</P>
<P>
 Congress is sure to make major changes in Clinton's plan. But, as currently 
written, it would require employers to pay at least 80% of a worker's premiums, 
with the individual paying the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration analysts estimate that the average annual premiums (subject to 
regional variations) will be $4,200 for a family of four and $1,800 for an 
individual. Twenty percent of that, the consumer share, would be $840 and $360, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who opt for more choice under a fee-for-service plan, premiums, 
co-payments and annual deductibles will be higher, with a cap on out-of-pocket 
spending of as much as $3,000 per year per family. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a high hurdle most people can't get over," warned the AMA's Todd. True 
choice, he said, "will depend on what that threshold is." 
</P>
<P>
 The mandatory alliance structure proposed by Clinton also would let consumers 
-- rather than their employers -- pick which plan to join. As the President 
boasted last month in a speech: "We give choice of providers back to the 
employees themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 His plan would also allow physicians to join more than one plan, increasing 
their availability to patients. "Our plan is designed to increase the choices 
that consumers have," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This idea that every American today has a choice of doctors is a myth," he 
told a Minneapolis town hall meeting on April 8. "More than half the American 
people who are insured in the workplace today don't have a choice. They get one 
plan and that's it. Ninety percent of the American people who are insured in 
small businesses with 25 or fewer employers have no choice." 
</P>
<P>
 One drawback to Clinton's approach is that different family members may find 
their longtime doctors belonging to different managed care plans. And since a 
family may belong to only one plan, some members will find themselves having to 
pay a premium to see their regular doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated 27 million people on Medicaid, the federal-state health program 
for the poor, would also gain more choice than they now have. 
</P>
<P>
 Many doctors currently refuse to accept these patients because Medicaid 
payment schedules are so much lower than private-sector fees. Under Clinton's 
plan, Medicaid recipients would be enrolled in the alliances and able to select 
their own plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The one reform agenda that offers unrestricted consumer choice is Rep. Jim 
McDermott's (D-Wash.) single-payer proposal, which would have the government 
collect a tax -- taking the place of all public and private insurance premiums 
-- and then pay everyone's medical bills. 
</P>
<P>
 But the plan is widely considered politically non-viable -- even by Clinton, 
whose plan would allow states to adopt a single-payer system. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the outcome of the health care debate, for people like Merrill, a 
social researcher, it is the onset of a potentially grave medical crisis that 
crystallizes the choice issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Until she was married last year, Merrill had her own health plan, which 
covered her visits to Dr. Joseph Moser, a Baltimore gynecologist whom she had 
been seeing since age 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after joining her husband's plan, an HMO, because of its lower premiums, 
Merrill continued going to Moser for regular checkups, paying for all the costs 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, things suddenly became anything but routine. Moser detected a 
widespread pre-cancerous condition and recommended further tests, including a 
biopsy. Merrill's plan refused to cover the expenses unless she went to a 
doctor in her HMO. 
</P>
<P>
 Moser even offered to lower his fees to that charged by doctors in the 
network, but he was rebuffed. Moser then offered to sign up as a participating 
doctor in the HMO; again he was turned down. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Merrill complained, protested and appealed, also to no avail. After 
finally seeing a network specialist, Merrill returned to Moser. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was upsetting and frustrating," Moser recalls. "And Jennifer Merrill isn't 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, many people have new doctors every few years. And the continuity 
that's developed in a doctor-patient relationship may be destroyed. If people 
are traded from doctor to doctor in exchange for fee discounts, they are no 
longer consumers, they are commodities."

FORMER OFFICIAL, 2 OTHERS DIE IN N.M. SHOOTOUT

 A former state legislator, his son and a sheriff's lieutenant were killed 
Friday in a shootout that erupted when authorities tried to take the son in for 
a mental evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Bill Sibrava and former Republican state Sen. Joe Mercer died at 
University Hospital shortly after the shootings, said Sheriff Ray 
Gallagher.Mercer's 30-year-old son, Stephen, died during the gunfight at his 
home, said sheriff's spokesman Ernie Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Mercer, a candidate for governor in 1986, was apparently killed in 
the cross-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't sure who shot him. We believe it was his son. We're not sure at 
this time," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Five deputies were attempting to serve papers taking Mercer's son in for a 
mental evaluation when the younger Mercer pulled a gun and began firing, 
hitting Sibrava. 
</P>
<P>
 "They went in the house and talked to him for just a little bit. He did not 
want to go," Watson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the four deputies returned fire, Watson said, killing Stephen Mercer. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said the elder Mercer had accompanied the deputies, who sought to have 
his son evaluated at a veterans hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Mercer had been involved in a seven-hour standoff with Albuquerque 
police last week and had held off police for 45 minutes on Thursday, Watson 
said.

SPANKING BILL VETOED; FEARS OF ABUSE CITED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State law should allow parents to spank their children, Gov. Lawton Chiles 
said Friday as he vetoed a bill that would have done just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiles called the bill a "good-faith attempt" to balance the rights of parents 
and the protection of children.But he said the wording would have made it too 
difficult to prosecute cases of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 He urged state lawmakers to draft a new version during their special session 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is understandable in some disciplinary situations for parents to spank a 
child," said Chiles, who acknowledged being on the giving and receiving end of 
spanking in his family. "I believe we need to clarify that Florida law allows 
this to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill he vetoed would have allowed spanking if it did not result in serious 
injury. The measure was approved by legislators on April 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill's sponsor, state Sen. Jim Hargrett, a Tampa Democrat, had viewed the 
measure as a way to help fight youth crime by giving parents more leeway in 
disciplining their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Hargrett was not immediately available to respond to the governor's veto, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Child advocates urged Chiles to veto the bill because its definition of child 
abuse required "significant" bruises and welts. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors opposed the bill because it required child abuse to be the result 
of "willful or intentional acts." They warned that such language would raise 
their burden of proof and allow defendants to use intoxication as a defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Adah Maurer, executive director of End Violence Against the Next Generation 
Inc., a nonprofit advocacy group in Berkeley, Calif., said she did not know of 
any state that outlawed spanking by parents. She also said she did not know of 
any state that explicitly gave parents that right. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's common law," she said.

BLAST AT OHIO PLANT FORCES EVACUATION; EXPLOSION: AT LEAST ONE WORKER IS KILLED 
AND TWO ARE MISSING AND PRESUMED DEAD AFTER NINE-HOUR FIRE. THE CAUSE IS 
UNKNOWN.

 An explosion at a chemical plant sent flames shooting hundreds of feet into 
the air Friday and produced a mass of thick, black smoke that forced 1,700 
people to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the employees in the Shell Chemical Co. plant at the time was killed, 
the company said in a statement. Two others were missing late Friday and 
presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Plant manager Arnie Dittmar would not identify the three, but said their 
families had been notified. No injuries were reported, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty to 75 of the factory's 480 employees were working at the time of the 
explosion, spokesman Mike White said. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon the fire was brought under control and local residents were 
allowed to return to their homes as firefighers conducted precautionary 
detoxification procedures to assure they had no chemicals on their clothes or 
equipment. It was not known whether the smoke and fumes were toxic. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant produces a thermoplastic rubber used in automotive parts, footwear 
and adhesives. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant, along U.S. 50, is a complex of buildings covering about 15 acres, 
located about a mile from this Ohio River town of 6,800 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire began at about 6:30 a.m. in one building and spread to at least one 
tank, which collapsed, said Washington County Fire Capt. Chris Forshey. He said 
he did not know the tank's contents. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the explosion was not immediately known. Residents 10 miles from 
the plant said they felt a jolt from the blast. 
</P>
<P>
 By early afternoon, flames were shooting 300 to 600 feet into the air, and the 
heat was so intense that firefighters had to retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire required about 500 firefighters, and equipment was brought in from 
neighboring states. Firefighters battled the blaze for about nine hours before 
it was extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the burning chemicals were petroleum-based solvents cyclohexane and 
styrene monomers, said Ohio Environmental Protection Agency spokesman Rob 
Berger. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are used in the production of plastics and can produce irritating or 
poisonous gases. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities evacuated 15 homes in Porterfield, Ohio, five miles west of 
Belpre, and later ordered the evacuation of everyone within a one-mile radius 
of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 A nearby portion of U.S. 50 was closed, and schools in the city and some 
surrounding areas canceled classes. The Coast Guard was advising commercial and 
recreational boaters to avoid the Ohio River at Belpre because of the smoke.

UNZ, BROWN AIR NEW ADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a new radio ad that began airing last week, Republican gubernatorial 
candidate Ron Unz suggests that qualified applicants to California's public 
universities are being turned away because of quota programs.  
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: A male voice says: "We're concerned parents. Our son had excellent 
grades in high school." A female voice continues: "But he was turned away by 
the state university. Why?" A third voice -- Unz's -- offers this answer: "The 
reason is affirmative action. These quota programs reward people based on race 
or ethnicity, instead of merit. . . . Past racial discrimination was wrong, but 
two wrongs don't make a right." Unz then promises to "completely abolish" 
affirmative action, bilingual education and multiculturalism programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: The ad is built upon a false premise, according to university 
officials. The University of California and California State University systems 
never reject qualified students. Students in the top eighth of the state's high 
school graduates are guaranteed spots at a UC campus, while those in the top 
third may attend CSU. Not everyone gets to enroll in the campus of their 
choice, but no one is "turned away." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, neither UC nor CSU has a quota program. To ensure that the student 
body reflects the diversity of the state, disadvantaged students are considered 
on a case by case basis for "special admission" in both systems. Race and 
ethnicity are among several factors that are considered during this process, 
including merit. But students admitted under this system do not take seats away 
from other deserving students. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as you meet the basic requirements, there's a place for you in the UC 
system," said Tom Debley, a UC spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McCarthy, a CSU spokesman, concurred: "There has never been anyone 
qualified who was denied." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Brown has been airing a new ad that trumpets 
her record as state treasurer since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: The commercial opens with black-and-white footage of unemployed 
workers and then shifts to a photo of Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wilson recession -- 550,000 jobs lost. More than any other state," an 
announcer says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Brown appears on the screen to say that, as state treasurer, she has 
managed America's largest investment fund and earned $4 billion for taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "With tough fiscal management," Brown says, "I've kept California solvent 
through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression." 
</P>
<P>
 * ANALYSIS: As in Brown's earlier commercials, this ad tends to exaggerate 
both Wilson's role in creating the recession and Brown's role in helping state 
government survive it. 
</P>
<P>
 California's economy peaked in the spring of 1990 and began its downturn well 
before Wilson took office. The state has lost at least 550,000 private sector 
jobs since then. Most economists believe these job losses stemmed more from the 
weak national economy and from defense cutbacks than from anything Wilson did. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists say the tax increase Wilson supported in 1991 exacerbated the 
state's problems, but Brown does not level that charge. Instead, her rap 
against Wilson is more guilt by association: He is the chief executive, 
therefore he is responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's claims about her role in keeping the state solvent are factually 
correct, but probably overstate her importance. Her job as treasurer is largely 
to carry out actions begun by the Legislature or the voters. She has borrowed 
money by selling bonds and notes to private investors and banks to tide the 
state over until there was sufficient cash in the treasury to pay the bills.

EASTERN PARKS SMOGGIER THAN THOSE IN WEST, STUDY FINDS; POLLUTION: AIR QUALITY 
CONTINUES TO DETERIORATE IN THE EAST, DESPITE STRICTER MEASURES. UC DAVIS 
RESEARCHERS CONCLUDE WESTERN STATES ARE DOING A BETTER JOB OF CONTROLLING 
SULFUR EMISSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 10-year study of smog in national parks has found that air quality is 
improving in western states but continuing to deteriorate in the East, despite 
tougher laws aimed at halting air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summertime, remote parks and wilderness areas in the East share the 
same hazy air as cities such as Washington. In fact, the study found, visible 
air pollution in the two eastern parks studied is worse than in Los Angeles 
during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at UC Davis, who conducted the study of a dozen national parks, 
came to the unexpected conclusion that the West is doing a better job of 
controlling the sulfur emissions that cause visible air pollution and acid 
rain. The findings were published in the latest issue of the journal 
Atmospheric Environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The measures used in the East to clean up the air aren't working the way they 
should and the air quality is getting worse," said physicist Thomas Cahill, 
head of the UC Davis Air Quality Group. "The measures used in the West are 
working, and the air is getting better." 
</P>
<P>
 Cahill called for tougher laws to reduce sulfur emissions, particularly in the 
East. "The bottom line is that the Clean Air Act may not accomplish all that it 
was supposed to do, which is to clean up the air of the eastern United States," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The research -- the first of its kind -- found that the United States is 
divided down the middle into two distinct zones of sulfur emissions, which can 
travel hundreds of miles from their sources. 
</P>
<P>
 In the East, the level of sulfate pollutants is often eight times as high as 
in the West because there are many more power plants, fewer emission controls 
and higher humidity, which accelerates the conversion of sulfur emissions into 
visible acidic particles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sulfate pollution is the primary cause of visible smog and, in heavy 
concentrations, can severely damage trees. By contrast, ozone, which is not 
visible, is the main component of smog that causes health problems in humans 
and can also damage vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 To see how air pollution is affecting visibility in some of the most remote 
and pristine spots in the country, the UC Davis researchers took air samples at 
scenic spots, such as the mountains above Yosemite Valley and the bottom of the 
Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers found that the air quality improved in national parks in 
Arizona, Colorado, Utah and Oregon between 1982 and 1992, while holding steady 
in Yosemite, the Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon National Park in Utah and two 
national parks in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 However, visible pollution at Shenandoah National Park in Virginia and Great 
Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee jumped nearly 40% during the same 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 "On many days in the summer, visitors have no view at all except a strange, 
gray fog from many of the most popular lookouts," Cahill said. "But it's not 
fog. It's mostly sulfate particles, with lots of water attached. At times in 
the East, it is almost pure dilute sulfuric acid." 
</P>
<P>
 Cahill said the UC Davis findings support the theory that the sulfate haze 
hanging over much of the eastern United States and Europe is countering the 
effect of global warming in that region by scattering light that would 
otherwise heat the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 He said this finding could explain why temperatures have not increased as much 
in the Northern Hemisphere as expected under scientific models of global 
warming.

EX-OFFICER SENTENCED IN SPYING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former police officer Tom Gerard, who fled to the Philippines after he was 
accused of spying for the Anti-Defamation League, pleaded no contest Friday to 
one charge of illegally accessing police computer records. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard's plea brings to a close the spying scandal that rocked the prominent 
Jewish civil rights group last year and outraged thousands of people and 
activist groups targeted by the league's private intelligence operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard, a onetime CIA agent who voluntarily returned from self-imposed exile 
to face charges, is the only person to be prosecuted in the scandal. He will 
serve 45 days in a work camp and pay a fine of $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Arlo Smith agreed not to bring charges 
against the Anti-Defamation League after the group promised to pay up to 
$75,000 to Smith's office to fight hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerard, who at one point was an intelligence officer with the San Francisco 
Police Department, was accused of tapping into police computers and giving 
confidential information on hundreds of people to Roy Bullock, an undercover 
operative for the Anti-Defamation League. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullock has admitted that the two of them sold some of the information to an 
agent for the South African government. Bullock, who was never charged, also 
used data from Gerard in amassing intelligence files for the league on nearly 
10,000 people and 950 groups, ranging from the Ku Klux Klan to the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People. 
</P>
<P>
 After the FBI began investigating the case, Gerard fled to the Philippines and 
resigned from the force. He left behind a briefcase filled with such items as 
false IDs, information about Central American death squads and a black 
executioner-style hood. From the Philippines, he threatened to expose illegal 
CIA support of death squads if he was prosecuted for his role in the 
Anti-Defamation League case. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a San Francisco judge dismissed felony charges against Gerard 
after the FBI refused to provide wiretaps and investigative files in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent the theft of confidential data in the future, Smith said, the San 
Francisco Police Department will require all computer users to have a personal 
password.

6 STANFORD ATHLETES CHARGED IN ATTACK ON GAY-THEMED STATUE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Stanford University athletes were charged with felony vandalism and four 
others with misdemeanors for allegedly attacking a campus statue to protest its 
gay liberation theme. 
</P>
<P>
 The athletes were arrested May 16 after someone poured black paint on the 
bronze statue of two men and two women crafted by George Segal. The statue was 
also rammed with a bench. University officials said the damage totals at least 
$7,900. 
</P>
<P>
 The athletes charged with felonies could face a prison sentence and a fine of 
up to $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hate crime charges could not be filed because the victim of the vandalism is 
an institution and not a person, said Santa Clara County Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Karyn Sinunu.

ROCK GROUP FILES COMPLAINT OVER ALLEGED TACTICS OF TICKETMASTER; ENTERTAINMENT: 
ATTORNEYS FOR PEARL JAM SAY THE AGENCY PRESSURED PROMOTERS TO NOT BOOK THE BAND 
BECAUSE IT WANTED TO SELL TICKETS AT LOWER PRICES. TICKET FIRM SAYS IT OPERATES 
WITHIN THE LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a memorandum to the U.S. Justice Department, the rock band Pearl Jam has 
complained that Los Angeles-based Ticketmaster successfully pressured promoters 
to boycott the band's low-cost concert tour this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the Seattle-based band -- the biggest-selling rock group in the 
country -- made the complaint May 6 in a memo to the department's antitrust 
division. The memo accused Ticketmaster -- the world's largest ticket agency -- 
of exercising a monopoly over ticket distribution in this country and using 
that influence to keep promoters from booking the Pearl Jam tour, which has 
been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorandum, filed by Sullivan & Cromwell, a prominent New York law firm, 
said that Ticketmaster has exclusive arrangements with all important concert 
venues in the country and uses these arrangements to "cement control over the 
distribution of tickets to concerts." 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department has begun an evaluation of the memo, and sent three 
officials to Los Angeles on Tuesday to interview music business figures, 
sources said. Such an evaluation is in some measure a standard response to such 
a complaint. It is preliminary to a decision on whether to launch an 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Justice Department declined comment. Representatives for 
Pearl Jam also did not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to The Times, Ticketmaster Vice President Ned S. Goldstein said, 
"Ticketmaster operates fully and squarely within the parameters of all 
applicable laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of Pearl Jam's last two albums together exceeded $137 million. 
Ticketmaster, which is privately held, last year reportedly earned about $200 
million in service and sponsorship fees on $1.3 billion in sales of tickets to 
concert and sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pearl Jam memorandum is likely to focus new attention on a growing furor 
over skyrocketing concert ticket prices and service fees, and the arrangements 
among managers, promoters and service companies that underlie pricing 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster collects a phone service fee for tickets to rock and pop 
concerts, typically $6 to $8 per ticket, although the agency's fee for $350 
tickets for Barbra Streisand shows amounted to $18 in some cities. Ticketmaster 
pays a portion of the fees to maintain exclusive long-term contracts with the 
owners of the largest concert venues. Ticketmaster also pays a portion to some 
promoters, managers, agents and artists. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Pearl Jam sent letters to promoters vowing to give concerts this 
summer only at venues that charged $18 for a ticket and no more than $1.80 for 
service or handling charges. A representative of the band said Pearl Jam was 
seeking to keep prices in a range their young fans could afford. 
</P>
<P>
 But sources in the concert industry said the group encountered immediate 
resistance from Ticketmaster and members of the North American Concert 
Promoters Assn., a McLean, Va.-based group that represents the nation's largest 
promoters. 
</P>
<P>
 In two letters obtained by The Times, Ben Liss, the executive director of the 
association, warned promoters that if they booked Pearl Jam under the band's 
conditions, they could face possible lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster "views the Pearl Jam issue as an all-or-nothing proposition," 
Liss wrote in one of his letters on March 24. Ticketmaster chief executive Fred 
Rosen "has indicated that he intends to take a very strong stand on this issue 
to protect Ticketmaster's existing contracts with promoters and facilities and, 
further, (Ticketmaster) will use all available remedies to protect itself from 
outside third parties that attempt to interfere with those existing contracts." 
</P>
<P>
 Liss did not return phone calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 After being turned down by virtually every major promoter in the country for 
bookings, Pearl Jam postponed its summer tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster has dominated the ticket market since 1991. In May of that year, 
the Justice Department's antitrust division gave the go-ahead for Ticketmaster 
to buy certain assets from Ticketron. At that point, Ticketron was 
Ticketmaster's only major competitor. 
</P>
<P>
 The government inquiry comes at a time when Ticketmaster plans to expand into 
a variety of new ventures, including movie ticket sales and an interactive TV 
channel devoted to tickets, concert merchandise, records and videos. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster is controlled by billionaire Paul G. Allen, who co-founded 
software giant Microsoft and who owns the Portland Trail Blazers basketball 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen reportedly paid more than $250 million in November for controlling 
interest in Ticketmaster from the Chicago-based Pritzker family, who retain a 
small piece of the firm as part of their vast holdings, which include the Hyatt 
hotel chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who also holds a 24% stake in the America Online interactive computer 
service, has joined forces with EMI Music, PolyGram, Sony Music and the Warner 
Music Group to create a video music channel to challenge MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of those four recording conglomerates have been subpoenaed in a 
separate antitrust inquiry by the Federal Trade Commission that is 
investigating compact disc pricing policies. 
</P>

IN LONG RUN, EAGLES REUNION WORTH WAIT; POP MUSIC: THE BAND'S RETURN AFTER 14 
YEARS BRINGS FANS FROM 'LIFE IN THE FAST LANE' TO LIFE IN THE MEMORY LANE. 
</P>

 They flew in from as far as Kentucky and Alaska. Some came prepared to drop 
$500 for a seat. And just about everyone was stoked for a trip down memory lane 
as the Eagles launched their historic reunion tour Friday at Irvine Meadows, 
their first show in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their lyrics have just keyed in to special times in my life. I'm a big music 
fan, but no other band seems to have that connection for me," said Julie 
Gregory, 33, a Kentucky attorney who flew thousands of miles to make opening 
night and considered the journey a pilgrimage of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do opening night. I figured if there was going to be something 
magical, tonight would be it," she said. "My mother thinks I'm crazy, but my 
boss is about 45 years old, and he wishes he were here." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid special effects of thunder and lightning, the Eagles opened to the cheers 
of 15,000 fans with a rendition of "Hotel California." 
</P>
<P>
 "Big time rock 'n' roll, just like I remember it," said Eagles co-founder 
Glenn Frey during a pause early in the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Frey noted that he wore his loose-fitting orange shirt in honor of Orange 
County. He and the other Eagles were typically dressed down, most of them 
wearing jeans, boots or sneakers. They played against a set depicting a desert 
with rock outcroppings and with props that appeared to be rusted girders of an 
abandoned mine. 
</P>
<P>
 For fans, the familiar sounds were the stuff of nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagles time began for Gregory at age 15, cruising the streets of Henderson, 
Ky., and blasting "New Kid in Town." When she got word of ticket sales, she 
placed an emergency call to a friend in Santa Monica and told him to spend as 
much as five bills to get her in. To her relief, she got a decent loge seat for 
$190. 
</P>
<P>
 To Gina Glidewell, 30, who left home in Playa del Rey for the concert at 4 
p.m. with her husband, Jeff, and found two scalped tickets for $250 for both, 
the 1970s rock fixtures are a soothing reminder of what life used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "First boyfriends, eight-track cartridges -- that's exactly what it brings 
back for me. Life was simple and there were no traffic jams," she said of her 
early Eagles memories. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles' concert was the band's first touring date since its 1980 breakup. 
The first of five shows at Irvine Meadows, it launched the five members on a 
lucrative return flight that is scheduled to continue until Oct. 8, when the 
Eagles will return to Southern California for a concert at the Rose Bowl in 
Pasadena.  
</P>
<P>
 The concert snarled traffic on the San Diego Freeway, and a crowd of thousands 
hovered outside the gates as early as two hours before show time, clutching 
sleeping bags and finishing off six-packs of beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Rex, 26, of Mojave, came prepared with a cardboard drink holder poised 
to haul four beers up the hill to the general seating area, and pair of 
binoculars to train on the heroes of her teen years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the concert to end all concerts. We love the Eagles," said Rex, who 
dialed her phone so frantically in the 10 minutes after tickets went on sale 
that she says it went dead and she had to run to a friend's house to keep 
trying. "My ultimate thing is to see Don Henley sing 'Boys of Summer.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Berman, 30, flew in from Seattle with his friend, Mike Contreras, 30, 
to hook up with Steve Acosta, an old friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on a mission," Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Eagles are so happening that I'm getting my aunt a shirt, and she's 47," 
added Acosta, 29, of Victorville. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:50 p.m., the long line of people waiting to be let onto the lawn of the 
Irvine Meadows were allowed to make a dash for a spot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd spanned several generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here to see the Eagles because it's their first concert in 14 years. My 
parents listen to them all the time," said Aaron King, 14, of Newport Beach, 
who came with his parents and a group of friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticket prices for the Irvine shows are unprecedented for a non-charity rock 
concert: $115 for orchestra seats, $75 for loge and terrace seating, and $35 
for a spot on the lawn (Barbra Streisand, whose roots are in the Broadway-style 
pop-diva tradition and not rock 'n' roll, commands ticket prices of $350, $125 
and $50 on her current tour, which resumes Thursday at The Pond of Anaheim). 
</P>
<P>
 High prices didn't prevent the Eagles from instantly selling out their five 
shows at Irvine. Playing to 15,000 people each night, they figure to gross $1 
million per night from ticket sales alone during their stand at Irvine.  
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1972 by original members Don Henley and Glenn Frey, the Eagles were 
one of the ruling rock bands of the 1970s, with hits including "Desperado," 
"Peaceful Easy Feeling," "Hotel California" and "One of These Nights." 
</P>
<P>
 Band members have cited such factors as burnout, drug abuse and the pressure 
of trying to top themselves commercially and creatively as reasons for their 
breakup. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles dubbed their return tour "Hell Freezes Over," a reference to how 
unlikely it once seemed that the rifts that split the members apart would ever 
heal. As it became apparent Friday night that the 1994 Eagles were able to 
render sharp versions of the hits that made them one of the leading bands of 
1970s rock, one pleased onlooker was the band's manager, Irving Azoff. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime proponent of the reunion, Azoff strolled the isles and could be 
heard gleefully saying, "They sound amazing." 
</P>

UMBERG TIES CLUB KILLING TO 'LAX POLICY'; POLITICS: ATTORNEY GENERAL CANDIDATE 
BLAMES MORGAN PAROLE ON WILSON 'QUOTA SYSTEM.' CORRECTION OFFICIALS DISPUTE 
CLAIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove) on Friday used the slaying of a 
23-year-old Huntington Beach woman to assail Gov. Pete Wilson for a "relaxed 
parole policy" that he said discourages sending parolees back to prison for 
drug violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, the Democratic candidate for attorney general, made his charges at an 
afternoon news conference held in front of the Australian Beach Club, across 
the street from the parking lot where Leanora Annette Wong was found savagely 
beaten to death last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Patrick Morgan Jr., who had met Wong at the nightclub, was arrested in 
connection with her murder on May 23 in Quincy following a statewide search. He 
had tested positive for drug use several days before Wong was slain, but 
results were not known by authorities until after her death. 
</P>
<P>
 "This young woman did not have to die," said Umberg, who said the Huntington 
Beach woman was a casualty of an "unwritten policy" that he said has been 
quietly enacted and has resulted in parole violators being released for all but 
the most serious of violations. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblyman's charges were disputed Friday by state correction officials 
who said Umberg is "manipulating facts" for political gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg, describing it as a "quota system," said the policy has resulted in a 
dramatic drop in the percentage of parole violators returned to custody -- from 
67% in 1990 to 39% in 1993. He also said that the drug testing of parolees is 
discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 "This policy is successful at one thing: saving money. But at what cost in 
human tragedy?" asked Umberg. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblyman's comments drew criticism from corrections officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no quota system that we have for revocation," said J.P. Tremblay, 
spokesman for the state's Youth and Adult Correction Agency, which oversees the 
Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just doesn't happen," Tremblay added. "Umberg is trying to use the 
unfortunate death of Leanora Wong to advance his message." 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman disputed Umberg's figures and said that the percentage of parole 
violators returned to custody in 1990 was 57.1%. He said the drop to 39% in 
1993 is largely due to the fact that some parole violators are sent back to 
county jails instead of state prison for parole violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, arrested on May 23, tested positive for cocaine on May 10 and the 
results were completed by May 17. Morgan's parole officer did not have evidence 
that he had violated the terms of his parole by using drugs until authorities 
were already searching for him in connection with Wong's slaying, corrections 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tremblay said Morgan's parole would have been revoked after the recent urine 
test and that he would have been sent back to prison because of his history of 
violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But Umberg contends that even if Morgan's failed drug test had been delivered 
in time, "the decision still would have been made to continue him on parole -- 
not to revoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's brief comments were met with criticism from a small group of 
protesters, including Thomas G. Reinecke, a candidate in the June 7 primary 
race for the 70th Assembly District seat and Placentia Police Chief Manuel 
Ortega.

DEGREES OF FREEDOM; MORE THAN 900 GRADUATE IN 1ST DAY OF CEREMONIES AT CAL

 Although they began solemnly with a procession of gowned students, graduation 
ceremonies Friday at Cal State Fullerton quickly showed signs of students' 
relief and euphoria. 
</P>
<P>
 "Na na na na, na na na na, hey hey hey, need a job," sang three students as 
they ran down into the field arm in arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Pink Silly String shot over the seated graduates as classmates waved and 
screamed to parents in the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students we see before us this afternoon will be the ones shaping the 
future of this region in the 21st Century," university President Milton A. 
Gordon began in his address. As if on cue, several students knocked a beach 
ball back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can wait," Gordon said, pausing for students to quiet down. 
</P>
<P>
 But by evening's end, more than 900 Cal State Fullerton students had become 
alumni.  
</P>
<P>
 Among them were Lisa Abato, 23, of Mission Viejo, who, hours after applying 
for a marriage license for a July wedding, donned her cap and gown. 
</P>
<P>
 Abato, 23, and Gwen Boone, also 23, of Buena Park, are the first two people to 
graduate from the university's nascent environmental chemistry program, which 
college officials call one of the few in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "What keeps me motivated is that when I'm outside, I look around and remember 
there are chemicals coming out of plants and other chemicals reacting with 
them," Abato said. "We have to breathe what results." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's ceremonies were the first of three days of commencement exercises at 
the university. Nearly 6,000 students are scheduled to march in six ceremonies 
held on the campus football field. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, university officials will honor the memory of sociology honors 
student Cathy Torrez, a junior who was killed by an unknown assailant in 
February. Torrez will be named an honorary alumna. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State Fullerton graduation is the first of the largest college 
commencement ceremonies in Orange County, even though students began graduating 
from other area colleges in early May. The institutions include:  
</P>
<P>
 * The Art Institute of Southern California in Laguna Beach, which awarded 27 
bachelor's degrees in fine arts on May 7.  
</P>
<P>
 * Rancho Santiago College in Santa Ana, where more than 480 people graduated 
on May 20.

MORE CANDIDATES BANKROLLING OWN CAMPAIGNS; POLITICS: MANY SAY IT KEEPS SPECIAL 
INTERESTS AWAY. LESS-ENDOWED CHALLENGERS ARE NERVOUS, REFORMISTS WARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Before she burst on the Orange County political scene, supervisorial candidate 
Haydee V. Tillotson and her husband were busy amassing a fortune in real 
estate, personal business and investment holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial documents filed with the registrar's office show the Tillotsons' 
portfolio valued at more than $2.2 million, with holdings ranging from mobile 
home parks and utility companies to Wal-Mart stores and beachfront property. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson said the figure is a "very conservative" number, and by Orange 
County standards the family's considerable wealth might pass as unremarkable. 
But Tillotson's choice to bankroll an expensive campaign -- with $342,000 in 
personal loans -- for one of Orange County's premiere political jobs has 
spotlighted an emerging local movement that has campaign reformists and 
less-endowed candidates nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign reports filed last week show that a number of candidates are drawing 
on their own resources to cast themselves as serious contenders in the June 7 
primary election. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 * In the crowded 70th Assembly District race, Republican businesswoman Marilyn 
C. Brewer has loaned her campaign $180,000 from personal and business accounts. 
In the same race, Thomas G. Reinecke has reported personal loans of $12,500. 
</P>
<P>
 * Jim Morrissey, a Republican candidate for the 69th District seat, loaned his 
campaign $60,000. One of Morrissey's June primary rivals, Judy Buffin-Edge, has 
raised a total of $9,600 -- one-tenth of Morrissey's total. Buffin-Edge has 
loaned herself $5,215. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgel L. Nickell, who ran unsuccessfully for the same seat two years ago, 
launched the current campaign with a $50,000 loan debt. It was unclear whether 
the $50,000 was a personal loan, and Nickell could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The only one bucking the trend in the 69th Republican primary, according to 
the latest campaign finance statement, was Martin Ageson, who has advanced his 
Assembly campaign just $1,872. 
</P>
<P>
 * Personal money also is fueling the supervisorial campaign of Huntington 
Beach businessman John A. Thomas, who with Tillotson has become a contender 
based largely on loans of nearly $50,000. But it is Tillotson who has dug 
deepest of any of the local candidates, reporting personal loans of $342,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson and others have defended their expenditures as calculated attempts 
to remain free from special interests who may seek to influence future policy. 
But others have cast a more wary eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Stern, co-director of the California Commission on Campaign Financing, 
called candidates' increasing reliance on personal funds -- especially in the 
form of loans -- among the "worst forms" of campaign money. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern said the potential for fund-raising corruption only increases in tight 
races where cash-poor candidates sometimes are tempted to stretch their 
fund-raising efforts to match their wealthy counterparts. Also, there are few 
rules that would restrict successful candidates from retiring their own debts 
with fund-raisers while in office. 
</P>
<P>
 In the worst cases, Stern said, the money advantages can discourage otherwise 
attractive candidates from even entering races. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money gets you an awful lot of respect and publicity in politics," Stern 
said. "What it can also do for wealthy candidates is freeze out those who don't 
have the same means." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime activist Shirley Grindle, who has helped author campaign contribution 
policy throughout Orange County, said the rules do not regulate personal loans. 
But she is considering amendments to local laws that could restrict how wealthy 
candidates use their money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a history to show that (personal loans) can create an 
artificial spending contest in a political race," Grindle said. "When election 
day gets close, people start to go crazy trying to match what the other person 
has. They refinance homes, forge signatures on checks and get caught up in that 
urge to win." 
</P>
<P>
 As the primary draws near in Orange County and candidates look to final 
campaign assaults to distinguish themselves from a crowded and competitive 
field, money is looming as a critical campaign concern, especially in the 
five-way supervisorial race involving Thomas and Tillotson. 
</P>
<P>
 The other main contenders, Linda Moulton Patterson and James W. Silva, both 
Huntington Beach City Council members who have been relying heavily on 
individual campaign contributions, said the recession has cut deeply into their 
fund-raising abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 And both have publicly criticized Tillotson's use of large personal loans as 
an attempt to "buy the election." Neither Moulton Patterson nor Silva, who have 
raised about $60,000 and $70,000 respectively by individual contributions, can 
come near Tillotson's loan totals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money is extremely tight out there," Silva said. "I had a fund-raiser 
recently where I made $3,000. Three years ago, that same event would have 
brought in at least $40,000." 
</P>
<P>
 With the race nearly certain to go to a runoff, Silva said the last weeks of 
the campaign will be extremely critical and could leave Tillotson with an 
advantage "that could sway the outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson, the Huntington Beach mayor, said the Tillotson money points 
up a need for campaign spending limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a real shame if it affected the election," Moulton Patterson 
said. "But I think people really respect candidates who go out and raise funds 
on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson and Thomas, however, see their campaign funding strategy as a much 
cleaner way of doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with virtually no political base, Tillotson sees her loans as 
equalizers in a race where Silva and Moulton Patterson have been able to use 
the power of their municipal offices to gain visibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had to at least double or triple our spending to build up name 
identification," Tillotson said recently. "I'm not denying that we have been 
successful in business," Tillotson said. "But I don't think a lot of money can 
guarantee anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a former Huntington Beach councilman, has literally papered the 
district -- from Costa Mesa to Huntington Beach -- with street and yard signs 
to place his name before the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Tillotson, Thomas said his reason for using personal loans was to show 
that he would not feel obligated to his contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only place you can raise money is from the special interests," Thomas 
said. "By not having to do any fund-raisers, I'm able to use my time better." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, who founded the Thomas Crane & Trucking Co. in Huntington Beach, said 
he will continue to use personal funds for the remainder of the campaign, but 
there are limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could probably afford it, but I won't spend that much," he said, referring 
to Tillotson's loan totals. "If you're out there spending that much, people 
begin to wonder why you want the job so badly."

BROKE WITH LAWYER OVER ACTIONS, SAY EX-PARTNERS; SUIT: TWO TESTIFY THAT JAMES 
D. GUNDERSON'S INHERITING GIFTS FROM CLIENTS' ESTATES AND INVESTING CLIENT 
FUNDS IN A PARTNERSHIP HE PARTLY OWNED LED THEM TO QUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two onetime partners of former lawyer James D. Gunderson testified Friday that 
they quit his law firm after they discovered that he was inheriting gifts from 
his clients' estates and also investing clients' money in a partnership he 
partly owned. 
</P>
<P>
 Sallie T. Reynolds and John Deily, who have since formed their own probate law 
practice in Laguna Hills, said they severed ties with Gunderson in 1990 after 
he had broken a promise to refer cases presenting conflicts of interest to 
lawyers outside the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The two lawyers were called to testify in a Superior Court suit alleging that 
Gunderson coerced a Leisure World man into leaving him a $3.5-million tax-free 
gift. The benefactor, Merrill A. Miller, died in February, 1992, at the age of 
98. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson, 69, has denied the allegations, saying that Miller was a close 
friend who had always wanted him to have the inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for Miller's other heirs want Judge Byron K. McMillan to order 
Gunderson to return the money. They say Gunderson has on several occasions 
inherited lucrative gifts from his deceased clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Reynolds and Deily testified that they had warned Gunderson that 
receiving inheritances from clients' estates could be improper. The warning 
came in 1988, they said, when they discovered that he had received a sizable 
gift from the estate of widow Emerald Mary Sully of Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, Gunderson inherited nearly $250,000 in AT&T stock from Sully, 
who had been declared senile four months before Gunderson prepared her last 
will and testament, in which he made himself the major beneficiary of the 
estate. Sully's other heirs sued, and Gunderson reached a confidential 
out-of-court settlement, which included a payment by Gunderson of $60,000 to 
settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds testified that the firm's partners met to discuss the issue after the 
Sully settlement and that Gunderson acknowledged then that he was involved in 
handling "one or two more" estates in which he was a beneficiary but promised 
to refer clients to independent lawyers for advice. Reynolds said that Linda 
Gunderson, Gunderson's daughter and a partner in the firm, then interjected 
that "there was more than one or two, and you ought to send them (the cases) 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 But Reynolds said she later discovered that Gunderson was still investing 
money from at least six clients' estates in a partnership named GWP, in which 
he had a financial interest. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she became "terribly frightened" and decided to end her 16-year 
relationship with the law firm, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said that she had inherited gifts -- worth $30,000 and $40,000 -- 
from two clients but that she did not prepare the documents that bequeathed 
those gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross examination from Gunderson's attorney, Stuart Lesansky, Reynolds 
denied that she attempted to extort from Gunderson 40% of the $3.5-million 
bequest from Miller's estate. 
</P>
<P>
 She acknowledged that a court ordered her and Deily to pay a $94,000 court 
judgment to Gunderson after the dissolution of the law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she felt hostile toward Gunderson, Deily said: "I feel betrayed. I've 
always prided myself on doing the right thing. They're trying to destroy my 
reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson's law firm has been embroiled in controversy since November of 1992, 
when The Times disclosed that he had inherited or otherwise acquired 
substantial sums of money from the estates of his clients. Gunderson retired in 
January after prosecutors for the State Bar of California said they were ready 
to file conflict-of-interest charges that could have led to his being 
disbarred. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunderson's attorneys have maintained that he surrendered his license because 
of failing health, not the conflict-of-interest investigation. Lesansky also 
said that Gunderson received gifts "a mere handful of times," and that each 
inheritance was a "unique circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
 Deily testified Friday that after The Times articles appeared, Gunderson asked 
for a meeting with him. Gunderson was "concerned and upset" about the newspaper 
stories, Deily said, and accused Reynolds of leaking information to the 
newspaper.  
</P>
<P>
 When Deily told him that Reynolds had not cooperated with the newspaper, Deily 
said, Gunderson commented that " 'It makes sense because she would be dragged 
into this too.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt sorry for Mr. Gunderson," Deily said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; POLICE ARREST 4 IN ROBBERY PLOT PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two months of investigation, Garden Grove police arrested four males 
Friday whom they had been following and whom they suspected were about to rob a 
home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers had watched the suspects' car pass by a house near MacArthur 
Boulevard and Flower Street several times, slowing each time, Sgt. Bump Willis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the residents of the house, a mother and three children, suddenly 
arrived home just after 3 p.m., police decided to move in, Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided for everyone's safety we were just going to get the (suspects') 
car away and get it stopped," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the safety of the residents in the area," police followed the driver away 
from the house before they made the arrests. In the suspects' car, they found 
an assault pistol with 30 rounds of ammunition and three pairs of gloves, 
Willis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two juveniles and two adults were arrested, and one juvenile was later 
released. The adults were Tuan Anh Nguyen, 19, of Garden Grove, and Yen Ba Ngo, 
21, of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 They were being held on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; PIER REPAIR DECISION SOUGHT BY TUESDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials hope by Tuesday to unveil a reconstruction plan for the Seal 
Beach Pier, which was damaged in a fire a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The city must decide whether to make temporary repairs to the historic wood 
boardwalk and reopen it for the summer tourist season or keep it closed for 
several weeks while permanent fixes are completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans to construct a temporary deck over the burned portion of the pier faded 
Friday because officials could not locate supplies needed for the job, City 
Manager Jerry L. Bankston said. The temporary repairs would not be covered by 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which temporarily stranded more than 100 people at the end of the 
pier, damaged several of the boardwalk's wood cross beams and supports, many of 
which must be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are not sure how long it will take to make permanent repairs. Lumber 
that was supposed to be used to fix damage from a 1992 pier blaze is stockpiled 
at a parking lot near the boardwalk and could be used for the project. But 
Bankston said more lumber is needed and that it might take weeks to get it from 
a mill. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, investigators Friday continued to search for the cause of the fire. 
They believe the blaze occurred when some sort of heat source brought onto the 
pier made contact with a plastic gas line that runs under the boardwalk from 
its base to Ruby's restaurant at the end of the structure. The "incendiary 
source" then ignited the gas line, officials suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been speculation that the fire started when hot coals from a grill 
fell through cracks in the pier deck and landed on the gas line. City laws 
prohibit barbecues on the boardwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators and city officials said they have no solid evidence that a 
barbecue caused the blaze. Investigators plan to interview a couple who said 
they saw a grill at the pier, Bankston said. Anyone with information about the 
fire is urged to call a 24-hour Fire Department hot line at (714) 744-0455. 
</P>
<P>
 Divers on Friday searched the ocean floor below the pier looking for evidence. 
They found debris from the fire, but no barbecue, Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankston said the city might eventually move the gas line or shelter it with 
some sort of protective covering. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; CHECK-CASHING FIRM OWNER SHOT, ROBBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a check-cashing business was wounded early Friday in a gun battle 
with two men posing as police officers who robbed him of $10,000, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money was recovered and one of the robbers also may have been wounded in 
the gunfire, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Martinez Fregoso, 53, told investigators that he was stopped outside 
his home in the 300 block of South Susan Street about 2:50 a.m. by two men in 
dark fatigues, who identified themselves as police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Dick Faust said Martinez was carrying the day's receipts from his 
check-cashing business. He struggled with the men and was shot in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who had a gun in his car, grabbed it and fired back at his 
assailants, Faust said. Martinez told police he was sure his shots hit one of 
the men, Faust added. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the assailants fled with the money in a gray van and the other fled on 
foot, Faust said. Officers spotted the van in the 200 block of South Jackson 
Street and chased it. 
</P>
<P>
 The pursuit ended at 7th and Sunset streets, where the driver abandoned the 
van and the $10,000 and ran. Police conducted a house-to-house search for the 
fugitive without success, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was treated at Medical Center of Garden Grove and released, Faust 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The van had not been reported stolen, police said. The robbers, who have not 
had been identified, were described only as in their 20s.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; MAN SENTENCED TO DIE IN 1989 MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 33-year-old Missouri man with a history of sexual assaults was sentenced to 
die Friday for the murder and attempted rape of a Fountain Valley mother who 
was on her way home to breast-feed her infant daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge told Timothy DePriest that the December, 1989, slaying of Hong Thi 
Nguyen, 26, was so cruel and vicious that the defendant deserved no mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The aggravating evidence is simply overwhelming," said Orange County Superior 
Court Judge Everett W. Dickey. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was strangled, shot, treated very brutally for no reason that I can see . 
. . treated as though she were a piece of garbage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuyen Ngo, the victim's husband, said he attended the sentencing hearing 
because he wanted to be sure that DePriest received the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 DePriest is the 29th person sentenced to death row from Orange County. He also 
faces a life sentence plus 57 years in his home state, where he was convicted 
of sexually assaulting a woman and shooting a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the murder, DePriest was on parole for a rape conviction in San 
Bernardino County. He had been charged in a second rape in San Bernardino, but 
in a plea agreement with prosecutors only admitted to a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender William G. Kelley said he believes his client's life 
should have been spared, in part, because DePriest is the product of an 
abusive, dysfunctional family.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; STATUE TO HONOR SURF LIFEGUARD INNOVATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For 30 years, Vincent G. Moorhouse dedicated his life to Huntington Beach and 
became a leader who made waves for professionalism among surf lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhouse, who died in 1992 at age 60, will be memorialized today with a 
hand-sculptured bronze statue of a six-foot brown pelican.The statue is planned 
to be placed near the city's lifeguard headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The statue will be unveiled during a ceremony that starts at 2 p.m. on the 
beach, south of Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 The money to pay for the $12,000 statue has been raised through a variety of 
fund-raisers, said Lt. Steve Davidson, of the Huntington Beach Marine Safety 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Those fund-raisers include the "Coastal Crusade," which began Monday and 
involved 15 lifeguards who joined a 120-mile run and swim along the Southern 
California coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants started near the Mexican border and headed north toward 
Huntington Beach and are expected to arrive in town early this afternoon for 
the ceremony, Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhouse was the city's lifeguard chief and a former community services 
director. He also was one of the founders of the World Surf Life Saving Assn. 
and United States Surf Life Saving Assn., organizations that share educational 
information and new lifesaving techniques, Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhouse was instrumental in making Huntington Beach a model for "surf 
lifesaving" standards, said Davidson, 45, a 26-year city employee who worked 
with Moorhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a major factor in the progress that there has been in this field," 
Davidson said. "He was a pioneer and innovator. . . . He was one of the leaders 
in the field in a profession that hasn't gotten much respect in the past."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SURFERS' AILMENTS PROBED BY COUNTY 
</P>

<P>
 The Orange County Health Agency is looking into whether a group of surfers who 
complained of severe sinus infections after a tournament near the mouth of the 
Santa Ana River could have picked up the illness from ocean water. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers said eight people have suffered head congestion and eye and ear 
infections after surfing from May 11 to 15 just north of where the river flows 
into the Pacific Ocean. Two of them called the health agency and said they 
thought pollution might be the cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly possible," that they contracted an illness while surfing, said 
Dr. Hildy Meyers, a county epidemiologist. "But it's extremely hard to document 
and prove." 
</P>
<P>
 She said officials are trying to determine if the two surfers could have 
gotten ill from surfing or if they picked up the disease someplace else. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers said the two surfers gave detailed information about their symptoms and 
whether they could have gotten ill from family members or from eating 
something. 
</P>
<P>
 "We encourage the others to call in also so we can look for common factors," 
Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 One surfer, Paul Gomez, said he thought he would get over a sinus infection he 
contracted during the tournament. But he drove himself to a hospital emergency 
room when he did not shake it by Sunday. Doctors concluded he was suffering 
from a severe viral infection and gave him medication to fight the pain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana River mouth is known as being more polluted than other Orange 
County beaches, especially after rainstorms when runoff washes down the river. 
</P>
<P>
 Corinne Clawson, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Sanitation Districts said 
water testers found higher-than-normal levels of coliform bacteria in the water 
at the river mouth on May 16. However, officials said the levels were not high 
enough to close the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers said the presence of the bacteria could indicate that the water in the 
area may cause illness in people. LYNN FRANEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Golden West College has received almost $800,000 in new funding from several 
state grants, college administrators recently announced. The grants will be 
used by the community college to expand its services and research, President 
Philip Westin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Golden West College has been actively pursuing grants as a way to bring in 
much needed non-tax dollars to support the college," Westin said. "We see these 
grants as one way for Golden West College to remain at the cutting edge of 
matching learning styles to teaching styles and making better use of technology 
to help students succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 The new grants received by the college include two aimed at helping 
handicapped students. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the grants received by Golden West was a $40,108 award for research into 
assessing language skills of deaf students. The college also received a $15,000 
grant for "improvement of access and success in science and mathematics for 
educationally disadvantaged students."BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CAMPAIGN LAW REVISIONS ADVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has moved ahead with plans to strengthen a 1993 campaign 
spending ordinance intended to keep stricter tabs on a candidate's campaign 
bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The council gave tentative approval to restricting a candidate's ability to 
transfer funds between campaign war chests. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if a candidate ran unsuccessfully for an office outside Anaheim, 
the candidate would be limited in the amount of leftover funds that could be 
used in a local campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 At most, the candidate could transfer $1,000 per contributor, but it would 
probably be less, depending on a formula that takes into account the percentage 
spent in the election outside Anaheim, according to City Atty. Jack L. White. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have tried to do here is to put everyone on the proverbial level 
playing field," White said at this week's council meeting. "It's rather complex 
and difficult to explain and maybe more difficult to enforce." 
</P>
<P>
 White said the new wording could be challenged in court on First Amendment 
grounds, but he believes the restriction would pass a legal test. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law is not totally settled in this area," added White. "But I think (the 
revision) is defensible." 
</P>
<P>
 The council also tentatively OKd two other changes to the July, 1993, 
ordinance. Both items would require candidates to report campaign contributions 
more thoroughly and to indicate what funds are being used to pay off old 
campaign debts. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to give final approval to the changes June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Political activists Shirley Grindle and Alexander Carrassi II, who originally 
proposed the modifications to the city in March, praised the council for 
tightening controls on candidates. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; MEMORIAL DAY OBSERVANCES PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Several Memorial Day observances to honor fallen veterans are scheduled Monday 
throughout Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Services will be held at El Toro Memorial Park, Pacific View Memorial Park in 
Newport Beach, Loma Vista Memorial Park in Fullerton, and Forest Lawn Memorial 
Park in Cypress. In addition, Buena Park Elks will hold an observance at Bellis 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The program at the El Toro cemetery -- the final resting place for almost 600 
U.S. veterans and for many South County pioneers -- will begin at 11 a.m. It 
will feature former county schools Supt. Robert D. Peterson, who served as a 
B-17 flying fortress commander during World War II. He was shot down over 
Austria in his 19th mission over Europe and was held as a prisoner of war for 
18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro Memorial Park is at 25751 Trabuco Road, Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 people are expected to attend the Forest Lawn observance, 
which will feature Capt. Harry E. Selfridge, commander of the Naval Surface 
Group in Long Beach, and Cypress Mayor Richard Partin. The program will be 
conducted on the forecourt of the memorial park's Ascension Mosaic. Several 
veterans groups are expected to participate, and music will be provided by the 
Western High School Symphonic Band. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Lawn is at 4471 Lincoln Ave., Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach Mayor Clarence J. Turner will read a proclamation and deliver a 
speech at Pacific View's 35th annual ceremony. It will begin at 11 a.m. at 3500 
Pacific View Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Brig. Gen. Milton Hunter, the commander of the South Pacific Division of 
Engineers, will address the 56th annual Fullerton Memorial Day observance at 
Loma Vista Memorial Park. The ceremony will begin at 10 a.m. at 701 Bastanchury 
Road. 
</P>
<P>
 In Buena Park, the public is invited to attend a 10 a.m. ceremony at Bellis 
Park, held by Buena Park Elks, post 2046. The park is at 8th Street and Knott 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire city is behind it," said John Curry, the event's chairman. said. 
"It's like a hometown get-together." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the event drew more than 400 people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13th annual event features a pancake breakfast from 7 to 9 a.m., sponsored 
by Buena Park Community Chorus. A $2.50 donation is requested. 
</P>
<P>
 The chorus will perform at the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 After the ceremony, Curry said, the Elks will host a free buffet and open 
house at their lodge, 7212 Melrose Ave. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; REFURBISHED LIBRARY TO REOPEN IN JUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the future looks gloomy for the financially beleaguered Orange County 
library system, readers here can expect their renovated branch to reopen by 
summertime, a county spokeswoman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The local branch -- the only public library in the city -- closed April 14 so 
the 22-year-old building in downtown Laguna Beach could be refurbished. 
</P>
<P>
 When the $500,000 project is completed, the library will be almost 800 square 
feet larger, allowing more space for books, computer work stations and a new 
local history collection donated by the Laguna Beach Historical Society, said 
Helen Lotos, community relations manager for the Orange County library system. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the building's lighting will be improved and a leaky and 
"energy-inefficient skylight" will be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building gets so much use, we finally came to the realization we had to 
do something down there," said Lotos, who estimates that the spruced up library 
will reopen by mid- or late June. "People are very happy the rooms are 
expanding and they are certainly happy about the skylight." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been little good news for the county's library system of late. 
Following severe budget cuts last year, a report released by the Orange County 
Grand Jury this week said some of the system's 27 branches will likely close 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach branch renovation is funded by Mello-Roos development fees, a 
system which allows local governments to tax homeowners to pay for roads, 
schools and other public facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The fees are being generated by development along the Newport Coast, an 
unincorporated stretch of land between Laguna Beach and Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Friends of the Library also contributed $50,000 to the restoration, 
Lotos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for re-roofing the University Park branch in Irvine, Lotos said the 
Laguna Beach project is the only county library restoration project underway or 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 "This renovation was planned in advance," she said. "We've really gone down to 
the bare bones maintaining the libraries that are there, let alone start a new 
project." 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Laguna Beach branch is complete, local readers can use the Dana 
Niguel Library on Pacific Coast Highway in Dana Point or the Crown Valley 
Library on Crown Valley Parkway in Laguna Hills, she said. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; RE-EMERGING WILDLIFE PROVIDES A SPECTACLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting in her car near an Irvine neighborhood, Cheryl Heffley saw something 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of black-shouldered kites were circling overhead, looking for prey. 
Suddenly the birds swooped down into a field, each re-emerging with a vole -- a 
small rodent resembling a mole -- in its mouth. Then, resting on a high-tension 
wire, the birds spent the next several minutes calmly eating their squirming 
morsels. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something you usually see," said Heffley, a wildlife biologist with 
the California Department of Fish and Game who specializes in Orange County 
wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 Except maybe about this time of spring. That's when the voles come out from 
their underground resting places to forage in the sun, becoming potential prey 
to birds. And all over Orange County, other wild animals and their new young 
begin emerging from the winter months to make their yearly appearances and 
start their life cycles anew. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the birds, there also are coyotes, foxes, raccoons, possums, 
rabbits, squirrels, rats, mice, bobcats, skunks and deer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is always the best time to watch wildlife," Heffley said. "You have the 
newborns, the young animals venturing out for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes they venture into residents' yards, causing problems. 
</P>
<P>
 This time of year, the number of calls to the county about wild animals in 
residential areas increases threefold -- to about 200 a day, said Dr. Richard 
Evans, chief of veterinary services for the Orange County Health Care Agency 
which, among its other duties, oversees animal control. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the calls are about birds, he said, and the rest have to do with 
possums, raccoons, skunks and coyotes, in that order. 
</P>
<P>
 "People see a possum taking a stroll with its babies on its back and they call 
us," Evans said. "There are significantly more calls at this time of year 
because there are more animals out there." 
</P>
<P>
 While the wild animals generally pose no health risk to humans, he said, there 
are occasional instances of skunks carrying rabies and coyotes eating small 
dogs and cats. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said his department responds to reports of bites or attacks on domestic 
animals by quarantining or destroying the wildlife involved. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said, the department will respond to a report of an injured 
animal by picking up the animal, attempting to rehabilitate it and eventually 
returning it to the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who spot a wild animal on their property are advised to leave it 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't touch, handle, feed or play with it," he said. "Just watch it, enjoy it 
and marvel that you have a wild animal in your back yard." DAVID HALDANE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; ELECTRONICS STORE, EMPLOYEES ROBBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At least three armed men robbed a consumer electronics company Friday, 
handcuffing six employees and loading a rental truck with compact disc players, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The intruders came to Advanced Marketing and Distribution in the 16600 block 
of Noyes Avenue just after noon.They initially pretended to be interested in 
buying stereos, then pulled guns and handcuffed employees, Irvine Detective 
Larry Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the employees were forced to lie on the floor of a front restroom, and 
two others were taken to a rear restroom, where they were robbed of wallets and 
rings. The employees were not injured, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers then took an undetermined number of Sony compact disc players. The 
three men, possibly joined by a fourth, left the scene in two vehicles, heading 
south on Jamboree Road.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; POLICE ASSN. PANEL SUPPORTS OFFICIALS

<P>
 A Fullerton Police Officers Assn. committee this week announced its support 
for four city officials facing a recall election June 7. 
</P>
<P>
 The union's Political Action Committee voted unanimously to back the 
challenged officials, saying its members will cast their ballots against the 
ouster of Mayor A.B. (Buck) Catlin, City Clerk Anne M. York and council members 
Molly McClanahan and Don Bankhead. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall effort began last July when the council voted 3 to 2 in favor of a 
2% tax on water, telephone, electricity, natural gas and cable television 
bills, despite objections from hundreds of residents. Catlin, McClanahan and 
Bankhead voted for the tax, saying it was necessary in order to save police and 
fire service which otherwise would have been cut. Council members Julie Sa and 
Chris Norby voted against it. 
</P>
<P>
 York became a recall target because she delayed the recall process when she 
rejected some petitions against the council members as faulty, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 145-member police association will be asked whether it wants to contribute 
money to the campaign against the recall, senior officer Dave Miller said. "We 
plan on asking members to help walk precincts and raise money because we just 
feel that the City Council members have acted responsibly in the past and that 
they do have a strong commitment to public safety," he said.MIMI KO

HAYDEN ACCUSES GOV. WILSON OF PLAYING ON FEARS OF RETIREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRIAN BALLOU, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Speaking to senior citizens at Leisure World here, Democratic gubernatorial 
candidate Tom Hayden accused Gov. Pete Wilson of playing on the fears of 
retired people to garner their votes in the upcoming election. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are truly representative of the majority voting public in California, and 
Mr. Wilson realizes that," the state senator from Santa Monica said."The 'three 
strikes' legislation is a ploy to get your vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said that Wilson, like candidates in other races, tend to focus on and 
overplay crime to get votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong, I'm tough on crime. I live in an area where it is a 
concern every day. But we need to attack it not from the point of building more 
jails, but curbing it before it happens through education. We are spending more 
money in California on crime than education." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden said he would make education his top priority and would work at 
reducing college fees. 
</P>
<P>
 His 30-minute afternoon speech, given almost two hours late because he had to 
cast a vote in Sacramento, was a departure from his regular speeches touting 
campaign reform and limitations on lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an insult to say that as you get older, you're only concerned about your 
fears," he said. "I believe that everybody is concerned about the quality of 
life in the future."

NUDE GARDEN GROVE MAN ON ARIZ. FREEWAY SHOT AFTER ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nude Garden Grove man walking on Interstate 10 was shot Friday after 
attacking a highway patrol officer, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Ricci, 23, was listed in stable condition in a Phoenix hospital after 
being shot twice by Officer Mike Bynaker of the Arizona Department of Public 
Safety, a department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Ricci apparently went berserk after being hailed by Bynaker. 
Officials didn't know why Ricci was nude, why he was on the highway or why he 
attacked the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bynaker had stopped to check an apparently abandoned truck on the highway 
about 12:45 a.m. when he saw Ricci walking in the highway's emergency lane in 
the nude. 
</P>
<P>
 Bynaker called to Ricci, who turned back and charged toward the officer, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bynaker sprayed pepper spray on Ricci in an attempt to stop him and then began 
using his baton when Ricci continued his attack. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ricci grabbed the baton, Bynaker fired at him twice. The first shot hit 
Ricci in the chest after passing through one of his hands, and the other shot 
hit Ricci in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the wounds, Ricci jumped toward the driver's side of Bynaker's patrol 
car and the officer slammed the door, inadvertently crushing the fingers of one 
of Ricci's hands. Bynaker then finally was able to handcuff Ricci, police said.

MAN CONVICTED OF MURDER IN BUSINESSMAN'S SLAYING; COURTS: BENJAMIN JIMENEZ, WHO 
DROVE ASSAILANT TO SITE OF SHOOTING, FACES MAXIMUM SENTENCE OF LIFE IN PRISON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Paramount man was convicted of first-degree murder Friday in the 
labor-related shooting death of Steven Leroy Henry, a Rancho Santa Margarita 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury deliberated less than four hours before convicting 
Benjamin Jimenez, 29, of murder with special circumstances of lying in wait and 
for financial gain, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Patrick Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez admitted to driving the shooter to the murder scene, but he testified 
that he was forced to do so and believed Henry would only be kidnaped, not 
killed, Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooter and the person who allegedly hired Jimenez to kill Henry have not 
been caught, and an investigation is continuing, Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the trial, it's obvious that there are still people out there who we 
believe are guilty of this crime. It's still an open case, and it's still under 
investigation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing was scheduled for June 27. Jimenez faces a maximum sentence of life 
in prison without the possibility of parole, Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry was killed in broad daylight at a Buena Park intersection Sept. 24, 
1992, just a quarter of a mile from the Lucky warehouse where he was headed to 
check on his "swampers," as the workers who unload tractor-trailers are known. 
</P>
<P>
 While Henry, 35, was at a traffic sign, a passenger got out of a car parked in 
front of him, walked to Henry's pickup truck, and shot several times through 
the driver's window, according to police accounts. The man then walked around 
the truck and fired again through the passenger window. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry and his wife started the Irvine-based West Coast Unloading Services 
Inc., which controls work at several local supermarket warehouses. The 
organization also provides workers' compensation and liability insurance at 
work sites and withholds taxes on workers' wages. 
</P>
<P>
 He launched the company in 1987 with an account with Lucky supermarkets, which 
has warehouses in Buena Park and Irvine. Henry also handled the Food for Less 
warehouse in La Habra. A week before his death, he had gotten accounts with 
Vons in San Diego and Ontario, according to Dick Rockwell, an attorney who 
helped the couple with some of the business's legal affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two of them had started the company. They worked very hard. They were 
growing. They had a lot of customers, and apparently their success made 
somebody mad," Rockwell said Friday. "To learn that the jury thinks they got 
the right person is gratifying, but it's not going to please anybody. . . . 
I've been around for a long time, and I do a lot of trial work, and this might 
be one of the most frustrating and saddest cases I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said evidence tied Jimenez and his car to the scene of the crime. A 
witness had seen him at the Lucky warehouse in Irvine on the morning of the 
shooting and on both days before the shooting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez testified that he was the driver but was forced into it and believed 
that Henry would be kidnaped, not killed, Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Jimenez, at trial, stated that it was someone named Chichi Rodriguez who 
approached Jimenez to have Henry kidnaped," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also named the alleged shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the stand he said 'Felipe' did the killing and showed a picture of 
Felipe," Donahue said. "It came down to a credibility contest. Perhaps Mr. 
Jimenez didn't have a lot of credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez' attorney could not be reached for comment.

MAN SENTENCED TO THREE YEARS FOR CONNING SENIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 24-year-old Los Angeles County man has pleaded guilty to conning two elderly 
residents by telling them they had won a sweepstakes. He posed as a police 
officer when one victim became suspicious and then robbed her, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenzo Duane Beamon, who used addresses in Long Beach and Compton, was 
sentenced to three years in state prison Wednesday in North Orange County 
Municipal Court. He pleaded guilty to five felony counts, including two counts 
of residential burglary for entering the women's homes under false pretenses, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Rosanne Froeberg, who prosecutes elder-abuse cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The scams took place in late April and May, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beamon telephoned the victims, both 83, and told them they had won $7,000 in 
the Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes, Froeberg said. He then told them he 
needed to come over with the check, and also get a blank check from them to 
cover administrative costs, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first woman, who suspected a scam, called police investigators, who 
answered the phone when Beamon called back the next day. He hung up, but later 
called back posing as an undercover officer. He then drove the victim to the 
bank, asked her to withdraw $800 as "material evidence" and fled with the cash, 
Froeberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beamon was arrested after the second victim called police while he was in her 
home, Froeberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a very smooth-talking, very articulate, very nice-looking young man. I 
can see why an elderly person would be very happy to open up their wallets to 
this young man," Froeberg said. "We view these cases as much more serious than 
a grand theft from someone who is not elderly and frail." 
</P>
<P>
 Beamon has a prior theft conviction and was sentenced to probation in Los 
Angeles County, she said.

MAN BURNED BY WIFE OVER CANDY DIES OF PNEUMONIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Carter, the 64-year-old cancer patient whose caretaker wife set him on 
fire two years ago after he ate one of her chocolates, has died of pneumonia, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the county coroner's office, Carter's death Thursday was 
unrelated to the serious burns he suffered in 1992. Carter died at Western 
Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter had been in the continual care of doctors since April 16, 1992, the day 
his wife, June -- tired of bickering with her husband and stressed out after 
years of taking care of him around the clock -- snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter had a rare form of breast cancer that had spread to his lungs and bones 
and was inoperable. He was also partially paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, his small, frail wife of 30 years had come home 
from a trip to the store to find that he had eaten her Easter chocolate bunny. 
</P>
<P>
 Enraged, the woman poured rubbing alcohol on her husband and lit a match. Paul 
Carter sustained second- and third-degree burns over 20% of his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally charged with attempted murder, June Carter, then 69, pleaded guilty 
in July, 1992, to felony elder abuse and was sentenced to a year in jail and 
five years' probation. But because of good behavior, she served only nine 
months at the Central Women's Jail in Santa Ana, according to the Orange County 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to reach June Carter Friday were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities, in the meantime, are assessing possible criminal ramifications 
from Paul Carter's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana police Lt. Bob Helton said that despite Carter's death from natural 
causes, "a death not related to (the burns) . . . we'll still run the case by 
the district attorney's office." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Rosanne Froeberg, who prosecuted June Carter, said she did 
not have enough information to decide if further legal action is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Coroner William King said there was no reason to believe 
prosecutors could make a case against June Carter based on Thursday's autopsy.

POP BEAT: MAKING IT IN THE MACHO RAP WORLD; CONSCIOUS DAUGHTERS, WHO SOME CALL 
THE BEST FEMALE GROUP IN THE GENRE, STEERS CLEAR OF VIOLENT, SEXIST TOPICS 
WHILE KEEPING CRUCIAL 'STREET QUALITY.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Rap is a man's world and for women rappers it's sometimes a hostile world -- 
where you have to walk on eggshells," says Karryl Smith of Conscious Daughters, 
which many consider the best female rap group to emerge in the '90s. "Sometimes 
it's like working with the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of hit rappers and their audiences is male and often seems 
to thrive on one of the favorite pastimes in rap circles: female-bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't let that bother you," says Smith, who, with partner Carla Green, 
recently had a huge hit with "Something You Can Ride to (Fonky Expedition)" -- 
one of the biggest hits ever by a female rap group. 
</P>
<P>
 "When guys use the word bitch , I don't get too upset," she says. "It's just a 
word." 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't that just a rationale? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not really -- but you do things you have to do to survive in this business," 
Smith says. "I'd like men to use nice, respectful terms for women but they 
don't -- and probably never will. We use the word bitch on our record too. It 
works in the context of our music. But there's uglier things in rap than men 
calling women disrespectful names." 
</P>
<P>
 The two 26-year-old women, who come from the Oakland area, steer clear of 
those uglier things -- like the excessive violence in gangsta rap. But their 
music, though generally positive, isn't exactly wholesome. Their debut album on 
Scarface/Priority Records, "Ear to the Street," is nowhere near as extreme as 
the music of some other female rappers, but it does include some crude language 
and images. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a street quality to what we do -- you need that," Smith explains. "If 
you don't use the same language the kids use, they won't want to hear your 
music. The problem is that they won't be able to relate to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith knows how crucial that aspect is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got into rap when I was about 10 because I could relate to what they were 
saying," she recalls. "Rap was just starting then but it had something no other 
music had. Black kids can relate to rap better than any other music because 
it's talking about what happens in their community." 
</P>
<P>
 When Smith and Green got mesmerized by rap back in the early '80s, they were 
high school students in El Cerrito, near Berkeley. Though they branched out 
into other areas, their passion for rap never waned. Both are 5-foot-10, and 
Smith made use of her height playing basketball at San Francisco State, where 
she majored in radio broadcasting. Green has been working in the computer 
business, developing software for computer games. On the side, though, they 
were building the foundation for a rap career. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hanging out at clubs working on our rapping and writing and looking 
for a break," Smith says. "We wanted to be rappers in the worst way." 
</P>
<P>
 Before ever recording an album, they had some minor successes, including an 
opening slot on a tour headlined by the group Fu-Schnickens. But their big 
break came at a party in 1991 where they met Paris, a prominent rapper who was 
looking to sign artists for his Scarface label.  
</P>
<P>
 Paris, who produced their debut album, was impressed by both their rap skills 
and their writing ability. He gave them free rein -- within certain limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't put anything out that was excessively violent or had a lot of 
negative images of the black community," he explains in a separate interview. 
"There are some references here and there to things like that -- but it's not a 
major theme of the songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Conscious Daughters, Paris insists, offer an honesty and reality missing from 
the work of what he calls the "fake" rappers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of record companies are putting together a bunch of pretty faces for 
hip-hop albums and have other people write all their music," Paris says. "It's 
not real and the fans know it. That's why a lot of these female rappers fail." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, though, points to another reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "These female rappers rap about stuff men don't want to hear about," she says. 
"We avoid doing that. Sure, we have songs geared to women, but there are so 
many male rap fans we don't want to turn them off. "What we don't do is shake 
our butts and flirt and tease and show men what we can do for them in bed," 
Smith explains. "That's the bimbo way. We can get our messages across and still 
maintain our dignity as women."

DIVIDED AIRWAVES SPLIT OLD ALLIES; RADIO: WHY WOULD OWNERS PIT KABC-AM AGAINST 
THEIR OWN KMPC-AM? IT'S 'THE COMPANY CANNIBALIZING ITSELF,' ONE STAFFER SAYS. 
OFFICIALS SAY THE GOAL IS TO CORNER THE MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ken Minyard, the longtime morning drive-time host and biggest ratings-getter 
at KABC-AM (790), is not pleased about his new -- and unlikely -- competition. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just that his friend and former KABC colleague Peter Tilden is now on 
opposite Minyard and partner Roger Barkley on KMPC-AM (710), it's that his own 
bosses created the conflict. KMPC is owned and operated by the same people who 
run KABC, and it was their decision to turn KMPC into a talk station that pits 
it against KABC and the separately owned KFI-AM (640). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's direct competition. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't concerned about 
that," Minyard said in a telephone interview. "I'm concerned that Peter was on 
so long at KABC, and the following he has comes from KABC. . . . I went in and 
expressed myself on the matter and my reservations were duly noted by our 
management. It seems curious, to say the least. I'm not the only one that has a 
question mark about this." 
</P>
<P>
 True enough. Another KABC employee regards the move as "the company 
cannibalizing itself." And veteran KABC host Michael Jackson said unhappily, 
"My feeling is there's one cake and you can divide it in just so many ways. 
We're all going to have to work harder." 
</P>
<P>
 Station officials acknowledge, but downplay, the intra-competition. Though 
they admit that KMPC may take away some listeners from KABC, they say the 
larger goal is to corner the talk-radio market collectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coca-Cola has Coke and Diet Coke; Procter & Gamble makes more than one brand 
of soap," said KMPC/KABC operations manager Al Brady Law. "All of a sudden we 
have the opportunity to broaden our reach in the marketplace by offering more 
products than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, he said, "If you don't want to listen to Michael Jackson discuss 
issues in his way, and you don't want to hear Rush Limbaugh discuss issues in 
his way (on KFI), you might want to hear about relationships (on KMPC). I want 
to supply alternatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Capital Cities Communications, which already owned KABC, bought KMPC in April 
from Gene Autry's Golden West Broadcasting for a reported $18 million. Three 
weeks ago, it discarded the low-rated all-sports format for a youthfully 
oriented talk format, or what is known in the industry as "young talk" or "hot 
talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Law and George Green, KABC/KMPC general manager, see KMPC's primary rival as 
KFI, not KABC. KMPC's promotional announcements repeatedly take aim at the 
station that -- thanks in large part to syndicated broadcasting giant Limbaugh 
-- has surpassed former talk-radio giant KABC over the past few years. KFI was 
No. 4 in the most recent quarterly Arbitron survey, covering last winter, while 
KABC was fifth, up from 11th in the previous three-month period. 
</P>
<P>
 "KFI did a superb job of positioning themselves as the young talk-radio 
station, positioning (KABC) as the old talk-radio station," said Green, who has 
been at KABC for 35 years. "But I think KFI can no longer say they're the young 
station in town." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the corporate directive at KMPC is to reach the younger demographic 
prized by advertisers, utilizing a hipper, more entertainment-oriented attitude 
than KABC. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a program director's delight," said Law, who is responsible for the 
programming decisions. "I have a sandbox here that has more toys in it than you 
can imagine. What I want to do is make KABC a place where there generally can 
be found a serious discussion of the issues. KABC is noted for that and I think 
the advent of KMPC allows us to continue that with KABC." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is grumbling within KABC's halls about the tone of the new station. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I impressed by that which I have heard at KMPC? Not in the slightest bit," 
said Jackson, the longtime host of KABC's 9 a.m.-1 p.m. show. "I don't see any 
of it actually getting a younger audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, who is currently in the midst of contract negotiations at KABC, said 
he finds the overall sound of KMPC lacking in professionalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what they're after," he said. "But, whatever the offer, I would 
not work at KMPC. I could work elsewhere, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all KABC staffers share Jackson's views. Lawyer Gloria Allred, who hosts 
KABC's 7-9 p.m. weekday slot, said that her competition at KMPC, Xavier 
Hermosillo, another ex-KABC employee, represents such a different point of view 
from hers (conservative to her liberal) that their shows will not be in direct 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I meet Xavier at the water cooler during the news break and it's always a 
little bit of a surprise to see him there," Allred said. "Then I realize he is 
on opposite me. But I don't ask him what he's talking about and I just don't 
feel threatened. It's strange because we were all one big team, one big family, 
and all of a sudden some of the people on this team are on another team, but 
it's still one family. And I have to think that Capital Cities knows what it's 
doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Several KABC insiders said they think the biggest area for contention is the 
morning matchup between KMPC's Tilden and Tracey Miller and KABC's Minyard and 
Barkley, who in the most recent ratings ranked second in their important time 
slot (behind Howard Stern on KLSX-FM). 
</P>
<P>
 "I can understand why Ken would be upset," said one KABC personality who asked 
not to be identified. "They're doing very well, so why suddenly say, 'We need 
you to go uphill right now and push this big rock'? I don't know what the sense 
of that move is." 
</P>
<P>
 Green and Law defend the decision, pointing to the different focuses of each 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, you're right -- if there's any show on (KMPC) that's more competitive 
with (KABC) than any of the others, it's Peter and Tracey," Law said. "But I 
think that's more a function of the time slot than anything else. I see Ken and 
Roger as the epitome of the radio magazine show, and I see Peter and Tracey as 
being more concerned with comedy."

INTRIGUING GAME OF TV ROULETTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The competitive matchups disclosed by ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox in their recently 
announced fall schedules are more intriguing than usual, from the frontline 
battle of programs to the long-range ambitions mapped out in executive suites. 
</P>
<P>
 For viewers, who will see 30 freshman series in the new prime-time lineups -- 
15 dramas, 13 comedies, one newsmagazine and "The ABC Family Movie" -- several 
matchups are sure to draw major attention: 
</P>
<P>
 * NBC is risking its top new series of this season, "Frasier," by pulling it 
from its cozy post-"Seinfeld" slot on Thursdays and sending it into 
head-to-head competition with ABC's "Roseanne," one of the best and 
most-established comedies on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 While NBC may be thinking that the public is wearying of the seemingly 
never-ending public adventures of ABC star Roseanne Arnold, there is also the 
possibility that her potent series will send "Frasier" into a ratings tailspin 
that could severely affect its momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Sundays, all eyes will be on Fox's newly acquired National Football 
League games -- swiped from CBS -- and how their lead-in will affect the 
tune-in for this highly watched night of TV, prized by advertisers and 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
 With CBS reeling from a one-two punch by Fox, which also this week swiped 
eight of its key stations in a daring raid that brought it 12 new affiliates 
overall, the thing to watch is whether -- and how -- the football games begin 
to have an impact on CBS' audience domination on Sundays with "60 Minutes" and 
"Murder, She Wrote." 
</P>
<P>
 Both long-running CBS series have benefited in the past from the football 
lead-in. And although the games only run until midseason, the impetus they 
provide for the network's Sunday lineup is probably a factor in keeping the 
audience in the habit of sticking with CBS on that night in the months that 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
 The other networks also hope to cash in on CBS' loss of the football games and 
finally make some progress against "60 Minutes" and "Murder, She Wrote," 
although the two aging series have proved to be durable television monuments 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, Fox, now possessing the football games -- and commentators long 
associated with it, including John Madden, Pat Summerall and Terry Bradshaw -- 
will use the contests to lead in to a new action drama, "Fortune Hunter," and 
"The Simpsons," which is returning to Sundays. These shows will be followed by 
Fox's "Married . . . With Children" and a new comedy, "Wild Oats," about a 
group of 20-somethings. 
</P>
<P>
 If football loosens CBS' hold on Sundays, "The Simpsons" and two other 
returning, high-profile series that have registered only mediocre ratings -- 
ABC's "Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman" and NBC's "seaQuest DSV" 
-- will be in place to make yet another assault at 8 p.m. on "Murder, She 
Wrote." 
</P>
<P>
 There are other intriguing matchups in the fall schedule, including Fox's 
increasingly popular "Melrose Place," which will be moved to Mondays at 8 p.m., 
taking on such sitcoms as "Fresh Prince of Bel-Air," "Blossom" and "Dave's 
World," as well as ABC's weekly NFL game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Melrose Place" could benefit from increased public attention to Fox as a 
growing network force, but the odds are that it will still have a rough time 
against the Big Three competition, although the show's hold on young viewers is 
formidable. 
</P>
<P>
 A key player in Fox's youth-oriented lineup is producer Aaron Spelling, who, 
in the coming season, will have three one-hour series on the network: "Beverly 
Hills, 90210," "Melrose Place" and its new spinoff, "Models Inc." The new show, 
with Linda Gray as the head of a modeling agency, will follow "Beverly Hills, 
90210" and try to make inroads against its key competition, ABC's potent "Home 
Improvement" and "Grace Under Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 By an odd twist, CBS, which has won the ratings crown for three consecutive 
seasons, goes into the 1994-95 shootout as the underdog in the eyes of many 
industry observers. Not only has the loss of football and the coming defection 
of stations over the next 1 or 1 1/2 years left a negative public impression 
but, more important in an immediate sense, CBS is running into the increasingly 
red-hot ABC network. 
</P>
<P>
 Dependent heavily on older-skewing dramas and unable to develop many pivotal 
blockbuster comedies, CBS also will be without four major sports happenings 
that helped it to the top in recent years: the World Series, the Super Bowl, 
the Winter Olympics and the weekly NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC, which might have won this season's ratings race if not for the Winter 
Olympics and the out-of-sight ratings propelled by the Tonya Harding-Nancy 
Kerrigan rivalry, seems well-armed for the coming season, with comedies galore 
-- 16 of them -- and many of them hits. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, ABC will have the Oscars, the Super Bowl and the World Series. 
The network was a solid winner in the May ratings sweeps, and it has come on 
strong as this season progressed. It had the No. 1 show, "Home Improvement"; 
the top new comedy, "Grace Under Fire"; the leading new drama, "NYPD Blue," and 
the highest-rated freshman newsmagazine, "Turning Point," a midseason entry. 
</P>
<P>
 Strengthened by such other comedy hits as "Coach" and "Full House," ABC has 
had the luxury to "hammock" some other new contenders, such as "Thunder Alley" 
and "Ellen" (formerly "These Friends of Mine"), between successful shows, thus 
helping them to successful launches. If they continue to deliver come fall, ABC 
will be even tougher. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, CBS and other networks were crowing that this has been a 
significant season for the networks, which actually went up in overall 
viewership despite new TV alternatives. The Fox station raid, while painful for 
CBS -- which could become more vulnerable to acquisition -- may be a further 
plus for networks and viewers because Fox chose to invest in free, over-the-air 
broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest, of course, is up to Fox programming -- not exactly on the dean's 
list in the past -- because viewers, in the end, watch shows and don't care 
what the number of the channel is. For the first time, however, Fox is reaching 
the potential -- in its station penetration -- to pass one or more of the Big 
Three networks in total household ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 With NBC moving both "Frasier" and "Wings" to Tuesdays, Fox will try to move 
in on Thursdays by leading off with two of its popular sitcoms, "Martin" and 
"Living Single." Both have black stars, but Fox dropped five other series with 
black headliners -- "South Central," "Roc," "In Living Color," "Sinbad" and 
"Townsend Television." 
</P>
<P>
 However, some breakthroughs may be occurring in the minority area. Margaret 
Cho, a Korean American stand-up comedian, has a new sitcom, "All American 
Girl," on ABC. And Latinos are starred in several series, among them Michael 
DeLorenzo in the police drama "Uptown Undercover" and John Leguizamo in a 
planned midseason comedy sketch show, "House of Buggin'," both on Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, despite CBS' three-year reign, despite the "Roseanne"-"Frasier" 
matchup, the key development of the new fall season could be a closer 
realization of a true four-network environment. Once upon a time, it was just 
CBS and NBC.

CANCELED 'NORIEGA' PROJECT TOO RISKY, OLIVER STONE SAYS; MOVIES: SCRIPT 
COMPLICATIONS AND $40-MILLION-PLUS PRICE TAG ALSO WERE FACTORS IN DROPPING THE 
FILM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the end, said Oliver Stone, creative complications with the script and 
financial risks in making a $40-million-plus film about Manuel Noriega 
outweighed the story he could tell about the former Panamanian strongman. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, the man who made such notable films as "JFK" and "Born on the Fourth 
of July," decided his movie "Noriega" -- which was to have starred Al Pacino -- 
would not be made.  
</P>
<P>
 "Certain films shouldn't cost as much as they do," the director said. "It's 
too risky." 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed strange that Stone was giving up the Noriega project. After all, he 
had spent months, off and on, making his own inquiries into the 1989 U.S. 
invasion of Panama, as well as scouting locations in Central America, charming 
Panamanian officials and even conducting a three-hour prison interview last 
November in Miami with Noriega, who is appealing a 40-year sentence for drug 
trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stone said he became frustrated as a dramatist by a "lack of conclusions" 
about Noriega and, finally, the Iran-Contra affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real story is probably too complicated (for a movie)," Stone told The 
Times this week in a telephone interview from Buenos Aires, where he is casting 
and scouting locations for his next film, "Evita." The long-delayed movie 
version of the Tony Award-winning Andrew Lloyd Webber musical is expected to 
begin production for Disney's Hollywood Pictures within the next year. "If 
(Special Prosecutor) Lawrence Walsh couldn't solve Iran-Contra, how could 
Oliver Stone?" 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Stone said, Noriega is a man with "some negative characteristics, 
who is not easily understood." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know him," Stone said. "I spent three hours with him in prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Movies with complicated story lines and ambiguous characters work, Stone said, 
when they are "done for a price." One example, he said, is "The Crying Game," 
which was nominated for the 1992 Academy Award for best picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone said movies today can quickly wind up becoming so expensive that it is 
difficult to justify them at that cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are pictures now costing between $80 million and $100 million," Stone 
said. "They're being accepted by rote. There is a madness in this thing that I 
was never part of. The most expensive picture I ever made was 'JFK,' which cost 
$40 million. I don't particularly like to make expensive pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone may still be reeling from the box-office failure of his last (not 
inexpensive) movie, "Heaven on Earth," the third in the director's Vietnam 
trilogy, which grossed a mere $5.8 million domestically. 
</P>
<P>
 Once projected costs of making "Noriega" climbed to between $40 million and 
$50 million, Stone said, it became "too risky." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked when it dawned on him that he had to halt the project, Stone said, 
"At 4 o'clock in the morning in a dream. . . . I was in hell. It wasn't easy." 
</P>
<P>
 The projected production costs had climbed rapidly, the director said, because 
there was considerable "map jumping" involved -- location shoots in Panama, 
Cuba, Europe, Miami and Washington, D.C. Since the film focused on the past 
four years of Noriega's life and the invasion of Panama, there also would be 
huge costs incurred staging battle scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the story itself was complicated, charting the rise of Noriega and his 
relationships with former President George Bush, Oliver North and Cuban leader 
Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem was trying to figure out how to tell Noriega's story in a 
two-hour movie," said a source close to Stone. "One day, Noriega is meeting 
with Bush. The next day he's meeting with Castro. The next day, he's meeting 
with some drug kingpin. It was just a bizarre multi-layered story that is not 
easy to tell." 
</P>
<P>
 One source said Stone left his interview with Noriega realizing he didn't have 
a lot to work with. Noriega had refused to be quoted regarding his legal appeal 
and any new evidence he may present. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone's own inquiries in Panama also didn't seem to fill out the story any 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like they (Stone and his associates) thought Noriega would be some 
great nationalist who had fought for his people . . . a Creole Bonaparte," said 
a source in Panama familiar with the project. "But they found out Noriega was 
just a weasel." 
</P>
<P>
 The source also said that while President Guillermo Endara's government seemed 
quite amenable to the movie production, there were numerous logistical problems 
typical of the tropics but probably infuriating to Stone's people. They wanted 
to see some of the old headquarters of the Panamanian Defense Force -- the army 
controlled by Noriega and disbanded in the invasion -- but found the place 
wouldn't open on the weekend. When they went to see Noriega's home, the man 
with the key, despite an order from a judge to let them in, simply didn't show 
up. It wasn't political, just incompetence, says the source. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone said when he made up his mind not to proceed with the film, he informed 
both Pacino and producer Arnon Milchan, whose company, New Regency 
Entertainment, was going to finance the film. Warner Bros. was going to 
distribute the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Some film industry sources suggested that a key factor in halting "Noriega" 
was a feeling that Pacino might not have had the box-office appeal to open the 
movie. They noted that Pacino's last film, "Carlito's Way," grossed only $36 
million domestically. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a dark, brooding look at a criminal," one source said of "Carlito's 
Way," noting, "Now, they were going to come back with another dark and brooding 
look at a criminal? If 'Noriega' was going to star Al Pacino, it had to be done 
for a price. Had 'Carlito's Way' done $75 million at the box office, I 
guarantee you 'Noriega' would be made today." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone, however, said Pacino was not the issue -- the Noriega story and the 
projected costs of location shoots were. "It's just the nature of the (film) 
business," Stone said. "The cost just grows and grows. I don't know the 
solution."

IN DEATH AND SUFFERING A CAREER IS BORN; TELEVISION: WITH 'WHEN DOCTORS GET 
CANCER,' SEPTUAGENARIAN RUTH DRAZEN HAS BEGUN A SERIES DEVOTED TO EXPLORATIONS 
OF HUMAN ADVERSITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 75, Ruth Drazen has begun a new life making films about death and illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Drazen, who until a few years ago had no filmmaking experience, has embarked 
on a journey to explore through film how people can live their lives more 
productively and lovingly by confronting the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most important and meaningful thing I've ever done with my life," 
Drazen said this week by phone from her Manhattan apartment. "Illness and death 
are all part of life. I want to be able to show people that we can learn to 
cope with suffering, that we can face adversity if we have love in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Drazen's maiden voyage in her journey, "When Doctors Get Cancer," airs Sunday 
on KCET-TV Channel 28. The one-hour documentary examines six physicians who 
find themselves re-examining the doctor-patient relationship when they or 
members of their immediate families learn they have cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a few of the physicians featured were treated successfully, others 
died soon after the documentary was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted the film to open the hearts of many people -- physicians and the lay 
public," Drazen said. "Doctors have their own mind-set about the psychological 
and physical pain their patients go through. But the public also has to make a 
big adjustment because many think the cure is just around the corner and they 
want to punish doctors if the results aren't right." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The impetus for the film was the death of Drazen's husband, who died in 1987 
after a 10-year bout with prostate cancer. "We were married for 28 years, and I 
was so vulnerable that I didn't think I could live without my husband," she 
said. "I thought that would be it for me. It was an enormous challenge for me 
to make a new life. It was very, very hard." 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, she was executive director of the National Genetics Foundation, 
a position she had held for more than 25 years. "I felt I understood the 
barriers between physicians and patients," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Drazen had no filmmaking experience, she did have some blood ties to 
the entertainment industry. Her brother, Bud Yorkin, is a prominent film and 
television director and producer. Her niece, Nicole Yorkin, and nephew, David 
Yorkin, are both screenwriters. 
</P>
<P>
 She embarked on the project alone, however, starting out like a young film 
student. She channeled her sorrow into making the film: "When I learned there 
were doctors who had cancer, I made appointments and spent a lot of time with 
them. They were very open, and they learned to trust me." 
</P>
<P>
 She intended to make the film for use in medical schools, and she obtained 
grant money from Cerenex Pharmaceuticals to that end. But the project 
eventually gained attention outside the medical community and won several film 
festival awards.  
</P>
<P>
 Now Drazen is working on a film on the management of pain in pediatric cancer 
patients, and on another looking at suffering and coping with it. A third film 
will deal with grieving. 
</P>
<P>
 She acknowledges that her subjects are not exactly popcorn fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's inevitable that we'll all be in that skin, and illness and death are 
part of life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we can face adversity if we have love in our lives. I'm finding that 
through making these films, I'm less fearful of my own inevitable death. I'm 
able to climb the mountain. Life has become very, very precious, and there is 
no end of possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
 * "When Doctors Get Cancer" airs at 4:30 p.m. Sunday on KCET-TV Channel 28.

</P>

 A proposed joint military-civilian use of the main runway at the Point Mugu 
Navy base could attract more than 2 million passengers annually, but demand for 
air cargo flights from such a facility would be limited, a draft study obtained 
Friday shows. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the concerns of Camarillo-area residents -- many of whom live near 
or under the Navy base's flight path -- noise generated by the extra civilian 
commercial flights would be negligible, according to the study by the Southern 
California Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
 A second study, due out this summer, will address the question of whether any 
airlines would agree to operate out of the Naval Air Weapons Station. A survey 
conducted of major airlines last year revealed that none was interested in 
operating out of Point Mugu, most citing the downturn in the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the plan said Friday that the study supports their contention 
that the area needs an airport to handle the estimated 1.7 million air 
passengers who call the county home and who now must travel out of Ventura 
County to get to a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really encouraged," said Richard L. Fausset, a Ventura businessman and 
one of the chief proponents of the Point Mugu project. "I think this shows that 
this is a proposal that will work. I'm really excited about this." 
</P>
<P>
 The feasibility study, researched by SCAG analysts for a countywide 
investigative committee, found that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Point Mugu is positioned in an underserved market between Santa Barbara, Los 
Angeles International and Burbank airports. If commercial service is developed, 
the airport could serve between 1.6 million and 2.49 million passengers 
annually by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 * Unless the proposed facility becomes an international airport, air cargo -- 
while generally appealing to county agricultural growers -- carries too many 
logistic problems and is prohibitively expensive. The only exception, the study 
states, could be the domestic delivery of fresh-cut flowers grown in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 * The total cost of converting the airport to joint use -- with a passenger 
terminal, parking lot and other facilities -- would be in excess of $153 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Other problems highlighted in the study include locating an acceptable site 
for a passenger terminal, meeting current and future state and federal air 
emissions limits, and finding ways to finance the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, which was authored by SCAG chief aviation analyst Tim Merwin, also 
found that a bomb and missile loading area and an ordnance assembly building 
next to the runway would have to be relocated at civilian expense because of 
military safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 But regardless of the drawbacks, Camarillo Springs resident Bill Torrence 
vowed Friday that his group, the Ventura County Assn. of Homeowners, would 
continue to oppose the project, adding that it has already begun a petition 
drive against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what that study says, this proposal will ruin our quality of 
life and, believe me, if we have to, we'll tie this thing up in court for 
years," Torrence said. "We are not going to let this county be turned into 
another LAX or Burbank." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Alpers, a Navy spokesman, said the study will help people make up their 
minds on the proposal based on fact and not rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this report as a good starting point," Alpers said. "It's one piece of 
a very large puzzle that is slowly coming together. However, what's important 
for people to understand is that we are still gathering information. We don't 
know everything about this yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea to open Point Mugu to civilian use was presented by Navy officials in 
March, 1993, as a way of defraying maintenance costs of the base's 11,000-foot 
main runway. After years of rejecting the idea, Navy officials made the offer 
because a steady decline in the number of military flights left them with a 
glut of unused flight time. 
</P>
<P>
 The SCAG report will be presented to the countywide Point Mugu Airfield Joint 
Use Investigative Committee at its June 1 meeting at the county airports 
administration offices at Camarillo Airport, 295 Durley Ave. The meeting starts 
at 10 a.m., and the public is invited to attend. (East Ventura County Edition) 
Forums on Point Mugu Navy Airfield Camarillo will hold a series of forums in 
the city during June and July on the issue of the proposed civilian-military 
use of the airfield at the Point Mugu Navy base. The public is invited to 
attend. All meetings will start at 7 p.m. at the following locations: 
</P>
<P>
 * June 2, Camarillo Springs Clubhouse, 6358 Irena Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 15, Camarillo City Hall, 601 Carmen Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 20, Las Colinas School gymnasium, 5750 Fieldcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 8, Leisure Village Recreation Center, 200 Leisure Village Drive West.

LOCAL CHINESE REACTION MIXED TO TRADE ISSUE 
</P>

 Chinese American business leaders in Ventura and Los Angeles counties said 
Friday that they support President Clinton's decision to reverse his policy to 
link China's trading status with its human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
 But pro-democracy activists said Clinton should have pushed his original 
position, and warn that it sends an ominous signal about human rights on the 
eve of the five-year anniversary of the Tian An Men Square massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, which is home to a growing Asian population, many Chinese 
residents said the day after Clinton's decision that the President had done the 
right thing because trade with China is too important to cut off. In Los 
Angeles, Chinese American business leaders also supported the President's 
decision to grant most-favored-nation status to China. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is more important," said Peter Chen, a Camarillo physician who 
immigrated to the United States from Taiwan in 1980. "China will be a strong 
economic partner in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Jue, whose family members were the earliest Chinese settlers in Ventura 
County, said every one gains from Clinton's reversal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to realize that this world is shrinking and we're dependent on each 
other for our economic well-being and survival," Jue said. "And as the old 
regimes begin to fade out and the newer leaders come on board, we'll see human 
rights improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Pan, store manager of the Hong Kong Supermarket in Monterey Park, said 
he gives Clinton hesitant support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good thing to do; both countries need the partnership," Pan 
said. "Of course, the human rights issue is pretty important, but . . . we 
should separate the issues and work on both at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Chang, a Thousand Oaks computer consultant and principal of the Thousand 
Oaks Chinese School, said Clinton should not have tried to dictate to China. 
</P>
<P>
 "I agree with the Chinese government," said Chang, who emigrated from Taiwan 
in 1979. "This is really an internal affair. The people there should be treated 
like people, but it takes time for a society or country to change. I don't 
think force is the right way." 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese American leaders in both counties said they thought that Clinton had 
bungled in the first place by making the issue so public during his 1992 
presidential campaign and during his first year in office. They said the 
President did not take into account the Chinese national character, which is 
concerned about "saving face." 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the Chinese government knows they are wrong, they don't want to lose 
face," said Arthur Chiou, chairman of the Conejo Valley Chinese Cultural Assn. 
"I don't think they will want to publicly admit they are wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 But now Clinton has lost face by backing down from his original stance, said 
Chris Wu, Monterey Park-based leader of the Alliance for a Democratic China, 
who opposed the President's reversal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the Chinese government is thinking thS. is soft," Wu said. "We're afraid 
for human rights in China." 
</P>
<P>
 Aline Yee Grossman, a fifth-grade teacher in Ventura, said she was 
disappointed by the President's action, although she characterized herself as a 
Clinton supporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents were refugees of the Communist takeover," said Grossman, who is 
first-generation Chinese American. "I remember their stories of how oppressive 
it was. I've never been there, but I'm not going until they improve how they 
treat people." 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by the decision to "de-link" human rights and most-favored-nation 
status, several pro-democracy groups plan demonstrations in front of the 
Chinese Consulate in Los Angeles on June 3 and 4, the anniversary of Tian An 
Men, when police opened fire on students rallying for democratic change and 
killed an unknown number. 
</P>
<P>
 But they appear to be in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very surprising. Last year, people were up in arms, but this year, I've 
rarely heard of an individual who doesn't support it," said Llewellyn Chin, an 
Alhambra attorney who is active in the Chinese American community. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some Chinese residents said it was unreasonable of the Clinton Administration 
to forcS. standards onto the Chinese, who have different values. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we can make policy on our standards and expect them to comply," 
said Patty Chan, a fifth-generation Chinese American who works as an 
occupational therapist in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Chinese Americans said they favored Clinton's decision because they 
feared that diplomatic relations with China would worsen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want that to happen again," said Joan Tang, an office manager in 
Camarillo. "We worked so hard to get back into China."

COUNTY MAY RECEIVE SALES TAX WINDFALL; FINANCES: EXTRA $3.4 MILLION IN 
PROPOSITION 172 REVENUES IS EXPECTED. FUNDS COULD BENEFIT FIREFIGHTERS OR PAY 
FOR JAIL BOOKING FEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County could receive an unexpected $3.4-million boost in sales tax 
revenue for public safety, a spokesman with the state controller's office 
confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 County leaders had predicted that Proposition 172's half-cent sales tax 
revenues would total about $26 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But a state report puts Ventura County's share at $29.4 million for the 
1994-95 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 "These numbers are based on the prior year figures and expected growth," said 
Edd Fong, spokesman with the state controller's office. "They will be pretty 
close to the actual numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Maffei, president of the Ventura County Professional Firefighters' Assn., 
said the increase is good news for firefighters, who were cut out of sharing 
$24 million that the county decided to spend on law enforcement, including the 
new Todd Road jail and the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's certainly going to help our position," Maffei said. "It will support 
what we've been saying all along, that there is money there for fire 
protection." 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Vicky Howard agreed that the extra revenue would bolster the 
firefighters' chances of getting part of the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said the board is waiting for the firefighters to come up with a 
spending plan before it decides how much to give them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the fire district gets their strategic plan together, I think some of the 
money should go to them," Howard said. "It's good to have this latitude to work 
with." 
</P>
<P>
 The news was also greeted with enthusiasm by city leaders, who are pushing the 
supervisors to spend part of the funds to cover the cost of booking inmates 
into jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "This clearly says the county now has the money," Simi Valley Mayor Greg 
Stratton said. "Now the question is, are they willing to give the cities their 
fair share?" 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders from each of the county's 10 cities signed a letter to the supervisors 
earlier this week asking that some of the funding be spent on booking fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this extra funding improves our case," Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank 
Schillo said. "I think there's enough there now to satisfy everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 If the supervisors agree to cover the $120-per-inmate booking cost with state 
sales tax money, cities could afford to spend more on police and patrol cars, 
Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities are asking for an initial $2 million to pay off booking fee debts, 
then about $600,000 a year to cover ongoing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Howard said she would rather use extra funds to balance the county's 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cities keep wanting to ignore the fact that the county has been hit much 
harder than the cities," she said. "I think we're going to be looking at doing 
what other counties are doing with part of these funds, which is covering 
deficits."

WARRIORS OF THE WEEKEND CLOG ROADS, CAMP AREAS; HOLIDAY: MEMORIAL DAY FORECAST 
CALLS FOR PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES, VERY CROWDED THOROUGHFARES AND BEACHES, AND 
COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF BARBECUE.

 Get ready for traffic jams, parking jams and campground jams. Prepare for 
overflowing outhouses and blanket-to-blanket beaches. Dig out the sun block and 
sandals and shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorial Day weekend starts today. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, thousands of Ventura County residents will hit the road this holiday 
weekend, seeking an out-of-the-way place to enjoy a mini-vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach their fun spots, however, they'll have to wade through the usual 
Memorial Day perils: heavy traffic, drunk drivers and people, people, people. 
</P>
<P>
 Several local campgrounds are already booked. Others will be full by tonight, 
with rangers turning away cars at the gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing we have open now is overflow camping" on a patch of 
hardscrabble dirt, said Art Caldara, who manages Lake Piru Marina. "The best 
way to describe it is that it's out in left field." 
</P>
<P>
 For those who want to honor the nation's soldiers, cemeteries throughout the 
county will offer special Memorial Day services. And for those in need of a 
patriotic exhortation, a 37-year veteran of the Marine Corps will deliver a 
stars-and-stripes speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library at 2 p.m. 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's fete in Ojai will splash the evening sky with colorful fireworks and 
rock the high school football stadium with music. And Monday morning, an 
hourlong show will highlight great moments in U. S. military history at Valley 
Oaks Memorial Park in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the organized events, thousands of county residents will revel in 
their own, often-chaotic spring flings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what people kick their summer off with," said Dave Bair, an employee 
at CISCO Sport Fishing in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather, at least, should cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologist Bruce Entwistle of the National Weather Service predicts morning 
fog followed by hazy or partly cloudy afternoons, with temperatures ranging 
from the mid-50s to about 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Patches of drizzle might fall here and there, Entwistle said, but "nothing's 
going to spoil" the weekend -- "unless you forget your sun block." 
</P>
<P>
 While sunscreen can take care of one holiday danger, vacationers should also 
watch out for other potential threats. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol officers arrested 40 people for drunken driving on 
Ventura County freeways during last year's Memorial Day weekend. And while 
they'll boost their staff by about 15 officers each day this weekend, the CHP 
recommends extra vigilance on the roads. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers should stay out of the fast lane, keep alert for weaving motorists and 
expect cars to zip through red lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aside from the drunk drivers, there will be all kinds of other people on the 
road in a hurry to get somewhere," CHP Officer Chris Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 They might be hustling, for example, to get to Mt. Pinos, a rustic wilderness 
tract on the border of Ventura and Kern counties. Already, most of the 52 
camping sites are reserved, even though Ranger Ken Jordan has warned of 
potential thundershowers in the mountains this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't seem to care," Jordan said. "If there's only a chance of rain, 
they'll chance it. Anything to get away for three days." 
</P>
<P>
 A similar attitude seems to be driving sales of backpacking equipment at Swiss 
Chalet in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that most beach and park camping grounds become zoos on Memorial 
Day, outdoor enthusiasts seem to be "heading more to the outback," said Mark 
Brown, manager of Swiss Chalet's mountain shop, where many weekend warriors are 
stocking up on supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 With the catch relatively good these days -- rock fish, barracuda and halibut 
are all biting -- sales of rods and reels have been picking up as well at Swiss 
Chalet, Manager Dean Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only time people can get off work, so it becomes a family-type 
event," Reyes said. "Usually, Memorial Day weekend is their second hit for 
fishing, after the trout opener." 
</P>
<P>
 Once they've purchased the gear, fishermen and campers can usually count on 
opening their wallets several more times over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrance fees, boat rentals and camping charges rack up quickly at Lake Piru 
Marina, where Caldara relies on Memorial Day to help fill his coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish we had four more of these holidays," Caldara said. "And four more 
Fourth of Julys, and four more Labor Days."

FIRM DIVIDED OVER PLANS FOR PEIRANO BUILDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two months after City Council members voted in a rancorous public hearing to 
raze Ventura's historic Peirano building, the development company planning to 
do the demolition is deeply divided over the deal and may not go forward with 
the building's purchase, company officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Wood, president of Ventura Realty, said his company's shareholders are at 
odds over his proposal to knock down all but two walls of the old Italian 
grocery to expose a Spanish laundry underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one of the five board members is strongly opposed to the deal and one 
major shareholder, Wood's uncle, former Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino, said he has 
also strong reservations about buying the building from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the company's board of directors will take the unusual step of 
letting the 25 shareholders vote on the proposal at their annual meeting June 
15. The shareholders generally do not weigh in on specific projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board members said they would wait (to vote on the project) until the 
shareholders meeting because the shareholders raised hell over the bad press," 
Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's sale of the old Italian grocery became a controversy in November 
when Ventura Realty said it planned to raze most of the crumbling brick 
structure to expose a lavanderi a underneath. Wood then hopes to restore the 
lavanderi a and surround it with a courtyard full of restaurants, shops and 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The lavanderi a , a 26- by 30-foot tile-lined pool, may have served as the 
laundry for San Buenaventura Mission, which is across the street from the 
Peirano building. 
</P>
<P>
 Angry residents jammed the council chambers and begged the politicians to 
reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the price tag running at $430,000 just to bring Ventura's oldest 
brick building up to present seismic standards, council members said they were 
not averse to tearing the structure down. 
</P>
<P>
 Peirano's Market operated on Main Street from 1877 to 1987, when the city 
bought it from the Peirano family with the intention of preserving it as a 
historic landmark. The now-empty building still sports cheery murals on its 
west wall advertising Borax laundry detergent and Ghirardelli chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura paid $150,000 for the property seven years ago. City officials soon 
realized, however, that the city could not afford to restore the building and 
agreed to sell it this spring to Ventura Realty at a loss of up to $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagomarsino does not think that the purchase is a good deal for Ventura 
Realty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, it's controversial, he said. For another, he does not believe 
that the company's retail development plan is a guaranteed moneymaker. And he 
wonders if it is the best use of a structure that the state lists as a historic 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I've read about it in the paper, I have really serious doubts," he 
said. "I wonder, why take on a controversial project when we're not sure of 
making money off of it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Cole, another shareholder and a Ventura native, said he is also uneasy 
about ripping down the building to make way for a new shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like old things," he said. "But if the cost (to preserve it) is so much . . 
. well, I'm torn." 
</P>
<P>
 Cole said he will wait to get more information at the June meeting before 
making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, city planners say they are tired of stalling on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to linger on for months and months, waiting for a negotiating 
agreement," said Everett Millais, Ventura's director of community services. 
"We're a little frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle, who voted against the project because he wanted to 
preserve more of the building, said he has heard the rumblings of discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a little disappointing, to go this far through the process, and assume 
certain things that aren't true, like that Ventura Realty is behind the deal," 
Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said he also is getting tired of waiting and may try to poll shareholders 
this week to get the city at least an informal answer before June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they may be inclined to look elsewhere for a developer if 
Ventura Realty's shareholders turn the project down. But a tenacious Wood 
insists that he still could be part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made the proposal, and I'm obligated as the president of the company to 
give Ventura Realty first dibs on it," he said, adding that he could find 
someone else to finance the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project is not dead if they say, 'No.' "

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; JAPANESE, U. S. STUDENTS PAIR OFF AT

 Pointing to a postcard in his folder Friday, 18-year-old Robbie Scherrei found 
that he had something in common with 17-year-old Megumi Ochiai of Japan. 
Scherrei's postcard was from Disneyland, as was a colorful button pinned to 
Ochiai's knapsack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was showing her that we're going to Disneyland for our graduation night," 
said Scherrei, one of about 100 Thousand Oaks High School students paired with 
visiting Japanese teen-agers from Kyomo High School in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a language barrier, some students managed to find mutual interests 
using pantomime, dictionaries and broken English. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most fun is when you get your point across," said Scherrei, who was 
sitting with Megumi in folding chairs listening to a student jazz band. 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural exchange began about 8:30 a.m. when the Japanese students arrived 
on a chartered bus about 45 minutes ahead of schedule. Touring the campus, the 
Japanese took a look at classrooms, art studios and athletic facilities on the 
sprawling 2,500-student campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking through an interpreter, 17-year-old Takayuki Matsumoto said he was 
most surprised by the large grassy areas on campus. Many high schools in Japan, 
he said, resemble vertical office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Japanese students did have one thing in common with their American 
counterparts: a love of jeans, baggy clothes and the hip-hop look. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks so American, but they have their own flair," said senior Bekah 
Estrada, who was paired with Katsumi Igarasai. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're into this big retro-'70s thing I really dig." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the visit to Thousand Oaks had been scripted ahead of time, 
improvisation was called for when a bomb threat forced early dismissal of the 
Moorpark Road campus Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 After receiving an anonymous call reporting explosives in a school locker, 
officials sealed off one end of the campus. The sheriff's bomb squad then used 
a robot to open the locker. It contained textbooks, papers and personal 
belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some kid might have heard a joke and someone else called it in," 
Sheriff's Sgt. Ken Warren said after the incident was over. Authorities said 
they had no reason to believe that the threat was related to the Japanese 
students' visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Lois Conrad, a science teacher who coordinated the visit, said the Japanese 
students were not told of the bomb threat because many were already nervous 
about crime and violence in the United States. The students were simply told 
that school would end early because of a power failure. "They didn't know the 
difference," she said. "They didn't know what the schedule was." 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese teen-agers' visit to Thousand Oaks was part of a four-day trip 
planned for 500 students from the same school. Another group of 100 students 
visited Rio Mesa High School near Oxnard on Friday. JULIE FIELDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County health officials have launched an investigation into the sale 
of damaged cans of infant formula and are warning the public not to purchase 
the potentially harmful baby drink. 
</P>
<P>
 The health department has received a number of complaints of damaged cans 
being sold at garage sales and swap meets, or advertised for sale in local 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The infant formula from those cans may be adulterated and might not be safe 
for consumption, health officials warn. 
</P>
<P>
 Infant formula manufacturers will not guarantee the safety of any product 
offered for sale by anyone other than reputable retail establishments, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Any damaged infant formula cans purchased from private parties should be 
discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials say infant formula cans with the following defects should not 
be purchased: 
</P>
<P>
 * Containers having a bulged end or lid. 
</P>
<P>
 * Containers that show visible evidence of leakage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Metal containers that are crushed out of shape to the extent that they will 
not fit in a case, stack on a shelf or cannot be opened with a manual can 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Needy families can get vouchers to purchase infant formula from the Ventura 
County Public Health Department. For information, call 652-5932. FRED ALVAREZ

 Local artists will set up their easels and sell their work Sunday on a 
Westlake Village tennis court to raise money for a cancer support group. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a continuing fund-raiser, the Wellness Community Valley / Ventura 
is sponsoring the art show on the grounds of the Emerald Forest Design House. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, a French chateau decorated by renowned designers and overlooking 
the North Ranch Country Club, has already drawn nearly 2,500 visitors since it 
opened in early May. The $15 house tour ends June 5. 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the art sale proceeds, as well as the ticket revenues, will go to 
support the Wellness Community. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is dedicated to helping cancer patients cope with their illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The house on Oxley Road is a five-bedroom mansion with a sweeping staircase 
and marble foyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Its rooms were finished by 16 California interior designers, including Tony 
Duquette and Hutton Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
 The art show runs from noon to 5 p.m. Sunday and includes artist Neil Boyle 
and Mark Ivy. 
</P>
<P>
 The house tours begin at 10 a.m. Wednesday through Sunday. Doors close at 4 
p.m.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SCHOLARSHIP FUND SET FOR FOSTER CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to give foster children a leg up when the law forces them out on their 
own at age 18, the Ventura County Public Social Services Agency has set up a 
scholarship fund, an official said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund will offer financial aid to foster children who by law must leave 
home at 18, but who lack money to support themselves and continue their 
education, said Barbara Fitzgerald, the agency's chief deputy director. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency is building the fund on a $5,000 donation left by the estate of 
Thomas J. (Johnny) Donovan, a longtime Ventura County resident who wanted 
children to benefit from the inheritance, Fitzgerald said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is to be called the TEACH Fund, which stands for Training and 
Education for Achievement by Children. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald said the agency is seeking donations to the fund, and is hoping to 
draw from interest earned to pay for future scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 The donations are being managed by the Ventura County Community Foundation, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster children interested in the scholarships must file applications by June 
15, and the agency will award money in July, Fitzgerald said. MACK REED

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; LAW LIMITS LOCATIONS FOR ADULT BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adult businesses will be banned from all but Ventura's industrial areas under 
a law unanimously approved this week by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The law prohibits adult-oriented businesses from locating within 200 feet of 
each other, and within 500 feet of a church, school, residence or other place 
where children might be. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law suggests the streets between Victoria Avenue and Arundell Avenue, 
south of the Ventura Freeway, as the largest area in the city where 
adult-oriented businesses might locate. 
</P>
<P>
 Various residents have asked the city to consider prohibiting such businesses 
entirely. The city's attorney has warned that doing so would violate the First 
Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; MAN FOUND INNOCENT IN MOTORIST'S DEATH

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 44-year-old Upland man was found not guilty Friday of misdemeanor vehicular 
manslaughter stemming from a 1992 traffic collision that killed a Port Hueneme 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura County Municipal Court jury listened to eight days of testimony and 
deliberated two days before returning the not guilty verdict against Anthony 
Garcia. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Alcantar Tapia, 51, was killed when his van collided head-on with a truck 
driven by Garcia near the entrance to a produce market at 3000 Hueneme Road, 
the California Highway Patrol said. The jury deadlocked 6 to 6 before clearing 
Garcia of any wrongdoing, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher S. Harman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia did not have any alcohol or drugs in his system, lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney George Eskin said prosecutors contended that Garcia was 
speeding and driving with defective brakes. But Eskin said that the wreck 
occurred on rain-slick streets in Oxnard and that a tractor-trailer parked on 
the road played a role in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was sticking out into the highway, and it was a factor in the accident," 
Eskin said. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; CITY REJECTS PLEA TO RELAX SMOKING RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to relax Ojai's far-reaching anti-smoking ordinance was rejected by 
the City Council this week, despite pleas from citizens and restaurant owners 
to change the strict new law. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai's ban on smoking, which was adopted last December, goes beyond 
restrictions adopted by other Ventura County cities by prohibiting smoking in 
outdoor eating areas. 
</P>
<P>
 That aspect of the ordinance, restaurant owners say, hurts their livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff decided to bring the issue back before the council after numerous 
complaints from residents and restaurateurs. In addition, nine of 14 local 
restaurant owners surveyed by the Chamber of Commerce said they wanted a 
smoking section in outdoor areas. But only four of the 14 entrepreneurs blamed 
the smoking ban for driving away customers.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's hurting me, it's hurting the city," said Antonio Aguilera, owner of 
Antonio's restaurant, at the council meeting. In a letter to the city, Aguilera 
said the ban has had a "devastating effect" on his business, resulting in about 
a 30% loss of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the meeting, council members questioned whether the ordinance or the 
recession was responsible for the decline in restaurants' revenues.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to see anyone suffer a loss of business," Mayor Pro Tem Nina 
Shelley said during the meeting. "But I think if we start eroding this 
ordinance, it would be a mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 After a heated discussion of health issues associated with secondhand smoke, 
the council voted 3 to 2 to leave the ordinance as it is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smoke does not know the difference between smoking and nonsmoking areas," 
Mayor Joe DeVito said. "I would not support changing (the ordinance) at this 
time and that is for health reasons." TRACY WILSON

 Two 16-year-olds from Camarillo were arrested and charged with attempted armed 
robbery early Friday after approaching two skateboarders and demanding money, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11 p.m. Thursday, two juveniles driving a Cadillac pulled up next to two 
20-year-old men skateboarding near Santa Rosa Road and Verdugo Way, and asked 
for their money while brandishing a revolver, according to Ventura County 
Sheriff's Sgt. Mike Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
 The skateboarders told them that they had no money, and the youths drove away 
empty-handed. The skateboarders memorized the car's license plate and called 
911. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found the abandoned Cadillac less than a mile away and traced the 
youths by contacting its owner. 
</P>
<P>
 They were arrested a few hours later. MARY F. POLS

SMOKERS' ADVOCATES FAIL IN BALLOT DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of smokers' rights advocates opposed to Camarillo's recently adopted 
smoking ordinance were unsuccessful in obtaining nearly 3,000 signatures needed 
to bring the smoking issue before city voters in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Camarillo's smoking ban, which was approved by the City Council 
last month and goes into effect today, were short 1,364 signatures of the 2,937 
needed to place the referendum on the November ballot, City Clerk Marilyn Thiel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a cursory review of the petitions Friday night, Thiel determined that 
the group had not collected enough signatures to have the measure as a 
referendum this fall. She added that of the signatures the group obtained, many 
appeared to be invalid. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Walden, owner of Dorothy's Chuckwagon Cafe and spokeswoman for the 
group, presented Thiel with the signatures at 5 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have enough," she said quietly while walking out of City Hall an 
hour later. "I had no idea. We just picked them up and rushed over." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the smoking ban were collecting signatures in restaurants and 
other public areas right up to the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Walden said that if the group had another week, she believed that it could 
have obtained the necessary signatures. The group did not begin collecting 
signatures until May 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only had about 20 days to do this," Walden said. "It's just a really short 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo resident Ken Williams, whose name was among those on the petitions, 
waited outside City Hall for the final numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an extremely short amount of time," he said. "Plus, people have never 
done this before." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Johnson, a Camarillo restaurant owner who opposes the smoking ban, said 
Friday, before the signatures were tallied: "If it doesn't go, it's not because 
we didn't have the support. It's because we didn't have enough time. None of us 
have ever done these things." 
</P>
<P>
 Walden said she plans to meet with Thiel on Tuesday to investigate the 
possibility of a ballot initiative and intends to take out papers in July for 
the City Council election in the fall. Walden would not say whether the papers 
would be for herself or someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the petition drive was spearheaded by a core group of about 10 
to 15 people, many of them restaurant owners, with various local residents 
pitching in to collect signatures. But the lack of time and manpower made the 
effort difficult, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo Mayor Ken Gose, who voted in favor of the tougher smoking law, said 
he never saw anyone collecting signatures for a referendum opposing the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not terribly surprised," Gose said of the lack of signatures. "If they 
had had more time, they might have been able to (get the signatures)." 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo's ordinance effectively bans smoking in most public places in the 
city, including all restaurants and most businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo is the fifth Ventura County city to adopt tougher smoking laws. 
Ventura County has passed a similar ordinance for the unincorporated areas of 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said the ordinance is going to hurt local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be some restaurants closing," he said. "I guarantee it."

TENANTS MAY DELAY JANSS MALL WORK; THOUSAND OAKS: BUILDING OF NEW ANCHOR STORE 
COULD BE PUT OFF UP TO TWO YEARS. SIX MERCHANTS HAVE NOT YET AGREED TO MOVE 
DURING RENOVATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stalled negotiations between Janss Mall management and several long-term 
tenants may delay construction of a new anchor retail store for up to two years 
during the mall's $50-million renovation, according to mall owner Bill Janss. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase of construction on a new Mervyn's -- envisioned by Janss as a 
key component to revitalization of the mall -- was due to begin in June and be 
finished by the fall of 1995. Now Janss said it is unlikely that any 
construction will begin before August. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, he said, problems with tenants may force management to temporarily 
put aside the Mervyn's project and focus instead on building a nine-screen 
movie theater and entertainment center. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Janss hoped to keep most of the mall open throughout the renovation, 
management planned to temporarily relocate 18 businesses within the 65-store 
mall. But six have not yet agreed to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a few unhappy tenants with short-term leases," Janss said. "We have 
not been able to reach a reasonable agreement with them. A couple of them have 
two years left on their (leases)." 
</P>
<P>
 He said two tenants have asked for $1.2 million to buy out their leases. "We 
can't pay that," he said. "It's not reasonable. They're asking for about as 
much as 30 years profit on their stores." 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for leases to run out on the stores -- Brown Bag Deli and Thousand 
Oaks Sewing & Vacuum -- could mean postponing the grand opening of Mervyn's 
until the summer of 1997, Janss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Rubenstein, director of the Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce, said he 
hoped that cooperation on both sides would ease the stalemate. Ultimately, the 
renovation will benefit both management and tenants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rubenstein said he believed that Mervyn's is already concerned with one 
potential pitfall to building in Thousand Oaks: the city's strict sign 
ordinance, which could prevent the Hayward-based company from erecting the type 
of markers it wants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's presumptuous of other tenants to throw another monkey wrench into the 
works," Rubenstein said. "Mervyn's is without a doubt going to be the draw to 
the center." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Mervyn's spokeswoman said the company's first concern is with persuading the 
City Council to approve five-foot-high lettering on the store and a separate 
sign at the mall entrance. Both would violate city rules. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are aware of the negotiations" over relocation, Kathy Blackburn said. "But 
we're not involved, and our real priority is the signage." 
</P>
<P>
 To build the 75,000-square-foot Mervyn's, the Brown Bag Deli -- a 13-year 
fixture on one corner of the mall -- would have to be demolished. But owner 
Joel Steinberg is refusing to give up his lease and move. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been offered a chance to move to the mall's new food court, next to the 
entertainment center, which will include a movie theater, a Barnes & Noble 
bookstore and Blockbuster Video. But Steinberg doesn't want that. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a grander plan of expansion in mind, one for his present location, 
where he said he has built a loyal customer base by offering hefty sandwiches, 
magazines and up-scale beers. Several years ago, he began selling beer-making 
equipment and offering classes in brewing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to do an upscale restaurant and brew pub," he said, taking out an 
artist's rendering. "We don't want to be in the food court, next to some taco 
place. That would be the wrong image." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg had plans for the restaurant drawn up two years ago, shortly before 
Janss management announced plans to renovate the mall, which was built in 1960 
and still evokes that style. He said management approved the plans without 
telling him what lay in store for the mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Relocating could cost him valuable business, he said. Already, faithful 
customers are quizzing him on how long he will hold out as stores around him 
disappear. He handed over a catering request as proof. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to place an order for a 3-foot sandwich for Saturday, May 7, 
1994. However, are you still going to be in business on that day?" it reads. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers at Yogurt Plus, situated between where the new movie theater and the 
food court will be, are asking owner Bruce Markowitz the same type of 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You heard anything yet?" Stacie Stocks asked anxiously as Markowitz handed a 
yogurt-filled cone to her. She drives to Yogurt Plus three times a week from 
Newbury Park and has been buying Markowitz's yogurt for about five years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Markowitz has not reached an agreement with Janss management either. His tidy 
little shop has been in the mall for eight years, and he said it took him six 
months just to build the counters and kitchen area, and install all the 
equipment. Relocating twice, once for construction and again when the food 
court is complete, could cost him a year's worth of business, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
 He has six years left on his lease and while he is not asking $1.2 million for 
it, Markowitz alone could hold up the entertainment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't throw me out," Markowitz said. "They can't condemn me. Maybe I'll 
just stay. Then I'll end up in the main lobby of the movie theater selling 
popcorn." 
</P>
<P>
 Janss said he hoped to come to an agreement with the tenants before that 
happens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a pragmatist," he said. "I'm assuming that these tenants are going to 
reach some sort of reasonable accord. It doesn't do them any good not to."

BANK TO CLOSE QUAKE-DAMAGED CREDIT CARD UNIT IN SIMI VALLEY; BUSINESS: FIRST 
INTERSTATE DIVISION'S 500 EMPLOYEES WILL BE TRANSFERRED PERMANENTLY TO L. A. 
WORKERS HAD BEEN BUSED THERE SINCE JANUARY. 
</P>

<P>
 First Interstate Bank announced Friday that it will pull 500 employees out of 
its earthquake-damaged credit card center in Simi Valley and transfer them to a 
less expensive site in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank has been busing employees from Simi Valley to temporary quarters in 
the First Interstate building at 1200 W. 7th St. in Los Angeles since two days 
after the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the bank will make the move permanent, according to a prepared statement 
by Michael Walker, senior vice president and manager of the credit card 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor seriously damaged the interior of First Interstate's 
180,000-square-foot building at 1700 Surveyor Ave., Simi Valley. There, 
employees had processed credit applications, handled credit card accounts and 
provided other services to several million holders of credit and ATM cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank is rehabilitating the three-story building in Simi Valley, but plans 
to sell or lease it rather than move its 500 employees back in, Walker's 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 "First Interstate Bancorp announced in March plans to significantly reduce the 
company's expense levels over the next year," the statement said. "As a result, 
the Bank Card Division needed to explore all possible options to reduce its 
operating expenses." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton said Friday that the move might not be a bad thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is they have continued repairing the building and are very 
interested in getting it sold," Stratton said. "We may be able to work with 
them in getting a new user in there, and the result, of course, will be that 
not only do the old (occupants) have a job, but the new ones will have a job 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said city officials began hearing about the planned move late last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials told bank executives "that the work force in Simi Valley is 
better than the work force you're going to get in L. A.," and that if employees 
leave the credit card division for other jobs to avoid the commute, they will 
be replaced by workers of a lower caliber, Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been talking to them and trying to convince them there's other things 
they've got to consider (than cost), but their minds were pretty well made up," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank expects to save $3 million a year because of the relocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Division workers will be allowed to keep their jobs and continue living in and 
around Simi Valley if they choose. The bank will continue to provide free bus 
rides to the new offices in Los Angeles through July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 It will also continue through September to subsidize employees with children. 
Those workers had to pay more for child care because of the increased time 
spent on the commute, Walker's statement said. And the bank will offer 
severance pay to workers who want to seek jobs closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank will also work closely with city and county officials and real estate 
brokers to advertise the Simi Valley building to prospective tenants and 
buyers, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton conceded that the city cannot offer potential occupants the types of 
tax breaks it often does to entice companies to build new buildings in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the building is equipped with a high-tech security system that 
might prove attractive to certain types of businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 It could serve "any number of businesses that deal in devices they want to 
keep secure, whether it be computers or records storage, or on-line retrieval 
systems." 
</P>
<P>
 "We really hate to see First Interstate go, because they've been a good 
citizen in the community," he said. "It's like a neighbor moving away that was 
a good friend."

FLOOD CONTROL CHANNEL STALLS; ADDED COST CITED; THOUSAND OAKS: CONTRACTORS HAVE 
BEGUN LINING THE WALLS WITH ROCKS TO PREVENT LOOSE SOIL FROM SLIPPING INTO THE 
CRATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A flood control project that prompted protests from neighbors who feared that 
it would drain a Thousand Oaks wetland will take an extra six weeks to complete 
and cost an additional $160,000, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 During construction of the flood control basin, which was originally scheduled 
to be completed this week, contractors have been continuously pumping ground 
water from the land next to the environmentally sensitive area and sending it 
through an underground pipe into a storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
 The pumping could seriously harm the wetland if it goes on for too long, a 
state regulator said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they continue pumping into the dry months, and there is a drought, there's 
a good possibility the water-bearing soils will dry out," said Ken Wilson, an 
environmental specialist with the state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to see the areas downstream of this project being desiccated 
because of some construction delays," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the delays were caused by problems with loose soil 
around the 30-foot-deep crater, which was excavated next to Reino Road between 
Lynn Road and Kimber Drive. Contractors have begun lining the walls with rocks 
to prevent the loose soil from slipping into the crater. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed, the basin is supposed to catch debris as it flows down flood 
channels, to prevent the channels from clogging during a big rainstorm. The 
project was approved as part of emergency measures taken to prevent flooding 
after the Green Meadow fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The six-week effort to line the basin with rocks will increase the price of 
the project from $878,453 to more than $1 million, according to Ed Gunen, 
division engineer for the Ventura County Flood Control District.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And, while the Federal Emergency Management Agency is expected to pay 75% of 
the project cost, that money has been withheld until an environmental review is 
done. In addition, the cost increase will need to be negotiated, FEMA spokesman 
Russ Edmonston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, payment for the whole project is on hold, so I'm not sure what 
will happen with the increase," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gunen said he is confident that the initial costs of the project will be 
covered and that FEMA will pay the $160,000 in cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if FEMA refuses to pay the additional costs, that burden would fall 
on the flood control district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the funds available to pay for that, if need be," said Art Goulet, 
the county's director of public works. "But we're hoping FEMA will agree to 
cover it." 
</P>
<P>
 Goulet said he could authorize the additional funds for the project because of 
its emergency nature. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors has not been involved in funding aspects of 
the project. But supervisors received a letter regarding environmental concerns 
about the basin at this week's board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The May 10 letter from Thousand Oaks Mayor Elois Zeanah sharply criticized the 
flood control district for failing to perform an environmental review before 
beginning construction of the basin. 
</P>
<P>
 She requested that the supervisors "consider completing the environmental 
assessment and analysis prior to the completion of the project." 
</P>
<P>
 Goulet said a response to Zeanah's letter has not yet been prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gunen said the county began studying the ground-water's movement last week 
after installing three monitoring wells near the basin. It will be several 
weeks before data from the wells will show whether continued pumping of ground 
water will harm the wetland, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not going to do any good to have an environmental analysis after all the 
damage has been done," Zeanah said. "It sounds to me like the county has not 
been responsive to our concerns or the concerns of the constituents."

METROLINK TRAIN HITS, KILLS MAN TRYING TO SAVE DOG IN SIMI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS and MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<P>
 A man who was apparently trying to rescue his dog from an oncoming Metrolink 
train was struck and killed by its engine as it traveled westbound through Simi 
Valley on Friday afternoon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, a white male who appeared to be in his 30s, had not been 
identified late Friday, according to Simi Valley police. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident marked the second Metrolink fatality ever in Ventura County and 
the fourth fatal Metrolink accident so far this year, said Peter Hidalgo, 
spokesman for the commuter rail line. Ventura County's first fatal Metrolink 
accident occurred on Christmas Eve, 1992, when a Simi Valley man committed 
suicide by jumping in front of a train. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the victim in Friday's accident was thrown about 30 feet into 
dense brush north of the tracks and was believed to have died instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 His small black dog was also killed. Its body landed about 30 feet from its 
owner, according to authorities with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department, which patrols the Metrolink rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident happened at 5:25 p.m., just before the train pulled into the Simi 
Valley station, authorities said. The man was walking with his dog along the 
tracks near Katherine Road when the train came through the Santa Susana tunnel 
and approached them going about 50 m.p.h., Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy 
Joseph Marko said. 
</P>
<P>
 The engineer spotted the man and began sounding the train's horn, Hidalgo 
said, adding that the man appeared to hear the horn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man tried to reach down to get his dog and was struck," Hidalgo said. "In 
an effort to save his dog, he gave his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Standing near the site of the accident, Marko called the accident "a real 
waste." He said the dog was not on a leash. 
</P>
<P>
 As he spoke, onlookers wandered close to the right of way at Katherine Road. 
Several of them had dogs, none on leashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Marko pointed out in an interview: "All rail property is private property. It 
is a violation of law to walk along or across the tracks." 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo said Metrolink has tried to communicate to the public that being on 
the tracks is both unsafe and illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "But people think that it's a nice path to jog along or walk along because it 
is off the streets and there is no traffic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The train, which had left Los Angeles at 4:26 p.m., was en route to Oxnard at 
the time of the accident. No one on board was injured.

COMMISSION TO CONSIDER LIFTING BAN ON COYOTE TRAPPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lifting the controversial ban on coyote trapping will be one the options 
before the Los Angeles Animal Regulation Commission on Tuesday when it takes up 
the issue, city officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The other three options before the citizens panel are to continue the ban 
indefinitely, to allow trapping only under limited circumstances or to allow 
for limited trapping but charge a fee for the trapping service, according to 
city officials and a draft report obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's review of the city's coyote trapping policy comes 11 months 
after a previous commission voted -- at the behest of wildlife advocates -- to 
halt all trapping by city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 But that decision has drawn a flurry of protest, primarily from hillside 
residents in the San Fernando Valley who fear the end of trapping will leave 
pets and children vulnerable to coyote attacks. Wildlife advocates have 
defended the ban as humane and reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over trapping climaxed on March 23 during a community meeting in 
Woodland Hills that drew dozens of residents, wildlife advocates and wildlife 
experts. At that meeting, the commission asked Gary Olsen, general manager of 
the Animal Regulation Department, to make a recommendation on the coyote 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But Olsen and the Animal Regulation Department have shied away from making a 
recommendation, deciding instead to offer the commission four options. 
</P>
<P>
 The first three options were outlined in a draft report dated May 20: 
</P>
<P>
 * Continue the ban. Under this option, the department would concentrate on 
educating the public on ways to coexist with the animal. "The focus of the 
education process, in part, is to remind pet owners of their responsibility to 
protect their animals," the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide trapping but only after certain criteria are met. The criteria 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 An Animal Regulation official must first visit the home of the resident 
reporting a coyote problem and make sure the resident has received the 
educational information provided by the city about coyotes. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, the resident must comply with recommendations made by the Animal 
Regulation official to make the home less vulnerable to coyotes. Such 
recommendations may include installing taller fences, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Trapping may also be allowed when a coyote is believed to have rabies as a 
result of an attack on a person; when a county, state or federal agency 
mandates it due to public safety concerns; or when a coyote is sick or injured. 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide trapping so long as the above criteria are met, but charge the 
resident a "cost recovery" fee for the trapping service. The report does not 
specify how much the fee would be. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Friday, department spokeswoman Nancy Moriarty said a more 
recent version of the report drafted Thursday includes a fourth option: to lift 
the ban and allow trapping without specific criteria and without a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Moriarty said the final draft was sent Friday for approval to Olsen, who was 
on vacation. The final report will not be released to the public until Tuesday, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents parts of the West Valley, said she 
submitted a recommendation to the department that is nearly identical to the 
option that allows trapping under limited circumstances but requires a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Under her option, the fee would vary depending on whether the trapping was 
successful or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick said she doesn't believe trapping will completely solve the coyote 
problem but wants the city to provide some limited trapping if residents are 
willing to pay for the costs of the service. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Mayor Richard Riordan said the mayor's office has tried to 
help find a resolution to the debate that will appeal to all sides. But as of 
yet, Riordan has not backed any particular option, said Riordan spokesman David 
Novak. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's commission meeting will be held at 10 a.m. at the Animal Regulation 
Department's Downtown offices at 419 S. Spring St.

PUMP DOWN THE VOLUME; SOMETIMES SOFTER IS BETTER, SAYS JAZZ GUITARIST THOM 
ROTELLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Contemporary jazz and consistently high volume seem to be inseparable 
partners. But Thom Rotella doesn't see it that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Rotella plays electric guitar and his band offers a lot of 
pop-oriented original material, he likes to keep his sonic levels in motion, 
going from not-so-loud to fairly soft. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sense of drama and emotion" when you change dynamic levels, says 
Rotella, who leads his five-piece ensemble at Randell's in Santa Ana tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like playing quieter," Rotella, 41, said recently. "There's a certain 
intimacy that comes with lower volume levels, a different kind of 
communication." 
</P>
<P>
 Rotella feels that playing quieter does not mean his band packs less of a 
punch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our band creates a lot of energy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a handle on things when the group does get loud, Rotella has recently 
returned to an old friend, performing on the Gibson L-4 electric guitar he 
first played jazz on, when, in his late teens, he was working in his hometown 
of Niagara Falls, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to play strictly acoustic guitars with a pickup, but I find the L-4 
makes volume easier to manage, sonically," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotella basically sticks with a format of energized, groove-based tunes, 
melodic pop-jazz numbers and pieces with a Latin or Brazilian flavor. But 
employing the L-4 suggests other types of tunes -- straight-ahead jazz tunes 
such as John Coltrane's "Impressions" or Wayne Shorter's "Footprints." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll play something like that once in a while," Rotella said in a phone 
conversation from his home in Venice. "I like the different feel of the swing 
beat. It can be exhilarating. The chord changes give me options for different 
colors and textures to explore. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's almost nostalgic," he said. "It brings me back to the kind of 
playing I did when I was in Boston at the Berklee College of Music (1970-72), 
or in Niagara Falls, when I was 21, playing in an organ trio with Ronnie 
Foster," referring to the keyboardist from Buffalo, N.Y., who has gone on to 
considerable popularity since moving to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But mostly, Rotella goes with his meat-and-potatoes offerings of pop-based 
material that easily reaches an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like a mix of accessible music and things that are more far out, but I 
guess I want to appeal to people," he said. "I think a lot of people who come 
to listen to music respond with a purely emotional feel, and having part groove 
tunes (in my repertoire) is another way of reaching those people. Plus, pop was 
part of what I grew up with, so it's part of my musical expression." 
</P>
<P>
 Rotella began playing guitar at 10 -- his grandfather also played the 
instrument -- and two years later he had first band, playing rock. At 14, he 
began to listen to jazz; he says he was knocked out when he first heard Wes 
Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 After his stint at Berklee, and some time in New York, Rotella moved to 
Southern California in 1973, establishing himself as a session guitarist. His 
solo performing career took off through a series of albums for the DMP label, 
the latest of which is "Without Words," recorded in 1990. The albums continue 
to sell -- "I get royalty checks" -- and receive airplay nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Rotella recorded for DMP on an album-to-album basis and is working on a new 
project, which he plans to shop around upon completion. He's also been playing 
on a hip-hop recording project for another artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some of that is seeping into my music, as some pieces become funkier, 
more hip-hop-ish," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While he makes most of his living writing jingles for TV commercials, Rotella 
is ripe to put his performing career on the front burner. To that end, he's 
been playing at clubs from Pasadena to Venice to Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 He last performed at Randell's in March and says he's looking forward to the 
return engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowd was really responsive, really paying attention, and when that 
happens, there's a certain magic, a feeling that is unbelievable," he said. "On 
a night like that, you can feel the emotion of the audience right with you, and 
it's kind of like one big band at that point." 
</P>
<P>
 * Thom Rotella plays tonight at Randell's, 3 Hutton Centre Drive, Santa Ana. 8 
p.m. to 1 a.m. No cover, $10 minimum. (714) 556-7700.

<P>
 Time has a way of eroding moments that once seemed etched in memory. 
</P>
<P>
 After 100 years, memories are not always precise recollections of the sort 
historians treasure. They are feelings and unshakable beliefs left over from a 
lifetime of living. 
</P>
<P>
 You remember the way the waitress at a Jim Crow cafe down South "shooed us 
away, just like we was a bunch of chickens," but not the day the civil rights 
bill was passed. 
</P>
<P>
 You remember when you first "received the Holy Ghost," but not the year the 
Supreme Court handed down Brown vs. the Board of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 You remember -- if you live to be 101 years old like Mercury Adams of Pacoima. 
"The Lord had brought me through some hard trials and tribulations, but he 
brought me out," Adams said, sitting on the couch at home, firm in her 
conviction. "I know he brought me out so I could witness for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Mother Adams, as she is known in Pacoima, is a woman whose faith in God is the 
most distinguishing characteristic of her life -- and it is what her 
conversation always returns to when she discusses her first century on this 
Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 On a coffee table in the home she has lived in for more than 40 years sits a 
blue-covered, family-size King James Bible. On the wall above two TVs hangs the 
colorful paintings she created years ago at the senior citizens' center: one of 
Mary, Joseph and Baby Jesus, another of Moses with the Commandments. There are 
also plaques, trophies, commendations and a letter of birthday congratulations 
from President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 On a stand below is a bottle of the olive oil she uses when anointing and 
praying for those in need -- like the man across the street who couldn't sleep 
after his wife passed on. Or the man who stopped mid-conversation and asked her 
to pray for him and his young wife after he realized he was speaking to a 
centenarian. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little things like that, that's what I call my personal work," she said. "I 
know the Lord left me here for a reason." 
</P>
<P>
 At a luncheon ceremony at the Pacoima Senior Citizens Multipurpose Center this 
week, Adams was honored by representatives of local politicians and more than 
60 seniors for her lifetime of contributing to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's a woman of peace," said the Rev. Alicia Broadous-Duncan, the center 
director. "She's set an example for many of us over the years with her love for 
her God and her people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Adams grew up in Cuero, a south Texas town about 100 miles from Houston and 
San Antonio. She was born April 6, 1893, just a bit more than 30 years after 
President Abraham Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' father was a Baptist minister. "He named me after the Greek god of 
speed," she said. Her mother worked as a maid. When she and her older sister 
Elsie were old enough, they worked as maids, too, "cleaning the white people's 
houses." 
</P>
<P>
 After their father died, Adams watched as her mother struggled to raise her 
two daughters with only her faith in God and the support of a few relatives to 
help her through. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though my mother was a widow, we never was hungry and we never begged," 
she said. "Some of these young people today don't know what it's about. If they 
would only look to God. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her voice trails off and then she struggles to remember the biblical verse: 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been young and now I'm old, I've never seen the righteous forsaken or 
his seed begging bread." 
</P>
<P>
 In Cuero and later Mission Valley, white people celebrated the Fourth of July 
while African Americans held Juneteenth celebrations commemorating June 19th, 
the day slaves in Texas learned they were free. 
</P>
<P>
 Life in those towns was segregated and education for African Americans limited 
by racism and the need to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I left school after the seventh grade," she said. "The rest was experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of experience she learned from observing the older people in her 
life, like her mother, who used the only thing she had available -- flowers and 
herbs -- to heal her children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know what a doctor was in those days," Adams said, standing in her 
yard next to a bush of yellow roses. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, when the sisters had fevers, "she went out and got some wild flowers, 
put us in a tub of water and put a blanket around us and broke the fever," 
Adams recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 In that time and place, raising children was a community affair. Neighbors 
watched out for each other and children obeyed adults, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honey, we had to walk a chalk line," Adams said. "Mama would get on us. When 
Mama was at work, the neighbors would get on us." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1936, Adams moved to Los Angeles, back when "it was quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 "You never heard of crime," she said. "Me and my husband used to go to church 
at night. We never was attacked or bothered." 
</P>
<P>
 They later lived in the community of Val Verde and worked at Dudley's Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was when Val Verde was at its high peak," she said. "People came on 
weekends and holidays. Big crowds." 
</P>
<P>
 She remembers the road trips back to Texas, to visit friends and family, and 
to Bakersfield. Jim Crow was present on both journeys. 
</P>
<P>
 At a cafe on the way to Texas, after traveling "all night long," she and her 
companions were told they could not eat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The young men was rising up," she recalled of the time. "They said, 'That's 
what we're fighting for now, to break down segregation.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Adams spent most of her working years in California as a maid, first as a 
live-in, then doing "day work." 
</P>
<P>
 She still remembers the families: the Gilmores in Hermosa Beach, the Lizzas in 
Newhall and a family in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to work for $3 a week and was glad to get it," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christ Memorial Church of God in Christ had its beginning in Adams' home on 
Hoyt Street in Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 When the church leader decided to found a church, Adams and her husband 
offered their garage. For more than a year church members gathered there, 
contributing "nickels and dimes" until a new building could be acquired, Adams 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pacoima, feeding the hungry and elderly is part of Adams' legacy, 
Broadous-Duncan said. She and others "took food down to Gonzalez Park and fed 
the seniors who didn't have food," Broadous-Duncan said. "They saw a need and 
filled it on their own, without money."  
</P>
<P>
 And for years, she volunteered at the community center on Herrick Street. 
</P>
<P>
 These days Adams is both delighted and appalled at some of the changes she has 
witnessed over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 She was pleased to see the advancements in civil rights won by the struggles 
of people like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. "He was a great man," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lack of jobs for young people is troubling. It seems worse now, she 
said, than during the years following the Depression. The way some families 
have deteriorated, the lack of a sense of responsibility to each other is also 
bewildering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Used to be young people took care of the old," she said. "Now the government 
takes care of them. Now everybody is separate. . . . It's the ruination of 
young people." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 She spends her days now taking care of the many flowers in her yard, going to 
church and sharing what she has from a "cupboard that stays full" with others. 
</P>
<P>
 Her cousin, who retired and returned to Texas after living in Inglewood for 
years, recently built a home in an area where African Americans could not live 
when Adams was younger. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can go and build a home anywhere now," she said. "You couldn't do it 
when I was there. That's the only reason I'd like to go back is to see that 
boy's house."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SENIORS DEVELOP A BOND WITH DISABLED YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The seniors are coming! The seniors are coming!" yelled Robert Perez, 
announcing the arrival of his senior citizen friends, as he ran down the 
pathway to the play area of Calamigos Ranch in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez is himself a senior -- a senior high school student at Leichman, a 
school for the developmentally disabled. He and 14 other Leichman seniors 
treated 16 senior citizens, whom they befriended five years ago, to a picnic 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths and the senior citizens became friends when they met at the food 
court of the Fallbrook Mall in West Hills. The Leichman students were on a 
field trip as part of a program designed to foster understanding of the 
community's disabled, as well as to help the disabled improve their social 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to gain acceptance for whoever we are," said Pearl Bush, a teacher at 
Leichman, adding that she has found that senior citizens are "very accepting of 
our population." 
</P>
<P>
 The senior citizens don't belong to an organization, but they congregate 
almost daily at the mall, where they walk for exercise, visit with other 
seniors or exchange tips on horse racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Hanson, 79, who calls himself the unofficial mayor of Fallbrook, recalled 
the day he met the youngsters: "One day, the gal that runs the pretzel and 
cheese said, 'How would you like to play ball with some handicapped kids?' and 
we said, 'Sure.' " Ever since, the senior citizens have sponsored a variety of 
projects and events for the children, including weekly bowling nights, softball 
games and parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Minerva said he enjoys being around the disabled youths because, "You give 
them just a little bit of attention, a little love, and they think you're 
giving them the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Keya Darby, who will be graduating from Leichman and moving on to New Horizons 
where he will learn work skills, said he especially likes playing softball, 
basketball and bowling with his older friends. "We just have fun with them," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Student Ryan Johnston said he appreciates the events the senior citizens have 
put on for his class. "I want to thank them for all the things they've done for 
us." MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; 2 HORSE BOARDERS FACE LOSS OF PERMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CROGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Planning Commission's Office of Zoning Administration on 
Friday ordered two commercial horse-boarding businesses to comply with Building 
and Safety Department standards within 90 days or lose their permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, these kinds of actions are only taken in very serious cases, like 
motels where prostitution or illegal drug sales are occurring," said Joe 
Perica, associate zoning administrator. "This was just our way of getting these 
people's attention and telling them that the clock was striking midnight on 
these violations." 
</P>
<P>
 At issue were longstanding failures by Hillcrest Ranch, on Zelzah Avenue, and 
Damoor Farms, on Rinaldi Street, to comply with several requirements attached 
to their permits to operate. Both are in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillcrest Ranch, which now boards 35 horses, is owned and operated by Shari 
Steinberg. Its permit, issued in 1989, came with the proviso that Steinberg 
obtain all necessary county health permits and building and safety permits for 
exiting structures, set aside on-site parking for 10 cars, control dust and 
store horse manure in covered containers.  
</P>
<P>
 She also agreed to build a bridle path and improve the road on the part of 
Zelzah that fronts her property.  
</P>
<P>
 Damoor Farms, operated by Roland Davis and his daughter, Michelle Valentine, 
received a permit in 1986. In 1991, they were reported in violation of city 
codes for failing to obtain permits for existing and new structures, to correct 
electrical and plumbing problems and for the storage of an unlicensed motor 
home on the property.  
</P>
<P>
 Building and Safety Investigator Galyn Taylor said Friday that both sets of 
owners had now made substantial progress toward compliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a compromise, Steinberg agreed to grade and improve her road, build a 
bridle path and complete the permit process on her buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis and Valentine agreed to obtain permits and complete repairs on all 
existing buildings, replace their motor home with a newer model and complete 
electrical repairs. JIM CROGAN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: GROUP TO HELP QUAKE VICTIMS CUT RED TAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most frustrating things about being an earthquake survivor is 
having to deal with huge bureaucracies that put you on hold, hang up on you or 
tell you that you just missed being eligible for aid. 
</P>
<P>
 A new organization has sprung up that promises to be in quake victims' corner 
when they tackle problems such as inadequate insurance payments, contractor 
fraud and government red tape.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's so important for them to hear, 'Let me try for you,' " said C. George 
Kehrer, executive director of Community Assisting Recovery (CARE), which has 
set up shop in Northridge. "They need human contact outside of those 
bureaucratic voices that say, 'That's not my job description.' And people are 
so vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Working in donated office space at 11145 Tampa Ave., Suite 19B, Kehrer, two 
other victims of the 1991 Oakland fires and Northridge quake survivor Kathy 
Trapani take about 40 calls a day. Most people ask what to do about an 
insurance adjuster's damage estimate that seems too low. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kehrer came to CARE as a survivor of the Oakland disaster, the group 
emphasizes its local roots. In fact, it split off from United Policyholders, a 
Northern California-based consumer group dealing with insurance issues, to 
focus on specific concerns of earthquake victims and broaden its mission to 
include non-insurance issues.  
</P>
<P>
 Next month, the group will hold separate meetings for policy holders of 
different insurers so they can meet and talk about their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The following meetings are scheduled: 
</P>
<P>
 * Thursday -- Farmers networking meeting, Unitarian Society, 9550 Haskell 
Ave., North Hills, 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 7 -- Meeting for policy holders whose insurance companies do not have 
their own meeting, Unitarian Society, 9550 Haskell Ave., North Hills, 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 9 -- Allstate Insurance meeting, Cal State Northridge University Club, 
7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 10 -- 20th Century Insurance meeting, St. Euphrasia Church, 11766 
Shoshone Ave., Granada Hills, 7 p.m.. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 12 -- CARE open house at its Northridge offices, 3 to 5 p.m.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; MARINES WILL SALUTE THE REAL DOGS OF WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They say every dog has its day -- even if it's 50 years coming. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, there are 25 dogs who -- thanks to a retired Woodland Hills 
veterinarian -- will receive belated honors for making the ultimate sacrifice 
in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 William Putney, commander of the Marine Corps war dog units in Guam in 1944, 
plans to revisit the scenes of battle July 20 and dedicate a cemetery on the 
island for his dogs, who for decades were buried in a neglected jungle patch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to make a speech," Putney said in a Virginia drawl. "It's 
going to be terribly emotional, and I just hope I don't screw it up." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a massive gala planned for the 50th anniversary of the liberation 
of Guam, the 25 Doberman pinschers and German shepherds who served and died on 
the island will receive a belated ceremony with full military pomp, including a 
21-gun salute and the attendance of the top brass in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs -- used as sentries, messengers and scouts in the rugged island 
battles -- originally were buried at Asan beach, where many had come ashore. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a typhoon wrecked the graveyard in the early 1960s, the headstones 
were moved inland and forgotten until Putney, 73, found them on his first 
return to the island in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Putney this month secured a plot for the new cemetery at the U.S. Navy base at 
Orote Point, the island's other beachhead, after trying in vain to get 
permission from the U.S. Department of the Interior for a new cemetery at Asan 
Beach. By July 20, new headstones will be set with each of the 25 dogs' names, 
with a life-size bronze statue of a Doberman standing proudly in the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Putney never expected retirement to be so busy. 
</P>
<P>
 Since a story about his quest for a new war dog cemetery appeared in The 
Times, he has been interviewed for a cable television show and received 
requests for his time from several schools and a TV documentary maker. Dozens 
of well-wishers have telephoned and written, although he refers offers of money 
to the United Doberman Club, which is paying for the statue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dogs are finally getting the recognition they deserve," Putney said. 
"They weren't just dogs. They were Marines that gave their lives bravely, and 
some of us are probably here today because of them." KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY'S 1ST PUBLIC POOL TO OPEN AT CENTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than five months after it was purchased by the city, the Calabasas Tennis 
and Swim Center will open the town's first public pool today. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the cleaned and repaired eight-lane pool marks the latest 
improvement at the formerly private center overlooking Lake Calabasas. 
</P>
<P>
 The city opened the center's 14 tennis courts soon after purchasing the 
neglected, 8.3-acre facility in mid-January, and plans to open a snack bar near 
the pool by June 20. The opening of weight-training and exercise rooms could 
come as early as fall, said Community Services Director Greg Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool at 23400 Park Sorrento will be open today, Sunday and Monday from 10 
a.m. to 4 p.m. Lifeguards will be on duty. After that, hours will be Monday 
through Friday, 7 to 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Fees are $2 per day for adults and $1 per day for senior citizens and youths 
under 16. Children 3 and younger will be admitted free. Monthly rates are 
available. KURT PITZER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; LACK OF FUNDS TO END DAY-CARE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Pacoima Youth Development Center, which provides low-cost day-care 
services for 57 children, is set to close in two weeks due to lack of funds, 
administrators said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which operates out of Pacoima Elementary school, was started in 
1992 with a $100,000 grant by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban 
Development to help parents go to work and stay off welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 The HUD money was a one-time grant, however, and the program found itself with 
no money last September. The center survived up to now thanks to a $25,000 
grant from Kaiser Permanente and a $25,000 grant from the Ahmanson Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money's run out, basically," said Director Elisa Garcia. "We've 
approached (Los Angeles City) Council members and other politicians, but they 
say there's no money available." 
</P>
<P>
 About 75 children are on a waiting list to join the popular program, which is 
run by the Antelope Valley-based Youth Development Corp. Most of the children 
live in Pacoima's San Fernando Gardens Housing Project, according to Garcia, 
and the parents simply cannot afford any other means of day care. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure of the center will force some of them to go on welfare, or 
otherwise drastically affect their lives, Garcia said. She met with most of the 
parents Friday to tell them the bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert Aguilar, 29, said he was able to attend Mission College because the 
center was taking care of his two children.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be quite difficult now, paying for my books, paying for a 
baby-sitter," he said. "I'll probably have to put school on hold." MIGUEL

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PANORAMA CITY; N.Y. PRINCIPAL BRINGS $235 CHECK TO SCHOOL

 A New York City school principal hand-delivered a check Friday to Liggett 
Street Elementary School, where classrooms were damaged by the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The $235 check delivered by Lawrence Cohen of Public School 33 supplemented an 
earlier $650 sent to the Panorama City school.Liggett Principal David Sanchez 
said the money will pay for repairs to computers, a water heater and the 
auditorium ceiling, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our children decided they wanted to help the children in the earthquake out 
here," said Cohen, whose school has 1,030 students in kindergarten through 
fifth grade. "They went out asking for donations. Some of them brought in their 
own piggy banks." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a generous offer on their part," said Sanchez, whose school has about 
the same number of students. "You don't have that happen too often -- a 
principal from another school come by to follow up." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen was in Los Angeles on personal business, but made the extra trip to 
Panorama City to see the school that his students had been worried about.  
</P>
<P>
 For his return trip, Sanchez gave Cohen a special plaque of thanks from 
Liggett. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; 84-YEAR-OLD GRADUATE MEETS LIFETIME GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Alec Bloom's favorite story about life as an 84-year-old college student. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in the class with a lady professor and, one evening, she brought in her 
two children," said the Sherman Oaks resident, his eyes twinkling. "And the 
little boy walked over to me and kept staring at me and I said to myself, 'What 
is he staring at?' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Then he turned to his mother and said, 'He is not so old.' " 
</P>
<P>
 To a standing ovation Thursday before his children and grandchildren and more 
than 600 fellow Valley College graduates, Bloom proved the little boy right. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy years after he quit high school to help provide for his family in 
Chicago, the former businessman choked back tears as he received his Associate 
of Arts degree in Jewish studies. The event, which featured Bloom as one of the 
commencement speakers, was held on the college football field. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my life I've wanted an education," Bloom said during his speech. 
</P>
<P>
 The eldest son of a Ukrainian cigar roller and a seamstress, he left school at 
14 to deliver telegrams for a nickel apiece. "I want to leave a legacy for my 
children. I want to be remembered that at 84, I graduated with a college 
degree. I want them to know that they can be successful in reaching whatever 
goals they set for themselves by thinking positively." 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley College event was among three community college commencements in 
the Valley this week. About 1,000 students graduated from Pierce College on 
Thursday and 288 students graduated Friday from Mission College. 
</P>
<P>
 A former president of his own tile company in Chicago, Bloom was spurred into 
college by his family four years ago after the death of his wife, Ruth. Bloom's 
family was represented at his graduation by his daughter and son, their 
spouses, and one of his five grandchildren. He also has four 
great-grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he denied himself an education in order to support his family, Bloom 
made sure his three younger siblings and his children had the opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "He sent one brother through dental school," said son Jordan Bloom, a bank 
vice president from Sherman Oaks. "And his other brother became president of 
Love's Barbecue and Orange Julius. The other sister graduated in mathematics. 
He paid for it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite being partially deaf and working 40 hours a week while attending 
college (up to this semester, when he took 18 units), the wiry man graduated 
with honors and a 3.8 grade-point average. Along the way, he earned the 
affection of professors and students alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was amazed," said 19-year-old Cristi Harris of Studio City, who attended 
the graduation just to see Bloom get his diploma. "We did one group project 
together and even after the report was done, he kept bringing in things on the 
subject to give us more information." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom will enroll in summer classes at Cal State Northridge to pursue a 
four-year degree in history. And don't expect him to quit school after his next 
graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be a professional student," said Bloom, who, when the time 
comes, wants to be buried with his diploma. "I'm like a dried old sponge on the 
shelf and suddenly they throw me in a bucket of water. I want to absorb all the 
education I can." JEFF SCHNAUFER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; MAYOR'S TASK FORCE TARGETS HATE CRIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Glendale Mayor Eileen Givens will appoint a committee to study hate crimes in 
the city, an action prompted by vandalism at a local Armenian-American youth 
center earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Relations Task Force, as it is tentatively named by city 
officials, is scheduled to be approved by the City Council at its meeting 
Tuesday. Givens will select members of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "This doesn't necessarily signal an alert, or signal we have a problem, that 
Glendale is a racist or bigoted city," Councilman Larry Zarian said. "What it 
says is that there are some racists and bigots among us." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale City Manager David Ramsay said the purpose of the task force is "to 
recommend ways to proceed in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force is the result of a request by local Armenian groups for the 
city to investigate vandalism of the Homenetmen Armenian General Athletics 
Union and Scouts Building at 544 W. Broadway on May 14. Vandals painted 
swastikas and "Asian-looking" characters on the walls of the building and on 
several vans parked nearby. Police have no suspects in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the task force should use the Homenetmen incident as a 
jumping-off point to study the more subtle prejudice against Armenians in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 While statistics show hate crimes in Glendale have decreased this year, some 
residents still tend to misunderstand Armenian immigrants, who make up just 
under 20% of Glendale's 195,000 residents, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that the basic sentiment of distrust is still there, even if 
the expression of these sentiments is becoming more civil," said Chahe 
Keuroghelian, intercultural relations coordinator with the Glendale Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something we need, since there is diversity in the city, since the 
city has so many newcomers," Zarian said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were nine incidents classified by police as hate crimes in 1992, with a 
majority of these directed at Armenians. Six hate crimes were reported in 1993, 
with two directed at the Armenian population. Two hate crimes have occurred in 
Glendale so far this year, both aimed at Armenians, including the Homenetmen 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The other incident occurred in April when transient Edmond Antone, 45, 
attacked an Armenian, Sarkis Shavaladian, 70, shouting the Armenian word for 
"stupid" and other ethnic insults. JENNIFER OLDHAM and ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; COMMISSION OKS REVISED MALL PLAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A $150-million project to renovate and expand Laurel Plaza mall and build a 
multistory office building on adjoining property has cleared one of its final 
hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Planning Commission on Thursday unanimously approved a revised 
plan for the project at Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Oxnard Street and voted to 
send it to the City Council's Planning and Land Use Management Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan, which must also be approved by the full City Council, reduces 
the proposed office building's height from 10 stories to six, extends the hours 
of mall and parking-lot security patrols and installs security cameras at 
parking-garage exits and entrances to shopping areas. 
</P>
<P>
 It also requires a pedestrian walkway with handicapped access from Laurel 
Canyon Boulevard to the mall, increases landscaping for areas that abut homes 
and closes one of the mall exits after 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission rejected a request by Robert Carcia, president of Slow the 
Overdevelopment Process (STOP), a homeowners' group, that security cameras be 
installed throughout the parking garages.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed that they didn't see fit to demand the developers spend 
the extra $100,000 it will take to make the garages safer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also decided against imposing a requirement that the builder, 
Forest Hills Development, retain a 26-year-old skating rink in the mall. JIM

BURBANK MAN CHARGED IN TRANSIENT'S SLAYING

<P>
 A 32-year-old transient died early Friday after he was shot several times in a 
Burbank apartment the day before, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank police released few details about the shooting death of Warren Giblin. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still not totally clear to us yet," said Lt. Larry Koch of the Burbank 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A suspect, Ralph E. Martin, 26, of Burbank, was charged with murder and is 
being held at the Burbank jail in lieu of $1-million bail. He is scheduled to 
be arraigned in Burbank Municipal Court on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting took place at about 5 p.m. Thursday inside Martin's apartment in 
the 200 block of West Ash Avenue, police said. Giblin was treated at the scene 
by paramedics and died about eight hours later at Holy Cross Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Giblin was the father of two young children who lived at one time in the 
Burbank Village area bordered by Olive Avenue, 6th Street, and Magnolia and 
Glenoaks boulevards, according to the Burbank Temporary Aid Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Giblin went to the center for free food about half a dozen times and told 
workers there that he had been unemployed since February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he was a Jack-of-all-trades and was willing to do anything," said Jay 
Storms, a computer technician for the center. "Food was what he was looking 
for." 
</P>
<P>
 The homicide is the city's fourth of the year.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 3 HIGH DESERT BRUSH FIRES CHAR 325 ACRES

 Three Antelope Valley brush fires driven by strong winds charred more than 325 
acres and destroyed two cars, two small storage sheds and killed a few chickens 
Friday, according to fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest fire was a 300-acre blaze that began at 1:23 p.m. at 6669 Avenue 
A, a sparsely populated area near the Kern County border, Capt. Mike Cody of 
the Kern County Fire Department said. He said the fire, fanned by winds up to 
30 m.p.h., burned a narrow path about 1 1/2 miles long before firefighters 
contained it about 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was started by a man burning tumbleweeds Friday morning, Capt. Mark 
Missildine said. The man put out the fire, but sparks got into manure, which 
smoldered and five hours later ignited grass nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is what happens when it gets into manure," Missildine said. No charges 
will be sought against the individual, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60 firefighters from Kern and Los Angeles counties, California City and 
Edwards Air Force Base fought the blaze, Cody said. He said numerous houses 
were threatened, but firefighters kept the flames away from most structures. 
</P>
<P>
 The two cars, storage shed, a few chickens and possibly a peacock or two were 
consumed near a house next to where the man was burning tumbleweeds. An 
estimate on the cost of the damage was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had it just about under control at one point and then the wind kicked up 
and blew it across the fire line," Cody said. 
</P>
<P>
 A 25-acre fire occurred at about 11:50 a.m. near 90th Street West and West 
Avenue J in Lancaster, Inspector Rick Moreno of the Los Angeles County Fire 
Department said. He said about 80 firefighters brought the fire under control 
in about an hour. It did not cause any injuries or threaten any structures. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-acre fire flared up at 40247 16th St. West in Palmdale at about 1:45 
p.m., Moreno said. Two structures were threatened, but firefighters put the 
flames out before any damage occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreno said the cause of the Lancaster and Palmdale fires remains under 
investigation. He said it is unknown if the fires were related.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BOARD VOTES AGAIN NOT TO GIVE CLAS TEST; 
EDUCATION: ACTON-AGUA DULCE DISTRICT QUESTIONS THE EXAM'S GOALS AND CONTENT. 
STATE OFFICIALS HAVE WARNED OF A LAWSUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the threat of a lawsuit by state officials, the Acton-Agua Dulce 
Unified School District board has reaffirmed its decision not to administer the 
controversial CLAS test to its students. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Thursday attended by more than 100 parents, the district's board 
of trustees -- as it did April 28 -- voted 4 to 1 against giving the California 
Learning Assessment System test because of objections to the test's goals and 
content, which critics say denigrate the family. 
</P>
<P>
 The second vote was taken in response to a recent letter from William D. 
Dawson, acting state superintendent of public instruction, who had asked the 
board to reconsider its position. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials have vowed to go to court against any district that refuses to 
give students the test. The first such suit targeted the neighboring Antelope 
Valley Union High School District, and is scheduled for a hearing June 6 in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Thursday night's meeting, the Acton-Agua Dulce school board "voted to 
stand as we are," board President Laurie Browning said. "We asked our attorney 
to write to the acting superintendent of state schools and inform him of our 
decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Keown, an attorney for the state Department of Education, said Friday 
that his office would have no response to the Acton-Agua Dulce board's decision 
until at least next week. He said the department may await a court ruling in 
the Antelope Valley district case before deciding whether to pursue legal 
action against Acton-Agua Dulce. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents have expressed concern over whether the small district, with 
four schools and about 1,700 students, can handle the cost of a legal battle 
with the state. But Browning said, "We have been offered legal assistance from 
other sources who also oppose the CLAS test." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from its content, critics of the test have objected to the secrecy 
surrounding it and have complained that it asks students personal questions. 
Supporters of the test say it is a commendable way of measuring critical 
thinking skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have read the test," said Browning, an Acton resident. "I found the 
material far too morbid in the writing section. I feel the test needs to be 
reviewed and that it is out prematurely." 
</P>
<P>
 This week's lone vote against withholding the CLAS test was cast again by Peg 
Spry, a retired schoolteacher. She said Friday that she believes the district 
should give the test because it is mandated to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Spry said she also had read the test. "I don't feel there is anything in it 
that will harm any child," she said.

 RABBIS CHOSEN: The independent synagogue Makom Ohr Shalom, which celebrates 
Jewish traditions of meditation and mysticism, has chosen two part-time rabbis 
to lead its services in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi David Cooper, author of three books on Jewish meditation, and Rabbi 
Mordecai Finley, a former assistant rabbi at Stephen S. Wise Temple, will 
jointly conduct the 8 p.m. service Friday, then alternate at subsequent 
bimonthly services of the congregation, said Lee L. Auerbach, a spokesman for 
the congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-year-old synagogue, which holds services at Encino Community Church in 
Tarzana, has been without a spiritual leader since its Founding Rabbi Ted 
Falcon left Southern California a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to serving as one of Makom's rabbis, Finley will continue to 
conduct Saturday morning services for Ohr HaTorah, a new congregation. Cooper 
will commute between Los Angeles and Jamestown, Colo., where he and his wife 
own a retreat center, according to Auerbach. 
</P>
<P>
 PALAU APPEARANCES: Evangelist Luis Palau, who will lead a five-day crusade for 
the San Fernando Valley starting at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at Van Nuys' Birmingham 
High School, will begin a series of additional speaking appearances tonight at 
a Spanish-language rally at Church on the Way in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Palau, whose international evangelistic association is based in Portland, 
Ore., will speak at a women's luncheon Wednesday and a business and 
professional luncheon Friday, both at Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City. The 
cost is $20 and $25, respectively. For information, call the crusade office at 
(818) 779-8400. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also the featured speaker at 8 a.m. next Saturday for the Los Angeles 
Mayor's Prayer Breakfast at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in Downtown Los 
Angeles. Actor Dean Jones is the master of ceremonies, and the Rev. Jack 
Hayford, pastor of Church on the Way, is on the program. Tickets cost $19. For 
information, call (818) 779-8310.

 President Clinton's use of religious imagery and references, sometimes viewed 
skeptically as camouflage for personal faults, had been encouraged six months 
ago by Fuller Seminary's Richard Mouw. 
</P>
<P>
 Mouw was one of 12 evangelical leaders invited last November to have breakfast 
with Clinton and Vice President Al Gore at the White House.Each was asked to 
offer some spiritual advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of us disagreed with (Clinton) on abortion and homosexuality, but I said 
I thought it would be important for him to talk more about how he connected his 
faith with policy issues," Mouw said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Mouw said the President, a Southern Baptist, was very articulate and at ease 
with Scripture when he talked at the National Prayer Breakfast early in 1993. 
President George Bush was not so adept at that event the previous year, Mouw 
said. "Whatever the character of his personal faith, Bush had a very difficult 
time talking about spiritual issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, I said you're very good at it and you ought to do more," Mouw said. The 
seminary president, himself a Presbyterian, offered Clinton three reasons for 
bringing up religious perspectives: 
</P>
<P>
 "One -- Evangelicals need to hear it because we need to see how you're making 
the connections (between faith and policy). 
</P>
<P>
 "Two -- The country needs moral and spiritual leadership from the President -- 
not as a way of trying to impose a religious perspective but out of a 
willingness to speak from convictions and one's personal journey to the big 
issues of public life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three -- I think it would be good for you. The more you talk about it, the 
clearer you are going to get." JOHN DARTFULLER THEOL

 When angry Christians shout "Murderers!" at abortion-rights advocates or taunt 
gays and lesbians by chanting, "God created Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve," 
the president of the Fuller Theological Seminary winces. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, "our fundamental posture is chip-on-our-shoulder, 'We're right and 
everybody else is wrong,' triumphalist and arrogant," said Richard J. Mouw, 
president of the nation's largest nondenominational seminary in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Mouw tends to take conservative views on abortion and homosexuality, he 
is seeking to persuade fellow believers to show a lot more "Christian civility" 
in addressing moral issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Mouw said legislation signed into federal law Thursday that bars 
abortion-clinic blockades and harassment was not necessarily a bad thing for 
the antiabortion movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is obvious that the more violent and coercive protests at clinics have 
done nothing to change the climate of opinion on abortion," he said Friday. 
"What we need is a dialogue in which we listen to one another and find other 
ways to state our convictions." 
</P>
<P>
 Mouw first outlined his call for Christian civility in "Uncommon Decency," 
published by InterVarsity Press in 1992. Last fall it found an interested 
reader at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 When President Clinton invited a dozen evangelical leaders, including Mouw, to 
a White House breakfast in November, the President asked for a copy of the 
book. Clinton wrote a note to Mouw shortly thereafter, saying he found his 
ideas helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has expressed frustration over a barrage of attacks on himself and his 
Administration in recent months. In a speech last week at UCLA, for example, he 
bemoaned "the destructive tone of public discourse in America today." 
</P>
<P>
 The President's troubles notwithstanding, many commentators have decried the 
heated tone of public debate today. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the sharpest words have emanated from Christian conservatives, 
prompting alarmed responses from Mouw and other influential evangelicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor Jack Hayford of Van Nuys' Church on the Way, one of those invited to 
the November briefing at the White House, "delivered an eloquent 'apology' for 
the un-Christlike way in which many Christians had treated the President," 
according to another participant, Philip Yancey, an editor at Christianity 
Today magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayford has also lamented what he calls "friendly fire," casualties inflicted 
by churches on fellow Christians. In his church newsletter last month, Hayford 
cited "carping criticism, the self-righteous salvos, and the tireless 
nit-picking" that arise over differences in doctrine and styles of ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Colson, an influential evangelical writer and commentator, recently 
asked, "How can Christians encourage fellow citizens to respect authority if we 
ourselves do not show the utmost civility?" 
</P>
<P>
 Colson pointed to Mother Teresa's remarks against abortion early this year at 
the National Prayer Breakfast with Clinton present. "Mother Teresa was 
invariably polite and respectful," Colson wrote. "Yet she did not flinch in 
speaking the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Mouw said that evangelicals should at times take uncompromising 
stands and issue stern calls for morality, but Christians should display a 
politeness and consideration of others. "When George Bush spoke of 'a kinder 
and gentler' nation a few years back, I said, 'Amen.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mouw taught philosophy at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich., before 
joining the Fuller faculty in 1985. He succeeded David Hubbard as president in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Mouw was among younger evangelicals 
calling for their churches to become more socially active. His first book was 
titled "Political Evangelism." Evangelicals became more visible on national 
issues in the late 1970s and the Christian right gained prominence in the early 
1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1990s, when I looked back on it," Mouw said in an interview, "I 
thought maybe it was time to call the whole thing off. Those pleas for 
evangelicals to get involved have been too successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evangelicals have entered into the public arena with the same kind of 
oversimplification, the same cliches and sloganeering kind of mentality that 
had characterized our dealing with other kinds of issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incivility is by no means the exclusive property of the (religious) right," 
he added. "Liberation theologians on the left speak in very uncivil terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Mouw urges a new period of "Christian gentleness" in keeping with biblical 
advice -- not as political strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it may also be that evangelical Christians who have often totally 
alienated people with whom they have disagreed on homosexuality and abortion 
while defending family issues, it may very well be that people will hear us 
better if we speak out of our own pilgrimage with a kind and self-critical 
spirit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But ultimately we do it because that's the kind of people God wants us to 
be," Mouw said. In his book and in seminars he led on the topic at the 
Evangelical Press Assn. convention this month in Costa Mesa, Mouw uses 
Scripture to back up his claim. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The writer of the Letter to the Hebrews (12:14) urges Christians to "pursue 
peace with everyone." In the 12th chapter of Romans, the Apostle Paul advises 
love, patience and humility in relations with others. Titus (3:2) urges 
Christians "to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle and to 
show every courtesy to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1 Peter, Mouw said, one sees what civility is about for the committed 
Christian. "Always be ready to make your defense to anyone who demands from you 
an accounting for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and 
reverence." (1 Peter 3:15-16) 
</P>
<P>
 Mouw said that sometimes Christian activists and preachers employ a crusading 
spirit in which anything goes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get anywhere by misrepresenting another person's position," said 
Mouw. Labeling abortion-rights advocates "murderers" is misrepresentation 
because "they are not really excited about murdering babies," Mouw said. "There 
are other (motivations) there." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the biblical commandment not to kill is invoked, Mouw said, "one of 
the other Ten Commandments is 'Thou shall not bear false witness.' "

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY TO PAY $50,000 OVER USE OF HOUSING FUNDS; 
COURTS: JUDGE ORDERS AWARD TO LAW FIRM THAT SUCCESSFULLY CHALLENGED PLAN TO 
FINANCE BRIDGES. BUT OFFICIALS HAIL RULING. 
</P>

<P>
 A judge ordered the city Friday to pay about $50,000 to a Los Angeles law firm 
that successfully challenged Lancaster's plan to use redevelopment housing 
funds to build two bridges over railroad tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, city officials hailed the ruling as a victory because the sum 
was far less than the $370,000 requested by the law firm of Kane, Ballmer & 
Berkman, which represented a resident who contended that the city's proposal 
was a misuse of redevelopment agency money reserved for housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's hearing before Burbank Superior Court Judge David M. Schacter was the 
latest development in a two-year legal battle waged by resident Dolores Dibley 
over the proposal to use redevelopment dollars to pay for overpasses at Avenue 
L and Avenue H. 
</P>
<P>
 These bridges were designed to carry cars over busy Sierra Highway and the 
adjacent railroad tracks. Lancaster officials had argued that they could use 
redevelopment money because the bridges would encourage developers to build 
more homes on the city's east side, including dwellings for people with low and 
moderate incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kane, Ballmer on behalf of Dibley sued the city over the plan. In August, 
1992, Schacter ruled that the city's plan was valid, but a state appellate 
court overturned the decision last November. The California Supreme Court has 
refused to consider the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The law firm then sought to recover its legal expenses, plus extra 
compensation permitted under state law when law firms set a precedent on an 
important public issue. In this case, the firm maintained that this court 
decision would discourage the misuse of redevelopment dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's attorneys contended that Kane, Ballmer's expenses were inflated and 
that the case did not set a precedent entitling the firm to additional money. 
</P>
<P>
 The sum awarded Friday "matches what our papers indicated that we thought was 
a reasonable number," Lancaster City Atty. David R. McEwen said. The funds will 
come from the redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not surprised by the ruling of the court," said R. Bruce Tepper of 
Kane, Ballmer, which has vowed to appeal Friday's ruling. "At all times, we 
have been prepared to take this up again." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "We have found the attitude of the city, at least in regard to this 
motion, to be highly hypocritical." 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster spent far more on its own attorney's fees -- $160,000 -- than the 
sum Schacter ordered it to pay Kane, Ballmer, Tepper said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the legal challenge, Lancaster used other funds to build the 
$12.4-million Avenue L overpass, which opened in March. City officials said 
they do not plan to use housing funds to build the Avenue H bridge over the 
next year.
