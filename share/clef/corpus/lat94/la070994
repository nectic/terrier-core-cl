O.C. JET CRASH TAPE INDICATES PILOT KNEW RISK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The pilot of a corporate jet that crashed in Santa Ana on Dec. 15, killing all 
aboard, knew he might encounter turbulence from a jet landing ahead of him but 
believed he could "do it," transcripts of cockpit conversation reveal.  
</P>
<P>
 The documents show that the doomed flight of the twin-engine Westwind carrying 
the top two executives of the In-N-Out Burger Chain appeared normal until the 
plane suddenly spun out of control and dove to the ground near the Santa Ana 
Auto Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The transcripts provided to The Times were made as part of the National 
Transportation Safety Board's ongoing investigation of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 They indicate that about a minute before the crash, co-pilot John O. McDaniel, 
49, suggested that the Westwind was "kinda close" to the Boeing jet landing in 
front of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although neither McDaniel nor pilot Stephen R. Barkin, 46, knew it at the 
time, the Boeing was a 757, a plane that has been shown to cause unusually 
powerful wake turbulence for an aircraft its size. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the discussion of whether they were too close to the bigger jet, 
cockpit communications appeared uneventful until the "sound of a deep breath" 
is heard from Barkin's microphone, and McDaniel urged, "keep it going . . . 
keep it going around." One second later, an expletive is heard; two seconds 
later, the cockpit tape ends. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB has yet to identify the cause of the accident, but turbulence from 
the United Airlines Boeing 757 that touched down safely in front of the 
Westwind at John Wayne Airport is suspected to have played a role. 
</P>
<P>
 Although aviation safety experts disagree on the level of danger involved, the 
757's narrow body and long, sleek wing design creates invisible "horizontal 
tornadoes" emanating from each wingtip that can be more potent and last longer 
than those made by other aircraft its size. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake turbulence poses the greatest danger during landing and takeoff, because 
the affected plane does not have enough airspace to carry out defensive 
maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana accident has figured prominently in the deliberations of the 
NTSB and the Federal Aviation Administration, which subsequently have made 
safety recommendations and rule changes to try to prevent such accidents. In 
addition to the Westwind crash, in which five people died, at least four other 
757-related accidents and incidents, claiming 13 lives, have occurred since 
December, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Santa Ana crash, The Times has obtained hundreds of pages of 
documents from federal agencies, including the FAA, indicating that even FAA 
scientists began issuing warnings on the potential danger of 757 wake 
turbulence as far back as five years ago. Researchers and safety officials have 
recommended that trailing planes, especially smaller ones, be kept farther 
behind 757s than they had been until just recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the accidents, the Department of Transportation has been conducting a 
review to determine if the FAA ignored safety warnings about the 757 wake 
turbulence. The same subject will be taken up by a congressional subcommittee 
at a hearing scheduled for later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The transcripts of cockpit and tower communications and other documents 
obtained by The Times revealed and confirmed new facts about the Westwind 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westwind jet was traveling faster than the 757, but Barkin and McDaniel 
intended to stay safely above and behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 In actuality, the Westwind was 400 feet below the flight path of the 757 when 
the smaller plane became hopelessly entangled in the 757's wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 In the moments before the crash, Barkin and McDaniel engaged in mostly mundane 
banter, including observations about the clear weather and the "nice lighting" 
on their plane. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the Westwind in landing configuration and in sight of the airport, 
McDaniel noted that the 757 was taking a steep approach, a situation that is 
especially dangerous to trailing aircraft, which generally must stay above the 
flight path of leading aircraft to avoid wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a little too high," McDaniel said a minute and a half before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we'll just sit here and slow down," replied Barkin, who also indicated 
he would take a higher approach to avoid trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 A few seconds later, McDaniel again alluded to the hazardous situation they 
were in. 
</P>
<P>
 McDaniel: "Yeah, we might still get a little wake turbulence there . . . looks 
kinda close." 
</P>
<P>
 Barkin: "Yeah, it's close, but I think we'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Just 38 seconds later, Barkin is heard taking a "deep breath," perhaps 
indicating the precise moment when the Westwind rolled 360 degrees and 
plummeted to earth on a 45-degree angle. 
</P>
<P>
 The last sound on the cockpit tape came from McDaniel, who said, "Oh 
(expletive)," two seconds before the recording ends. 
</P>
<P>
 The transcripts, letters, reports, diagrams and other documents also: 
</P>
<P>
 * Confirm that air traffic controllers, while cautioning the Westwind to slow 
and make "S-turns" if necessary to stay far enough away from the 757, did not 
inform Barkin and McDaniel that they were following a 757. While that was not a 
requirement at the time, controllers now warn pilots of smaller planes if the 
plane in front of them is a 757. 
</P>
<P>
 * Show that weather conditions helped set the stage for the accident. With 
virtually no wind, the wake turbulence did not dissipate as fast as it would 
have if the wind was blowing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Indicate that both McDaniel and Barkin were experienced pilots, with 
approximately 5,400 and 8,200 flight hours, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the accident, the Westwind was 2.1 miles behind the 757. 
Starting July 1, the FAA began instructing its controllers to keep smaller 
planes like the Westwind four miles behind 757s on final approach. The rule 
change only applies when controllers are guiding planes in for landing, 
however; the Westwind was flying under visual flight rules, which meant that 
the pilot bore the primary responsibility for maintaining a safe-enough 
distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, friends and relatives of the dead pilots and colleagues have maintained 
that, if the FAA had told pilots what it knew about the nature of 757 wake 
turbulence and instituted the same recently adopted safety measures earlier, 
then Barkin and McDaniel would have been more prudent. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB is expected to release its final report on the accident before the 
end of the year. In a preliminary report released in March, the agency's 
accident investigators concluded that the crash could have been prevented if 
the pilot or air controllers had kept an adequate safety cushion between the 
Westwind and the 757.

 BODY SLING: The new Ejection Seat was the big draw when the Orange County Fair 
opened Friday (B1). And that's at $40 a pop too. . . . "It's a human 
sling-shot," says one fair-goer who rode it. Its two 125-foot cords pull back 
and sling strapped-in riders 30 feet above the catapult, which towers over the 
rest of the fairgrounds. The $40 may seem steep, but you and a friend can ride 
together for $30 each.

 MOVING IN: The new $8-million Central Library in Newport Beach doesn't open 
until Sunday, but its parking lot was full on Friday as staff and construction 
crews busied themselves with last-minute details. . . . "It has been a 
controlled frenzy," says Tom Johnson, assistant city librarian. There's all new 
furniture and a whole host of children's programs they're boasting about. But 
much of the library will be the old books crated over from the old building. 
The doors open Sunday at 1 p.m. 
</P>

 HARVEST TIME: Greg Laurie has never hit a home run, but the California Angels 
would give anything if they could fill Anaheim Stadium the way he can. The 
Riverside pastor's free, three-night, nondenominational Harvest Crusade (B1) 
drew 152,000 to the Big A last year. For this year's crusade, which started 
Friday night and runs tonight and Sunday, Laurie's got more than 500 area 
churches promoting the show for him. Tonight's star entertainment: pop star 
Deniece Williams.

 ONE-THIRD ENOUGH? The private group Enough is Enough has scored another 
victory against sex magazines. After its pitch, the Buena Park City Council 
this week tentatively approved an ordinance requiring stores to cover up the 
bottom two-thirds of such magazines with devices commonly known as "blinder 
racks." Enough is Enough got a similar ordinance passed in Costa Mesa. Says the 
group's Wendy Leece: "We can't prohibit them because of the First Amendment, 
but we can cover the bottom two-thirds of them."

 The daughters of a Mission Viejo couple, killed when a suspected drunken 
physician collided head-on with their car, filed wrongful death lawsuits Friday 
claiming state and local officials failed in their duties to protect the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuits, filed on behalf of Karie and Shelbie Minzey, come nearly one 
year after their parents, Mark and Noreen Minzey, were killed on Santiago 
Canyon Road while driving home from a softball game, a tragedy that sparked an 
outpouring of support for the girls from their South Orange County community. 
</P>
<P>
 Karie Minzey, 12, a softball all-star, was critically injured in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Also injured in the crash were two passengers in the Minzey car, Danielle 
Rodriguez, 12, and her sister, Jacqueline, 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Joseph Allen, a 32-year-old Laguna Beach internist who specialized in 
treating AIDS patients, is waiting trial on two charges of second-degree murder 
and driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs in connection with the 
crash.  
</P>
<P>
 The wrongful death lawsuits, filed Friday in Orange County Superior Court, are 
the latest court action by the children through their legal guardian. They are 
suing the California Department of Motor Vehicles, the Medical Board of 
California and South Coast Medical Center, which treated Allen for alleged 
suicidal tendencies about a month before the collision. The Minzeys also filed 
a fourth lawsuit against Chrysler Corp., maker of the Dodge the parents were 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suits against the state agencies, the family alleges that DMV and 
medical officials should have known Allen was a danger not only to himself, but 
to others, and acted sooner to revoke his license to drive and to practice 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 The suits allege Allen had been involved in at least three prior traffic 
accidents while under the influence of drugs and alcohol between April, 1992, 
and June, 1993. The fatal crash occurred July 11, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 With his medical license intact, Allen was able to prescribe himself drugs 
that contributed to the crash, the suit against the Medical Board alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman with the Medical Board of California said Friday she had not yet 
seen the lawsuit, but denied any wrongdoing or liability for the collision. 
</P>
<P>
 "While again sympathizing with the Minzey and Rodriguez families, we continue 
to insist that Ronald Allen alone is responsible for this tragedy," board 
spokeswoman Candis Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer representing Danielle and Jacqueline Rodriguez said they plan to file 
similar suits Monday against the DMV and Medical Board of California. 
</P>
<P>
 DMV officials have also denied any wrongdoing, saying Allen was driving with 
an invalid license at the time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 In two previous accidents before the fatal crash, Allen had been driving with 
an Illinois driver's license, authorities have said. After his license was 
taken away by Laguna Beach police in June, 1993, he applied for a California 
driver's license 10 days later and was given a temporary permit, according to 
the DMV.  
</P>
<P>
 DMV officials allege that Allen failed to disclose that his Illinois driver's 
license had been revoked when he applied for the permit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lawsuit filed Friday against South Coast Medical Center, the family 
alleges that officials failed to follow proper procedures and released Allen 
prematurely after he was brought to the hospital in a suicidal state about a 
month before the crash. Allen was taken to the hospital after being arrested on 
suspicion of driving under the influence, according to the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials could not be reached for response Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the Minzey children also filed on Friday a product liability 
lawsuit against Chrysler, alleging the Dodge the family was driving was unsafe 
and failed to hold up as it should in the crash, contributing to the deaths and 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler officials in Michigan could not be reached after the lawsuit was 
filed late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minzey and Rodriguez families took their first legal actions in Superior 
Court in December, filing civil lawsuits against Allen seeking $30 million in 
damages. The suits allege Allen was intoxicated by drugs and alcohol at the 
time of the crash and was fully aware such conduct could have "deadly 
consequences." Those lawsuits also name National Car Rental System Inc., which 
rented Allen the Chevrolet Lumina he was driving. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Minzey family amended the earlier lawsuit against Allen to 
include accusations of professional negligence, alleging the doctor should have 
not prescribed himself medication knowing he was going to be drinking and 
driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, who is being held at the Orange County Jail, declined a request for an 
interview this week. 
</P>
<P>
 His lawyers have contended that the murder charges are excessive in the 
criminal case. They say Allen was suffering from severe financial problems, 
stress and depression at the time of the head-on crash. Just hours before he 
got behind the wheel of his car that afternoon, they say, he learned his father 
had died. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest round of civil court action comes after a difficult year for all 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Karie Minzey, who nearly died in the crash, moved with her sister Shelbie, now 
16, to live with an aunt and uncle in Georgia. Shelbie was not in the car when 
the crash occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Karie is recovering and can walk, but still has a tube attached to the back of 
her head to relieve pressure and swelling in her brain, her lawyer said. She 
also must go through rigorous physical therapy and rehabilitative work for her 
injured knee and wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's certainly going to have problems the rest of her life," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Karie was back in a Georgia hospital Friday, recovering from reconstructive 
surgery to her face and forehead, her aunt, Jeanine Posey said from their 
Marietta, Ga. home. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be other surgeries to come, and the seventh-grader's medical 
expenses as of May had surpassed $600,000, according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy for them," Posey said of her nieces. "They miss their mom and 
dad. But overall they're doing pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Danielle and Jacqueline Rodriguez, who were treated for their 
injuries and released from a hospital the day of the crash, are better 
physically, although the emotional trauma remains, according to their lawyer, 
Gary Moorhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Psychologically, they're just trying with their parents to cope and talk 
things out," he said. "It's been hard on them. They were best friends with the 
Minzeys." 
</P>
<P>
 Moving forward with the civil suits has been slowed because of the pending 
criminal case against Allen, Johnson and Moorhead said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't get a lot of the information," Moorhead said. "That's why it's been 
a tedious process so far."

IMPARTIAL JURORS CAN BE FOUND, COURT EXPERTS SAY; TRIAL: EXTENSIVE AND 
PAINSTAKING SCREENING OF POTENTIAL PANEL MEMBERS IS CONSIDERED A KEY FACTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the 11th floor of the criminal division of Los Angeles Superior Court, some 
would-be jurors played with puzzles, while others munched on fruit or sipped 
drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 But many found a better way to pass the time: Like people in two out of every 
three households in Los Angeles County, they were glued to the television set, 
transfixed by the parade of experts presenting grisly evidence of blood and 
slashed throats during the televised preliminary hearing for O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented media coverage has led to an equally unprecedented audience 
for the proceedings surrounding the murder case, a fact that has sparked 
widespread concern. Now that Simpson, whose six-day, nationally televised 
preliminary hearing ended Friday, has been ordered to stand trial, a crucial 
question looms: 
</P>
<P>
 Can he obtain a fair and impartial jury? 
</P>
<P>
 The county's top justice official, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti, answers the question with a decided yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we can find a fair and objective jury if we are given the 
opportunity to question them," Garcetti said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial, which has not yet been scheduled, could start as early as 
mid-September, with notices going out to potential jurors in coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury experts generally agree it will be possible for Simpson to obtain a fair 
jury -- in part because the Hall of Famer's image was so good before the 
murders. But they stress that finding jurors with open minds will require 
extensive, painstaking screening. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the presumption of innocence. Even without publicity, defendants face 
strong prejudices. Polls show that in many places, 50% of respondents believe a 
person is probably guilty just because he is brought to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 This attitude is reinforced by media coverage. A soon-to-be-published study by 
jury researchers suggests that television strongly influences viewers to accept 
a defendant's guilt, often without the viewers even realizing it. Newspapers, 
though less prejudicial, also may create biases, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides weeding out jurors with set convictions, the lawyers in the Simpson 
case will have to ferret out those who want to sit on the former athlete's jury 
so they can cash in by selling their stories to tabloid media, a troubling 
phenomenon already seen in other well-publicized cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all the evidence against him, Simpson still enjoys an unusual 
advantage: Many people do not want to believe he did it. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming there will be no plea bargain, some jury experts rule out a change of 
venue to counteract the effects of media coverage: The case has been dominating 
airwaves everywhere. They point out that Simpson probably would benefit most 
from a Los Angeles jury because he has been so beloved and admired here. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors could not be expected to forget what they have heard about the case, 
experts said, but they must be able to decide his fate on the facts presented 
during the trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have suggested that jurors are less able to shake emotional reactions 
stemming from media reports of gruesome details of the crimes, such as the 
victim's suffering or sexual violation, than biases created by factual 
evidence, including reports of the defendant's character that were not allowed 
at trial. 
</P>
<P>
 University of Delaware jury researcher Valerie Hans said she thinks the 
widespread broadcast of the 911 tapes, purportedly recording Nicole Brown 
Simpson summoning police as her husband raged in the background, could 
prejudice a jury in much the same way as a prior conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 In an experiment several years ago, Hans presented a circumstantial case to 
mock jurors. The case against Simpson at this point is also largely 
circumstantial. Those told by the researchers of the defendant's record gave 
the evidence considerably more weight than those who did not know it, Hans 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not so much the amount of pretrial publicity," said Ronald Beaton, 
director of jury consulting for Maryland-based Forensic Technologies 
International, "it is the level of detail. There has never been a preliminary 
hearing televised like this, so no one can say exactly what the impact will 
be."  
</P>
<P>
 Although researchers say pretrial publicity tends to predispose people to 
assume the defendant is guilty, jurors are still able to overcome their 
preconceived ideas and acquit the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Several high-visibility cases, including the McMartin molestation and the 
William Kennedy Smith rape trials, have generated widespread publicity and 
ended in either the acquittal of defendants or in hung juries, noted USC law 
professor Erwin Chemerinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of an example where someone was convicted largely on the basis 
of pretrial publicity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the pervasive media coverage, the lawyers in the Simpson case have 
simply tried to turn it to their advantage, observed jury consultant Jo-Ellan 
Dimitrius. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a very subtle form of brainwashing," the Pasadena-based consultant 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution has been "using terms like bloody massacre, bloody trail . . . 
all very emotionally filled words that cannot help but have an impact," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also notice that Marcia Clark, every time she refers to O.J., refers to him 
as the defendant," Dimitrius said. "She is consciously making efforts to 
dehumanize O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense is up to the same game, she added, associating Simpson with such 
"terms as major depression, suicidal, American hero and sports legend." In 
trying to mold public opinion, Robert L. Shapiro, Simpson's lead attorney, 
described him as distraught and suicidal at a nationally televised press 
conference when Simpson initially failed to turn himself in to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the coverage is generally assumed to have hurt Simpson -- the 
preliminary hearing was largely a one-sided show in which the prosecution 
presented its evidence -- it could backfire on the district attorney because 
the jury pool could become "desensitized" to the gore of the case, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimitrius believes Clark was conscious of this when she turned the photograph 
of the bodies away from the public during the preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to save that gruesome, grisly photograph for that day in trial that 
is going to elicit tremendous negative response from the jurors," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Harland W. Braun, recalling his representation of a defendant 
in the "Twilight Zone" case in the mid-1980s, said: "I thought there would 
never be more publicity" in a case than that.  
</P>
<P>
 And when he defended a police officer accused of beating motorist Rodney G. 
King, he noticed a sea of satellite dishes outside the court and thought, "I 
will never see more publicity than in this case." 
</P>
<P>
 But this week when he went Downtown to court, he saw the long rows of 
television trucks and satellite dishes outside the criminal courthouse where 
the Simpson hearing was taking place. 
</P>
<P>
 "This," he said, "is twice the intensity." 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills lawyer Danny Davis, who represented McMartin Pre-School 
defendant Ray Buckey, said attorneys must learn to influence the media rather 
than pointlessly try to quiet them during headline-grabbing trials.  
</P>
<P>
 "You have to accept and integrate the role of the media as participants," 
Davis said. "The news media is an active ingredient into the outcome of what we 
still pretend is just courtroom proceedings." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was defending the accused child molester, Davis said, surveys showed 
that 99% of people living in the jury pool area believed he was guilty before 
the trial. 'We had (potential) jurors talking about the death penalty," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 After dragging out the preliminary hearing for 18 months, he said he 
consciously tried to court the media, becoming respectful of their deadlines 
and helping reporters whose stories would be good for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called it media litigation back then," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buckey was eventually acquitted of most charges, and eight others were 
dismissed after a jury hung. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in England and Canada, where criminal charges have been dropped because 
of prejudicial publicity, there is no precedent for dismissing charges in the 
United States because of extensive pretrial coverage, according to defense 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Convictions have been overturned on appeal, however, because jurors used 
information in deliberations that they had not obtained during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simpson has a unique advantage: He was extremely popular before he was 
accused in the killings of his ex-wife and her friend. Recent surveys and calls 
to talk shows indicate that a significant number of people, particularly 
African Americans, continue to believe Simpson is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is something that is very unusual in the world of criminal defense," 
said Hans of the University of Delaware, "to have a person who went into the 
situation with a great reservoir of public good will as opposed to a neutral 
person or someone who is perceived rather negatively." 
</P>
<P>
 People do not want to believe that Simpson could have killed his former wife 
and her friend, said Alameda County Deputy Dist. Atty. Kenneth Burr, because 
"then any one of us could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The coverage of the evidence against Simpson may be balanced by his previous 
popularity, said Burr, who has tried several celebrated cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the type of thing that could be a wash." 
</P>
<P>
 Although judges can prevent lawyers from interviewing prospective jurors, most 
attorneys believe the judge in the Simpson trial will allow extensive 
questionnaires because of the high visibility of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Braun, accustomed to publicity because of the notorious cases 
he has tried, discounts the worries about pretrial publicity. He said he 
believes it influences judges more than jurors because judges are more 
political and attuned to public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think jurors are more affected by long-term prejudice than what they read 
in the short term," Braun said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and others fear that the jury system is most endangered by tabloid media 
willing to pay for a juror's story, which could entice people to lie to be on 
the Simpson jury. Two prosecution witnesses in the Simpson case have already 
admitted that the National Enquirer was paying them for their exclusive story. 
</P>
<P>
 A juror in such a situation might try to play a role during deliberations that 
would whet the tabloids appetite later on, several experts said. Beyond that, 
public confidence in the jury system might be diminished if jurors sold their 
stories after deliberations, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury consultant Dimitrius said prospective jurors in the federal King and the 
Reginald O. Denny trials admitted they had considered the possibility of making 
money from serving on those juries. 
</P>
<P>
 One prospective juror said she thought about keeping a diary and later selling 
it as a book. Some tabloid television shows later approached jurors before 
deliberations were over, asking to buy their story, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my perspective, that is an absolutely horrible thought -- that there 
could be people with a hidden agenda who would come onto this jury so they can 
go on a show," Dimitrius said. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Delgado, 37, who reported to jury duty in the Los Angeles Criminal 
Courts Building on Thursday, said he would love to sit on the Simpson jury just 
to watch the dueling lawyers -- "the dream team" -- even though it is unlikely 
he would be called again so soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Money would not be a consideration, the postal worker said outside the jury 
waiting room, but it would "definitely" cross his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as the interviewer's questions would not be objectionable, he added 
with a smile, "I would take the money."

FLOODED WATERWAYS SWAMP DOZENS OF SOUTHERN TOWNS; WEATHER: DEATH TOLL CLIMBS TO 
23 AS OTHER CITIES PREPARE FOR WORST. THOUSANDS FLEE RAPIDLY RISING RIVERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The death toll continued to climb Friday as rain-swollen rivers and creeks 
overran dozens of towns and hamlets throughout Georgia as well as in parts of 
Alabama and north Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 In what is the worst flood to strike this region in 65 years, at least 23 
people are dead, 300,000 were without safe drinking water and portions of 
interstate highways were closed because of high water. Damage estimates have 
reached $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In this southwestern Georgia city, a van ran off the road and into the Flint 
River late Thursday. Five people in the vehicle escaped, but two children, ages 
2 and 4, were swept away. As of Friday afternoon, one child's body had been 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 At the town cemetery, 200 air-tight caskets popped out of the sodden ground 
and were floating, held in only by a fence. Parks Department workers in boats 
tried to corral some of the coffins, tying them to trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to retrieve what we can until we can get the National Guard 
in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Southeast of downtown, at the Oakridge Shopping Center, businesses were closed 
and filled with water. Water also rose halfway to the roof of the Southside 
Baptist Church. Verna Hall, 70, who lives three houses away, said: "I was 
supposed to teach Sunday school this week. I guess I won't have to worry about 
that now." 
</P>
<P>
 From his back yard, Al Cortez, 45, contemplated casting a fishing line into a 
river he normally cannot see from his house. "Too muddy," he concluded. "And 
the smell!" 
</P>
<P>
 After four days of heavy rain generated by a stalled tropical storm system, 
the worst was still ahead for thousands of people living downstream on 
waterways swollen way past capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a lot of concerned people here," said Police Officer Doyle Welch in 
Bainbridge, Ga., located about 40 miles south of Albany. The Flint River is 
expected to crest at 45 feet above flood stage next Wednesday at Bainbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 2,000 residents of low-lying areas west of town have been evacuated. "But 
everyone is working together, and we're doing the best we can," Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Albany, which has been virtually isolated by rising water, the muddy Flint 
was expected to crest early today. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers here used boats to pluck stranded residents from the roofs of their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been pulling them from trees, power poles and all kinds of things," 
said Assistant Fire Chief J.W. Arrowwood.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite days of warning, some waited until it was almost too late. "We were 
fools, just crazy," said Johnny Oliver, who was picked up by a boat as he waded 
through shoulder-high water. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 15,000 residents -- nearly a quarter of the city's population -- have 
been forced out of their homes. A hospital was sandbagged and partially 
evacuated. All four bridges into town were closed. 
</P>
<P>
 In Macon, Ga., where floodwaters closed down sections of Interstate 75 and 
Interstate 16 this week, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. 
Cisneros toured the stricken area Friday afternoon and said: "This is a city of 
106,000 that has no drinking or running water, and it's likely to be eight days 
until they get it back. It's going to be very difficult and frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros said thousands of people had been forced from their homes in a swath 
of Georgia that includes Macon, Americus and Albany. "After the Midwest floods 
of last year, nothing surprises me," he said. "But this is a body blow. And 
when a person is pushed out of their home, it doesn't matter how vast the area 
of destruction is." 
</P>
<P>
 While the sun was seen in Albany and Atlanta on Friday, anxiety rose 
downstream with the floodwaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just closed all our bridges," Police Chief Sam Tripp of Hawkinsville, Ga., 
said Friday afternoon as the Ocmulgee River hit 38 feet on its rise to an 
expected crest of 42 feet on Monday. Already, Tripp said, the river has claimed 
20 to 25 homes in low-lying areas of this town of 5,000 residents, and more 
were expected to be lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've only had four or five inches of rain here; this is all from upstream," 
Tripp said. "In 1990, the river got to 31 feet, but that was nothing like 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Choctawatchee River is expected to crest at a record 26 feet today in 
Caryville, Fla., a town of 600 people located west of Tallahassee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water's been rising for three days, and we've got Marine Patrol, Florida 
Highway Patrol and the fire marshal, even National Guard troops, moving 
people," said Holmes County Sheriff's Deputy Ronnie Grant. "They say this is 
going to be the worst flood since 1929." 
</P>
<P>
 In Macon, the Ocmulgee, fed by rainfall totals as high as 20 inches, had 
already done its damage. The water treatment plant was swamped Tuesday, and 
since then residents have lined up at area shopping centers for free drinking 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the Ocmulgee crested at what officials guessed was about 35 feet; 
they could not be certain because the depth gauge was swept away. Flood stage 
is 18 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Left behind was a mess: piles of debris, brown mud, and a pungent stench. 
</P>
<P>
 In Americus, where at least 10 people died, divers continued to search creeks 
and rivers for bodies Friday while some residents began to shovel mud from 
their homes. Rainfall in Americus this week has totaled more than 24 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the Towaliga River, 150 miles north of Albany, police found the body of 
William Miller, who with his wife, Willa, had been missing since Tuesday. Willa 
Miller, who clung to a tree for nine hours before being rescued, told police 
their car was swept into the raging floodwaters.  
</P>
<P>
 Near Elbert, about 100 miles northeast of Albany, another man's body was found 
in a swollen creek. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities feared that more bodies would be found. 
</P>
<P>
 The rains that have pounded the region for days began late Sunday, hours after 
Tropical Storm Alberto blew across the Florida Panhandle from the Gulf of 
Mexico and then stalled over Georgia and Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 Fed by moisture from both the Gulf and the Atlantic Ocean, the low-pressure 
system was transformed into a round-the-clock rain machine, dumping record 
amounts of precipitation on central and southern Georgia and parts of Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Gov. Zell Miller has declared 43 counties disaster areas, and 
President Clinton authorized federal aid -- including emergency housing grants 
and low-cost loans -- for the hardest-hit areas. Some 400,000 acres of cropland 
has been flooded, and 31 earthen dams have given way.  
</P>
<P>
 "My thoughts and prayers are with the people back home who are battling fires 
and floods, and especially with the families of those who have lost their lives 
in the disasters," Clinton said in a statement from Naples, Italy, where he is 
attending an economic summit. 
</P>
<P>

SIMPSON LEGAL FEES COULD RUN INTO MILLIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The best defense money can buy costs big, big bucks. And for O.J. Simpson, the 
meter is ticking. 
</P>
<P>
 During his preliminary hearing, the superstar athlete turned accused murderer 
was surrounded by as many as five attorneys, led by Robert L. Shapiro. At least 
two other big-name lawyers -- F. Lee Bailey and Alan M. Dershowitz -- are 
acting as advisers but have not appeared in court so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Top criminal defense lawyers command from $250 to $400 an hour, although most 
legal experts believe Simpson probably has signed a flat-fee agreement, with a 
lump sum to be paid for the preliminary hearing and another for the trial, 
which a judge ordered Friday. In any case, experts speculated, the legal bill 
is already well into five figures, probably six. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the supporting cast: the paralegals, investigators, 
criminalists, psychiatrists, forensic experts and DNA scientists. Each will 
demand a paycheck. Some bill by the hour, some by the day. Some will demand 
appearance fees for testifying -- and don't forget travel expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The final tab, experts said, is almost certain to run well into the millions 
and strain, if not drain, Simpson's considerable net worth, once estimated in 
court papers at more than $10 million -- perhaps at the expense of his 
children's financial future. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, family members have expressed concern about the financial 
future of Sydney Simpson, 8, and Justin Simpson, 5, with their mother dead and 
their father in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assume Simpson will be bankrupt or broke by the end of the trial simply 
because the money, whatever he has, will have been spent legitimately on his 
defense -- and that's without any make-work b.s.," said Santa Monica criminal 
defense attorney Charles Lindner, a veteran of 13 capital cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles lawyer Bradley Brunon, who has tried nearly three dozen murder 
cases, said: "If the client has an unlimited budget, the legal fees can 
approximate that. Remember that old saw about the football coach, George Allen, 
being given an unlimited budget and exceeding it? That may prove true in a case 
such as this. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because," Brunon said, "what corner would you want to cut when a man's life 
is at stake?" 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have not decided whether to pursue the death penalty in the case 
against Simpson, charged with murder in the slayings of ex-wife Nicole Brown 
Simpson, 35, and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman, 25. Though Simpson was 
ordered Friday to stand trial in Superior Court, that decision is still weeks 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 It is virtually impossible, experts said, to quantify the cost of a death 
penalty case. In large part, that is because defense lawyers have long kept 
such costs shrouded in secrecy, believing that itemizing the bill would tip 
prosecutors to secret defense strategies.  
</P>
<P>
 It is well-known around any courthouse, however, that defense costs in any 
death penalty case typically reach well into seven figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other side of the coin no expense will be spared," San Diego defense 
attorney Elisabeth Semel said, referring to prosecutors. "So when someone's 
life is at stake, it behooves the defense to exploit every resource it can." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if prosecutors do not opt for the death penalty, the overall cost to 
Simpson is still likely to be substantial. Should the case go to trial, a 
conservative estimate, said Los Angeles defense lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., 
would be $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be major," Cochran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro signaled the intensity of the campaign ahead as he left the courthouse 
Friday, saying: "We are going to be working very hard throughout the weekend 
getting ready for the trial. . . . We are going to start working tonight. We 
are not going to waste time." 
</P>
<P>
 With that kind of legal effort, one issue, experts said, is how much O.J. 
Simpson, who turns 47 in jail today, can afford. 
</P>
<P>
 An accountant hired by Nicole Brown Simpson in connection with the couple's 
1992 divorce fixed O.J. Simpson's net worth at $10.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of that, according to court records, is in real estate, not cash -- 
the home in Brentwood, valued at $5 million, a house in Laguna Beach and 
various condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Simpson had been divesting himself of real estate. The house 
in Laguna Beach was sold in August for $1.55 million, according to property 
records. Last November, Simpson sold a Monarch Beach condo that he had acquired 
in 1989 for $300,000, absorbing a $116,000 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, accountant Edward J. Lieberman said in 1992 that 
Simpson earned $1.5 million in 1991, much of it under contracts with NBC and 
Hertz Corp. In the prior five years, he earned an average of $1.2 million a 
year, Lieberman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson argued that his income was substantially less, about $881,000 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he stood to lose money that year, saying his investments in 
Pioneer Chicken restaurant franchises were worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 He claimed extraordinary expenses -- housing expenses in Brentwood of $264,000 
in 1992 as well as support to his mother of between $800 and $1,100 per month 
and $32,000 annually to his adult daughter from a prior marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge in the divorce ordered Simpson to pay even more support, $5,000 per 
month for each of his two children with Nicole Brown Simpson -- $10,000 total. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, Sydney and Justin Simpson are being cared for by their 
maternal grandparents, Louis and Juditha Brown at their home in Monarch Bay, a 
secluded community within Dana Point in Orange County. The Browns share the 
home with three adult daughters and now four grandchildren, including the two 
Simpson children. Louis Brown, 70, is a semi-retired real estate broker and 
investor. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolf Baur, a first cousin raised by Nicole's parents and considered like a 
brother by her sisters, said he does not know if Nicole left a will or whether 
she was covered by a life insurance policy. Family members have not yet been 
able to check on such matters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other family members declined comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though O.J. Simpson is behind bars, those children are still entitled to 
monthly support, family law specialists said. Beyond that, those specialists 
said, the children likely have no legal claim on how their father spends his 
money -- or how much of it goes toward the defense of the criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's his money," Brentwood attorney Joan Patsy Ostroy said. "As long as he's 
supporting the kids, I don't think they get to complain about how he spends his 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 And spend it, criminal defense lawyers said, he will. 
</P>
<P>
 The going rate for top lawyer talent in Los Angeles, one of the nation's most 
expensive legal markets, starts at $250 per hour, experts said. When defense 
attorney Leslie Abramson sought public funds this year for the retrial of the 
Menendez brothers, that's what she sought -- only to have a judge tell her it 
was too much. 
</P>
<P>
 For this case, most experts said, Shapiro and former law school dean Gerald F. 
Uelmen would get far more than that. 
</P>
<P>
 If, however, Shapiro and Uelmen were each charging "only" $300 per hour and 
working "only" 14-hour days during the just-ended preliminary hearing, that 
figures out to $8,400 per day for just those two attorneys, Los Angeles defense 
lawyer Harland Braun said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the seven-day workweek that an intense preliminary hearing demands, the 
total would climb to $58,800 a week -- again, just for Shapiro and Uelmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Working for hourly wages, Braun said, he alone made a total of between 
$600,000 and $700,000 on the "Twilight Zone" case. That, he said, was nearly 10 
years ago -- and the charge was manslaughter, not murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, meanwhile, had at least three other lawyers in court with him 
regularly -- Shapiro associate Sara L. Caplan, business attorney Leroy (Skip) 
Taft and longtime friend Robert Kardashian. 
</P>
<P>
 Kardashian has said he is working for free. The other lawyers could not be 
reached or declined to comment about inquiries on their fees. 
</P>
<P>
 It quickly becomes apparent to most clients, Braun and other defense lawyers 
said, that an hourly ticker makes little financial sense. "If he's paying him 
by the hour, he can't afford that," Cochran said of Simpson, a friend. "He's 
going to have to come to a lump sum." 
</P>
<P>
 Such flat-fee arrangements can be lucrative for the lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Menendez case, Abramson made $650,000 in fees for the first trial, 
according to court records. Now that the Menendez estate has virtually 
evaporated, taxpayers are paying Abramson's fee for the second trial, about 
$125,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can begin to guess just how much Shapiro and the defense team might 
command for Simpson's defense. But, experts said, the deal most likely would be 
structured to include one fee for the preliminary hearing and another, fatter 
sum for the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever the fees are, they're going to be high -- because of the complexity, 
enormity, seriousness and responsibility of the case," San Diego attorney Semel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tacked on to the fees, meanwhile, are the costs of the case -- the mounting 
charges for paralegals, investigators and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 A good investigator charges at least $75 per hour, Braun said, adding that 
$250 per hour is not unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the experts. It costs $550 to do DNA typing at Cellmark 
Diagnostics of Germantown, Md., the nation's largest private DNA testing 
laboratory. A molecular biologist to explain the test results for jurors costs 
$1,200 per day if the biologist has a Ph.D., $1,100 per day with no doctorate, 
according to Mark Stolorow, Cellmark's director of operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus travel expenses," Stolorow added. 
</P>
<P>
 "And this is an experts case," Cochran said. "This is a case about forensic 
pathology. You cannot be outgunned. The people have more resources than O.J. 
Simpson. To fight them, you've got to do everything you possibly can -- for as 
long as the money holds out."

COLUMN ONE; PUNJAB'S LAWLESS POLICE; OFFICERS WERE GIVEN ENORMOUS LEEWAY TO 
QUELL THE SIKH SEPARATIST UPRISING IN NORTHWEST INDIA. BUT EVEN AFTER THE 
GOVERNMENT GAINED THE UPPER HAND, CITIZENS STILL FACE OFFICIAL ACTS OF TERROR.

<P>
 On a country road lined with bougainvillea in flaming bloom, Sukhwinder Singh 
Bhatti's abductors, perspiring in the heat of a Punjab summer, laid their trap. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 4:30 p.m. when the bus carrying their quarry home from work moved into 
view. Two men in civilian clothes clutching light machine guns motioned it to 
stop and made five men get off. 
</P>
<P>
 Identifying the portly, bushy-bearded Sikh attorney among them, the gunmen 
roared away with their prey in a white van whose driver wore a mask. 
</P>
<P>
 That was May 12. Bhatti, 43, hasn't been heard from since. His wife, 
Harcharanjit Kaur, 30, the mother of their three children, is so sick with 
worry that her face has turned a cadaverous gray and her eyes have sunk into 
their orbits. 
</P>
<P>
 In all likelihood, the Sangrur District Bar Assn. member has been murdered. 
Fellow attorneys say the same fate befell three other defense lawyers before 
him, and one even vanished with his wife and 18-month-old son. 
</P>
<P>
 More examples of terrorism in violence-weary Punjab? It depends how one 
defines the term. As in other recent incidents, the prime suspects are not 
armed insurgents battling the Indian government, but the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no rule of law in Punjab," Bhatti's wife, wringing thin hands whose 
nails have been gnawed to the flesh, exclaimed as she wept. "We can count only 
on God." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years after the balance shifted decisively in the authorities' favor in 
the war on Sikh separatism, the Punjab populace is reaping a brutal and bloody 
harvest. Police had been given a virtually free hand to liquidate the 
militants. Now, like a machine that has escaped from its inventors, they 
continue to commit acts of illegal detention, torture, intimidation, murder and 
extortion. Elected officials and the courts seem powerless to stop them. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've created a monster, and now they are finding it difficult to control," 
a local journalist says. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a decade, a rebellion launched by often vicious extremists from 
the Sikh religious and ethnic minority raged in this flat, canal-laced land of 
rice, wheat and sunflower fields on India's northwest border. As recently as 
1991, the struggle for a separate Sikh state was claiming nearly 5,000 lives a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 To liquidate the separatist danger in India's breadbasket, the government 
embarked on a ruthless counterinsurgency campaign. Police began to kill any 
militant they caught, rather than turning suspects over to courts cowed by the 
extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 Now "the black period is over," Punjab's chief minister, Beant Singh, said 
earlier this year, proclaiming victory over the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 In one sense, he is undeniably right. In industrialized Ludhiana, the Indian 
state's largest city, alcohol-lubricated engagement parties and blue jeans for 
girls are back in vogue as people ignore the fundamentalists' ascetic fiats of 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
 After sundown, traffic again roars along roads, and farmers drive teams of 
oxen through fields they once fled at dusk. In 1992, when militants ordered an 
election boycott, only 20% of voters turned out. In partial elections in May, 
three times that percentage voted. 
</P>
<P>
 By Singh's estimate, only 12 to 13 "hard-core militants" remain at large, and 
most of them have fled Punjab. But police conduct continues to vary from the 
grisly to the outrageous, according to press accounts and interviews with 
dozens of victims and witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, four village women who went to Amritsar, seat of the holiest 
Sikh shrine, were illegally taken into custody, and the word jebkatri -- 
pickpocket -- was tattooed on their foreheads. 
</P>
<P>
 The women were obviously simple country folk who had nothing to do with either 
politics or crime, their lawyer says. Police so clearly exceeded the bounds of 
permissible behavior that the Punjab High Court ordered the women awarded 
50,000 rupees ($1,620) in compensation, and New Delhi authorities launched a 
criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an all-too-rare instance of errant police officers here being held 
accountable for their deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Punjab, there is rule of law on the statute books only," lawyeS. Gill, 
chairman of the Ludhiana-based International Human Rights Organization, a 
non-governmental monitoring group, charges. "Police have instructions to 
eliminate people who were directly or indirectly involved in the (separatist) 
movement: militants, relatives and sympathizers, religious figures." 
</P>
<P>
 Also at risk, he says, are people who try to monitor human rights abuses and 
attorneys who represent accused terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Even being married to the wrong person may be dangerous. In June, 1993, police 
dragged 40-year-old Gurnam Kaur by the hair from her Ludhiana home, clubbing 
her with rifle butts. 
</P>
<P>
 It later became clear that they were really seeking her husband, who is 
accused of being the brains behind the militant Babbar Khalsa International 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 The husband was arrested later in Delhi, police announced. But his wife never 
resurfaced, although the Indian Supreme Court's registrar ordered Punjab police 
to hold an inquiry and report "immediately." Her sister-in-law fears that Kaur 
was tortured to death by police in the town of Tarn Taran and her body dumped 
in the Beas River. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of Bhatti, a member of a separatist political party who served as 
legal counsel to Sikhs accused of terrorism, depicts in miniature how Punjab's 
police seem to be able to act at will. He was abducted 100 yards from a police 
checkpoint west of Sangrur, one reason many people believe police were 
responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 Another is the criminal complaint that Bhatti had filed on behalf of an old 
man tortured in police custody. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiff, Baldev Singh, is 74. In July, 1993, he says, he was picked up 
by police, stripped naked, trussed up with a rope and hung upside down from the 
ceiling of a police station. He was beaten with bamboo poles on the soles of 
his feet until he blacked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Singh says, police crushed his thighs beneath a heavy wooden roller. 
They asked him if he had been providing shelter to Sikh militants. No, he 
maintained. Again he lost consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 The torture was repeated for a second day. On the third day, he was freed. He 
had to be driven home because he couldn't walk. On orders from the Sangrur 
magistrate, three doctors examined Singh and corroborated that he had been 
tortured. Bhatti filed a legal complaint on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police officials were threatening Mr. Bhatti and me to withdraw the case," 
Singh now says. "They said we'd be eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged by the mysterious disappearance of yet another lawyer, Punjab High 
Court Judge V. K. Bali gave police until June 3 to produce Bhatti. But police 
showed up in court empty-handed, saying they had searched extensively and had 
no idea where he was. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian officialdom routinely rejects allegations of human rights violations in 
Punjab and other troubled areas of the country. The charismatic chief of the 
Punjab police, K. P .S. Gill, who is universally credited with crushing the 
insurgency, has categorically denied accusations of police brutality and 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
 During his visit to Washington in May, Indian Prime Minister P. V. Narasimha 
Rao assured a joint session of Congress that his government was "taking 
scrupulous care" to protect human rights, and he invited members of the Senate 
to go see the situation in Punjab for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Crisscrossing the dusty, sunbaked farmlands watered by tributaries of the 
Indus, one hears stories that are at odds with the reassuring statements of 
officials. Such testimony portrays police and paramilitary forces subject to no 
real judicial or governmental oversight. It seems to make a farce of the slogan 
painted on red-and-blue police checkpoints that promises the Punjab populace 
"protection with affection." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've come across no case where a prosecution against the guilty official was 
won," R. S. Maha, a Sangrur lawyer, says. "And the victim remains the victim." 
</P>
<P>
 In a study of alleged shootouts between militants and police in Punjab, the 
international human rights organization Amnesty International noted that in 169 
such "encounters" reported in the state's press, 266 purported Sikh separatists 
were killed, but not a single police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report released during Rao's U.S. visit, Human Rights Watch/Asia and 
Physicians for Human Rights put the death toll in Punjab's decade-long 
insurgency at more than 10,000, charging that most of the victims were 
summarily executed in police custody. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of Harpal Singh, 40, seems all too typical. Acquitted on terrorism 
charges last July, the agricultural worker was arrested the next day. Police, 
however, denied detaining him. A few days later, they announced that a militant 
armed with an AK-47 had been slain in an "encounter" near the village of 
Maheru. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctor who performed the autopsy confirmed to Singh's father that the dead 
man was his son. But it was a strange gunfight. The post-mortem showed he had 
been shot point-blank in the forehead twice with a pistol. Supposedly armed 
with a fast-firing assault rifle, he hurt no one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has ever been killed in a fake ambush," Punjab Chief Minister Singh 
has asserted. As for accusations of official brutality, he claims that during 
his more than two years in office, about 200 police officers have been punished 
for one offense or another. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a recent occurrence in Chandigarh, Punjab's capital, casts doubt on 
the official version of events. In March, police chief Gill summoned the press 
to witness the "surrender" of a celebrated ideologue of the separatist 
movement, Kanwar Singh Dhami. 
</P>
<P>
 The news conference rapidly deviated from its organizers' plans when the badly 
limping speaker announced that he had been held illegally and incommunicado by 
police for 10 months, along with his pregnant wife and 6-year-old son. Dhami 
told reporters that he had been severely tortured and warned while in custody 
that his family would be wiped out if he didn't "surrender" to Gill before the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
 After the uncooperative speaker was bundled off by police, Gill said he was 
obviously deranged. 
</P>
<P>
 A particularly gruesome "encounter slaying" in the town of Patti also has 
bared official misdeeds. Police in October left a body at the Civil Hospital, 
asking that an autopsy be performed. Sarabjit Singh's head was bathed in blood, 
witnesses remember; he had been shot in the back of the skull with a 
small-caliber gun. 
</P>
<P>
 When the corpse began to talk, the hospital staff was flabbergasted. Singh, it 
turned out, wasn't dead but was severely wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 The entry hole left by the bullet was dressed, and he was given injections and 
intravenous glucose. Then, Sita Ram, a police officer, returned. He grabbed 
Singh by the arms and legs and tossed him into a patrol vehicle, witnesses 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour later, the police were back. Again, they wanted a post-mortem 
performed. This time, Singh was truly dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The case appears to be one of the very few in Punjab where a police officer 
may be punished for the use of excessive force, leading some to hope that 
officials of the government and courts are trying harder to rein in police. Ram 
is in jail pending trial. But at the hospital, the doctor who treated Singh is 
afraid to discuss the case for fear that Ram's fellow officers may take 
revenge. Securing a murder conviction may be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, a terrorism 
suspect in India can be held for up to two years without trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Ludhiana human rights activist and lawyer Gill estimates that some Sikhs have 
been in jail for up to four years without having been convicted of any crime or 
even having gone to court. 
</P>
<P>
 His organization, which has undisguised sympathy for the separatist struggle, 
has estimated that 7,000 to 8,000 activists, relatives and sympathizers are 
languishing in Indian jails, often in custody illegally. When quizzed earlier 
this year, Chief Minister Singh maintained that only 800 to 900 "terrorists" 
were in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Events in Punjab have much wider implications because police techniques 
pioneered there are being extended to other troubled areas of India, including 
the state of Jammu and Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
 It was announced in May, for instance, that the new post of superintendent of 
police for operations would be created in districts of Kashmir where Muslim 
insurgents are particularly active. According to some Punjab human rights 
activists, the holder of this job is in charge of faking the deaths of 
detainees in "encounters." 
</P>
<P>
 Police chief Gill has also admitted that police hit teams have been created in 
Punjab to "trace, identify and kill top militants" instead of arresting them. 
In May, 1993, one squad went all the way to Calcutta to shoot dead an alleged 
militant and his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, nine police assassins went to West Bengal to kill another 
alleged terrorist. Local authorities were so infuriated that they disarmed the 
Punjab officers and barred them from leaving until an investigation is 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Punjab police showed their colors again this month at a New Delhi press 
conference called after their chief was chosen head of India's field hockey 
federation. When a pair of journalists cast doubt on Gill's qualifications for 
the job, they were hustled out by five high-ranking Punjab officers and given a 
thrashing. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian authorities' biggest break in their fight against armed Sikh militancy 
came in February, 1993, when Gurbachan Singh Manochahal, chief of the 
underground committee that had been spearheading the Sikh separatist struggle, 
was gunned down after emerging from a bunker hidden beneath a cowshed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a poor farming village near Tarn Taran, the dead militant's sister-in-law 
is struggling to get by. "We have no peace," Kashmir Kaur complains. Police 
seized the sprawling farmhouse occupied by the family, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 How many members of her family are still alive? Kaur pauses to think. 
Gurbachan's mother and father disappeared following their detention by police, 
she says. The same thing happened to two of his four brothers. In all, she 
concludes, 10 family members have vanished or been killed while in the custody 
of Punjab police. 
</P>
<P>
 "The peace they talk about has been built on the bones of my relatives," Kaur 
says.

KIM IL SUNG, N. KOREA'S LONGTIME LEADER, DIES; ASIA: DEATH OF COMMUNIST 
DICTATOR AT 82 COMES WEEKS BEFORE NORTH-SOUTH MEETING. EXPERTS EXPECT 
INSTABILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kim Il Sung, the Communist dictator who ruled North Korea for more than four 
decades and pushed the isolated regime to the brink of nuclear confrontation 
with the world, died of a heart attack Friday at age 82, Radio Pyongyang 
reported today.  
</P>
<P>
 Kim, the world's longest-ruling Communist leader and the object of a slavish 
personality cult, collapsed Thursday just a few weeks before a historic meeting 
with South Korean President Kim Young Sam aimed at easing the mounting nuclear 
tensions. Pyongyang's suspected development of nuclear weapons had raised an 
international outcry, leading to threats of economic sanctions and even some 
predictions of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Il Sung, however, recently met with former President Jimmy Carter and 
expressed a desire to suspend the nation's nuclear program and open ties with 
the United States. As a result, the United States and North Korea had begun a 
third round of high-level talks in Geneva on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's sudden death, however, throws the outlook into confusion and sets off 
the Korean peninsula's gravest crisis since the 1950 Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Young Sam received the news a little after noon today. He immediately 
summoned his defense minister and ordered him to "prepare for all 
contingencies." 
</P>
<P>
 The armed forces have been put on alert, South Korean television reported. Kim 
was to shortly convene an emergency Cabinet meeting, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, a spokesman said the White House was aware of the report and 
was attempting to get more details. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of North Korea's capital wept hysterically after hearing the news, a 
Beijing-based reporter accredited to Pyongyang said today.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is mass shock and hysteria," said Krzysztof Darewicz, a correspondent 
for the Polish news agency PAP. "In our embassy the gardeners and translators 
just sit and cry. People who tried to go shopping said they could not because 
shop assistants do nothing but cry."  
</P>
<P>
 Darewicz said he had been in contact with his sources in Pyongyang by 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Il Sung will be succeeded by his son, Kim Jong Il, whom analysts regard as 
more dangerous and unpredictable than his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Jong Il, a reclusive figure who lacks his father's stature and genuine 
adoration by the people, is suspected of employing kidnaping, terrorism and 
guerrilla warfare to achieve his ends. He is said to have masterminded a 1983 
bombing in Burma, now Myanmar, that killed 17 South Korean officials and the 
1987 midair bombing of a South Korean airliner that killed all 115 people 
aboard.  
</P>
<P>
 Analysts believe a Kim Jong Il regime, failing to command loyalty, may be 
vulnerable to a coup. As a result, some say the senior Kim wanted to hand over 
a nuclear arsenal to his son to ensure the younger Kim's continued rule in the 
Communist world's only dynastic succession. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Il Sung was lionized as a demigod and great guerrilla leader who liberated 
North Korea from the clutches of Japanese colonialism. The Institute of North 
Korean Studies in Seoul said, however, that he actually had a "paltry record of 
guerrilla combat" and was plucked out of the then-Soviet army to run the newly 
won territory after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 But under an extravagant personality cult, Kim was deified as having almost 
single-handedly driven out the Japanese; his image is memorialized in statues, 
posters, books, comics and lapel pins throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korean propagandists under Kim referred to their country as a paradise, 
and visitors reported that Kim's people showed signs of respect toward the man 
they called the Great Leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Kim's more than four decades as leader of the Communist northern half of 
Korea were marked by repression at home and constant military action against 
Western-aligned South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kim was seen in the West as a destabilizing influence in world 
affairs, and in Beijing and Moscow as a problem ally, he was admired in parts 
of the Third World for providing his people with a high standard of living. He 
championed the ideology of juche , or self-reliance. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, however, crop failures and demands by Russia and China that 
Pyongyang begin paying for goods in hard currency have pushed North Korea to 
the brink of economic collapse. There have been widespread reports of severe 
food shortages, growing public unrest and an increasing number of defectors to 
China and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Korea, a Japanese colony from 1910 until 1945, was divided into Soviet and 
American zones after World War II. Kim attracted the world's attention on June 
25, 1950, when he sent his troops across the military demarcation line in an 
attempt to unify the Korean peninsula by force.  
</P>
<P>
 His forces scored important early victories, but within days of the attack a 
United Nations force under American command entered the war on the side of the 
U.S.-backed Republic of Korea. By October, Kim was a refugee in China. 
</P>
<P>
 After almost a million Chinese troops joined the fighting and pushed back the 
U.N. forces, Kim was reinstated in Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, which failed to move the boundary line either north or south, 
Kim survived a challenge to his rule by purging his government of Communists 
who had come from South Korea, saying they had spied for the United States 
during the war and that they were plotting to overthrow the government. Five 
years later, Kim showed his independence by ridding his Korean Workers Party of 
pro-China Communists. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's invasion of the South was just one example of the aggressive foreign 
policy he followed with only minor interruptions until his death. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1968, the North Korean navy captured the U.S. electronic surveillance ship 
Pueblo and made prisoners of its crew. The following year, a North Korean 
assassination team made it to within yards of the residence of South Korean 
President Park Chung Hee. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, North Korean border guards hacked to death two U.S. officers in the 
demilitarized zone between North and South. 
</P>
<P>
 Support of Third World governments, especially those opposed to the United 
States, was a cornerstone of Kim's foreign policy. Kim's men trained 
Palestinian guerrillas; his pilots are reported to have flown missions for the 
Libyan air force. At one time, Kim exchanged weapons for oil with Iran and 
enjoyed good relations with the Sandinista government of Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's early life is a mystery, and because of the heavy rewriting of history 
under his rule, it may never be fully known. 
</P>
<P>
 According to North Korean propagandists, Kim led a large rebel force in the 
1930s and fought 10,000 battles against the Japanese -- 4,774 of them in the 
year 1936 -- never lost a skirmish and entered Pyongyang as a marshal at the 
head of his army of liberation. 
</P>
<P>
 The only information historians outside North Korea are sure of is that Kim 
was born near Pyongyang as Kim Song Ju on April 15, 1912, into a family of 
farmers and teachers. Kim emigrated with his father to North China, where he 
attended a Chinese school. 
</P>
<P>
 There is evidence suggesting that Kim led a small unit of about 200 Korean 
guerrillas but this apparently was attached to the Chinese Communist Party. It 
is not known whether there were any separate Korean groups fighting against 
Japanese rule either in Korea or in the Japanese-occupied regions of China. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim is known to have been involved in just one battle, an attack on a Japanese 
police station in which seven Japanese were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear when Kim adopted the nom de guerre Kim Il Sung, but records 
indicate that there were no fewer than four guerrilla leaders with that name 
active in northern China. By 1941, the Japanese army was in firm control of the 
region, and Kim fled to the Soviet Union with a group of about 120 others. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim is known to have attended a Soviet military academy during World War II. 
When he returned to Korea at the end of the war, he was a Soviet citizen and a 
captain in the Soviet army. 
</P>
<P>
 He was installed by Soviet troops to head what Moscow hoped would be a 
satellite state, but he learned to exploit the strategic position of his 
country, as well as the later Sino-Soviet split. Thus he obtained aid from both 
China and the Soviet Union without falling completely into the orbit of either.

 TOUR DE OVER: The wheels came off Friday for cyclist Greg LeMond. He dropped 
out of the Tour de France (C11), and his future as a top rider may be 
uncertain. . . . But former U.S. cycling champion Barry Wolfe, 62, of Woodland 
Hills says LeMond will always be special. "He put U.S. cycling on a new level," 
Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW NAME: The rebuilt Golden State-Antelope Valley Freeway interchange 
reopened Friday, and was renamed after the police officer who died there after 
the quake (B1). But the event got off to a quick start, so his fellow cops 
missed the big moment. . . . They'll get another chance, however, in a few 
months. "We'll do something more official when the signs are made," said 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD GAME: Bryan LaCour didn't start for his team during its first Olympic 
Festival baseball game. But he certainly knew how to finish. LaCour (above), 
who attended Chatsworth High, got two hits and played well in the field. . . . 
"I was kind of mad I didn't start," he said, "so I wanted to show something." 
(C14) 
</P>
<P>
 REST OF STORY: The ancient Israelites got a bad deal from biblical prophets, 
according to Prof. Ziony Zevit of the University of Judaism in the Sepulveda 
Pass. Zevit says the prophets called them whore-like for worshiping other 
deities, but didn't give the whole story (B11). . . . For modern Bible readers, 
"it would be as if I wanted to study Catholic doctrine, but all I had were the 
writings of Martin Luther," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 OTHER GUMPS: Forrest Gump is the big Gump these days, and no wonder. But don't 
forget the Gump business in Santa Clarita -- you see their name on portable 
toilets everywhere. . . . "We certainly haven't been hurt in any way by it," 
said Barry Gump, president of Andy Gump Inc., talking about the movie's ad 
campaign. "Had we had a little more advance notice, we might have tried to play 
along with it." Michael Arkush

U.S. SEEKS REFUGE SITES FOR HAITIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER and DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, in an attempt to salvage its Haitian refugee 
policy, contacted countries as far away as West Africa on Friday in a search 
for havens and pledged that the United States will pay all costs of their 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal came as the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada became the first 
country to officially agree to fill part of the void created when Panamanian 
President Guillermo Endara shocked the Administration on Thursday by canceling 
Panama's agreement to take 10,000 Haitian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Grenadian Prime Minister Nicholas Brathwaite said his government will 
participate, although details have not been worked out. U.S. officials expect 
Antigua and Dominica also to participate. But the three islands are so small 
that they are unlikely to make up for the loss of the planned camps in Panama, 
which would have been the first and largest of the refugee sites. 
</P>
<P>
 In Naples, Italy, President Clinton sweetened the pot for potential havens by 
pledging that the United States will pay the full costs of operating Haitian 
refugee sites and will help host governments police the facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House official said the Administration has asked several countries in 
West Africa to take in some of the Haitians, who are fleeing the impoverished 
island nation in ever-increasing numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in the discussion stage," the official said. "We don't want to 
divulge which countries we're talking to because that will make the discussions 
more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 "After all," he added, "West Africa is not much farther than Brazil or the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, to prepare U.S. forces around Haiti for possible 
military action, officials said the Pentagon will order the amphibious command 
ship Mt. Whitney to the Caribbean next week to replace the amphibious assault 
ship Wasp, which has been stationed in the area for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Mt. Whitney does not carry the 650-troop Marine complement that 
the Wasp does, the communications vessel does have facilities to serve as the 
nerve center for coordinating air and ground attacks by all four armed 
services. About 2,000 Marines are steaming toward Haiti aboard the amphibious 
assault ship Inchon. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the transfer of ships, which is expected to be announced 
Tuesday, is part of a plan to bolster U.S. naval capability in the area. The 
Inchon is expected to be relieved by the Wasp in late August or early 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon said Friday that 1,859 Haitians had been picked up at sea since 
Thursday, up 150 or so from the previous day. This increases the total since 
June 15 to nearly 16,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Schrager, spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince, said Coast 
Guard cutters and Navy ships are so overloaded with refugees that they are 
unable to pick up all of the Haitians trying to escape the island in small 
boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to the flood of refugees, the Administration announced this week that 
Haitians intercepted at sea would be transported to "safe havens" outside the 
United States where they could remain as long as the oppressive military 
government remains in power in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 It said that Haitians hoping to win asylum in the United States must apply at 
the embassy in Port-au-Prince or at two provincial centers where immigration 
inspectors will conduct extensive interviews to determine if they have a 
well-founded fear of persecution, the international standard for refugee 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that standards for admission to the planned havens are far 
looser. Haitians need only say that they want to go to a camp rather than be 
returned to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials said that those taken to the camps would not be allowed to apply 
for admission to the United States and would not be permitted to mingle with 
the population of the host country. In effect, the camps will be prison 
compounds, kept intentionally Spartan to prevent them from becoming attractive 
alternatives to the desperate conditions in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 In Naples, Clinton said he was disappointed that Endara reneged on his promise 
to establish camps in Panama. But the President expressed confidence that other 
sites can be found. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he personally had contacted leaders of several governments that might 
establish havens, assuring them "that they would bear no cost and that they 
would not have to worry about the security problems." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said they could not estimate how much that will cost the 
American government, although it will certainly be tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Endara continued to complain that American negotiators had 
trampled on Panamanian dignity. "They treated me as if this were a banana 
republic," Endara said in an interview with Telemundo television news. 
</P>
<P>
 But President-elect Ernesto Perez Balladares, who will succeed Endara in 
September, said he is willing to talk with Clinton about reviving plans for 
Panama camps. He said Endara's reversal "makes us an international 
laughingstock." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said the only permanent solution to the Haitian crisis is the removal 
of the military government of Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras. Although the President 
said he hopes that economic sanctions will bring down the regime, he said an 
American invasion is possible, if peaceful methods do not succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the conduct of the (Haitian) military leaders will have more than 
anything else to do with what options are considered . . . and their conduct 
has not been good," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a senior American official accompanying Clinton sought to dampen 
speculation that U.S. military action is imminent. "You all are looking for 
some sort of date certain," he told reporters. "That's not where we are." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.) complained that Clinton is following 
"a policy of anarchy" that may make military action inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "With each new failure we move closer to direct military intervention," Mfume 
said. "The worst kind of military intervention is the kind that was avoidable."

INSURANCE QUICK FIX CALLED HAZARD TO HEALTH REFORM; LEGISLATION: ANALYSTS WARN 
THAT CONGRESS WOULD BE SHORTSIGHTED TO FOCUS ONLY ON COVERAGE DISCRIMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It sounds so simple: Ban insurers from jacking up rates on sick people and 
force them to accept all applicants, offering the same rates regardless of age 
or health status. 
</P>
<P>
 No single health reform proposal enjoys broader support among the public or 
members of Congress. And no wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending discriminatory insurance practices would instantly allay deep-seated 
fears of middle-class Americans that they might lose coverage when they change 
jobs or be priced out of the market when they become seriously ill. In poll 
after poll, 60% to 80% or more of respondents favor such reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a big hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless accompanied by a requirement that everyone be insured, insurance 
reforms would mean higher premiums for the insured and actually increase the 
ranks of the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because such reforms would enable the sick and the vulnerable to buy 
insurance, often for the first time. Their high health costs would force 
insurers to increase premiums across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the young and the healthy -- confronted by rising rates -- might 
drop coverage, secure in the knowledge that they could buy insurance when they 
needed it. That in turn would increase premiums for everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus would begin a vicious cycle that, experts say, would hasten the 
deterioration of the nation's health care financing system. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect is growing that Congress will abandon comprehensive health care 
reform this year and instead do little more than try to remedy the apparent 
shortcomings of today's insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
 That approach could do more harm than good. Dire warnings of the unintended 
consequences of insurance reform are being sounded by such disparate analysts 
and advocates as conservative hospital lobbyist Michael Bromberg and First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, architect of President Clinton's agenda for change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurance reforms will solve many of the problems that the insured, voting 
middle class is worried about. But it won't control costs or insure the 
uninsured -- the two biggest challenges we face," said Drew Altman, president 
of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care philanthropy based in Menlo 
Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "You buy some time, but costs will continue to escalate," added Edward F. 
Howard, executive vice president of the Alliance for Health Reform, a 
nonpartisan educational group here. "So you lay the groundwork for a bigger 
explosion in a few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as Congress prepares to begin floor debate on health reform, the appeal 
of insurance reforms may prove all but irresistable. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every health reform bill introduced in recent years contains such 
measures -- including all four bills reported out recently by two committees in 
each chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance reforms "solve real problems for real people. And it can happen 
without turning the system on its head," said Gail Wilensky, a health expert in 
former President George Bush's White House who now advises congressional 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilensky, former head of the Health Care Financing Administration, said that 
"it's important for Congress to say to the American people: 'We can do 
something, and here's one piece, signed, sealed and delivered.' "  
</P>
<P>
 She and other advocates of incrementalism acknowledge that insurance reforms 
alone will do little for the estimated 38 million uninsured Americans. But they 
say that such measures are a good and realistic beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents argue that insurance reforms alone are doomed to fail unless they 
are accompanied by a requirement leading to universal coverage, such as 
Clinton's controversial proposal to require all employers to pay at least 80% 
of workers' insurance premiums, with individuals picking up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance reforms alone "just won't work," said Marvin B. Hall, president of 
the Hawaii Medical Service Assn., the largest insurance company in that state. 
"You'd push costs even higher." 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurance reforms by themselves will increase premiums substantially because 
you'd be allowing back into the group people who have been excluded primarily 
because of costs," said John Rother, legislative director of the American Assn. 
of Retired Persons. "And you haven't done anything at all about the cost of 
health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the winners of insurance market reforms, at least in the short term, 
would be small businesses. Most such reforms being contemplated by Congress 
would give them a choice of health plans by pooling them into large, voluntary 
purchasing groups, thus affording them lower rates enjoyed by large groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest losers would be younger people, whose rates would rise sharply. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see a bunch that's going to drop out," said Richard I. Smith, an 
analyst at the Assn. of Private Pension and Welfare Plans. "And what problems 
are we solving if we end up just producing more uninsured?" 
</P>
<P>
 Willis D. Gradison Jr., head of the Health Insurance Assn. of America, agreed, 
saying that insurance reforms "could easily have just the opposite effect of 
what is intended." He cited the experience of New York state as a prime 
example. 
</P>
<P>
 There, a law took effect in April of 1993 that barred insurers from setting 
premiums based on age, sex or health status and required them to guarantee 
coverage to all. 
</P>
<P>
 After just nine months, 40% of policyholders at Mutual of Omaha, the largest 
underwriter of individual policies in New York, saw their premiums drop, 
according to Medicine & Health, a weekly newsletter. But 60% experienced 
increases of as much as 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the number of uninsured grew by more than 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to pave the way for national insurance market reforms as a first step 
toward broader reforms, Reps. J. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.) and Michael Bilirakis 
(R-Fla.) have introduced just such a bill, saying that it is "designed to 
re-establish the health reform debate on a foundation of agreement rather than 
one of divisiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some members have made clear that that's as far as they are willing to go," 
said Martin Corry, AARP's director of federal affairs. "But we think that's 
pretty shortsighted." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilensky, the Republican consultant, worries that insurance reforms could sap 
the will of Congress to press on with more comprehensive reforms, such as 
expanding coverage to the uninsured. "That could be harder to do after you've 
made the middle class happy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Clinton has a different concern. In recent remarks before a business 
group here, she predicted that if Congress fails to enact comprehensive reform 
this year, the system will deteriorate to the point where an exasperated public 
will demand a quick fix from Congress -- namely a government-financed, 
single-payer system such as Canada's. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do not achieve comprehensive health care reform this year," Mrs. 
Clinton said, "we will have a single-payer system, I would argue, around the 
year 2000. . . . There will be a grass-roots movement that sweeps this 
country."

JUDGE CITES 'AMPLE EVIDENCE,' ORDERS SIMPSON TO STAND TRIAL; COURT: CRIMINALIST 
TESTIFIES THAT BLOOD DROP FOUND AT CRIME SCENE MATCHES FORMER ATHLETE'S TYPE. 
DEFENSE ATTORNEY SAYS HE WILL PUSH FOR AN EARLY TRIAL DATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Football great O.J. Simpson must stand trial for the murders of his ex-wife 
and a friend of hers, a Municipal Court judge ruled Friday, setting the stage 
for a spectacle that could send the superstar to Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court has carefully considered the evidence in this case and the 
arguments of counsel," said Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell as a 
six-day preliminary hearing televised across the nation came to a close. "The 
court feels that there is ample evidence to establish the strong suspicion of 
the guilt of the accused." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from the bench, Kennedy-Powell directed the somber-faced Simpson, 
dressed in a dark suit and maroon tie, to stand. She then informed him that 
"there is sufficient cause to believe this defendant guilty" of the murder 
charges against him and ordered him to be arraigned in Superior Court on July 
22. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, he will be held without bail at the Men's Central Jail, where he 
has been locked up since his arrest last month. 
</P>
<P>
 When the hearing concluded, family members of Nicole Brown Simpson left 
arm-in-arm, followed by those of Ronald Lyle Goldman, who also huddled close 
together for comfort. Simpson, who turns 47 today, was taken away in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 He could come to trial as early as mid-September. Although declining to 
comment in detail, Simpson attorney Robert L. Shapiro said he will seek a 
speedy trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to have the trial in a very short period of time," he said as he 
ducked into his car to avoid a crush of reporters outside the Criminal Courts 
Building in Downtown Los Angeles. "We are going to start working tonight. We 
are not going to waste time." 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference after the hearing, Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil 
Garcetti said his team of prosecutors will be ready to begin in September if 
Simpson's lawyers exercise their right to insist upon a trial within 60 days of 
his Superior Court arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Simpson sat impassively as Kennedy-Powell announced her decision, 
which had been predicted by experienced lawyers but vigorously contested by 
Simpson's high-profile legal team. For the past six days, they subjected 
prosecution witnesses to intense cross-examination and accused police of 
illegally searching Simpson's home in the hours after the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 They lost that effort, and on the hearing's final, climactic day, a police 
scientific analyst testified that a blood drop found at the scene of the crime 
matched Simpson's blood type in several important respects. That was the first 
time that physical evidence has been presented in court linking Simpson to the 
scene of the crime. The analyst, LAPD crime lab supervisor Gregory Matheson, 
said the blood sample narrows the list of people who possibly could have left 
that drop to as few as 1 in 200. 
</P>
<P>
 A deputy medical examiner who performed the autopsies in the case followed 
Matheson to the stand and, using drawings, described in grim detail the many 
wounds inflicted on Goldman and Nicole Simpson, who were found lying in deep 
pools of blood on June 13. The examiner, Dr. Irwin L. Golden, noted that both 
victims suffered gashes across their necks and numerous wounds on their hands, 
an indication that they tried to fend off the thrusts of the assailant's 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 He also for the first time raised the possibility that more than one weapon 
might have been used in the attacks, noting that at least some of the wounds 
appeared different than the majority of cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony by Friday's witnesses capped a preliminary hearing in which 
prosecutors introduced a pair of bloody gloves -- one found at the murder 
scene, one on a walkway behind Simpson's home -- as well as bloodstains taken 
from his car and driveway. The district attorney's office also pounded away at 
Simpson's alibi by introducing witnesses who suggested that the murders may 
have occurred as early as 10:15 p.m. or 10:20 p.m. on June 12 -- testimony that 
challenged the contention of Simpson's attorneys, who said their client could 
not have committed the murders in part because he was home waiting for a 
limousine at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Simpson's lawyers attacked the credibility of witnesses and 
accused the police of mishandling the investigation. On Friday, they also 
raised questions about the coroner's work, noting that medical examiners waited 
hours before performing tests that might have more closely pinpointed the time 
of death. 
</P>
<P>
 In a last-ditch effort to have the case dismissed without a trial, Shapiro 
urged Kennedy-Powell to toss out the case because the prosecution theory 
linking Simpson to the crime "just doesn't stand up to logic." Shapiro based 
that argument largely on what he said were holes in the prosecution cases. 
</P>
<P>
 To have committed the crime, Shapiro said, Simpson would have had less than an 
hour to kill two victims, abandon his bloody clothing, dispose of the murder 
weapon and a pair of bloody shoes "and then go back to his house and leave a 
bloody glove in his back yard." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro, his voice rising, also launched a two-prong challenge to the 
testimony indicating that a blood sample from the crime scene matches Simpson's 
blood type. First, he said, tens of thousands of people in Los Angeles alone 
have blood with the same characteristics; and, second, even if it does turn out 
to be Simpson's blood at the scene, the location also was the home of his 
children, which he visited often. Simpson therefore could have cut himself on 
another occasion, explaining the blood droplets, Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro also raised the possibility that other suspects may be under 
investigation because a police detective testified Thursday that new leads 
continue to arrive all the time and that the investigation continues. But 
police sources said Friday that there is not any other suspect being sought, an 
assessment with which Garcetti concurred at his news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came her time to address the court Friday afternoon, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Marcia Clark, who has sparred with Shapiro since even before the hearing 
began, said her adversary's closing remarks typically misrepresented the case 
against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence is consistent and very powerful," she said, "even at this early 
stage of the case to indicate that the defendant has indeed committed every 
crime that he is charged with." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark conceded that the blood tests presented in court Friday do not single 
out Simpson as the only possible suspect in the case. But when combined with 
other evidence, such as the matching bloody glove found at his house and the 
circumstances surrounding his whereabouts during the hour that prosecutors 
believe the killings took place, Clark said, "virtually everyone except for the 
defendant" can be eliminated as a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution built its case methodically over the past week, an unusual 
approach to a preliminary hearing because prosecutors often present only 
minimal evidence in those proceedings. But with the nation watching, they 
called witness after witness, following what Clark described as a "trail of 
blood" leading from the crime scene and picking up at Simpson's house. They 
left the most important evidence for the hearing's final hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Matheson, a supervisor at the Los Angeles Police Department crime lab, 
provided the cornerstone of the prosecution's physical evidence, and his 
testimony had been interrupted late Thursday when court recessed for the day 
without him getting the chance to detail the results of any blood tests. 
</P>
<P>
 That left an air of suspense hanging over the proceedings when they reconvened 
Friday morning. But Clark quickly dispelled it by moving Matheson to the heart 
of his testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning from Clark, Matheson produced a chart detailing specifics of 
the blood types of O.J. Simpson, Nicole Simpson, Goldman and a sample taken 
from the cobblestone path leading away from the murder scene. Using that chart, 
Matheson explained the testing procedures employed to determine a person's 
blood type and to rule out possible matches. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, he said, only one of the three people whose blood type was 
analyzed could have been the source of that droplet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could Nicole Simpson have left the blood drop at 875 South Bundy?" Clark 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Matheson responded. 
</P>
<P>
 "With respect to Ronald Goldman . . . could he have been a source of that 
blood drop on the trail?" the prosecutor continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Matheson answered. "He could not." 
</P>
<P>
 "With respect to the defendant, could he have been the source of the blood 
drop that was found on the trail at 875 South Bundy?" Clark then asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Matheson said. "He can be included in the group of possibles." 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing with that questioning, Clark then sought to show that the group of 
people who could have been the source of that blood was small enough to suggest 
Simpson as a likely suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Matheson said he computed the frequency of each of the three genetic markers 
occurring in a single sample and determined that 0.43% of the population would 
share those characteristics -- meaning that the odds against someone having an 
identical match are more than 200 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In his cross-examination, however, Simpson lawyer Gerald F. Uelmen elicited an 
admission from Matheson that samples recovered from crime scenes sometimes 
blend blood from more than one person, confusing the analysis and changing the 
odds. Given the blood characteristics in this case, Matheson said that could 
mean that one out of every 100, rather than 200, people could have produced 
characteristics such as the one found leading away from the two bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you talk about that kind of frequency in a population the size of Los 
Angeles, for example, where we have 8 million people, you're saying that there 
are something on the order of 40,000 to 80,000 other people whose blood would 
produce the identical genetic markers that you have identified?" Uelmen 
suggested to Matheson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Approximately, that's correct, yes," Matheson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The test results presented in court Friday represent a first glimpse at the 
battery of procedures that investigators expect to perform on blood samples 
recovered from the scene of the crime and Simpson's home. The most precise, DNA 
tests, will not be completed for several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although preliminary DNA tests have been completed, prosecutors did not seek 
to admit those results during the preliminary hearing. They need only show at 
this hearing that there is sufficient evidence for Simpson to stand trial, not 
that he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference after the hearing, Garcetti said he is confident that the 
DNA results will be ready in time for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Matheson's testimony provided the linchpin of the prosecution's preliminary 
hearing case, but he was followed to the stand by an equally captivating 
witness, the medical examiner who performed the autopsies on the victims' 
bodies and who clinically described their extensive injuries before a 
spellbound courtroom Friday. Simpson sighed heavily and rolled his head back as 
Deputy Medical Examiner Dr. Irwin L. Golden of the Los Angeles County coroner's 
office described the black dress and undergarments that Nicole Simpson was 
wearing when she was murdered a few feet from the front door of her Brentwood 
condominium, where her two children were sleeping inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden was questioned by Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman, whose gentle 
style contrasts with Clark's scrappy approach to witnesses. After describing 
his qualifications, Golden quietly detailed the cutting, slashing and puncture 
wounds to both victims. 
</P>
<P>
 As they have been throughout the preliminary hearing, family members of the 
two victims were in court for that testimony. Members of the Goldman family 
hugged each other tightly as the medical examiner described the state of the 
bodies in clinical terms. Nicole Simpson's sister grimaced and clenched her 
teeth, staring directly ahead as Golden explained how her sibling died. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson, Golden said, died from a cut to her throat so deep that it 
nicked her spinal column. Golden described it as a "gaping" wound and pointed 
to a chart in which it was highlighted in deep red. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nicole Simpson's knife wounds were largely confined to her head and 
neck, Goldman suffered dozens of knife wounds up and down his body, including 
three sets that could have killed him -- punctures to his right lung, a deep 
pair of slashes across his throat and a five-inch deep wound to the left side 
of his abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 Both victims also were cut on the hands, evidence that they attempted to fight 
off their attacker, Golden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman's sister and stepmother, who have sat side by side through much of the 
hearing, cried quietly and held each other's hands while Golden described the 
attack on the young man, who would have turned 26 last weekend. Goldman's 
father left court before hearing the medical examiner testify. 
</P>
<P>
 As the case passes from Municipal to Superior Court, a mystery moves with it. 
In court last week, Judge Kennedy-Powell held up a bulky envelope containing 
evidence that Shapiro had turned over to another judge for safekeeping. Neither 
police nor prosecutors have been allowed to look inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy-Powell said Friday that her decision to order Simpson to stand trial 
was not influenced in any way by the envelope or its contents, which are 
unknown even to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "That envelope, in a sealed condition, will be transferred," Kennedy-Powell 
said, "to the Superior Court for such further rulings as are appropriate at a 
future point in time." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Tina Daunt and Carla Hall contributed to this report. The 
Deadly Attack 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Irwin L. Golden, a medical examiner who performed the autopsies on Nicole 
Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, testified that the following injuries were 
the most severe: NICOLE BROWN SIMPSON 
</P>
<P>
 1. A "gaping wound" that severed both carotid arteries and nicked both jugular 
vein, causing extensive blood loss. The fatal wound reached to her spine. 
</P>
<P>
 2. A bruise on the right side of scalp RONALD LYLE GOLDMAN 
</P>
<P>
 3. Two wounds on right side of his neck, one of which severed jugular 
</P>
<P>
 4. Two wounds that entered through rib cage and into right lung; both 
considered fatal 
</P>
<P>
 5. 5.5-inch-deep wound to the abdomen considered fatal OTHER WOUNDS 
</P>
<P>
 Golden also noted many "defensive" cuts and abrasions to the victims' arms, 
hands, faces and bodies. Smaller stab wounds were found on the right side of 
Nicole Brown Simpson's neck, and she had three cuts on the back of her head. 
Goldman had a deep but not fatal wound to the left thigh.

JAPAN; SCIENCE AGENCY HEAD INHERITED IRON WILL FROM FAMED FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan's first female astronaut lifted off Friday, but the Science and 
Technology Agency chief she calls from the cosmos is just as conspicuous. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief is also a woman -- and, it turns out, the most popular member of 
Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama's new Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Makiko Tanaka, 50, was elected to the lower house of Parliament just last 
July. Last week, however, she became director general of the science agency in 
a stratospheric promotion. The public seems to approve: In a poll this week by 
the respected Asahi Shimbun newspaper, a plurality of those surveyed named 
Tanaka as the Cabinet's most prominent member. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanaka is fond of saying she was "just a housewife" until her election, in 
which she ran as an independent, later switching to the Liberal Democratic 
Party. But she was never simply a housewife, nor is she just any rookie 
legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 She is the only child of the late Kakuei Tanaka, Japan's legendary former 
prime minister known as both the incarnation of political corruption and an 
unforgettably dynamic leader. Disgraced in a bribery scandal, he faded from 
politics after suffering a stroke in 1985, but the Tanaka support base has 
remained solid. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter inherited her father's supporters. She also took on his iron will 
and energy, street smarts and ineffable quality of political glamour, analysts 
say. Like her father, whose common touch endeared him to the public, Tanaka 
says she intends to champion the interests of society's have-nots -- the "weak 
upon whom the political light doesn't shine," she has called them. 
</P>
<P>
 Her key interests are education, welfare and health care -- interests shaped 
in part when she nursed her father through his long illness before he died in 
December. But her supporters talk her up as a future foreign minister -- she 
studied at an American high school and is fluent in English and Spanish -- or 
dream she can become Japan's first female prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is gifted with political power and instincts, and is well-trained because 
she comes from a political family," said Kuniko Inoguchi, a political science 
professor. "Her potential is enormous." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanaka's husband, Naoki, is also a lower house member, and the couple have 
three children. Yet it was the close, sometimes tempestuous relationship 
between father and daughter that most shaped Tanaka. 
</P>
<P>
 A Tokyo native born Jan. 14, 1944, Tanaka studied politics at her father's 
feet. She debuted on the world political stage at 13, at a party for the 
Burmese telecommunications minister when her father held a similar post. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, she traveled with him around the world, attending international 
conferences and meeting VIPs, from Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos to 
the Rockefeller family. 
</P>
<P>
 Kakuei Tanaka clearly had plans for his daughter beyond tending the hearth. He 
proudly introduced her as "my fighting cock of a daughter" and ordered his 
wife, Hana, not to waste time teaching Makiko such duties as how to make miso 
soup. 
</P>
<P>
 The battles between the strong-willed father and daughter became known as 
"title matches." In one of the more infamous ones, Kakuei Tanaka slapped Makiko 
across the face when she announced that she wanted to study at a U.S. high 
school. Without shedding a tear, she gritted her teeth and stopped talking to 
him for six months. She won: He relented. She attended a Quaker high school in 
Philadelphia and graduated in 1963 before going on to the prestigious Waseda 
University in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say Tanaka is the Cabinet's token woman. Others say the science agency 
has no real power, although Japan's nuclear energy program has put it in the 
spotlight. But no one denies Tanaka's political calling -- least of all she. 
"Politics to me is like water to a fish, air to a bird," she told journalists 
last year. "Politics was an irresistible force surging inside of me."

MEDIA; PRICE WAR MAY EXACT TOLL ON BRITISH PAPERS; A BATTLE BEGUN BY PRESS 
BARON RUPERT MURDOCH COULD PROVE FATAL FOR ONE OR MORE NATIONAL JOURNALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The British newspaper industry is engaged in a brutal price war that most 
observers believe will result in the death of one or more of the country's 
national newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the British "quality" papers and the racier tabloids have been trying out 
price-cutting, some of it temporary and some seemingly permanent, for the past 
year. The publishing war has boosted circulation for those papers that reduced 
newsstand prices -- while decreasing sales for those that have not matched the 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers believe that a final shakeout is imminent and that the major loser 
will be the respected Independent. Former Deputy Editor Stephen Glover said the 
circulation war could "lead to the death of the Independent and the grievous 
wounding of the Daily Telegraph." The conflict began last July, when the Sun, 
the best-selling tabloid owned by press baron Rupert Murdoch, who is now based 
in Los Angeles, slashed its cover price from 25 pence (39 cents) to 20 pence 
(31 cents). Competing tabloids responded in kind. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the Times -- Britain's Establishment paper until it was taken 
over by Murdoch 13 years ago -- shocked the industry by cutting its price by 
the equivalent of 23 cents.  
</P>
<P>
 Most observers believe that Murdoch's price-cutting strategy has several 
objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is to deal a possibly fatal blow to the respected but financially 
ailing Independent, thereby picking up circulation and advertising for the 
Times; second, to cut into the 1-million circulation of the competing Daily 
Telegraph, traditionally the highest-selling "quality" daily; and third, to 
have the Sun mop up its lowbrow rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Murdoch publications are thought to be losing money in the short term with 
their lower prices, but precise figures are unavailable because most British 
papers are part of larger companies that do not break out profit-and-loss 
statements for individual units. 
</P>
<P>
 The Murdoch ploy seems to have unsettled the Daily Telegraph, which has 
watched the Times' circulation soar over the half-million mark for the first 
time in its history -- more than 40% over the previous year -- as the Daily 
Telegraph dropped below 1 million daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Conrad Black, the Canadian proprietor of the Daily Telegraph, 
announced that he was cutting the price of that paper from 48 pence (74 cents) 
to 30 pence (47 cents). 
</P>
<P>
 At the announcement, the value of stock market shares of the Daily Telegraph 
dropped more than a third in two days of trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Black was further embarrassed by the revelation that his holding company had 
sold about 10% of its shares in the Daily Telegraph group at top market price 
the previous month -- triggering accusations of insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Black, however, insisted the shares were sold before the decision was made to 
lower the Daily Telegraph's price -- and this view was accepted by the watchdog 
Stock Exchange Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Daily Telegraph issued a formal apology to its employees, many of whom 
own its stock, for the massive and "unforeseen" price drop. 
</P>
<P>
 And Black declared: "Rupert is opening his arteries here. He is trying to kill 
us. He doesn't give a damn about the Independent, he's going for the market 
leader."  
</P>
<P>
 As the Daily Telegraph struggled with the price-cut decision, the Times 
quickly lowered its price even further. 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts suggest that the Times is now losing several cents on every paper 
sold. But Murdoch can absorb such loses in the expectation of eventual gains. 
</P>
<P>
 The Independent's founding editor, Andreas Whittam Smith, said: "What we are 
witnessing is a return to the industry's ugly past, dominated by proprietors 
inebriated with the power that newspaper ownership is thought to bring."

U.N. NAMES SOUTH AFRICAN JUDGE AS BALKANS WAR CRIMES PROSECUTOR; SECURITY 
COUNCIL: APPOINTMENT OF RESPECTED MAGISTRATE AFTER LONG DELAYS RAISES HOPES OF 
HUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Reviving hopes of human rights activists, the U.N. Security Council on Friday 
appointed Richard Goldstone -- the South African judge who exposed the illegal, 
anti-black campaign of his country's military intelligence officers -- as 
prosecutor for the Balkans War Crimes Tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment, by a unanimous 15-0 vote, came after more than a year of 
wrangling over a prosecutor. The tribunal is charged with trying those accused 
of "ethnic cleansing" and other war crimes in Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Delays in choosing a prosecutor slowed the work of the tribunal, headquartered 
in The Hague. But diplomats now believe that Goldstone, 55, should be ready to 
announce the first indictments this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The council vote also ushered a prominent South African into a prestigious 
international position. Until the election of Nelson Mandela as South Africa's 
first black president in late April, it was unthinkable that the council would 
name a judge from a country that was the redoubt of apartheid and an 
international pariah. 
</P>
<P>
 Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who has made 
prosecution of war criminals in the Balkans almost a personal crusade, was 
vacationing in Europe when the council voted. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a statement issued on her behalf by the U.S. mission to the United 
Nations, she hailed Goldstone as "a seasoned barrister and judge who, at great 
personal risk, insisted that the truth be known about cruel abuses committed 
under apartheid in South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 "He already has made his mark on history on one continent," she said. "By our 
decision today, Judge Goldstone will have an opportunity to shape the future on 
another continent." 
</P>
<P>
 Albright also bemoaned the long delay in naming him. "The search for a chief 
prosecutor . . . has consumed too much time and encountered too many obstacles 
-- some unreasonable, others unpredictable," she said. "The victims of 
atrocities in the former Yugoslavia have not been well-served by the resulting 
delay." 
</P>
<P>
 The council had named a prosecutor once before, selecting Venezuelan Atty. 
Gen. Ramon Escovar Salom last October. 
</P>
<P>
 But he first delayed coming to The Hague so he could continue his prosecution 
of former President Carlos Andres Perez for corruption; he then resigned in 
February to become Venezuelan interior minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection process was hampered by an agreement among council members that 
their choice be unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 This set off a steady stream of vetoes over the months: Britain vetoed an 
Egyptian-born American; several developing nations vetoed a Scot; Pakistan 
vetoed an Indian; Russia vetoed an American and a Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
 Although council members did name a deputy prosecutor, Graham T. Blewitt of 
Australia, in February, the paralysis over choosing a prosecutor made many 
human rights activists wonder about the Security Council's commitment to the 
tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambassadors reportedly settled on Goldstone at the suggestion of Judge 
Antonio Cassese of Italy, the presiding judge of the tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Africa, Goldstone's Commission of Inquiry Regarding the Prevention of 
Public Violence and Intimidation attracted worldwide attention in 1992 when it 
accused military intelligence officers of mounting a dirty-tricks campaign 
against the African National Congress, using prostitutes, drug dealers and 
murderers to lure ANC officials into criminal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 His commission also bared the details of police massacres of black 
demonstrators and of violence between Zulus and Xhosas. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstone established a reputation as an evenhanded, reassuring magistrate and 
became one of the few members of the white Establishment of South Africa to win 
the full respect of black political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the appointment of a Balkans prosecutor, there is some fear among 
human rights groups that the United States and its European allies might 
bargain away the tribunal to induce Serbia to accept a peace agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although all sides have been accused of war crimes in Bosnia and Croatia, a 
U.N. commission recently concluded that most were committed by the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 They, for example, have been accused of employing the practice of "ethnic 
cleansing," in which murder, rape and other violence have been used to clear an 
area of enemies, both military and civilian. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the Clinton Administration still regards the tribunal as a 
separate issue from any peace agreement and would oppose any lifting of 
sanctions on Serbia if it refused to cooperate with the tribunal by turning 
over those indicted by the prosecutor.

PROBE MAY HURT RISING TORY POLITICIAN; BRITAIN: NOVELIST JEFFREY ARCHER IS 
LINKED TO INSIDER TRADING. HE DENIES ALLEGATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The political fate of Jeffrey Archer, a prominent Conservative Party figure 
and best-selling novelist, was cast into uncertainty Friday when it was 
revealed that he is under investigation on allegations of insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Archer is considered a front-runner to become Tory chairman in Prime Minister 
John Major's expected Cabinet reshuffle this summer; he has been the leading 
choice of many party rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Trade and Industry Department broke with its policy of secrecy in such 
matters to confirm that Archer, among others, is the subject of an 
investigation into share-dealing in Anglia Television. 
</P>
<P>
 The multimillionaire author and politician has strongly denied any wrongdoing, 
and political observers speculated that the leak about the inquiry was intended 
to deny Archer the party chairman post he desires. 
</P>
<P>
 His friend Lord Parkinson, a former Conservative Party chairman and Cabinet 
member, declared Friday: "It would be very difficult to promote him into a job 
with this hanging over him. Certainly the timing could not have been worse from 
Jeffrey's point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 Archer, a 54-year-old former member of Parliament, is one of the few leading 
Conservatives close to both Major and former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. 
He combines book-signing appearances around Britain with plugs for Conservative 
Party candidates. His last book, "Honor Among Thieves," was an international 
bestseller. His current work, "Twelve Red Herrings," has just hit the 
booksellers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows what a terrific job he has done running around the country 
raising masses of money for the Conservative Party," said Parkinson, "and 
everyone will be hoping this will just go away and prove to be entirely without 
basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Trade and Industry Department inspectors are scrutinizing the January share 
purchases in Anglia Television, which occurred about the time the company 
agreed to a takeover bid by MAI, a television combine. Archer's wife, Dr. Mary 
Archer, was then a member of the board of directors of Anglia Television and 
had been since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Anglia Television accepted a $438-million takeover bid from MAI on Jan. 18. 
Its shares jumped 180 pence ($2.70) to 664 pence ($9.96) and MAI shares gained 
10%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is completely untrue," Archer said, denying he had done anything illegal. 
"I did not buy any shares." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Evening Standard reported Friday that Archer's wife had held shares in 
Anglia Television in her name and in a "nominee" account. The newspaper said 
investigators were scrutinizing an Anglia stock transaction this year with a 
$75,000 profit in which the Archers may have been involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trade and Industry Department defended its decision to make public the 
existence of the Archer inquiry, saying the information had already been leaked 
by television companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Heseltine, the department's Cabinet minister, said he is waiting to 
receive a report from independent investigators before deciding if further 
action is warranted. Observers said he could, for example, launch a criminal 
prosecution under laws prohibiting insider trading.

TENSION RISES IN CAMBODIA OVER COUP PLOT; ASIA: THE GOVERNMENT CLOSES A 
NEWSPAPER THAT SUGGESTED A CABINET MEMBER WAS INVOLVED. THE CAPITAL APPEARS 
QUIET BUT ON EDGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cambodian government closed one of the nation's most popular newspapers 
Friday as tensions continued to swirl throughout the country in the aftermath 
of an unsuccessful coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Phnom Penh appeared quiet but extremely edgy, with the streets deserted at 
night and a heavy army presence designed to prevent any military movements from 
the countryside into the city, capital residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government said it foiled the coup attempt by about 200 soldiers who were 
intercepted on their way to Phnom Penh early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The coup leaders were identified as former Interior Minister Sin Song, who was 
placed under house arrest, and Prince Norodom Chakrapong, who went into exile 
in Malaysia after the intervention of his father, King Norodom Sihanouk. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Sunday, the government has also arrested Gen. Sin Sen, a senior official 
of the Interior Ministry, and Tes Thoy, chief of the Police Protective Unit, 
for taking part in the coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The plotters, who allegedly planned to appoint a new government and replace 
Sihanouk as head of state, reportedly also included a deputy defense minister 
and several army generals who were said to have taken refuge in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats in Phnom Penh said it is now clear that the coup attempt had been 
mounted by hard-line elements of Cambodia's former Communist Party, which ruled 
the country with backing from Vietnam from 1979 until U.N.-supervised elections 
in May, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Those elections were won by the royalist party headed by Prince Norodom 
Ranariddh, Sihanouk's older son, but the threat of civil war forced him into a 
fragile coalition government with the defeated Communists led by Hun Sen. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said that, while the full extent of official involvement in the 
attempted coup was still murky, the putsch appeared to have had the unintended 
effect of improving the strained relationship between Ranariddh and Hun Sen, 
who govern Cambodia as first and second prime ministers. Both men were relieved 
to see the hard-liners purged, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 The costs of the latest instability also became apparent when Singapore 
Airlines announced it was abandoning plans to form a partnership with the Phnom 
Penh government to run a new state airline in Cambodia. Singapore Airlines had 
planned to take a 40% stake in the new carrier, to be called Royal Air 
Cambodge. Other investors were reported to be putting plans for projects on 
hold, while aid donors also waited to see how the government crisis wound up 
before honoring past pledges of assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The jitters in Phnom Penh worsened Friday when the government announced that 
the Cambodian-language Morning News, one of the nation's most popular 
newspapers, had been closed. Its editor, Nguon Nun, was being questioned by 
police over an article suggesting that Interior Minister Sar Kheng had been 
involved in the coup plot. Sar Kheng, who has been described as a rising 
political star, denied he was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The government also banned officials from speaking to reporters about the 
investigation of the coup plot, in an effort to halt the rumors sweeping the 
city. Under the constitution adopted after last year's elections, Cambodia is 
supposed to have a free press. 
</P>
<P>
 The tumult has also been intensified by a vitriolic debate in Parliament, 
which culminated Wednesday in the passage of a law outlawing the Maoist 
guerrillas known as the Khmer Rouge, whose rule in the 1970s left more than 1 
million Cambodians dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban on the Khmer Rouge was proposed by Hun Sen after the collapse last 
month of peace talks, brokered by Sihanouk, between the government and the 
Khmer Rouge. The Khmer Rouge, which refused to take part in last year's 
elections, remains a potent force in Cambodia because of its military strength, 
and the ban will have no practical effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Sihanouk, who is being treated for cancer in Beijing, vehemently opposed the 
Khmer Rouge ban, so the final bill adopted left the door open to future 
negotiations with the group. The law includes a six-month amnesty during which 
group members can turn themselves in. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members of the royalist party initially opposed the ban because they 
feared the law would be used to muzzle government opponents by accusing them of 
supporting the Khmer Rouge. But they later voted for the bill, averting a major 
division in the government only days after the coup attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the ban, a number of Cambodia specialists said they expect the Khmer 
Rouge to play a waiting game to see if the instability in Phnom Penh will lead 
to so much internal strife that the government can be pushed aside with only 
minor effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The government, meanwhile, has attempted to implicate neighboring Thailand in 
the coup plot, saying that nine Thai nationals, some in Thai military uniforms, 
were arrested Sunday during the failed putsch. 
</P>
<P>
 Relations with Thailand have deteriorated sharply in recent months after 
accusations that Thai officials continue to provide shelter and support for the 
Khmer Rouge; Bangkok has become a bogyman of Cambodian propaganda. In turn, the 
Thais have tried to block proposals by the United States and Australia to 
provide military aid to the Cambodians to help fight the Khmer Rouge.

AT G-7 MEETING, RUSSIA LOOKS FOR RESPECT, NOT AID; SUMMIT: YELTSIN IS STILL THE 
ODD MAN OUT AS RICH COUNTRIES GATHER. BUT HE WILL BE AN EQUAL PARTNER IN 
POLITICAL MATTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin lands here today with a long-coveted 
invitation to the World's Most Important Countries Club, marking a new phase in 
Russia's bumpy rapprochement with the West. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, Yeltsin does not come seeking international aid. Rather, 
he aims to show the West that Russia, however troubled, is no longer a charity 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 While Yeltsin was not invited to the Group of Seven economic talks that begin 
today, he will sit as an equal partner at the table Sunday when the world's 
richest democracies discuss political problems ranging from Bosnia-Herzegovina 
to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin has attended previous G-7 meetings as a second-class visitor. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, Ukraine is the problem child. Its woes -- especially the 
$1.5 billion in proposed aid to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant -- will 
get top billing. 
</P>
<P>
 The symbolism of Yeltsin's inclusion is not trivial to Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hungry and frightening years of 1991 and 1992, Moscow had to 
swallow its pride and ask the West for food aid to survive the winter. Even 
when Yeltsin brought home pledges of $43 billion from the G-7 meeting in Tokyo 
last July, many of his countrymen felt humiliated by the spectacle of their 
fallen superpower being reduced to begging crumbs from the table of its rich 
capitalist rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the promised aid never arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russia survived without it. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been nine months since tanks rolled through the streets of Moscow to 
squelch a revolt by hard-line members of Parliament, a putsch that almost 
toppled the Yeltsin presidency. But to everyone's amazement, Russia is 
struggling back onto its feet in an atmosphere of relative economic and 
political tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation fell to 6% in June, down from a peak of 20% per month last year. 
That performance bettered even the expectations of U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen, who in February was skeptical that inflation could fall below 9% 
by the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the Russian budget deficit yawns -- but not as wide as in some other 
European countries. And even the battered Russian ruble is stabilizing. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Yeltsin, he now is on cordial terms with the leaders of the two houses 
of the new Russian Parliament. Although the public is outraged by the spectacle 
of mobsters, bankers and bureaucrats getting rich while most workers grow 
poorer, the strikes and social unrest forecast for this summer have yet to 
materialize. And despite a business climate that would drive Horatio Alger to 
despair, Russian entrepreneurs are somehow holding on. 
</P>
<P>
 Russians today are far from upbeat about their future. Many are deeply cynical 
about what they have seen so far of "democracy." Most are worn out by the 
struggle to survive amid the epic chaos of the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its myriad and thorny problems, the Russia that Yeltsin will present 
to the G-7 today is a tougher, more independent and more self-reliant nation 
that insists on being treated as an equal political partner with the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not asking for packages of cheese and sausage," said Sergei D. 
Belenkov, a Russian presidential spokesman. Instead, what Russia wants is more 
trade, more private investment and freer access to world markets that remain 
closed to its most competitive products. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin may remind the G-7 of its many unkept aid promises. But he is unlikely 
to torment his hosts, lest Russia appear as an "ungrateful beggar" or "a 
bottomless pit" into which money vanishes -- images that officials are eager to 
dispel. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its economic accomplishments, the Yeltsin government still fears that 
Russia will be treated as a feeble Third World power, humored by the West only 
because of its nuclear arsenal and its potential to bully the Baltic states and 
the rest of the former Soviet empire. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are like a grumpy great aunt," one Western diplomat said. "On the one 
hand, we don't take them seriously. But on the other hand, you can't ignore 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 As Russia dismantles its military machine, it seeks membership in Europe's key 
financial, political and security structures to maintain its international 
clout. Moscow has already joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's

FROM G-7, RUSSIA NOW LOOKS FOR RESPECT, NOT AID; SUMMIT: YELTSIN IS STILL THE 
ODD MAN OUT AS RICH COUNTRIES GATHER. BUT HE WILL BE AN EQUAL PARTNER IN 
POLITICAL MATTERS. 
</P>

 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin lands here today with a long-coveted 
invitation to the World's Most Important Countries Club, marking a new phase in 
Russia's bumpy rapprochement with the West. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, Yeltsin does not come seeking international aid. Rather, 
he aims to show the West that Russia, however troubled, is no longer a charity 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 While Yeltsin was not invited to the Group of Seven economic talks that begin 
today, he will sit as an equal partner at the table Sunday when the world's 
richest democracies discuss political problems ranging from Bosnia-Herzegovina 
to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin has attended previous G-7 meetings as a second-class visitor. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, however, Ukraine is the problem child. Its woes -- especially the 
$1.5 billion in proposed aid to close the Chernobyl nuclear power plant -- will 
get top billing. 
</P>
<P>
 The symbolism of Yeltsin's inclusion is not trivial to Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hungry and frightening years of 1991 and 1992, Moscow had to 
swallow its pride and ask the West for food aid to survive the winter. Even 
when Yeltsin brought home pledges of $43 billion from the G-7 meeting in Tokyo 
last July, many of his countrymen felt humiliated by the spectacle of their 
fallen superpower being reduced to begging crumbs from the table of its rich 
capitalist rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the promised aid never arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russia survived without it. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been nine months since tanks rolled through the streets of Moscow to 
squelch a revolt by hard-line members of Parliament, a putsch that almost 
toppled the Yeltsin presidency. But to everyone's amazement, Russia is 
struggling back onto its feet in an atmosphere of relative economic and 
political tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation fell to 6% in June, down from a peak of 20% per month last year. 
That performance bettered even the expectations of U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Lloyd Bentsen, who in February was skeptical that inflation could fall below 9% 
by the end of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment in Russia has increased to roughly 8%. But in Ireland, a European 
Union member, it is double that. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the Russian budget deficit yawns -- but not as wide as in some other 
European countries. And even the battered Russian ruble is stabilizing. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Yeltsin, he now is on cordial terms with the leaders of the two houses 
of the new Russian Parliament. Although the public is outraged by the spectacle 
of mobsters, bankers and bureaucrats getting rich while most workers grow 
poorer, the strikes and social unrest forecast for this summer have yet to 
materialize. And despite a business climate that would drive Horatio Alger to 
despair, Russian entrepreneurs are somehow holding on. 
</P>
<P>
 Russians today are far from upbeat about their future. Many are deeply cynical 
about what they have seen so far of "democracy." Most are worn out by the 
struggle to survive amid the epic chaos of the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its myriad and thorny problems, the Russia that Yeltsin will present 
to the G-7 today is a tougher, more independent and more self-reliant nation 
that insists on being treated as an equal political partner with the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not asking for packages of cheese and sausage," said Sergei D. 
Belenkov, a Russian presidential spokesman. Instead, what Russia wants is more 
trade, more private investment and freer access to world markets that remain 
closed to its most competitive products. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin may remind the G-7 of its many unkept aid promises. But he is unlikely 
to torment his hosts, lest Russia appear as an "ungrateful beggar" or "a 
bottomless pit" into which money vanishes -- images that officials are eager to 
dispel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not believe in the West's ability to help us anymore," the Red Star 
newspaper said Friday. "It is more important for us to have fair access to 
world markets." 
</P>
<P>
 Russia may be able to win access to up to $4 billion in new International 
Monetary Fund loans this year, officials said. It would also like to 
restructure its $80-billion foreign debt and push for more loan guarantees and 
insurance to lure jittery foreign investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its economic accomplishments, the Yeltsin government still fears that 
Russia will be treated as a feeble Third World power, humored by the West only 
because of its nuclear arsenal and its potential to bully the Baltic states and 
the rest of the former Soviet empire. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are like a grumpy great aunt," one Western diplomat said. "On the one 
hand, we don't take them seriously. But on the other hand, you can't ignore 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 As Russia dismantles its military machine, it seeks membership in Europe's key 
financial, political and security structures to maintain its international 
clout. Moscow has already joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's 
"Partnership for Peace" program and is courting the General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (OECD) and the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow also dreams of making this session of leading world economies not the 
G-7 but the G-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Yeltsin acknowledged that Russia cannot be considered an equal 
economic player with the United States, Japan, Canada, Germany, France, Italy 
and Britain. But he noted with pride that a political G-8 is already a reality. 
Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev suggested Friday that perhaps next year both 
the economic and the political discussions will be conducted by a G-8.

U.S., N. KOREA CALL NEGOTIATIONS OVER NUCLEAR STANDOFF PRODUCTIVE; ASIA: BUT 
DEATH OF PYONGYANG'S LEADER CASTS SHADOW OVER FIRST FORMAL TALKS IN MORE THAN A 
YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The United States and North Korea opened negotiations Friday aimed at settling 
the dispute over Pyongyang's nuclear program, with both sides calling the first 
day's talks productive. 
</P>
<P>
 That the two sides returned to the bargaining table is itself a milestone of 
sorts. These are the first formal negotiations between the United States and 
North Korea in more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But only 20 hours after the talks began, the death of North Korean President 
Kim Il Sung was reported, and Pyongyang suspended the talks, at least 
temporarily, the North Korean mission announced today. 
</P>
<P>
 A mission spokesman said he did not know when the talks would resume. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the U.S. delegation said early today, "It's not clear whether the 
postponement will be just for a few days of mourning or for a longer period." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Bermudez, a close observer of the Kim regime and an author of books on the 
North Korean military, said in an interview in Washington that he thinks the 
president's death will not derail the Geneva talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The objectives of North Korean foreign policy probably will not change in the 
short term," Bermudez said. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year, North Korea has repeatedly delayed or defied efforts by 
the International Atomic Energy Agency to carry out thorough inspections of its 
nuclear facilities at Yongbyon; the United States, in turn, has talked of 
organizing international sanctions against Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Friday morning, the chief U.S. delegate, Robert L. Gallucci, who is 
assistant secretary of state, and a team of American officials drove into North 
Korea's mission to the United Nations here to shake hands with North Korea's 
Kang and several aides. The two teams then sat down for seven hours of talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my view, there is a great probability that in the days ahead, we can try 
to get together on ways to narrow down our differences on the nuclear issue," 
Kang had told reporters at the end of the day. "Both sides want to resolve the 
nuclear issue through dialogue and by peaceful means." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the reports of Kim's death, U.S. officials had cautioned that they do 
not expect any concrete results, good or bad, from the talks for about a week. 
But Gallucci too Friday night described the beginning of the negotiations as 
productive and "useful." 
</P>
<P>
 Stopping Pyongyang's nuclear program is now such a high priority for the 
United States and its allies that North Korea was the first item on the agenda 
when President Clinton met Friday with Japan's new Prime Minister Tomiichi 
Murayama in Naples, Italy, site of the economic summit of the world's leading 
industrialized nations. 
</P>
<P>
 After their meeting, Murayama -- who later fell ill and was briefly 
hospitalized for diarrhea, dehydration and fatigue -- praised "the tenacious 
efforts of the United States" in dealing with North Korea; Clinton said he was 
pleased with Murayama's assurances of the "continuity of Japanese foreign 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has offered to move toward gradual diplomatic 
recognition of North Korea and to arrange help for its economy, if Pyongyang 
will halt and eventually abandon its nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is particularly eager to work out some solution for the 
disposal of fuel, recently removed from the reactor at Yongbyon. The fuel could 
be reprocessed into enough weapons-grade plutonium to make five or six nuclear 
weapons by the end of this year. The CIA believes North Korea already has 
enough material for one or two nuclear bombs. "Clearly, the nuclear issue is 
the central issue (in the talks)," Gallucci said Friday night. "I think 
everybody understands that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kang said that, in the first day's discussions, "both sides have identified 
that there is much in common. At the same time . . . there are also many points 
on which the two sides differ very much." 
</P>
<P>
 In the days leading up to the talks, American officials have sketched out a 
scenario under which the United States and North Korea might agree to take 
small, gradual steps, so each side would gain confidence in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the United States might agree to higher-level diplomatic contacts 
with North Korea or to opening of liaison offices in Washington and Pyongyang, 
if North Korea continues its freeze on its nuclear program and begins to take 
steps to dismantle it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will move with them," explained a senior U.S. official this week. He said 
the American team was envisioning an approach in which the United States and 
North Korea might make agreed-on concessions at the same time, to avoid endless 
arguments over who should act first. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one on the American side knows yet whether these ideas are acceptable 
to the North Koreans -- indeed, whether they are prepared to make any 
concessions at all on their nuclear program, beyond the current round of talks. 
</P>
<P>
 If the talks fail, Administration officials say they will revive now-suspended 
efforts to obtain a formal United Nations resolution for economic sanctions 
against North Korea. And there were hints Friday that the United States is 
still planning for sanctions by shoring up the support of allies. 
</P>
<P>
 After Clinton met with Murayama in Naples, a senior Administration official 
said the Japanese prime minister "made clear that they would support whatever 
action was required at the United Nations or in New York." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Paul Richter in Naples contributed to this report.

 Kidnapers released an Associated Press correspondent 20 days after seizing her 
from a car in the Somali capital, Mogadishu.Tina Susman, 35, was in good 
health. News of the June 18 kidnaping had been withheld by news organizations 
to facilitate attempts to secure her release. Her abductors initially demanded 
$300,000, then lower amounts, but AP said no ransom was paid. Susman's captors 
allowed her to receive food, books and bottled water, and to send and receive 
written messages.

 U.N. officials struggled to broker a cease-fire in Rwanda to clear the way for 
relief aid to reach about 1.7 million Rwandans in the west fleeing rebel 
advances. With 900,000 refugees pouring into a safe area guarded by French 
troops, France urgently appealed for help in caring for the displaced. 
Shaharyar Khan, U.N. special envoy to Rwanda, said two days of talks between 
the rebels and the self-declared interim government had been useful. U.N. 
sources said they expect a cease-fire soon, but the rebels insist on a 
commitment that those deemed guilty of massacres be brought to justice.

 The Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas, claimed responsibility for 
killing an Israeli soldier whose body was found near Jerusalem Thursday. The 
group, which opposes the peace deal between Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization, said it would continue attacks against Israelis unless the 
government released all Palestinian prisoners. The deaths of the soldier and a 
17-year-old female Jewish settler killed near Hebron unleashed hours of unrest 
as settlers blocked roads, burned tires and stoned Arab homes.

Germany. Rather than face more noisy human rights protests, Li opted out of an 
afternoon boat trip and farm visit outside Munich after meeting with business

for Romania, ending a visit that successfully drummed up business but created a

SHUTTLE SOARS ALOFT WITH AQUATIC ANIMALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The space shuttle Columbia roared through clouds into orbit Friday, beginning 
a scheduled two-week mission to study the development of aquatic animals and 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA officials fretted throughout the morning that storms might interfere with 
liftoff.But the weather cooperated and the shuttle blasted off at 9:43 a.m. 
PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first shuttle launch since April and the fourth this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A puff of some material briefly appeared near the right solid-rocket booster 
about a minute into the flight as Columbia streaked over the Atlantic Ocean. 
Shuttle manager Loren Shriver said it probably was condensation created by 
shock waves, but he asked flight controllers to check their data as a 
precaution. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight controllers at the Johnson Space Center in Houston also had to cope 
with a computer problem in the final minutes of the countdown. Some of their 
monitors were off by nearly a second, but they worked around the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Once settled in a 184-mile-high orbit, the seven astronauts began powering up 
the bus-sized laboratory in the shuttle cargo bay. The crew includes Dr. Chiaki 
Mukai, the first Japanese woman in space. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia is carrying a variety of Japanese fish, newts and sea urchins as well 
as toad eggs. There also are flies, slime mold, mouse bones, roots, cress and 
lentil seedlings, day lily cells, yeast cells, and human and mouse white blood 
cells. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 80 experiments are planned, with more than 200 scientists from 
around the world participating. Shriver called the mission "a stepping stone 
into the space station program." 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia is scheduled to return to the space center on July 22.

CLINTON'S AIDS POLICY CHIEF QUITS, CITING FRUSTRATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kristine M. Gebbie resigned Friday as the federal government's first AIDS 
policy coordinator, cutting short a term that began amid high public hopes and 
ended in general disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've given it a good try," she said in an interview. "But, in some people's 
minds it was a doomed job -- and they never gave me a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton accepted the resignation by saying that Gebbie had served 
"ably and with dedication." Her departure reopens a search that dogged the 
early months of the Clinton presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration sources described her departure as a "mutual decision" between 
Gebbie and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a really hard time and it was weird because she's articulate and a 
good communicator. But somehow she was not able to communicate the real 
improvements we were making against AIDS," said one Administration source, who 
declined to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in his presidency, Clinton fulfilled a campaign promise by creating the 
post of AIDS coordinator. The purpose was to bring new cooperation and an 
overall strategy to the activities of the many federal agencies that deal with 
aspects of the AIDS crisis -- from the federal Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention to the Public Health Service and the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Filling the job, however, proved to be difficult. Gebbie was not appointed 
until six months into Clinton's term after numerous people had turned down the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection created high expectations among many involved in the battle 
against AIDS, particularly because of her previous experience dealing with the 
disease. But she never seemed to get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just ran out of any political support or goodwill," said one AIDS 
activist who requested anonymity. "She had no support in the (AIDS) community 
and no support in the federal agencies. She did not consult and she did not 
bring people in in a collaborative way in decision-making. In the community, 
she just never hit it off with people." 
</P>
<P>
 Gebbie was widely criticized in April for releasing an AIDS "action" agenda 
that numerous AIDS organizations labeled as woefully lacking in action, 
although she described it then only as a beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many -- including Gebbie -- believe the problems she suffered in the 
job were not entirely her fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a position the President promised, and he fulfilled that promise, 
but the job was not well structured or well conceived or well staffed," said 
Dan Bross, executive director of the Washington-based AIDS Action Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Gebbie said in an interview Friday that "nobody had defined" the mission of 
her new post. That lack of definition created "some enormous and conflicting 
expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 "But now it's time for this one to end," she continued. "I've learned some 
things about what did and didn't work. Part of the problem was the persistent 
use of the label czar (as some referred to the job), which carries implications 
that weren't there. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last little bit, they (the critics) never grasped what this job was -- 
or wasn't. The turnover will let that definition, or redefinition, happen. It's 
a good time for me to make a change, and to make a change in this job too." 
</P>
<P>
 A registered nurse and epidemiologist who once taught at UCLA, Gebbie was a 
highly regarded member of the AIDS commission established by former President 
Ronald Reagan, and many believe that she was responsible for countering the 
extreme views of many of its conservative members. She also served as chief 
health officer for the states of Oregon and Washington, and as head of the AIDS 
task force for the American Assn. of State and Territorial Health Officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of AIDS Project Los Angeles, one of the largest AIDS service 
agencies in the nation, shed no tears at Gebbie's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good thing," said Phill Wilson, the project's director of 
public policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he hopes that her successor will have more diverse, AIDS-oriented 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need someone who has some sort of vision around these issues," Wilson 
said.

WIND SURPRISED WILDFIRE CREW, OFFICIAL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone knew that a shift in the wind was coming, but no one expected it to 
transform a modest brush fire on Storm King Mountain into a deadly inferno, a 
state official said Friday as the death toll in the blaze climbed to 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were in a situation where they were making the decisions. They were 
aware of the risks," said Bob Moore, state director for the U.S. Bureau of Land 
Management. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire was handled routinely. . . . It was a small fire, an ordinary fire, 
and we had limited resources," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last two bodies were found about a quarter of a mile north of where the 
others were found, Garfield County Undersheriff Levy Burris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were running along the ridges and apparently got caught up with nowhere 
to go in a ravine," Burris said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the bodies would be taken to a local mortuary for an autopsy before 
being returned to their families. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Interior Department officials said a federal review board will 
"establish the facts and sequence of events" that caused the firefighters to 
become trapped Wednesday and "identify ways to prevent a recurrence." 
</P>
<P>
 The board is to submit a report to the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. 
Forest Service within 45 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Wind that pushed the fire quickly through steep and rugged terrain had been 
forecast about 24 hours earlier by the National Weather Service. But Eric 
Hipke, a smoke jumper with 52 other firefighters who were clearing a fire line 
on the mountain, said no one expected 50 m.p.h. winds that sent bands of fire 
ripping through the dried-out juniper and pinion at 100 feet per minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Hipke said "the whole canyon just blew up. I've never seen anything like that 
in my life. It just kept chasing us back." 
</P>
<P>
 Hipke, who was burned on his arms and legs, said from his hospital bed that 
the ravine the group was using as an escape route dead-ended and they were 
trapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoke jumpers traditionally parachute in to fight fires. Among the 
firefighters on Storm King Mountain, some had parachuted in, while others hiked 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must find answers to what caused this terrible tragedy," Interior 
Secretary Bruce Babbitt said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 As officials started to analyze the disaster, people whose lives were touched 
by it spoke out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just see it as somebody made a big mistake by sending them in there," said 
Nadine Mackey, the mother of Don Mackey, of Hamilton, Mont., who died in the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Roth said he recalled discussing the danger of sudden high winds with 
his son, Roger Roth, one of the elite smoke jumpers who was among those killed. 
"He's had experience with them before, he knew what to watch for. But somehow 
or other the terrain was so steep they didn't have a chance to run out before 
it came up the valley," Roth said.

BRANCH DAVIDIAN WHO TESTIFIED AGAINST CULT IS SENTENCED TO 3 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The lone Branch Davidian to strike a plea bargain in the shooting deaths of 
four federal agents was sentenced Friday to three years in prison on a reduced 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Schroeder's testimony was a key in convicting eight of her fellow cult 
members, a prosecutor said.She was the last member of David Koresh's cult to be 
sentenced in a gun battle that erupted during a raid on Feb. 28, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the four agents, six Branch Davidians died. Schroeder's husband 
was among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to say I know a lot of people have suffered. I really am sorry for 
that. I don't think it should ever have happened," Schroeder told U.S. District 
Judge Walter S. Smith before sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith sentenced Schroeder, 31, to three years in prison, three years of 
probation and fined her $5,000. The charge against Schroeder -- resisting 
arrest -- was reduced from first-degree murder. She could have been sentenced 
to a maximum of 10 years in prison on the resisting arrest charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder testified about the cult's plan to wage a holy war with authorities, 
detailed where cult members stood armed during the standoff and described their 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the best inside story that we could provide the jury," Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Bill Johnston said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shootout, Schroeder handed out weapons and ammunition. She left the 
sect's compound just outside Waco on March 12 to be with her children, who had 
been released to authorities earlier in the 51-day standoff that followed the 
botched raid. 
</P>
<P>
 The impasse ended April 19, 1993, when a fire destroyed the cult's compound. 
Koresh and about 80 followers died during the blaze, which prosecutors said was 
set by the sect as federal officials tried to tear holes in the compound.

PERIL SEEN IN REFORM LIMITED TO INSURANCE; HEALTH CARE: ANALYSTS WARN THAT 
CONGRESS WOULD BE SHORTSIGHTED TO FOCUS ONLY ON COVERAGE DISCRIMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It sounds so simple: Ban insurers from jacking up rates on sick people and 
force them to accept all applicants, offering the same rates regardless of age 
or health status. 
</P>
<P>
 No single health reform proposal enjoys broader support among the public or 
members of Congress. And no wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending discriminatory insurance practices would instantly allay deep-seated 
fears of middle-class Americans that they might lose coverage when they change 
jobs or be priced out of the market when they become seriously ill. In poll 
after poll, 60% to 80% or more of respondents favor such reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a big hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless accompanied by a requirement that everyone be insured, insurance 
reforms would mean higher premiums for the insured and actually increase the 
ranks of the uninsured. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because such reforms would enable the sick and the vulnerable to buy 
insurance, often for the first time. Their high health costs would force 
insurers to increase premiums across the board. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the young and the healthy -- confronted by rising rates -- might 
drop coverage, secure in the knowledge that they could buy insurance when they 
needed it. That in turn would increase premiums for everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus would begin a vicious cycle that, experts say, would hasten the 
deterioration of the nation's health care financing system. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect is growing that Congress will abandon comprehensive health care 
reform this year and instead do little more than try to remedy the apparent 
shortcomings of today's insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
 That approach could do more harm than good. Dire warnings of the unintended 
consequences of insurance reform are being sounded by such disparate analysts 
and advocates as conservative hospital lobbyist Michael Bromberg and First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, architect of President Clinton's agenda for change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurance reforms will solve many of the problems that the insured, voting 
middle class is worried about. But it won't control costs or insure the 
uninsured -- the two biggest challenges we face," said Drew Altman, president 
of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care philanthropy based in Menlo 
Park, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "You buy some time, but costs will continue to escalate," added Edward F. 
Howard, executive vice president of the Alliance for Health Reform, a 
nonpartisan educational group here. "So you lay the groundwork for a bigger 
explosion in a few years." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as Congress prepares to begin floor debate on health reform, the appeal 
of insurance reforms may prove all but irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost every health reform bill introduced in recent years contains such 
measures -- including all four bills reported out recently by two committees in 
each chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance reforms "solve real problems for real people. And it can happen 
without turning the system on its head," said Gail Wilensky, a health expert in 
former President George Bush's White House who now advises congressional 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilensky, former head of the Health Care Financing Administration, said that 
"it's important for Congress to say to the American people: 'We can do 
something, and here's one piece, signed, sealed and delivered.' "  
</P>
<P>
 She and other advocates of incrementalism acknowledge that insurance reforms 
alone will do little for the estimated 38 million uninsured Americans. But they 
say that such measures are a good and realistic beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents argue that insurance reforms alone are doomed to fail unless they 
are accompanied by a requirement leading to universal coverage, such as 
Clinton's controversial proposal to require all employers to pay at least 80% 
of workers' insurance premiums, with individuals picking up the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance reforms alone "just won't work," said Marvin B. Hall, president of 
the Hawaii Medical Service Assn., the largest insurance company in that state. 
"You'd push costs even higher." 
</P>
<P>
 "Insurance reforms by themselves will increase premiums substantially because 
you'd be allowing back into the group people who have been excluded primarily 
because of costs," said John Rother, legislative director of the American Assn. 
of Retired Persons. "And you haven't done anything at all about the cost of 
health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the winners of insurance market reforms, at least in the short term, 
would be small businesses. Most such reforms being contemplated by Congress 
would give them a choice of health plans by pooling them into large, voluntary 
purchasing groups, thus affording them lower rates enjoyed by large groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest losers would be younger people, whose rates would rise sharply. 
"You'll see a bunch that's going to drop out," said Richard I. Smith, an 
analyst at the Assn. of Private Pension and Welfare Plans. "And what problems 
are we solving if we end up just producing more uninsured?" 
</P>
<P>
 Willis D. Gradison Jr., head of the Health Insurance Assn. of America, agreed, 
saying that insurance reforms "could easily have just the opposite effect of 
what is intended." He cited the experience of New York state as a prime 
example. 
</P>
<P>
 There, a law took effect in April of 1993 that barred insurers from setting 
premiums based on age, sex or health status and required them to guarantee 
coverage to all. 
</P>
<P>
 After just nine months, 40% of policyholders at Mutual of Omaha, the largest 
underwriter of individual policies in New York, saw their premiums drop, 
according to Medicine & Health, a weekly newsletter. But 60% experienced 
increases of as much as 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the number of uninsured grew by more than 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to pave the way for national insurance market reforms as a first step 
toward broader reforms, Reps. J. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.) and Michael Bilirakis 
(R-Fla.) have introduced just such a bill, saying that it is "designed to 
re-establish the health reform debate on a foundation of agreement rather than 
one of divisiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 "Some members have made clear that that's as far as they are willing to go," 
said Martin Corry, AARP's director of federal affairs. "But we think that's 
pretty shortsighted." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilensky, the Republican consultant, worries that insurance reforms could sap 
the will of Congress to press on with more comprehensive reforms, such as 
expanding coverage to the uninsured.

PETITIONS SUBMITTED FOR OREGON GAY RIGHTS BAN; ELECTIONS: BACKERS HOPE TO 
QUALIFY THE INITIATIVE ON THE NOVEMBER BALLOT. MEANWHILE, SIMILAR DRIVES IN 
WASHINGTON STATE AND MISSOURI FAIL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oregon group that is seeking a ban on gay rights legislation submitted 
signatures Friday in hopes of getting its proposal on the November ballot. 
Groups with similar goals came up short in Washington state and Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 They are among several states where petition drives by gay rights opponents 
have been under way this year. In Arizona on Thursday, a group sponsoring such 
a drive said it had dropped the petition campaign and instead would concentrate 
on challenging existing gay rights ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
 In Michigan, backers face a Monday deadline of submitting enough signatures to 
force a statewide vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregon Citizens Alliance turned in what it said were 120,000 signatures to 
put its new anti-gay rights initiative on the statewide ballot. The measure 
will qualify for the November ballot if the secretary of state determines that 
at least 89,000 of the signatures are valid. 
</P>
<P>
 Alliance Chairman Lon Mabon said he was confident that the measure would pass 
because the language is less strident than the wording of a similar measure 
defeated by voters in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In Missouri, Paul Summers, president of the Amendment Coalition, said his 
group did not get enough signatures by Friday's deadline for a ballot proposal 
to prevent the state and local governments from enacting laws and ordinances 
providing special protection to homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington state, sponsors blamed their failure on gay rights activists who 
stumped the state urging voters not to sign the petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The group said it collected more than 180,000 signatures, but officials 
recommend submitting at least 210,000 to ensure that the requirement of 181,667 
valid signatures is met.

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; WITH 'DRESS REHEARSAL' OVER, CAST PREPARES FOR THE TRIAL; 
COURTS: DEFENSE LAWYERS ARE LIKELY TO FILE A FLURRY OF MOTIONS. DNA TESTING, 
SEARCH WARRANT ARE KEY ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell's ruling Friday afternoon ordering O.J. 
Simpson to stand trial on murder charges, the legal equivalent of a dress 
rehearsal has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the six-day preliminary hearing, Simpson's trial will feature a 
larger cast of witnesses, a more in-depth script, and perhaps a significant 
additional act -- a full-scale defense presented by Simpson's lawyers that may 
include an appearance on the witness stand by the football legend himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "All this hearing was was an exploration of the strengths and weaknesses of 
the prosecution's case," said Los Angeles criminal defense lawyer Barry Tarlow. 
"The trial will be a struggle to find out the truth where both sides will be 
presenting evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Well before before the start of the trial, which Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti said 
Friday could begin in mid-September, a flurry of legal motions and issues will 
be debated before an as-yet unchosen Superior Court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the key issues are whether DNA samples gathered by the prosecution are 
admissible at trial and whether evidence of past spousal abuse can be 
introduced. Defense lawyers will also, in all likelihood, file a motion asking 
the new judge to overrule Kennedy-Powell and dismiss the charges for lack of 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional defense motions probably will include a new attempt to throw out 
evidence obtained in a search of Simpson's Brentwood estate in the hours after 
the bodies of his ex-wife and her friend were discovered outside her nearby 
condo. 
</P>
<P>
 For prosecutors, the looming question is whether to seek the death penalty 
against the celebrity, who is charged with the premeditated slashing deaths of 
Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman on the night of June 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The formal pretrial process begins July 22, with Simpson's arraignment in Los 
Angeles Superior Court, at which time he will again be asked: "How do you 
plead?" 
</P>
<P>
 By then, it is unlikely that the district attorney's office will have resolved 
whether to seek the death penalty or life without parole -- the only two 
alternatives if it sticks with the "special circumstance" theory of multiple 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Such decisions are made by a committee of senior district attorney officials, 
who hear arguments by the prosecutors and informal pleas from the defense. The 
panel seeks consistency, considering decisions in past cases. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior prosecutor, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, 
said he doubts that his office would seek the death penalty against Simpson 
because the crimes of which he is accused could have been the result of 
passion, were rooted in a specific circumstance and are unlikely to happen 
again. But other lawyers said one has only to look back to the Menendez murders 
for a similar case in which death is being sought. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 90% of the felony cases that reach Superior Court are concluded with 
a plea bargain, one is unlikely in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who maintains his innocence, has little to gain. If the special 
circumstances were eliminated and he were allowed to plead to either first- or 
second-degree murder, he would still face the prospects of imprisonment until 
old age. It is unlikely that prosecutors would be willing to reduce the charges 
to voluntary manslaughter, which could lead to a relatively minor penalty of 11 
years imprisonment for each slaying. "There is no area, it seems, with an 
overlap," Los Angeles defense attorney Harland W. Braun said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Simpson's attorneys, even broaching the subject of a guilty plea might 
prove daunting because of fears that news of any such negotiations might leak 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that a plea bargain is unlikely, here is what is likely to happen in 
coming weeks as attorneys start preparing for trial. They are expected to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Relitigate the fairness of decisions made by the judge in the preliminary 
hearing. Defense attorneys customarily file motions based on Penal Code Section 
995 asking Superior Court judges to second-guess their lower court colleagues 
based solely on a review of the case's written record. Such motions rarely go 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense in this case is also expected to challenge again the initial, 
warrantless search of the Simpson property, but will probably be barred from 
introducing any new evidence on this subject. It can introduce evidenceto 
challenge a search warrant that police later obtained. 
</P>
<P>
 * Squabble over the admissibility of DNA tests on blood from the crime scene 
that have not yet been completed. California appellate courts have made 
conflicting rulings on the crucial question of how far scientists can go in 
testifying about the ability of DNA tests to serve as genetic fingerprints and 
identify specific individuals. The question, said Southwestern University 
School of Law professor Myrna S. Raeder, is: "Is there an appropriate 
statistical basis, based on genetics, that permits an expert to come up with a 
number -- whether it be one in 10,000 or one in a million -- that has 
scientific validity." The California Supreme Court has not weighed in to settle 
the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The point will be moot, of course, if the prosecution's DNA tests eliminate 
Simpson as the source of the blood. 
</P>
<P>
 * Debate whether Simpson's past conduct can be admitted as evidence before a 
jury. In 1989, Simpson pleaded no contest to misdemeanor spousal battery of 
Nicole. And in the weeks before Simpson's preliminary hearing, authorities 
released tape recordings of Nicole's anguished calls to 911. Legal experts said 
it is unlikely that a judge would allow introduction of such explosive 
evidence. In deciding, a judge would have to balance the information's value to 
prosecutors as proof of the crime in question against its prejudicial impact on 
the defense. In general, past conduct is not considered proof of a currently 
charged crime. 
</P>
<P>
 An exception could come if Simpson takes the witness stand at his trial and 
says, for example, that he had a peaceful marriage. Then prosecutors might be 
able to use some of his past actions to challenge his veracity. 
</P>
<P>
 * Select the jury and possibly help choose the judge. A judge will probably be 
assigned soon by the presiding judge of the Superior Court. In some 
high-publicity cases in the past, the presiding judge has consulted with 
lawyers for both sides to avoid the spectacle of them later blackballing a 
judge. Each side can disqualify one judge without having to give a reason. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury selection in this case could take longer than the trial itself 
because massive publicity could make it more difficult to find people who 
declare, believably, that they can be impartial. Selection will be even more 
complex if the prosecution seeks the death penalty. A major issue for attorneys 
on both sides will be whether the judge allows them to question prospective 
jurors or exercises that prerogative alone, from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional delay could result if Simpson changes his defense team. His lead 
attorney, Robert L. Shapiro, is a criminal law specialist but has never tried a 
death penalty case. 
</P>
<P>
 In the preliminary hearing only a handful of witnesses were used, and as is 
typical, the defense presented no case. Defense lawyers rarely want to subject 
their witnesses to cross-examination and tip their hands to prosecutors about 
their theory of the case. The trial will likely feature many additional 
witnesses, including many more scientists. Criminalist testimony at the 
preliminary hearing dealt with only one of many blood spots. At trial, the 
defense is likely to have experts of its own to question the validity of 
scientific evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense at trial is never required to put up a separate model of what 
took place," Raeder said. "All the defense has to do to gain an acquittal is to 
raise a reasonable doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 How quickly it gets its chance is largely in its own hands. A defendant is 
entitled to a trial 60 days after arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 But only rarely is that right exercised. "Sometimes it is to the defense's 
benefit to go to trial immediately . . . if they have an airtight alibi," said 
Los Angeles attorney Gerald L. Chaleff. "In the sense that they have a picture 
of you standing next to the Pope. And the Pope's going to come in and testify."

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; CLOSING ARGUMENTS BY DEFENSE, PROSECUTION AT MURDER 
HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The following are excerpts from the closing arguments of O.J. Simpson's 
principal attorney, Robert L. Shapiro:  
</P>
<P>
 Your honor, I would ask the court to consider the jury instruction that would 
be given in a case like this regarding circumstantial evidence, and that is if 
the evidence presented relies solely on circumstantial evidence, there can be 
no conviction unless the circumstances point to guilt and are not reconcilable 
with any other reasonable theory. 
</P>
<P>
 If, on the other hand, the circumstances may point to guilt or innocence, the 
jury or finder of fact must adopt that theory which points to innocence and 
reject that which points to guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Now clearly this not a trial, and clearly this burden is not the same. But the 
legal principle remains. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a case based entirely on circumstantial evidence. And it is clear from 
the presentation of the people and through our cross-examination that the 
circumstances can point both toward a suspicion of guilt and also toward a 
theory of innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 The key piece of evidence that the people are relying on is the serology of a 
99% chance that four blooddrops found at the Bundy crime scene were of the same 
type and chemical composition as that of Mr. O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 The converse is this: If you take the Coliseum on any given Sunday, 40,000 
(to) 80,000 people will have that same blood type. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2, there was testimony elicited from the people's witness that Mr. Simpson 
has joint custody of these children with his ex-wife, the decedent, Nicole. 
</P>
<P>
 That being the case, it is reasonable to assume that he would visit the 
children or pick them up at her condominium on a regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the criminalist cannot fix the age of the blood spots, there is an 
equally reasonable theory that those blood spots, if in fact they belonged to 
Mr. Simpson, were placed there at some other time than the time of death. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in fact, the criminalist testified that by viewing the photographs, the 
blood appeared to be of different ages. However, he blamed that on poor 
photography. 
</P>
<P>
 But on cross-examination, he admitted that proper crime scene photography 
requires using the same type of equipment with the same lighting conditions 
from the same angle. 
</P>
<P>
 Point No. 2 that the prosecution relies on: There is a matching glove found . 
. . behind the Simpson residence that matches a glove found at the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Another conclusion -- well, let's go by the testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked (Detective Philip L.) Vannatter: "How did that glove get there?" He 
said: "Someone brought it there." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's look at the other circumstantial evidence involved. If, in fact, the 
killer lived at the Simpson residence, the court would have to believe the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
 That in a window period of less than an hour, the killer was able to leave the 
crime scene (where there was) . . . a victim with two arteries in the neck cut, 
two jugular veins cut, and massive blood from both victims. 
</P>
<P>
 A clear inference would be that the murderer was indeed covered with blood. 
The murderer would then have to do the following: 
</P>
<P>
 Abandon the bloody clothing, because they have not been found or presented; 
abandon bloody shoes, because they have not been found or discovered, and then 
go back to his house and leave a bloody glove in his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 That just doesn't hold up to logic. 
</P>
<P>
 We have no evidence whatsoever in this record that whoever committed this 
horrendous act acted with premeditation and deliberation, as is charged in the 
complaint filed by the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a case that the police admit is still under investigation, where other 
suspects are being sought, where the medical examiner admits that two weapons 
could have been used, a clear inference that there may be more than one killer. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't want to go through each and every area of impeachment with the 
witnesses, but I think it is very, very clear that everybody who has 
participated in this investigation has not done so in a professional manner. 
From the time the Los Angeles Police Department arrived on the crime scene, it 
was nearly 10 hours later until they started the scientific investigation and 
even took the temperature of the body. 
</P>
<P>
 There was testimony that the Fire Department obviously was there and left and 
didn't do anything, yet the coroner's records clearly indicate that the Fire 
Department chief was the person who pronounced the bodies dead. I doubt if he 
did that from a distance. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a case that everybody has jumped to an immediate and unrealistic 
conclusion as to the state of this evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . This is a case where the chief serologist said: "We used serology as 
much to eliminate as to implicate," and yet we have no DNA testing back. This 
is a case that is needless and groundless. 
</P>
<P>
 The court on viewing all of the evidence . . . should have little difficulty 
in deciding that this certainly is not a case of premeditated murder by anyone 
for there is totally no evidence on that issue whatsoever; and No. 2, that 
there is not and cannot be at this point in time a strong suspicion that Mr. 
Simpson is guilty of anything.

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; CLOSING ARGUMENTS BY DEFENSE, PROSECUTION AT MURDER 
HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The following are excerpts from the closing arguments of Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Marcia Clark, the lead prosecutor in the case.  
</P>
<P>
 In order to find in this case . . . that there is no strong suspicion to 
believe the defendant has committed the crimes . . . you would have to ignore 
all of the evidence. And the evidence is consistent and very powerful . . . 
(Indications are that) the defendant has indeed committed every crime that he 
is charged with. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I will address the issue of the sufficiency of the evidence to prove 
premeditation . . . (But) I will leave that for now . . . because I do think 
the evidence is clearly sufficient to show that these crimes were premeditated. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 First of all, the killer in this case was clearly injured during the 
commission of these murders. He left a trail of blood leading away from the 
victims to the rear of the residence and out to the alley. A trail of blood was 
found from the defendant's Ford Bronco leading up the driveway to his front 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 And I would remind the court that the distance between the two locations is a 
mere two miles . . . (There was) not enough time for whatever injury was 
sustained . . . to have healed sufficiently so that (a person) would not bleed, 
unless he was holding something in his hands that would stop the blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the fact that we failed to find the bloody shoes that clearly were worn 
from the scene -- although we did find a bloody glove -- is hardly illogical at 
all. The reason we found the bloody glove was simply accident. . . . If he knew 
he dropped the glove, obviously we would never have found either. But . . . he 
did drop the glove, not intentionally but by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, the bloody glove that was found at the crime scene is left-handed. 
That's a very important fact. The bloody shoe prints leaving that crime scene 
with blood drops alongside them were to the left of those shoeprints. That 
shows us that the killer was injured somewhere on his left side. 
</P>
<P>
 The blood on the driver's door handle of the Ford Bronco would logically be 
opened with the left hand, and it's no coincidence that we just happen to find 
the blood spot on the driver's door handle . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Now on the day that the defendant returned from Chicago, Detective Vannatter 
makes the observation that after having seen the left-handed bloody glove at 
the crime scene that clearly came off during the struggle . . . he sees the 
defendant with a bandage around his middle left finger. And then he takes him 
down to Parker Center where he sees . . . a swollen finger on the left hand 
with a cut that was dressed and treated at Parker Center. No coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Third. The right-handed mate to that glove is found on the defendant's 
property . . . mere hours after the crimes were committed. . . . And a . . . 
test on that glove came up positive. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth. The defendant clearly lied to the limousine driver, Allan Park. When 
Allan Park drove down to the Rockingham gate about 10:40 (p.m.), the Ford 
Bronco was not there. Between 10:40 and 10:55, he rang the intercom repeatedly 
and received no answer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only when 15 minutes later, after Park had just seen a black person, 
6-feet, 200 pounds, walk quickly up the drive and into the front door, that the 
intercom was finally answered by the defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that person . . . entered the house through a front door . . ., all 
downstairs lights were off. Immediately after that person entered the house, 
all the lights went on. And 30 seconds later, the defendant answered the 
intercom. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Now it must be obvious to everyone at this point that the person seen entering 
the house by Allan Park was the defendant. But he lied to the limousine driver, 
and it's a very significant lie, because why would he need to do that? Why not 
just say: "I was out getting some last-minute things. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But it's very significant that he chose to lie to the limo driver at all. . . 
. What lie did he tell? He said: "Oh, I overslept. I just got out of the 
shower." We know that's not true. He was seen going in the house 30 seconds 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 The only reason to tell such a lie is that the defendant is trying to set up 
an alibi for the time when he knows that the murders occurred. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Fifth. The blood drop on the trail leading away from the victims at 875 Bundy. 
Testing revealed that only (0.43% ) of the population could . . . have been the 
source of that blood drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Now what's interesting is on cross-examination, (defense) counsel attempted to 
(show) that that stain might reflect that two people left that blood drop . . . 
If that's true, we do know this: At least one of them had all the markers that 
can be attributed to the defendant, who is within 0.43% of the population that 
could have left that blood drop. 
</P>
<P>
 And of those (people) that could have been the source, the 0.43% that could 
have been the source of that blood drop, how many had a bloody glove found on 
their property mere hours after the murders occurred, a bloody glove that 
matched the bloody glove found at the crime scene?

NATURE OF A KNIFE ATTACK SETS IT APART; ON THE SCENE: IMAGES FROM THE SIMPSON 
DRAMA; CRIME: THERE IS MORE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL INVOLVEMENT THAN A SHOOTING, 
EXPERTS NOTE. IT DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN AN ATTACKER'S INTENT WAS MORE EVIL.

<P>
 The double slaying for which O.J. Simpson stands accused is everything the 
typical Los Angeles killing is not. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a city renowned for its impersonal murders -- drive-by attacks, stray 
bullets, indiscriminate violence often inflicted by anonymous assailants from a 
safe distance with a high-powered gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicides caused by stabbing accounted for only 9% of the 2,065 killings in 
Los Angeles County last year. They are often characterized by excessive 
slashing or puncture wounds that far surpass what is necessary to end the 
victim's life, according to detectives, psychologists and other students of 
criminal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most shootings, in which the perpetrator never touches his victim, an 
assailant with a knife usually has to engage in a hand-to-hand struggle. Unlike 
the armed robber who can coolly eliminate his witness with a pull of the 
trigger, a knife-wielder must fervently want his victim dead. Unlike the 
average drive-by, in which a carload of gangbangers may speed off without even 
knowing whether their target was struck, a killer with a knife often cannot 
escape without being doused by his victim's blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you got a gun, it's real easy and clean -- you don't have to get yourself 
dirty," said Kris Mohandie, the Los Angeles Police Department's in-house 
psychologist. "Using a knife entails a lot of something else -- a lot more 
work, a lot more involvement, a lot more investment, both physically and 
emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony on the last day of Simpson's preliminary hearing focused on the 
graphic details of the June 12 knife attack at his ex-wife's Brentwood 
condominium.  
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's examiner said that the killer slashed Nicole Brown Simpson's neck 
so deeply that the blade cut into her vertebrae. Ronald Lyle Goldman's neck was 
also sliced, a lung was pierced and a critical artery was punctured by a 
five-inch-deep gash. More than a dozen other cuts scarred his body, indicating 
a fierce struggle with his attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have something like a severed head or someone disemboweled, the 
first thing you think is, what kind of person, what kind of thing, what kind of 
animal would do something like this," said veteran LAPD Detective Andy Cicoria, 
who has responded to more than 1,000 homicides.  
</P>
<P>
 For every rule, of course, there are exceptions, and experts are quick to 
caution that many people who kill simply seize upon the most readily available 
weapon. Moreover, they add, a blood-soaked crime scene may appear more brutal, 
but it does not necessarily mean that the attacker's intent was any more evil. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuart Fischoff, a psychology professor at Cal State L.A., recalled his 
experience last year outside a friend's Hollywood restaurant, where three 
skateboarders whizzed by and knocked over a potted palm. 
</P>
<P>
 When his friend protested, one of the skaters clubbed him over the head with 
his board. Fischoff said he instinctively grabbed a chair and swung it at the 
teen-age assailant before being restrained by an onlooker. It was only 
afterward, he said, that he even became aware of how fiercely he had reacted. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're in the throes of it, you lose a sense of what's going on, you're 
just thrashing and bashing," said Fischoff, who studies aggressive behavior.  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, in the criminal subculture that stretches from the streets to the 
jails, men with the stomach for such intimate warfare generally are held in 
high regard. It is not uncommon to hear veteran gangsters lament the passing of 
more honorable days, when beefs were frequently resolved with face-to-face 
combat. 
</P>
<P>
 In the gang world, a person with enough ruthlessness to kill with a knife 
"would be considered loco, psycho, straight crazy," said John Berge, an 
instructor at the California Youth Authority facility in Chino. "For some 
reason, in that subculture, they get a lot of respect for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Galipeau, a longtime probation officer, believes few criminals have the 
appetite for such up-close bloodshed. He tasted it back in Vietnam, strangling 
to death a Viet Cong soldier while rescuing a wounded comrade behind enemy 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you either have to be survival-oriented, like in my case, or actually 
sociopathic," Galipeau said. "I know guys who will shoot somebody at a distance 
or driving by in a car. But there's probably only one-half of 1% out there who 
have the heart to come up to you and stab you until you die, all the while 
smelling your blood and your sweat."

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY; VICTIMS' IMAGES ARE A POWERFUL REMINDER OF LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman were a haunting -- and 
important -- presence in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Without them attending the preliminary hearing, we might have forgotten there 
are victims in the O.J. Simpson murder prosecution, dominated as it is by a 
famous defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 The families' televised images reminded everyone, including prospective 
jurors, of the loss inflicted on the survivors. Through those left behind, we 
saw Simpson and Goldman for what they were -- a young man and woman robbed of 
life, rather than figures on a medical examiner's crude charts. When we saw the 
parents, we felt the dead could have been our children, or our sisters and 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 It must have been torture for the relatives to go through the hearing, 
particularly on the last day Friday when they heard a medical examiner describe 
the fatal wounds in cold, clinical language. You wonder how -- and why -- they 
did it. 
</P>
<P>
 But think for a moment and you might understand their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a growing number of victims, and survivors of victims, they may well have 
a desire for retribution. Maybe they needed to know the facts of the crime and 
to close the book on a horrible event. 
</P>
<P>
 And like any victims or survivors, they want justice from a huge and 
complicated court system that often seems unconcerned with individuals. Only by 
sitting in court, watching the judge and jury, and by speaking up at sentencing 
and parole hearings can the victims be sure their voice will be heard. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of the families and their power to stir the viewers' emotions are 
sure to shape events outside the courtroom. For the Brown and Goldman relatives 
are the latest examples of a force that has drastically changed California's 
criminal law by empowering often-forgotten victims and families. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It probably began, Prof. Evan Lee of UC's Hastings Law School told me, when 
Earl Warren was chief justice of the United States, presiding over a Supreme 
Court that greatly increased defendants' rights. "It was the first court to 
protect defendants' rights in a vigorous way," he said. "Before the Warren 
court, the system was tilted toward the prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the attack against defendants' rights was first led by county 
district attorneys who were angry over the conduct of the Democratic-controlled 
Legislature's Assembly Criminal Procedure Committee. Through the '60s and '70s, 
the committee killed scores of prosecutors' bills designed to weaken the 
defense side.  
</P>
<P>
 Although blocked by the Legislature, then-Gov. Ronald Reagan was able to 
articulate the feelings of the prosecutors and cops, and of middle-class 
Californians who were becoming more concerned with crime. His rhetoric took 
root. 
</P>
<P>
 What turned rhetoric into a movement was television, according to Assemblyman 
Bob Epple, who now chairs a much more conservative version of the Criminal 
Procedure Committee, the Public Safety Committee. Epple, a Democrat, saw it 
happen in his district, which includes the working-class and middle-class 
Democratic communities of Downey, Lakewood, Cerritos, Norwalk and Santa Fe 
Springs. There, he watched the growth of what became the victims' rights 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victims' families became the focus of television news," Epple told me. 
"The victims were always shown on the news. As the people looked at a victim's 
family, it was easy to say, 'That could be me, that could be my children, that 
could be my neighborhood.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By 1982, organized victims' rights groups existed throughout the state. They 
were joined that year by a famous grass-roots organizer, the late Paul Gann, 
who helped them win voter approval of a constitutional amendment called the 
victims' bill of rights. 
</P>
<P>
 It made many changes in the law, but the major one was to empower victims and 
their survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 It gave them the right to speak when a defendant was sentenced and at parole 
hearings. Victims and survivors now must be notified of such proceedings. This 
was a momentous change. In the past, defendants were sentenced, and freed, and 
the victim never heard of it. The crime was an unfinished chapter in the 
victim's life. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law made the victim and survivors part of the criminal justice system, 
with official standing. During this time, victim support groups increasingly 
urged victims and survivors to attend trials, to be present at all steps in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Empowered, victims continued to organize. Victims' groups were an important 
part of the campaign to recall California Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, 
whose court overturned 64 of 68 death penalty sentences. The increased penalty 
measure known as "three strikes and you're out" is also a product of the 
victims' right movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is an end to it," said Richard Eiglehart, an Alameda 
County prosecutor on leave while serving as consultant to the Assemby Public 
Safety Committee. "You will see an active policy-based focus by the different 
victims rights' groups for some time to come." 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson preliminary hearing has ended, but the Goldman and Brown families 
won't go away, nor will the powerful cause they symbolize.

 Gregory Matheson, a supervisor at the Los Angeles Police Department crime lab. 
In his second day on the stand, said blood found at the scene of the crime 
matches some characteristics of O.J. Simpson's blood and that 0.43% of the 
population could be expected to have the same type.On cross-examination, he 
acknowledged that 40,000 to 80,000 people in Los Angeles might have blood that 
would also match.

<P>
 Dr. Irwin L. Golden, deputy medical examiner for the Los Angeles County 
coroner's office. Testified that both victims suffered multiple knife wounds, 
with Nicole Brown Simpson's throat deeply slashed and Ronald Lyle Goldman 
stabbed in the head, throat, chest, abdomen, thigh and hands. Also suggested 
for the first time that two weapons might have been used.

DICK SARGENT, 64; 'BEWITCHED' TV ACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dick Sargent, the affable actor best remembered as Elizabeth Montgomery's 
second television husband on the sitcom "Bewitched," died Friday. He was 64. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Wise, a spokesman for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, said Sargent had been 
admitted Wednesday and died there of prostate cancer that was diagnosed in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, after parts on several failed sitcoms, Sargent replaced the late Dick 
York in the role of Darrin Stephens on ABC's "Bewitched." York, who left after 
five seasons because of a debilitating back injury and an addiction to 
painkillers, died in 1992 at age 63 of emphysema and a degenerative spinal 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 As husband to Montgomery's Samantha, a winsome witch who could work magic with 
a twitch of her nose, Stephens tried vainly to juggle the pressures of his ad 
agency job along with the escapades of his wife and disapproving mother-in-law, 
usually with little success. 
</P>
<P>
 Sargent, the son of a World War I hero and a former silent film actress, was 
born Richard Cox. After a childhood spent in Carmel, Calif., he briefly 
attended Stanford University, where he appeared in several school plays before 
dropping out to pursue an acting career. 
</P>
<P>
 As Dick Sargent, he began on the big screen in the late 1950s with roles in 
such forgettable films as "Bernardine" and "Mardi Gras." In 1959, he was seen 
with Cary Grant and Tony Curtis in the wartime comedy "Operation Petticoat." 
Later movies included "That Touch of Mink," "Captain Newman M.D.," "The Ghost 
and Mr. Chicken," "The Private Navy of Sgt. O'Farrell" and "Hardcore." 
</P>
<P>
 He also appeared in dozens of episodic TV shows, among them "Gunsmoke," 
"Playhouse 90" and "Family Ties," and was a regular in the 1961 situation 
comedy "One Happy Family." 
</P>
<P>
 After "Bewitched" ended in 1972, Sargent continued to act occasionally, with 
guest appearances on such TV shows as "Taxi," "Murder, She Wrote" and "L.A. 
Law" and in B movies such as "The Clonus Horror," "Body Count," "Teen Witch" 
and "Rock-a-Die-Baby." 
</P>
<P>
 After his cancer was diagnosed, doctors were optimistic that it could be 
treated. However, the disease continued to spread and by early this year 
Sargent was seriously ill and further weakened by daily radiation treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 After mostly withdrawing from show business in his final years, Sargent 
returned to the news in 1991 when he announced that he was gay, ending what he 
said was an awkward facade he had maintained throughout his professional life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was such a relief," he told an interviewer that year. "I lived in fear of 
being found out. Now it's given me a whole new mission in life." 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime supporter of the Special Olympics, Sargent was soon a highly 
visible advocate of gay rights as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't be ignored," he said at a 1992 gay pride parade and festival in 
Orange County, for which he was grand marshal. "We deserve to be heard. People 
don't understand that we're everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Sargent conceded that while "coming out" may have cost him professionally, the 
personal rewards were worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably never be allowed to play a father symbol again," he told a 
reporter in 1991. "I'm afraid for my career. I'm probably gonna lose a whole 
lot of work. . . . I may even have to sell the house someday, but this is more 
important. I like myself, probably more than I have most of my life."

JOHN SHAD; LED SEC PROBE OF BROKERAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John S.R. Shad, a former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman who 
initiated an investigation of Drexel Burnham Lambert and then went on to try to 
clean up the brokerage as its head, has died. He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
 Shad died Thursday in New York after heart surgery, said his daughter, Leslie 
Shad. 
</P>
<P>
 As head of the SEC, the federal agency created in 1934 that regulates 
virtually all the nation's investment activities, Shad ordered a wide-ranging 
probe of Drexel in 1986 that eventually led to a securities-fraud plea 
agreement with the Justice Department. In April, 1989, Drexel hired Shad, who 
by then was U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands, as part of its settlement with 
federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Shad left Drexel just over a year later as the failing brokerage tried to work 
its way through a bankruptcy reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman of Drexel, Shad donated his compensation to the Harvard Business 
School Leadership and Ethics Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Drexel helped fuel the takeover craze of the 1980s by establishing a 
marketplace for risky securities known as junk bonds. But the fraud charges 
doomed the firm, which agreed to pay $650 million in penalties and pleaded 
guilty to six felonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Shad was a vice chairman of now-defunct E.F. Hutton & Co. from 1970 until his 
appointment to the SEC by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. In 1987, Shad left 
the SEC to become the envoy to the Netherlands.

FDA ORDERS RECALL OF GOAT MILK CHEESE THAT MAY BE TAINTED WITH BACTERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Northern California company is recalling thousands of packages of goat milk 
cheese because they may contain life-threatening bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who purchased Cypress Grove Chevre between early May and June 22 is 
asked not to eat the cheese, but to return it to the store where it was 
purchased for a refund. 
</P>
<P>
 The cheese from a processing plant at McKinleyville, Calif., near Eureka, was 
sold primarily in California, but possibly contaminated shipments also went to 
Colorado, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, Oregon and 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Food and Drug Administration discovered that some of the cheese was not 
pasteurized long enough, so it could be contaminated with listeria, a bacteria 
that usually causes flu symptoms in healthy people, but can be deadly to the 
very young, elderly, people with weak immune systems and fetuses. Recall 
questions should be directed to Cypress Grove at (707) 839-3168.

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; BIG SCREEN, SMALL SCREEN VIEW THE CASE FROM DIFFERENT 
ANGLES; TELEVISION: NETWORKS' DECISION TO CARRY LIVE COVERAGE COST THEM UP TO 
$1 MILLION A DAY IN LOST REVENUES. BUT VIEWERS STAYED RIVETED TO THE HEARING.

<P>
 Friday's dramatic conclusion of the preliminary hearing in the O.J. Simpson 
murder case came none too soon for the three major broadcast networks. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to carry live daily coverage demonstrated the power of network 
television by turning the focus of an entire country on a Los Angeles 
courtroom. The total number of households using television steadily climbed 
each day this week, reaching 18% above normal viewership levels on Thursday, 
according to preliminary figures released Friday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. Half 
of those homes were watching Simpson's hearing on the three networks. 
</P>
<P>
 But each of the broadcast networks lost as much as $1 million a day in 
advertising revenue by dumping their regularly scheduled programming, according 
to network sources. In addition, they angered droves of loyal soap opera fans, 
thousands of whom flooded ABC, NBC and CBS with complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, despite the complaints and the lost revenue, the networks wanted to 
cover the story that has captivated the nation, and viewers were glued to their 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soap opera fans have complained, but the ratings show people were riveted," 
said CBS executive Lane Venardos on Friday, shortly after Municipal Judge 
Kathleen Kennedy-Powell ruled that there was enough evidence to proceed with a 
murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Venardos, who directed CBS' live courtroom coverage, has been working from 
7:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. since the hearing began, producing live daily coverage and 
evening news specials. 
</P>
<P>
 When ABC briefly turned away Wednesday for an hour to broadcast its 
long-running daytime drama "One Life to Live," viewers switched over to CBS and 
NBC. ABC's ratings dropped 32% and never fully recovered the rest of the day, 
even after returning to the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major story," said Bill Croasdale, who is in charge of buying 
network commercial time for Western International Media. "And, despite their 
concern about lost ad revenue and irate soap fans, none of the networks wants 
to be pilloried in the press for running soap operas instead of in-depth 
Simpson coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 During the slow summer months of TV reruns, the Simpson case dominated U.S. 
television from morning until night. O.J. Simpson was the constant subject of 
morning news shows, daytime courtroom coverage, evening newscasts, evening 
tabloid shows, prime-time newsmagazines and late-night news wrap-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable television's CNN did not have the financial problems of the broadcast 
networks in terms of lost revenue from soap operas. CNN's live coverage of the 
hearing pulled in some of its highest ratings outside of its Persian Gulf War 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an amazing story -- I don't think anybody at the start of this week 
thought that we would all be there live for five days straight," said one 
network source. 
</P>
<P>
 National network ratings are only available for the first two days of the 
hearing. On June 30, the three major broadcast networks and cable's CNN had a 
combined afternoon rating of 18, translating into nearly 17 million homes out 
of a total of 94 million TV households in the nation. But nobody can determine 
how many viewers actually watched the proceedings because in workplaces across 
the country groups of employees clustered around single TV sets. 
</P>
<P>
 The ratings dipped slightly July 1, but preliminary Nielsen figures show that 
ratings climbed steadily over this past week when witnesses began testifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Network executives said that it was too soon to tell how they will cover the 
trial. Given the intense viewer interest, however, they are leaving open the 
possibility of more gavel-to-gavel coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't made any decisions yet," Venardos said, "but I could see the 
networks offering live, daily coverage of the trial, at least in the beginning 
and perhaps for significant portions of the trial. I can't see the trial being 
(any) less interesting than the hearing."

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; BIG SCREEN, SMALL SCREEN VIEW THE CASE FROM DIFFERENT 
ANGLES; MOVIES: MOTION PICTURE STUDIOS SEE A TRANSFIXED AUDIENCE AND SEIZE THE 
MOMENT BY POURING MONEY INTO EXTRA ADS TOUTING THEIR SUMMER RELEASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The O.J. Simpson saga has unexpectedly sparked a boom in advertising from 
major studios pushing summer blockbusters. 
</P>
<P>
 The relentless TV coverage of Simpson's flight from authorities, his arrest 
and the preliminary hearing has changed the summer strategy that studios use to 
hype their movies, just as the major releases are hitting theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 The studios have traditionally advertised during news hours, though that time 
period has not been the best venue for attracting moviegoers. But the studios 
have found a bonanza, not only during the news hours but during gavel-to-gavel 
coverage of the Simpson case and during evening wrap-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 The advertising is reaching all age groups, both men and women -- something 
usually difficult to achieve during the summer months when most TV fare 
consists of reruns and local news, the studios have found.  
</P>
<P>
 Studio sources would not say on the record that they have taken advantage of 
the Simpson coverage by playing their ads to a larger, captivated audience. 
They fear criticism for capitalizing on a double homicide. But, privately, they 
say they hope the strategy will be effective. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be considered exploitative, but this kind of decision is reflective 
of the world we live in," a source at Universal Studios said. "The movie 
business is susceptible to the same things as any other organization, including 
the news business. We're just adjusting our media program to work within the 
bounds of what is happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Local station officials agree that the studios are buying more ads because of 
the Simpson coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a significant increase in news buys that was often done on a 
day-by-day basis," said Stacy Okonowski, a spokeswoman for KCAL-TV, Channel 9. 
"Normally the studios advertise in the early day and in the late-evening 
periods. But they were buying ads during our evening news, too. That was 
significantly up." 
</P>
<P>
 John McKay, director of sales for KCBS-TV, Channel 2, said: "Yes, we're seeing 
movie spots bought in places where they would not usually be bought." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said studio marketing executives have been huddled in meetings trying 
to figure out what Simpson-related news programs would attract the widest 
audience. And in at least one case, an alternative strategy has been used. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal Pictures came up with a Simpson-related strategy for promoting "The 
Shadow," which opened July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 That day, as reporters skulked around the courthouse for the latest breaking 
news on Simpson, Universal went full throttle. An 18-wheeler truck, with "The 
Shadow" plastered on both sides, was driven to the media-packed courthouse so 
that it would be in full view of the TV cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sources say they spotted one of the trucks parked in front of Simpson's 
house. Universal does not deny the courthouse maneuver but discounts any cruise 
by Simpson's Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
 An MGM source said the response among marketing executives at nearly every 
studio has been: "How tacky. Wish we would have thought of that!" 
</P>
<P>
 But most studios have limited their campaigns to TV advertising for reaching 
the widest audience during the Simpson coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, people of all ages and from all walks of life are now glued to their TV 
sets," said one MGM marketing source. "You've got a whole audience targeted to 
a certain medium that you don't usually get, especially at this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
 Some studio representatives were quick to accuse 20th Century Fox for 
blatantly capitalizing on the sensational murders. On June 16, the studio 
blitzed Los Angeles airwaves by running ads for the summer hit "Speed" on 
apparently every TV station. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say the ad buy was in anticipation of Simpson's arrest and heavy news 
coverage that evening, although it turned out he was not arrested until the 
next day. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fox officials say a gamble on Simpson's arrest was not the motivating 
factor. They insist that the TV ads were bought in advance because the day was 
considered the peak time to grab attention before another three-day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 But their competitors say such a costly ad-buying spree, which can run in the 
neighborhood of $100,000 for one night, is usually done the Thursday night 
before a film opens. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Brothers was pushing its next film, "The Client," on Court TV, another 
critical venue for all-day coverage of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "It boils down to this," said one MGM marketing source: "What's a studio to do 
when they've got close to 100 million viewers watching?"

EX-LAPD DETECTIVE WAIVES EXTRADITION; CRIME: THE RETIRED OFFICER IS A SUSPECT 
IN A SERIES OF ARMED ROBBERIES IN THE SOUTHLAND. HE WILL RETURN TO CALIFORNIA 
TO FACE CHARGES.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A retired Los Angeles Police Department detective waived extradition Friday to 
return to California and face charges in a series of armed robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Douglas Brambles agreed to return to California during a brief 
appearance before District Judge Nancy Becker.It was not known how soon Los 
Angeles authorities would come to get Brambles. 
</P>
<P>
 Brambles was arrested Tuesday on a fugitive warrant charging him with nine 
felony counts. 
</P>
<P>
 The former detective, who handled some of the department's most sensitive 
organized crime cases in a 23-year career that ended in March, is a suspect in 
a two-month string of armed robberies in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The robberies occurred in various Los Angeles locations, starting with the 
armed robbery of a suburban Woodland Hills bicycle shop March 3. 
</P>
<P>
 During his career, Brambles headed the Los Angeles Police Department's 
investigation into the ZZZZ Best carpet cleaning service, and he was the LAPD's 
contact with Elizabeth Adams, a Beverly Hills madam who passed on the pillow 
talk gleaned from her clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1992, Brambles was reprimanded by a department disciplinary panel 
for giving false testimony in a criminal case about his transfer out of the 
LAPD's organized crime intelligence division. 
</P>
<P>
 The police Board of Rights concluded that Brambles misstated his relationship 
with a woman. He testified that the relationship was "strictly business" when 
in fact it was personal.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Brambles was identified as a suspect by a security guard who 
works near a motel in Inglewood. The guard also worked at a dry cleaners 
targeted in a holdup.

FORMER CONVICT PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN KIDNAPING OF GIRL, 12, IN LODI 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 25-year-old man pleaded not guilty Friday to kidnaping a 12-year-old girl 
from her Lodi home last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Reese Cochran appeared in shackles in San Joaquin Superior Court to 
enter pleas to 21 counts that include kidnaping, burglary and sexual battery. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Connie Callahan scheduled a preliminary hearing for Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Public Defender Dave Adams said Cochran is "rather sad and perplexed" about 
the charges facing him and the news media furor. Adams said he has told his 
client not to grant any more media interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran is charged with abducting Katie Romanek from her home last Saturday 
after tying up her sister and a friend. He was captured the next day during a 
massive police manhunt 25 miles southwest of Lodi. Katie was found in a field. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran is an ex-convict who has spent much of the last eight years in prison 
in Arizona.

BOY SCOUTS BROKE LAW IN OUSTING GAY LEADER, JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State law prohibits the Boy Scouts from expelling a Scout leader after 
learning of his homosexuality, a Superior Court judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boy Scouts are a business, and as such they cannot discriminate on the 
basis of someone's sexual preference, Superior Court Judge Anthony Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge awarded former Explorer Scout leader Chuck Merino $5,000 in damages 
and ordered the Boy Scouts to pay his lawyer's fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scouts, who have a national policy banning homosexuals from being leaders, 
are expected to appeal the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The principles of the Boy Scouts are not for sale and they will not change," 
said the group's lawyer, Michael Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 Merino, 38, was expelled in 1992 and sued seeking reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
 During the non-jury trial, Edwards argued that the Boy Scouts are a collection 
of volunteers rather than a business. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge disagreed, ruling that the Scouts have commercial interests and 
are covered by the Unruh Act, the law that prohibits discrimination based on 
race, religion and sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial in San Diego, Merino said he was never asked about his sexual 
orientation before becoming a leader in the program.

 Howard Stites, who played a key role in the development of Burbank during the 
Depression and World War II, died Monday, leaving behind numerous city 
monuments to his work.

CULTURE WATCH; DANGER IN IGNORANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Roper poll released last year seemed to yield the shocking finding that 34% 
of Americans either doubted or weren't sure that the Holocaust ever happened. 
The poll, sponsored by the American Jewish Committee, understandably set off 
alarms, for it appeared to indicate considerable headway had been made by that 
lunatic fringe that proclaims the Holocaust to be a myth.A second look at the 
question asked by the poll, however, suggested a more reassuring reason for its 
startling numbers. "Does it seem possible or does it seem impossible to you 
that the Nazi extermination of the Jews never happened?" That question, with 
its double negative, surely must be among the more confusing ever posed in a 
major opinion survey. 
</P>
<P>
 A follow-up poll with a rephrased question has elicited markedly dissimilar 
results. "Does it seem possible to you that the Nazi extermination of the Jews 
never happened, or do you feel certain that it happened?" More clearly asked, 
91% of those polled said they were certain the Holocaust took place. Only 1% 
said it was possible it never happened, while 8% weren't sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Of what importance is knowledge of any specific historical event, in this 
instance organized killing on an unparalleled scale? Its importance lies in the 
terrible revealing light it sheds on what ideological hatred can lead to, and 
on the inhumanity that ordinary people are capable of descending to. To be 
unaware of such an enormous crime, to deny or question its relevance to 
contemporary affairs is surely to weaken civilization's barriers against 
barbarism.

THE SHOWDOWN OVER SMOKING; STAGE IS SET FOR NOVEMBER BALLOT CONFRONTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The stage is now set in California for a clear-cut showdown between the public 
good and tobacco interests. The Legislature has passed a sweeping statewide ban 
on smoking in restaurants and nearly all other enclosed places of employment. 
It took years of wrangling and compromising to pass this bill, a measure whose 
time has come. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Gov. Pete Wilson will have the courage to resist intense pressure 
from the tobacco lobby and other narrow special interests and sign AB 13. 
Friday morning he told KNX radio that "I expect that I will sign it." After 
all, last year he imposed similar restrictions on state office buildings. How 
could he prescribe otherwise for private workplaces? 
</P>
<P>
 But a major hurdle looms. Philip Morris, the cigarette maker, has managed to 
place an initiative on the November statewide ballot that would cancel out AB 
13 and all local anti-smoking ordinances. If approved, it would replace them 
all with uniform but far less restrictive rules that would permit smoking in 
workplaces that are well-ventilated. It is indicative of the backer's mendacity 
that Philip Morris gained the signatures for the initiative by promoting it as 
an anti-smoking measure. 
</P>
<P>
 NOD TO TOURISM: AB 13, authored by Assemblyman Terry B. Friedman 
(D-Brentwood), is the strongest legislation of its kind passed by any state and 
is sure to be emulated elsewhere. Meant mainly to protect nonsmokers from 
secondhand fumes, it was the product of prolonged deliberations in which 
Friedman got cooperation from the tourism industry by agreeing to allow smoking 
in parts of hotel lobbies and bars and in banquet and meeting rooms. And he 
agreed to exempt businesses with five or fewer employees as long as no worker 
objected. It was by coincidence but quite fitting that the bill was passed on 
the same day that the Centers for Disease Control disclosed staggering figures 
on the health costs of smoking. The centers released a study by UC Berkeley and 
UC San Francisco that found about $50 billion a year in direct medical costs 
can be attributed to smoking -- or $2.06 per pack of cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 TAXES AND LIVES: The Tobacco Institute responded with typical obtuseness. "We 
stand by our conviction that those costs do not exceed the taxes collected on 
the product," said its spokesman, Thomas Lauria. How comforting to the dying 
lung-cancer patient to know that he is recouping, in terminal medical care, the 
taxes he paid on all those packages of pleasure, with even something left over 
for the government. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a partisan issue. AB 13 passed the Senate on June 30 by a 23-10 
vote and the Assembly Thursday by 48 to 22, with many Republicans joining the 
Democratic majority. There may be some who agree with Assemblyman Gil Ferguson 
(R-Newport Beach) that AB 13 violates individual rights on the basis of the 
"lie" that secondhand smoke is dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Environmental Protection Agency says secondhand smoke is deadly, and a 
growing body of medical opinion supports that view. This bill protects 
Californians. The governor should sign it.

UNRAVELING THE STOP-N-GO PUZZLE; FREEWAY PHENOMENON IS INVESTIGATED -- AND, 
HALLELUJAH, A SOLUTION IS GIVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As we all know, Southern California is an enigmatic place. But sociology 
aside, for the average Angeleno a chief daily enigma is the maddening mystery 
of why fast-moving freeway traffic sometimes comes to a teeth-gnashing halt for 
no apparent reason, then later speeds up, again for no apparent reason. 
</P>
<P>
 We can now thank Bob Holmes for helping us solve this central mystery of 
everyday life. The answer is both as simple as clumsy driving and as complex as 
shock waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporting on current traffic research in the June 25 issue of New Scientist, 
Holmes says such slowdowns occur when traffic is heavy and cars follow each 
other closely. In such situations any slight slowing, such as when rounding a 
curve or receiving merging traffic, can be amplified into a near-stop. 
</P>
<P>
 This is because poor drivers will brake more than necessary, causing a growing 
wave of deceleration among those behind. A similar wave of acceleration occurs 
when traffic begins to move again. (The driver who started the problem is 
blissfully ignorant of what he did, having long left the scene of the crime.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Think of the similar case of sound waves," writes Holmes in the British 
journal. "You hear the bang of a firework wherever the sound wave reaches you, 
not when you pass the site of the explosion. Similarly, your car stops on the 
motorway wherever it meets the shock wave." 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson: Drive smoothly in heavy traffic. Use the space between your car 
and the one in front as a kind of shock absorber to moderate changes in speed. 
The mysterious traffic breakdowns are the fault of you who are too heavy on the 
brake. We've got many intractable problems in Los Angeles, but this one is 
solvable.

CLEANER BEACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission would like to thank The Times for your 
timely editorial spreading the message of personal environmental responsibility 
("The Beach You Save May Be Your Own," July 2). We are very proud that through 
our Adopt-A-Beach Program and annual statewide Coastal Cleanup Day Californians 
lead the nation in caring for the coast. More than 50,000 volunteers joined in 
the 1993 Cleanup Day, an accomplishment that has just been awarded the world 
record by the Guinness Book of Records. Even at the minimum wage, that one 
three-hour cleanup amounted to a savings to the state of more than $637,000! 
</P>
<P>
 In response to The Times' call for people to lend a hand, here are some simple 
things that can be done: 
</P>
<P>
 * Groups can make a commitment to cleaning their favorite beach at least three 
times a year. The commission's Adopt-A-Beach Program can provide the supplies 
and orientation to make it easy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Teachers can get the Save Our Seas curriculum to help students understand 
the ocean and coastal environment, and involve them in hands-on projects that 
show them they have the power to make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 * Businesses can join Lucky Stores, Southwest Airlines, Coors Pure Water 2000, 
the American Plastics Council and scores of local businesses in helping to 
underwrite organizing and supplies for volunteer cleanups.  
</P>
<P>
 * Individuals can make every visit to the beach a conservation crusade and set 
an example by always leaving the beach cleaner than they found it.  
</P>
<P>
 * Voters can support SB 1411, by state Sen. Henry J. Mello (D-Santa Cruz), 
authorizing an Adopt-A-Beach license plate; part of the fee for each plate sold 
would help provide funding for the Adopt-A-Beach cleanup and education program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Everyone can volunteer for the 10th annual Statewide Coastal Cleanup on 
Saturday, Sept. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope your readers will take up your challenge by calling the Coastal 
Commission at (800) COAST 4 U to find out more about these and other ideas that 
will help make the beach "see-worthy."

PRELIMINARY HEARING FOR O. J. SIMPSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After enduring the first day (June 30) of the O.J. Simpson preliminary hearing 
on all the television stations in Los Angeles, I am disgusted. The death of a 
young woman and man in a brutal way is no longer lamented; rather the accused 
is more eulogized by the media and the general public. The trial in the media 
has focused more on how great of a person O.J. Simpson is rather than the 
brutality of the murder that he is accused of being responsible for. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after the first day the Simpson lawyer, Robert Shapiro, is attempting to 
throw out crucial and incriminating evidence because of a legal loophole. For 
most of us this move is disgusting because the average person would not get 
this kind of overpaid treatment. It seems that the justice system unduly favors 
those with more wealth. This country in my opinion is sick when such 
"tabloidesque" stories overshadow such crucial happenings such as health care 
reform, which unlike the Simpson case will affect us all. 
</P>
<P>
 Responsible journalism should be lamented because it has departed from this 
country. The new tabloid news is king and unfortunately seems to be capturing 
the whole nation's attention and ratings.

 Instead of the press reporting the number of letters Simpson receives each day 
(3,500), perhaps we should focus on the number of letters the families of the 
victims receive. This might give us an indication of the percentage of the 
population that have their priorities straight.

<P>
 * Richard McKenzie's "Under Siege From Assault Journalism," (Column Right, 
June 26) identified a legitimate problem, but conveniently sidesteps the real 
issue. Blaming journalists for the Simpson media mess is like blaming soldiers 
for a war. 
</P>
<P>
 The legitimate news media used to be more or less insulated from the "bottom 
line." Thanks to the takeover of the news business by big business (especially 
the profit-obsessed media conglomerates) "success" in journalism is no longer 
measured by solid reporting, but by getting (by whatever means) the biggest 
share of viewers/readers. The new journalism has but one rule: Big audiences 
equal big profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it just be a coincidence, Mr. McKenzie, that this trend among the 
mainstream media developed during a series of big-business Republican 
administrations?

 Did these fools forget that two people were slaughtered, and two small 
children were left without a mother? The prayers should have been said for the 
victims and not this high-profile individual. 
</P>
<P>
 It is bad enough that there are more fools in this world who forget the 
victims, but, please, spare us the stupidity of the "Congress" being so 
offensive.

<P>
 Re Nirode C. Mohanty's letter, June 10: 
</P>
<P>
 I think it is particularly offensive and hypocritical for Mohanty to baldly 
state that "Islamic fundamentalists from Afghanistan to Algeria with active 
military and other logistics, support Pakistan" in their efforts to drive India 
out of Indian-occupied Kashmir. There is no shred of evidence to support the 
canard that the popular uprising for self-determination of the Kashmiri people 
is driven by external forces inimical to India. 
</P>
<P>
 Kashmir is just one of several indigenous uprisings by minorities against 
harsh, racist central Indian rule. The world is well aware of the brutality 
being committed against the Assamese people and the Sikhs in Indian Punjab. Not 
too long ago, India forcibly occupied Goa and has been threatening Bhutan and 
Nepal ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is not Islamic fundamentalism in brutalized Kashmir, where a force 
of 500,000 Indian security troops, armed to the teeth, is facing down and 
terrorizing the innocent Muslim population. It is an issue of 
self-determination as mandated by the United Nations more than 40 years ago and 
in which India, a signatory, has refused to implement the Security Council 
resolution. The issue is India and its brazen reneging on an agreement with the 
world body. That this has caused anguish and popular resentment should come as 
no surprise. It is a case of the pot calling the kettle black!

ANGELS COME UP EMPTY; BASEBALL: THREE-RUN NINTH WASTED AS YANKEES RALLY FOR A 
4-3 VICTORY AMID INCREASING STRIKE TALK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels were acting so giddy in the dugout Friday night that you'd have 
thought major league baseball had just decided to let the entire American 
League West into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was looming as one of those melodramatic, zany comeback victories, the kind 
that can carry a team for weeks, let alone provide relief for their miserable 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Angels were left with an all-too-familiar result, losing 4-3 to 
the New York Yankees, and believing that the players' strike can't come soon 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of celebrating a dramatic ninth-inning comeback -- scoring three runs 
in the top of the ninth -- they were left consoling one another after the 
Yankees' Bernie Williams capped a two-run rally with a one-out, bases-loaded 
single against Joe Grahe. 
</P>
<P>
 Their only consolation is that their torment won't last an entire season, 
convinced after their latest briefing Friday of a work stoppage in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, according to several players, informally voted to strike and have 
provided that authorization to the Major League Players Assn. They are 
scheduled to vote within two weeks on a strike date, which is expected to be in 
August, according to one source. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you the strike date," said Angel second baseman Harold Reynolds, 
one of several players who attended a negotiating session Friday, "but I can 
tell you that we're very unified on this." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Angels (36-51) are left trying to figure out what they can do 
with the season that still remains, showing the crowd of 23,770 at Yankee 
Stadium just why they have the worst record in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
 Their entire offense for 8 2/3 innings consisted of a first-inning infield 
single by Rex Hudler and three walks. The only saving grace was that Angel 
starter Brian Anderson had limited the Yankees to two runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, inexplicably, it happened. Chili Davis hit a ball off the wrist of 
Yankee starter Melido Perez. Greg Myers doubled to left. Tim Salmon, in his 
first big league pinch-hitting appearance, hit a two-run single to left, tying 
the score. Two batters later, Mark Dalesandro singled to center, scoring 
pinch-runner Reynolds for the go-ahead run. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, all the Angels had to do was stop the Yankees. Reliever Mark Leiter 
retired the only batter he faced in the eighth, but Angel Manager Marcel 
Lachemann summoned closer Grahe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't jump ship just because a guy has a bad day," Lachemann said. "I know 
(managers) that like to do that, go with the front-runner, but I don't play 
that game." 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe, successful in his last four save situations, opened the ninth by 
yielding back-to-back singles to Mike Stanley and Paul O'Neill. Pinch-hitter 
Matt Nokes then hit a routine double-play ball to shortstop Gary DiSarcina. He 
flipped the ball to Reynolds for the first out, and watched in horror as 
Reynolds' relay throw was high and wide, allowing Nokes to reach first. 
</P>
<P>
 "You sit there thinking, 'Oh, man, I hope that doesn't cost us,' " Reynolds 
said. "I was hoping they'd hit another one right to me. It never happened, and 
that's tough to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with runners on first and third with one out, Grahe needed a strikeout. 
He got ahead 1-and-2 on Daryl Boston, and tried to get him to swing at a 
curveball in the dirt. Instead it hit Boston's right foot, loading the bases. 
</P>
<P>
 If Grahe wasn't frustrated enough already, pinch-hitter Jim Leyritz hit a high 
chopper to the right side of the infield. First baseman J.T. Snow fielded the 
ball, but no one was at first. Grahe had forgotten to cover until it was too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he could have thrown out Leyritz is debatable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no play on that ball," Lachemann said. "It wasn't a high-chopper. 
It was almost an infield fly." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Grahe: "I got so upset that they were going to tie the game on a ball 
like that, I didn't even cover first. I don't care if it's Babe Ruth running 
down the line or Lou Brock, I should have been there." 
</P>
<P>
 It was all over two pitches later when Williams slapped a single up the 
middle, scoring Nokes for the game-winner. The Yankees (49-33) went into a 
frenzy, with only Perez left disappointed for not not securing the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may feel bad," Grahe said, "but I'm sure he doesn't feel as bad as I do."

WORLD CUP SHOULDN'T BE CONSIDERED SPOILED BY MURDER OF ESCOBAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with bittersweet amusement the headline on Jim Murray's column in 
today's paper, "Death Will Be the Lasting Memory." 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Andres Escobar will probably become the lasting memory of the '94 
Cup, not because it is representative of anything but the sad state of affairs 
in Colombia, but because it is such an easy story to cover. Guns, drugs and 
murder make wonderful copy -- no, they make sensational copy. And to lump these 
sensational elements with a sport little understood and generally written about 
as un-American, so brilliantly panders to the public palate (whose appetite is 
daily whetted with the blood-sport of Menendezes, Buttafuocos and Bobbitts) as 
to put the late W.R. Hearst to shame. Not only can Americans feel good about 
despising this barbaric sport, but they can revel in all its tawdry, gory 
details over a cup of coffee in the morning before tuning in to the O.J. 
Simpson hearings.

 Jim Murray says the 1994 World Cup "will be remembered for a murder. . . Cause 
of death: World Cup soccer. Murder One." It's amazing that a so-called 
professional journalist can't figure out that it was a gang of drug-dealing, 
gambling hooligans who shot Escobar. Soccer fans didn't do it. Bora Milutinovic 
didn't do it, and neither did Tony Meola, Alexi Lalas, Romario, Bebeto or Pele. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup '94 "will be known for the Murder in Medellin" only for those like 
Mr. Murray, who are oblivious to what goes on in the world.

 The murder of Andres Escobar is not so much an aberration of the degree of 
violence associated with sports in the 20th Century, but a punctuation mark. 
The obsession with winning and the unbalanced view of what sports competition 
is really all about manifests itself every day. 
</P>
<P>
 As a soccer referee, I have witnessed verbal and physical assault at all 
levels of play. Not only is abuse of athletes and spectators rampant, but the 
abuse heaped on officials is so common that it is considered by some to be part 
and parcel of sports competition. Respect, decency and fair play are in short 
supply on America's soccer fields, baseball diamonds and basketball courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Escobar's murder may be a glimpse into the future of the American sports scene 
if we do not, as a nation, realign our priorities.

 I was incensed on June 4, when my wife and I went to the Rose Bowl to see the 
U.S. national team play Mexico, when we walked up to our seats and had to 
endure jeering, thrown objects and obscenities because we were wearing the red, 
white and blue. I was furious when she was hit in the head, twice, with ice as 
we cheered the "home" team to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Now I hear about Mexican fans trashing the streets of L.A. while celebrating 
their World Cup victory on the other side of the continent.

 The World Cup didn't bring hooligans to America -- they've been here all the

 Let's not be getting too upset or surprised that Diego Maradona has been

punched the ball into the goal.

 Congratulations to Chris Dufresne for recognizing that the Germany-Belgium 
game turned on a horrendous non-call. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans would never have won a man down, in regulation or overtime. And 
Germany's Rudi Voeller fouled a Belgian defender on his second goal, a header, 
with a well-placed forearm. 
</P>
<P>
 We've seen this type of officiating that benefits Germany and other World Cup 
powers before. Until this shameful bias stops, the event might best be called 
the "Selected Parts of Certain Hemispheres Cup."

LONGTIME ANGEL FANS HAVE SEEN ENOUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have finally had it. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been an avid fan of the Angels for more than 30 years. I have been a 
season-ticket holder for the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
 I have grimly watched the Angels lose their best players through trades and 
free agency. I have witnessed two spontaneously applied philosophies: 
"Nurturing the kids for the future," and, "It's now or never." 
</P>
<P>
 And firing Buck Rodgers, one of the original Angels, a man who had the 
audacity to call things as they really were . . . that was the last straw. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm through. 
</P>
<P>
 The players can moan and complain all they want about their fans, and frankly, 
I can't blame them. Every ballplayer wants to have supportive fans fill the 
park. Unfortunately, these players have no idea how we have suffered over the 
years of miserable losing, heartbreaking disappointment, and now, excruciating 
boredom. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, it's over.

 Both Angel President Richard Brown and General Manager Bill Bavasi agree that

 Regarding the Angels' ownership and management, do the Cowboy and his girl

 His accomplishments? Hmmm, he let down a city full of fans who wanted

our standards and support him had he been merely mediocre. But, alas, it was

GOLF ROUNDUP; LOHR 'SETTLES' FOR SECOND-ROUND 68 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Lohr confirmed the obvious in Friday's second round of the Anheuser-Busch 
Golf Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "That 61 was a tough act to follow," Lohr said after shooting a 
three-under-par 68 to maintain a three-shot edge in the $1.1-million event at 
Williamsburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 While Lohr's four-birdie, one-bogey effort paled in comparison to his 
opening-round gem, it was good enough to establish a 36-hole record for the 
tournament on Kingsmill Golf Club's 6,797-yard layout. Lohr was at 13-under 
129, one shot better than Ian Baker-Finch and Mike Donald were at the midway 
point of the 1991 event. 
</P>
<P>
 Glen Day, a PGA Tour rookie, also shot a 68 and is second at 132. Then it's 
two more strokes to John Wilson, who shot a 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Purtzer was at 135 after a 69, and the group at six-under 136 included 
1987 Anheuser-Busch champion Mark McCumber, 1984 winner Ronnie Black and rookie 
Justin Leonard. All three shot 69s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kermit Zarley shot a seven-under-par 64, to take a one-stroke lead over DeWitt 
Weaver in the first round of the Kroger Senior Classic at Mason, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golf Course at Kings Island played to the advantage of the big hitters 
after a week of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Nineteen players, including defending champion Simon Hobday, had to sit out a 
39-minute rain delay before they could finish. Soft greens helped 29 of the 79 
players in the field break par. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Shaw, Rocky Thompson and Jim Colbert were another stroke back at 66, and 
Bob Smith, Graham Marsh, Charles Coody and Larry Gilbert were at 67.

MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY; CALIFORNIA LOSES JOBS WHILE REST OF NATION GAINS; 
EMPLOYMENT: PAYROLLS GREW BY A HEALTHY 379,000 ELSEWHERE BUT DECLINED IN THE 
STATE BY 12,100, REFLECTING ITS WOBBLY RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN and JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Raising new concerns about the state's recovery, California began losing 
employment again last month, even as companies across the country added a 
higher-than-expected 379,000 jobs to their payrolls, the government reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department also said a separate employment survey shows the U.S. and 
California jobless rates remaining unchanged in June, with the nation's level 
staying at 6.0% and the state's at 8.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's jobless rate for May -- the most recent figure available -- 
was 5.3%, down from 6.2% in April, as hiring picked up in construction, 
retailing and business services. The June jobless rate, to be released in about 
two weeks, will likely be higher because of large numbers of students and 
teachers who typically seek summer employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts, focusing mainly on the monthly payroll jobs totals, said the 
national figures reflect how the economy continues to expand smartly while the 
state's remains wobbly. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. figures "are strong numbers by any measure, with gains in almost 
every industry," said Joseph A. Wahed, chief economist for Wells Fargo Bank in 
San Francisco. But California, he noted, suffered a sizable loss of 12,100 
jobs, with declines spread across most of the state's industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Kimbell, director of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project, dismissed 
the idea that California "is relapsing into recession, but we sure aren't 
showing any momentum toward joining the other states" in economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many analysts see little sign of inflation flaring up nationally, 
they said the robust job statistics, combined with the dollar's recent 
weakness, could put renewed pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to raise 
interest rates for the fifth time this year.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fed is not expected to move immediately -- its policy-setting committee 
signaled no intent to raise rates after holding a two-day meeting this week -- 
but analysts say an increase is increasingly likely later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the U.S. job gains came at restaurants and in other service 
industries, including many low-paying and temporary summer jobs. But the 
figures also include a 34,000 increase in factory employment, the biggest 
monthly jump in that category in more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials quickly tried to quell fears of inflation. 
"Our economy is coming back on its soundest footing in decades, with more jobs 
and low inflation," President Clinton told reporters at the summit of the seven 
leading industrial nations in Naples, Italy. "In fact, we are leading the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's 379,000 gain in payroll jobs was inflated by various statistical 
and data-gathering quirks, including the use of a five-week measuring period 
rather than the usual four weeks. Even if the normal four-week period was used, 
however, the gain would have been about 300,000, economists said. That is up 
from an average of 287,000 for the first half of 1994 and a monthly average 
194,000 for all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, average hourly wages inched downward, as did the factory 
workweek, which has hovered at historically high levels. Factory overtime was 
unchanged in June, holding on to a previous decline.  
</P>
<P>
 "Companies have finally started to cut back on overtime and hire additional 
workers," said Cynthia Latta, an economist with Lexington, Mass.-based 
DRI/McGraw-Hill.  
</P>
<P>
 The separate employment survey of U.S. households, which is used to calculate 
jobless rates, showed big declines in the number of people either working or 
looking for jobs in California and the rest of the country. But analysts 
generally discounted those statistics, attributing the plunging labor force 
figures to unresolved problems in some of the new procedures the government is 
using to gather data. 
</P>
<P>
 One hopeful sign from that study, however, is that the unemployment rates for 
both the nation and the state held steady after posting big declines in May. 
The U.S. jobless rate, now at a 3 1/2-year low, is down from 6.4% in April, 
while California's rate is down from 9.7% the same month. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 11 big states whose unemployment rates were reported Friday, 
California's 8.3% jobless rate remained the highest, followed by New Jersey's 
7.1%. North Carolina posted the lowest rate, at 3.7%, with Illinois coming in 
next, at 4.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 For California, the 12,100 loss in payroll jobs last month was coupled with a 
downward revision in the job totals for both April and May. All told, it left 
the state with a meager job gain of 6,200 for the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier figures suggested that California was recovering somewhat more 
robustly after losing, by one estimate, nearly 850,000 jobs from mid-1990 
through the end of last year. Kimbell said the state now seems to be moving 
"sideways," and the stimulus provided by post-earthquake rebuilding efforts 
appear to have been minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet various economists see indications that the state economy is 
strengthening. Ted Gibson, principal economist for the California Department of 
Finance, said payroll tax revenues have risen faster than expected.

OFF THE TICKER: HIS POP TART LAWSUIT IS TOAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An imprisoned drug dealer's $310,000 lawsuit claiming he was hurt biting into 
a defective Pop Tart proved fruitless when a federal judge dismissed the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Lyons, 28, said a shard of glass in one of the toaster pastries 
injured his mouth, emotionally traumatized him, and kept him awake "for 72 
hours due to nightmares in which he was dead in a coffin in prison from eating 
Pop Tarts." 
</P>
<P>
 He sued Pop Tart maker Kellogg Co. of Battle Creek and J.M. Smucker Co., which 
provided filling ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
 In dismissing the lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Benjamin Gibson ruled Lyons 
failed to prove his suffering was worth at least $50,000, the minimum for a 
federal lawsuit. Gibson said Lyons lost no wages and incurred no medical 
expenses.

PANEL RULES CANADA WHEAT IMPORTS HARM U.S. FARMERS; TRADE: THE FINDING 
HEIGHTENS TENSIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. OTTAWA WARNS OF RETALIATORY 
MEASURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal panel stepped up U.S.-Canada trade tensions Friday by ruling that 
Canadian wheat imports have harmed U.S. farmers and taxpayers and asking 
President Clinton to curb the shipments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian government expressed disappointment at the ruling and warned that 
punitive trade sanctions would draw retaliation. But trade experts said any 
sanctions are probably months away. 
</P>
<P>
 After a six-month investigation ordered by the Clinton Administration, the 
International Trade Commission found that imports of durum wheat, used in pasta 
products, have "materially interfered" with the Agriculture Department's aid to 
farmers, costing taxpayers roughly $170 million in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation followed a surge in imports of durum wheat from Canada in 
recent years. The U.S. grain lobby contends that Canada's rail subsidies enable 
that country to undercut U.S. farmers on price. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House intervention came after lawmakers from leading wheat-growing 
states extracted promises in return for their support last year of the 
then-pending North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imports have resulted in lower prices in the domestic market. These lower 
prices interfere with the wheat programs by increasing the amount the U.S. 
taxpayer must pay to farmers," Commissioner David Rohr said. 
</P>
<P>
 By offering their products at unfairly low prices, Canadian farmers have 
"compromised" the spirit of free trade between the United States and its 
largest export market and forced U.S. farmers to rely on the Agriculture 
Department at a time when the Administration is seeking less government 
intervention in the marketplace, Rohr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission members recommended that Clinton impose a tariff rate quota, which 
would penalize Canadian farmers if they export a certain metric tonnage of 
wheat, or other penalties on Canada. Three of the six panel members qualified 
their decision, however, saying U.S. action should be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding Canadian farmers to 40% of the average tonnage of wheat exported 
between 1989 and 1992 would save U.S. taxpayers $25 million a year, one 
commissioner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian officials, who contend that the biggest surge in grain exports to 
this country simply filled a shortfall created by last year's floods in the 
upper Midwest, reiterated that they will return any trade volley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make no mistake," embassy spokesman Terry Colli said. "If there is punitive 
action taken here, Canada will react." 
</P>
<P>
 But there are obstacles to any quick U.S. action, including opposition by a 
key committee in Congress that must authorize the increase in tariffs needed to 
give teeth to any quotas. 
</P>
<P>
 The threatened quotas will more likely be a sideshow to ongoing negotiations 
with Canada over its grain subsidy policies under the pending General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade, said Robert Kohlmeyer, executive vice president of World 
Perspectives Inc., a Washington-based farm trade consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the new GATT, the U.S. and Europeans agreed to (reduce their grain 
subsidies), but the Canadian system has been left intact, which gives them 
freedom to operate very freely and price grain as they see fit," Kohlmeyer 
said. "That is a much bigger issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadians have singled out wine and pasta as prime targets for 
retaliation. Canada is the top export market for U.S. wines, and more than 90% 
of the 8.9 million gallons that entered Canada from the United States last year 
came from California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're watching this very intently. We don't take it lightly," said John 
DeLuca, head of the Wine Institute in San Francisco.

MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY; BOND YIELDS REGISTER 2-YEAR HIGH ON JOB NEWS; DOW

 Treasury bond yields rocketed Friday to their highest level in nearly two 
years after a report showing strong job growth nationwide triggered renewed 
worries that the Federal Reserve Board may again hike interest rates to slow 
the economy.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar fell following suggestions from President Clinton that 
market forces, not government intervention, will resolve the greenback's 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 However, optimism about the outlook for corporate profits sent stock prices 
higher for a fifth straight day, with the Dow Jones industrial average gaining 
20.72 points to finish at 3,709.14. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond finished Friday at 7.69%, 
its highest closing yield since it hit 7.73% on Nov. 9, 1992. The long bond 
finished at 7.60% on Thursday. Its price, which moves in the opposite 
direction, dropped 29/32 point, or $9.06 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields jumped soon after the Labor Department reported that the economy 
added 379,000 jobs in June -- about 100,000 more than expected by most 
economists -- and that the unemployment rate stayed at 6% instead of edging up 
to 6.2% as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said many market participants now believe the Fed -- which completed 
a two-day policy meeting Wednesday -- will feel compelled to push up short-term 
interest rates prior to its next meeting Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "With data this strong and revisions throughout the prior months as well, it 
does show a continuing strength in the economy and inspires fear that perhaps 
the Fed hasn't slowed growth enough to contain inflation," said John Canavan, 
an analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates Inc. in Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The retreat cut across the range of Treasury maturities. Economic strength can 
spur inflation, which hurts the value of fixed-income securities. 
</P>
<P>
 But shorter-term Treasury securities were hit the hardest. They fell between 
1/4 point and 13/32 point, and intermediate maturities dropped between 19/32 
point and 7/8 point, the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The tumbling dollar, meanwhile, heightened fears that foreign investors will 
dump their holdings of dollar-denominated investments such as Treasury bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. currency closed lower against the Japanese yen and German mark after 
Clinton, in Naples, Italy, for a summit of the world's seven most economically 
powerful nations, said he was concerned about the dollar's weakness but that 
coordinated government buying efforts to support the dollar don't always 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Economic fundamentals will rescue the dollar from its tailspin, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the comments reinforced the perception that the government is 
prepared to let the dollar fall unaided, and that sent it tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar fetched 98.05 Japanese yen, down from 98.75 on 
Thursday. Against the German mark, the dollar fell to 1.563 marks, down from 
Thursday's 1.572. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, a healthy quarterly earnings report from Dow component 
Aluminum Co. of America helped push the blue chip indicator aloft. 
</P>
<P>
 But the broad range of other stocks had a mixed session as equity investors 
couldn't completely shrug off the impact of a setback in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, losers led gainers by about 6 to 5 on the New York 
Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 236.52 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market's negative reaction to June's strong employment reading 
initially rattled stock investors, but the selling moderated by midmorning. 
</P>
<P>
 For the week, the Dow industrials gained 62.49 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the stock market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Buying was selective, with investors concentrating on cyclical stocks, which 
are those of companies whose earnings directly depend on economic conditions. 
Leading the advance in cyclicals was Aluminum Co. of America, which jumped 3 
5/8 to 78 7/8 after reporting better-than-expected second-quarter earnings. 
Caterpillar rose 1 3/8 to 105 3/4 and Whirlpool rose 3/4 to 52 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nike surged 2 1/8 to 62 1/8 after it reported late Thursday 
better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
 * Diagnostek, which provides drugs by mail, tumbled 4 1/4 to 17 3/4 after it 
said late Thursday that its Arizona and New Mexico pharmacy contracts with 
Cigna Corp. will be terminated. 
</P>
<P>
 * Semiconductor stocks found buyers ahead of Monday's report on June industry 
demand. Intel rose 1 1/4 to 59 1/8, Cypress Semiconductor added 1 to 17 7/8 and 
LSI Logic closed up 1 3/8 to 28 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * J.C. Penney rose 1/2 to 49, helped by an upgrade from Kidder, Peabody.

MARKETS AND THE ECONOMY; CALIFORNIA LOSES JOBS WHILE REST OF NATION GAINS; 
EMPLOYMENT: PAYROLLS GREW BY A HEALTHY 379,000 ELSEWHERE BUT DECLINED IN THE 
STATE BY 12,100, REFLECTING ITS WOBBLY RECOVERY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Raising new concerns about the state's recovery, California began losing 
employment again last month, even as companies across the country added a 
higher-than-expected 379,000 jobs to their payrolls, the government reported 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department also said a separate employment survey shows the U.S. and 
California jobless rates remaining unchanged in June, with the nation's level 
staying at 6.0% and the state's at 8.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts, focusing mainly on the monthly payroll jobs totals, said the figures 
reflect how the national economy continues to expand smartly while the state's 
remains wobbly. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. figures "are strong numbers by any measure, with gains in almost 
every industry," said Joseph A. Wahed, chief economist for Wells Fargo Bank in 
San Francisco. But California, he noted, suffered a sizable loss of 12,100 
jobs, with declines spread across most of the state's industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Kimbell, director of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project, dismissed 
the idea that California "is relapsing into recession, but we sure aren't 
showing any momentum toward joining the other states" in economic expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's enough to make you nervous," Kimbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many analysts see little sign of inflation flaring up nationally, 
they said the robust job statistics, combined with the dollar's recent 
weakness, could put renewed pressure on the Federal Reserve Board to raise 
interest rates for the fifth time this year.  
</P>
<P>
 The Fed is not expected to move immediately -- its policy-setting committee 
signaled no intent to raise rates after holding a two-day meeting this week -- 
but analysts say an increase is increasingly likely later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the U.S. job gains came at restaurants and in other service 
industries, including many low-paying and temporary summer jobs. But the 
figures also include a 34,000 increase in factory employment, the biggest 
monthly jump in that category in more than four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's reaction to the employment reports was mixed. Apparently 
concerned by the prospects for an interest rate increase, the bond market 
sagged, lifting yields on 30-year Treasury bonds to 7.69%, from 7.60% on 
Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.72 points to close at 3,709.14, but 
losers outnumbered gainers in the broader stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials quickly tried to quell fears of inflation. 
"Our economy is coming back on its soundest footing in decades, with more jobs 
and low inflation," President Clinton told reporters at the summit of the seven 
leading industrial nations in Naples, Italy. "In fact, we are leading the 
world."  
</P>
<P>
 The nation's 379,000 gain in payroll jobs was inflated by various statistical 
and data-gathering quirks, including the use of a five-week measuring period 
rather than the usual four weeks. Even if the normal four-week period was used, 
however, the gain would have been about 300,000, economists said. That is up 
from an average of 287,000 for the first half of 1994 and a monthly average 
194,000 for all of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, average hourly wages inched downward, as did the factory 
workweek, which has hovered at historically high levels. Factory overtime was 
unchanged in June, holding on to a previous decline.  
</P>
<P>
 "Companies have finally started to cut back on overtime and hire additional 
workers," said Cynthia Latta, an economist with Lexington, Mass.-based 
DRI/McGraw-Hill. Employers are adding workers rather than continuing to 
lengthen employees' hours, because of growing confidence that business demand 
will remain strong, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The separate employment survey of U.S. households, which is used to calculate 
jobless rates, showed big declines in the number of people either working or 
looking for jobs in California and the rest of the country. But analysts 
generally discounted those statistics, attributing the plunging labor force 
figures to unresolved problems in some of the new procedures the government is 
using to gather employment data. 
</P>
<P>
 One hopeful sign from that study, however, is that the unemployment rates for 
both the nation and the state held steady after posting big declines in May. 
The U.S. jobless rate, now at a 3 1/2-year low, is down from 6.4% in April, 
while California's rate is down from 9.7% the same month. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 11 big states whose unemployment rates were reported Friday, 
California's 8.3% jobless rate remained the highest, followed by New Jersey's 
7.1%. North Carolina posted the lowest rate, at 3.7%, with Illinois coming in 
next, at 4.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 For California, the 12,100 loss in payroll jobs last month was coupled with a 
downward revision in the job totals for both April and May. All told, it left 
the state with a meager job gain of 6,200 for the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier figures suggested that California was recovering somewhat more 
robustly after losing, by one estimate, nearly 850,000 jobs from mid-1990 
through the end of last year. Kimbell said the state now seems to be moving 
"sideways," and the stimulus provided by post-earthquake rebuilding efforts in 
Southern California appear to have been minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet various economists see indications that the state economy is 
strengthening. Ted Gibson, principal economist for the California Department of 
Finance, said payroll tax revenues have risen faster than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems quite clear to us from the taxes we're collecting that things are 
much better than the employment data indicate," he said. Wahed added that his 
bank's loan demand is up, and customers report that their businesses are 
improving. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's jobless rate, which unlike the national and state figures 
is not adjusted for seasonal trends, rose to 10.1% in June from 9.7% in May. It 
is the county's highest unemployment rate since January, when the level was 
11%. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jay D. Horowitz, a labor market analyst with the California Employment 
Development Department, noted that unemployment in the county generally rises 
in June, in part because of the large number of students looking for summer 
jobs. In fact, he said, the rise in joblessness last month was comparatively 
small. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures showed the number of employed falling 17,000 to 3,994,000, while 
the number of unemployed people rose 16,000 to 448,000.

BUILDING A FOLLOWING; ROLE OF SERVICE IS HAMMERED HOME AT HOMEBASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ila Bramhall knows what she likes -- and the service she'd been getting at her 
neighborhood HomeBase store just wasn't it. 
</P>
<P>
 She could never find what she wanted, and employees were of little assistance. 
Said the Tustin resident: "I used to get so mad at the salespeople that I'd 
walk out." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Bramhall walked out of the do-it-yourself store on Barranca Avenue in 
Irvine recently, she had a $75 purchase in hand and a whole new attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened," Bramhall said, "but everyone in that store 
helped me." 
</P>
<P>
 The warm reception she got is part of the new hospitality at the Irvine-based 
home improvement chain. HomeBase is recognizing that, in an increasingly 
competitive field, low price and wide selection aren't enough to satisfy 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Service is king these days," said Terry McEvoy, an analyst who follows the 
home improvement industry for the brokerage Janney Montgomery Scott. "And 
you've got to have guys in the store who can help," he said, because most 
do-it-yourself shoppers "are basically unskilled laborers." 
</P>
<P>
 HomeBase's major competitor, Atlanta-based Home Depot, has long balanced 
price, selection and service. And San Jose-based Orchard Supply Hardware, a 
45-location home improvement chain based in Northern California, recently 
brought its reputation for high-quality service to the competitive 
do-it-yourself market in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Sherman, who joined HomeBase as president in September, acknowledged in 
an interview that experiences like Bramhall's were once all too common at the 
chain.  
</P>
<P>
 "We knew customers recognized us for price and selection," Sherman said. "What 
we didn't give was service." 
</P>
<P>
 "The customer is dictating that service be an integral part of the total 
(sales) equation," said Sherman, most recently an executive with Waban Inc., 
HomeBase's Natick, Mass.-based parent. "I think the so-called category killers 
in consumer electronics -- Circuit City and the like -- are showing how it can 
be done with experienced salespeople." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to bolstering service, HomeBase is completing a costly 
restructuring that will include the closing or relocation of 24 stores that 
were too small, too old or too far away from the chain's stronghold in 
California, where 31 of its 81 remaining stores are located. 
</P>
<P>
 HomeBase is abandoning an ill-fated bid to become a national chain and is 
putting renewed energy into its operations in the West. (Waban reported a 
$101-million pretax charge in connection with that restructuring at its 
subsidiary.) 
</P>
<P>
 Waban executives are optimistic that the restructuring is working: Operating 
income at the 67 HomeBases to remain open after restructuring rose to $11.8 
million for the quarter ended April 30, up from $8.4 million for the same 
period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers suggest that HomeBase's failure to recognize earlier the importance 
of customer service was in part a result of its history as a membership club. 
Up until just two years ago, the chain was known as HomeClub, and its customer 
base was mostly contractors whose main concern was low prices on bulk 
purchases, plus convenient hours and fast check-out lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, three-fourths of HomeBase's customers are do-it-yourselfers like 
Bramhall, who typically need guidance to tackle leaky faucets, broken hinges 
and worn-out electrical fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman is encouraging employees to steer customers to the licensed 
contractors, plumbers and interior designers who are now on site at HomeBase 
stores. Employee counts at the stores, which had ranged from 80 to 170, have 
risen to 120 to 250. 
</P>
<P>
 Because builders have different needs than those of weekend warriors -- pros, 
for example, often buy top-of-the-line power tools or lumber by the truckload 
-- HomeBase has dramatically increased the number of items it stocks to 25,000, 
up from 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some industry insiders question whether warehouse-style operators can 
make good on their pledge of lower prices and increased service. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have a big store with service," said Bill Griffin, 52, who has been 
selling hardware at Griffin Ace Hardware in Santa Ana since he was 12. "But you 
can't have the same pricing, because service costs money. I think people know 
what they're going to get, and they'll be disenchanted with promises of 
service."

 Probe Sought on Coffee Price Hikes: The New York State Consumer Protection 
Board has asked the Justice Department to investigate the recent retail hikes 
amid steep jumps in futures prices for coffee that will not reach consumers for 
months. The agency said in a statement that the increases in consumer prices 
are unwarranted because the currently surging price of raw coffee should be 
reflected later, not now. Prices for green, unroasted coffee beans soared to 
eight-year highs recently, topping $2 a pound, after frosts in Brazil's 
coffee-growing regions damaged vast amounts of next year's crop.

 Macy Delays Decision on Merger Offer: R.H. Macy & Co.'s board postponed action 
on the offer from Cincinnati-based Federated Department Stores and reiterated 
its intention to operate as an independent company. Macy, which is reorganizing 
under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, said it continues to be concerned about 
the possibility of antitrust sanctions if a merger develops.Macy and Federated, 
which operates the Bloomingdale's chain, have retail operations in a number of 
the same cities, including New York. In addition, some Macy bondholders 
continue to favor a reorganization plan under which Macy would remain 
independent. If Federated addresses concerns and submits a proposal before July 
22, Macy said, it will consider the offer. Macy's holdings include the Macy's, 
Bullock's and I. Magnin chains.

PEOPLE: BENNETT QUITS JOB AS CHIEF OF CIRCUS CIRCUS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 William Bennett, one of the two entrepreneurs who built Circus Circus 
Enterprises Inc. into a Las Vegas casino powerhouse, resigned Friday amid 
rumors about the company's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Circus Circus Chief Financial Officer Dan Copp said Bennett's resignation was 
voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, 69, was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said Chief Executive Clyde Turner would assume the additional post 
of chairman. Turner was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a Wall Street darling among casino companies, Circus Circus began to lose 
its luster early this year when earnings declined for the first time since it 
sold shares to the public in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 However, its stock has risen in recent days after rival gaming company Bally 
Entertainment said it was seeking to acquire 25% of Circus Circus stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, who managed the Nevada operations of home builder Del Webb Corp. for 
five years before entering the casino industry, and William Pennington, a slot 
machine vendor, bought Circus Circus in 1974 when it was a run-down hotel. The 
two turned the operation around and used it to become one of the giants of the 
gaming industry by catering to middle America with low-cost, no-frills hotels 
and casinos as well as family-oriented fun. Pennington retired in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Circus Circus went public in October, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's properties include the original Circus Circus Las Vegas 
casino-hotel; Excalibur, a 4,000-room hotel and casino opened in 1990; Luxor, 
an Egyptian pyramid-themed hotel and casino, and properties in Reno and 
Laughlin, Nev.

THE SCRABBLE SCRAMBLE; LEISURE: HASBRO UPS ANTE BY 10% IN EFFORT TO OUTBID 
MATTEL FOR OVERSEAS RIGHTS TO SELL THE BOARD GAME.

<P>
 U.S. game maker Hasbro Inc. upped the ante Friday in its bid for a worldwide 
monopoly to sell the board game Scrabble. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro, which owns U.S. rights to the game, offered to pay 10% more than El 
Segundo-based Mattel Inc. has already bid for J.W. Spear & Sons, a British 
company with the rights to sell Scrabble outside North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro bid $16.50 per share for the 73.3% of J.W. Spear that it does not 
already own, valuing the takeover target at $86 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattel had previously bid $15.40 per share and later scored a legal victory 
when a court rejected Hasbro's claim that the Mattel offer was invalid. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro had contended the Mattel bid came too late to meet a deadline agreed 
upon with major J.W. Spear shareholders for accepting an earlier Hasbro offer 
of $13.50 per share. A judge sided with Mattel and shareholders who said the 
higher offer was made with minutes to spare. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether Mattel would step in with a higher bid or give up the 
battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only say we are considering our options at this point," said Glenn 
Bozarth, a spokesman at Mattel's headquarters. The company has until Aug. 5 to 
make up its mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro owns U.S. and Canadian distribution rights to Scrabble but wants to own 
all rights to sell the game, which is booming in new markets such as Eastern 
Europe and Turkey. The Pawtucket, R.I., company already owns 26.7% of J.W. 
Spear, based in the London suburb of Enfield, and through subsidiaries owns a 
number of other popular games, including Monopoly. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattel earns most of its money from Barbie dolls, miniature cars, Disney toys 
and Fisher-Price toys for small children, but it wants to expand its business. 
The company is not yet big in board games and says Scrabble would be a logical 
fit with its vast international distribution network. 
</P>
<P>
 J.W. Spear is reviewing the latest offer, but a spokesman said the company's 
directors will not immediately make any recommendations on whether shareholders 
should accept it -- in hopes that the bidding could soon go higher.

midst of a deep downturn, said it will close two plants in Albuquerque, N.M., 
and Chihuahua, Mexico, and lay off more than 1,000 employees. The Albuquerque 
plant, with about 440 employees, performs assembly, testing and integration of 
computer systems, as well as order consolidation and shipping.The Chihuahua 
plant employs about 630 people doing assembly and testing of computer modules. 
The company said it will eliminate the jobs over the next six months. Last May 
it announced plans to cut 20,000 more workers from its staff of 80,000. The 
announcement comes after the Maynard, Mass.-based computer maker, the nation's 
third-largest, racked up losses of more than $3 billion.

 Irvine Apartment Communities, the real estate investment trust formed by the 
Irvine Co., said Friday that it has bought two parcels of land in Irvine for 
$9.1 million and plans to build two apartment complexes on the properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The REIT plans to build a 513-unit apartment building called Villa Coronado at 
Harvard Avenue and Main Street and a 368-unit building called Santa Rosa at 
Culver Drive and Barranca Parkway on the land purchased from the Irvine Co.The 
REIT paid $5.8 million for the Villa Coronado site and $3.3 million for the 
Santa Rosa site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased by the continued strength of the market and very encouraged by 
the recent job growth in Orange County, which will result in an increased 
demand for rental housing," said Patrick Smith, president of the REIT. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it plans to buy three more sites this year to build a total 
of 1,320 apartments. A $150-million construction loan will pay for the 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Apartment Communities, based in Newport Beach, was formed last year 
when Irvine Co. spun off its apartment properties in a $200-million stock 
offering to the public. It now owns 43 apartment projects in Irvine.

 AT&T Awarded Telecom License in Britain: The company said it has been awarded 
the license to offer telecommunications, giving it more freedom to fight back 
against the joined forces of British Telecom and MCI.However, the long-distance 
firm cautioned that it must still go through a 28-day public consultation 
process. That process could reveal important details regarding just how far the 
British government will go in assuring an even playing field. Even if AT&T gets 
full access to the British market, it will be handicapped by its need to use 
existing networks of competitors such as British Telecom. Executives say the 
British market is already crowded with players.

 Intel, Japanese Firm to End Pact: Intel Corp. and Nippon Steel Semiconductor 
Corp. said they will end their flash memory chip manufacturing agreement in 
1995.Nippon Steel Semiconductor has been manufacturing flash chips for Intel 
since 1991. The termination of the agreement between the two companies comes as 
Intel looks to build flash chips based on more advanced technologies. Flash 
chips, used primarily in portable devices, retain data even after their power 
is shut off. Nippon will continue to manufacture Intel flash products in 
decreasing volume over the next year while converting capacity to produce 
dynamic random access memory chips, the companies said.

'LOLLAPALOOZA': A SMASHING START; SMASHING PUMPKINS ANCHORS THE BILL OF 
ALTERNATIVE ROCKERS THAT PLEASED, PUZZLED AND 'PALOOZED A HOT VEGAS CROWD ON 
THE OPENING STOP OF THE 31-CITY TOUR.; THE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in its four-year history, this summer's "Lollapalooza" tour 
is saving its best for last. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing support bands overshadow the headliners in past extravaganzas, 
the top-billed Smashing Pumpkins defied the odds here Thursday with an 
assurance and drama that even Vegas casino high-rollers would admire. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opening stop of a 31-city tour that reaches Southern California in 
September, the Pumpkins -- led by singer-guitarist Billy Corgan -- played with 
a spellbinding urgency that far surpassed everything else on the nine-hour 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pumpkins' accomplishment was all the more compelling because the Chicago 
quartet -- whose expressions of youthful melancholia and desire combine beauty 
and force with a sometimes "Layla"-like grace and reach -- wasn't just 
competing against seven other acts at the Sam Boyd Silver Bowl stadium. It also 
competed against the ghost of Nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest challenge facing any concert tour is the idea of "what might have 
been." 
</P>
<P>
 And that challenge hovered over "Lollapalooza '94" because Nirvana, the 
most-acclaimed rock group of the '90s, had been scheduled to headline the 
annual summer showcase of alternative rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Smashing Pumpkins, one of Nirvana's two or three chief rivals, was to have 
been the support band that preceded it on stage each night. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cobain's suicide in April eliminated the chance to see how these two great 
young bands would respond to playing back-to-back -- whether the competition 
would push both to new heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Nirvana, the prospects for "Lollapalooza '94" went from a historic 
matchup to simply a solid lineup -- one that also ranged from rap 'n' rollers 
the Beastie Boys to funk legend George Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobain's loss was felt at the box office and in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales have been robust on most "Lollapalooza '94" stops around the country, 
including Cal State Dominguez Hills' Festival Field, where the tour comes Sept. 
4 and 5. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thursday was "Lollapalooza's" first trip to this desert city and the 
package apparently needed a stronger name -- a Nirvana or Pearl Jam -- to lure 
fans to an outdoor show in the blistering heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than half of the available 22,000 tickets were sold in advance and the 
walk-up Thursday appeared slight. Nirvana would have meant an extra 6,000 
sales, one insider speculated. 
</P>
<P>
 Though none of the musicians mentioned Cobain on stage, it was on the minds of 
some backstage and some members of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 30 minutes after the stadium gates were opened at 11 a.m., a song was 
dedicated to Cobain by a performer in the "open mike" tent set aside for 
budding spoken-word artists and acoustic songwriters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a pied piper," Andy Hall, 21, sang, delivering a cynical tale about pop 
stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked afterward if he thought Cobain's death took some of the wind out of the 
concert, he said, "Sure, we still feel his loss. You don't get over something 
like that quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Another fan in the tent agreed: "He'll be remembered the same way Jimi 
Hendrix, Janis Joplin and Otis Redding are remembered." 
</P>
<P>
 All this mourning for Cobain put added pressure Thursday on the Smashing 
Pumpkins, who moved into the headline slot after Nirvana dropped off. 
</P>
<P>
 Would some underdog emerge from the pack to overshadow the Pumpkins -- the way 
Nine Inch Nails did in 1991 (upstaging Jane's Addiction), Ministry in 1992 
(over the Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Rage Against the Machine last year (over 
Alice in Chains and Primus)? 
</P>
<P>
 The music on the main stage began at 1 p.m. with the Boredoms, a band from 
Japan that uses aggressive vocal punctuation as a distinguishing element. That 
experimental edge asks a lot of an audience -- more than the sun-drenched fans 
were willing to give on a day when the temperature on the artificial turf in 
front of the stage was estimated at 110 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of the early hours of the festival, fans seemed more concerned with 
putting on sunscreen and walking through the cooling Mist Tents than watching 
bands or exploring the dazzling array of high-tech, interactive devices on 
display near the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 L7, the Los Angeles quartet, played its likable brand of straight-ahead rock, 
but was largely anonymous in the stadium setting. The Breeders, a more original 
and inviting foursome, also had trouble establishing a rapport. 
</P>
<P>
 A Tribe Called Quest, pioneers of the growing jazz-rap fusion, delivered a 
respectable set, though it too was relatively faceless. 
</P>
<P>
 No way to miss George Clinton and his crew, who gave a lively crash course in 
funk dynamics and costuming (one male guitarist wore a wedding dress, while a 
second wore only a large diaper). 
</P>
<P>
 The Beastie Boys, who preceded the Pumpkins on stage, unleashed a glorious 
assault built around beats that hit fast and hard, backed by disarming 
street-wise raps that keep pace quite remarkably. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the three Beasties still haven't developed much of a stage presence, 
except for the bouncing-ball energy associated with rap since the early days of 
Run-DMC. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the support acts, however, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds emerged with the 
most riveting performance because Australian native Cave's Southern Gothic rock 
vision offered the day's most radical twist.  
</P>
<P>
 Though Cave has been a critical favorite for years, he still seemed largely a 
stranger to most of the young audience. Fans gazed uncertainly at the fire and 
brimstone of his stark and flailing manner.  
</P>
<P>
 There was no such uncertainty when the Pumpkins took the stage around 9 p.m. 
As the crowd on the field surged forward, Corgan stepped confidently to the 
microphone and played with the obsession and command of rock's most charismatic 
stars.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year at the Palladium in Hollywood, Corgan was clearly a major talent, 
but there was a hesitancy in his manner -- as if he was either not secure about 
his own skills or uncertain about his emerging leadership role in rock.  
</P>
<P>
 No such doubts now. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the talk about the "Lollapalooza" concept being more important to rock 
audiences than the individual bands on the bill, it is the magic of a great 
presentation that you remember most each summer. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, the Pumpkins should fuel those memories.

JAZZ REVIEW; BOWL 'GUITAR GREATS' INVOKE JOE PASS, WES MONTGOMERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The principal players were not all on stage for Wednesday night's "Guitar 
Greats" concert at the Hollywood Bowl. Mundell Lowe, Lee Ritenour and George 
Benson did the performing, but the images and the echoes of Joe Pass and Wes 
Montgomery were equally present. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowe appeared in place of Pass, who died after the program was scheduled. It 
was an appropriate replacement. Lowe's straight- ahead playing clearly springs 
from the same origins as Pass' benchmark jazz style. On standards such as "Body 
and Soul," "Alone Together" and a laid-back 3/4 version of "The Way You Look 
Tonight" (with a stellar piano solo from Bill Cunliffe), Lowe kept the flame of 
mainstream jazz guitar burning brightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Ritenour and Benson had Montgomery on their minds. Using octave passages -- a 
Montgomery trademark -- with great profusion, Ritenour's readings of "Boss 
City," "Goin' On to Detroit" and his own "Wes Bound" managed to recall 
Montgomery without sacrificing Ritenour's own identity. Yet, good as he was, 
Ritenour too often seemed to step back from the edge of more extended 
creativity in favor of easy riffing. One suspects he could be a much better 
player if he put aside technique and style, and allowed the music to come 
through on its own terms. Saxophonist Ernie Watts and drummer Harvey Mason 
provided powerful support, with Watts generating some startlingly avant-garde 
honks and squeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Benson was similarly reliant upon the familiar Montgomery octave-method. But 
he also -- for at least a few tunes -- played with a fire and fury rarely heard 
since he became a pop star. His solo on "Caravan," for example, revealed that 
he has both the technical capacity and the innovative imagination to be an 
important force in contemporary jazz. But most of the balance of his set was 
devoted to brief, easy-rocking renditions of the soul-based music he has 
concentrated on since the late '70s. DON HECKMAN

'LITTLE BIG LEAGUE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a teacher and moviegoer, I feel that Times staff writer Peter Rainer missed 
the point of the movie "Little Big League" ("And a Little Child Shall Manage 
Them," June 29). Managing is really controlling adults, which is a child's 
ultimate fantasy.By the end of the film, Billy gains the respect of those 
around him, marking the realization of another fantasy of children and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 As an educator and an aunt to young children, I could not ask for more -- a 
film devoid of gratuitous sex and senseless violence. How many films can be 
enjoyed by both children and their grandparents? In the violent world that we 
witness daily on our TV screens, I find "Little Big League" a welcome refuge.

CHILDREN, VIOLENCE AND 'THE LION KING' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am constantly amused by the word from on high from psychologists regarding 
what does and does not upset children. My 10-year-old twins loved "The Lion 
King."After the discussions they have had among their friends about the 
Menendez brothers blowing their parents away and whether O. J. Simpson did or 
did not slash his ex-wife's throat and stab Ronald Goldman, seeing a cartoon 
lion killed is tame stuff indeed. "Lion King Too Violent for Little Viewers?" 
(July 2): No. Is real life too violent for little viewers? Yes. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Carroll Lachnit's article about the degree of violence in Disney's "The Lion 
King" is quite distressing. Children are not adults and should not be expected 
to ". . . give shape to their inner conflicts. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 How absurd it would be to ask a 4-year-old to carry a sack of cement, or an 
8-year-old to do the family shopping. Why then do we ask these same children to 
view and deal with the violence of the adult world in the guise of 
entertainment? The old adage "There is a time and place for everything" applies 
to the needless exposure of our children to media and entertainment violence. 
</P>
<P>
 It is by far a better course to allow our children to grow with positive, 
nonviolent stories, movies and television. From a foundation of a positive 
world view they will learn to deal with the occasional violence that will 
actually occur in their adult world.

TV REVIEW; 'NEW LIGHT' ON AIDS AN AMBITIOUS SPECIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You have to cheer ABC for turning over two hours of prime time for the 
ambitious, often sexually explicit "In a New Light '94," the third annual 
entertainment and information special on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, given the show's report that half of all AIDS cases hit 
youths from ages 15 to 24, you can only decry the Saturday night time slot when 
many young people might be out of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 AIDS "has become the background of our life," says host Barbara Walters. Yet, 
she says, "we have seen an apathy growing, amazingly of boredom, with the 
discussion of AIDS itself." 
</P>
<P>
 This production replaces apathy with passion, musical and otherwise, and is 
alertly edited, cutting between incisive facts and entertainment. A major theme 
of "In a New Light" -- directed by Lauren Harris and written by Danny Lemos, 
producer Joseph F. Lovett and Madalyn Minch -- is condom safety. In one lively 
scene, Youthwave, a group of HIV-positive young adults, demonstrates how to 
apply a latex condom, as wide-eyed students in a high school auditorium look 
on.  
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the program, there is great music with performances from, among 
others, country singers Clint Black and Kathy Mattea, jazz great Jimmy Scott, 
Lou Reed, Lisa Minnelli, Chaka Khan, Gloria Estefan, Michael Feinstein. The 
Seattle-based rock band Rumors of the Big Wave performs a ribald, safe-sex 
number, "Love Glove," and closes the program with the stirring "I Choose Life," 
during which celebrities call out the names of loved ones who have died of 
AIDS-related illnesses. Rather than arch sentimentality, it works dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal commentaries from, among others, Rosie Perez, Bill Cosby, Whoopi 
Goldberg, Gregory Hines, Susan Lucci, Bebe Neuwirth and Dr. Ruth Westheimer are 
illuminating, incisive and often funny. Singer Lou Reed candidly says, "I 
believe trying to set your life in order is a very good thing to do. I'm not 
here because I'm smart. I'm here because I'm lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 What lingers are the courageous portraits, none more touching than the profile 
of the late Broadway conductor James Raitt, taped shortly before his death last 
April and emotionally riveting in its depiction of an ebullient Raitt 
expressing the powerful effect of attitude during rehearsals for Broadway's 
"Damn Yankees." 
</P>
<P>
 One AIDS survivor in Gotham, Peter Jablonski, displays a Rolodex half-filled 
with cards of his dead friends. Spiritually dead, he's given a new lease on 
life by the love and grace of heterosexual friends who ask him to help raise 
their young son. Carrying the little boy around New York on his shoulders, the 
ghost of Jablonski rises from the ash heap. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible to lose everything and everyone you love," he says, "and still 
go on and have a wonderful life." * "In a New Light '94" airs at 8 tonight on 
ABC Channel 7. RAY LOYND

TV REVIEW; 'MUDDLING THROUGH' DRIVES INTO TOO MANY POTHOLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Muddling Through" is about a trashy woman who returns to her rural 
cafe/motel/service station after a three-year jail stint for shooting up her 
philandering husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Bring on the low jinks.The CBS comedy, which didn't make the fall schedule, 
sputters through tonight's premiere mostly on empty, its crush of bogglingly 
bad jokes all but eclipsing its occasional darts of stinging dark wit and 
Stephanie Hodge's energy and good comic timing as twangy parolee Connie Drego. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to Drego's Oasis, Connie discovers that her 18-year-old daughter, 
Madeline (Jennifer Aniston), has married Trooper Cooper (Scott Waara), the 
idiot cop whose testimony sent her to prison, and that her 16-year-old 
daughter, Kerri (Aimee Brooks), is living wildly and dressing like a hooker. 
</P>
<P>
 Caustic Connie to Kerri: "I did not bust out, why is yours?" Obviously, 
"Muddling Through" is not the mother's milk of creativity. And the hicksville 
humor intensifies when Connie finds that two-timing Sonny Drego (D. David 
Morin), the "dirt with a driver's license" whose buttocks she almost shot off 
three years ago, is living on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, this family is dysfunctional. And, despite the ear-splitting din of 
studio audience laughter that greets every one-liner, so is the comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Muddling Through" airs at 9 tonight on CBS Channel 2. HOWARD ROSENBERG

TRENDS; NEW TECHNOLOGY ON MACHINES AND SERGERS MAKES SEWING FASTER AND EASIER. 
SO GO BACK TO SPOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home sewing has gone high-tech. A new generation of machines has tiny computer 
screens, track balls and interchangeable pro grams. They can switch from 
straight stitch to buttonholes to fancy embroidery without complicated 
attachments. Then there's the serger, a smaller machine that uses up to five 
cone-shaped spools of thread at once.  
</P>
<P>
 Sound intimidating? Perhaps. But those who have made the leap to computerized 
machines and sergers say sewing has never been easier or more exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 Such enthusiasm for the new machines is a godsend for the home-sewing 
industry, which has suffered from lax sales and declining consumer interest 
since the 1970s. But now the American Home Sewing & Craft Assn. is preparing to 
revamp sewing's homespun image -- actress/model Lauren Hutton has been hired as 
national spokeswoman -- and attract new recruits. A particular emphasis will be 
placed on home decor, because pillows, drapes and bed fashions are easy 
projects for beginners and make the coveted "designer look" affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 So what are these new machines, and why should those with little time to sew 
be excited about them? 
</P>
<P>
 First, there's the serger, which sews seams at 1,500 stitches per minute, 
trims off excess fabric and finishes raw edges all in one pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergers have been around for more than 40 years in commercial sewing 
operations, but scaled-down versions for the home were developed within the 
past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to sewing faster, the serger makes a stronger seam than 
conventional sewing machines. Its system of needles and loopers forms a network 
of interlocking stitches that extend over the edge of the seam, which is why 
the serger is sometimes called an overlock machine.  
</P>
<P>
 A similar seam sewn on top of the fabric is called a flatlock, commonly seen 
on T-shirts, sweat shirts and exercise wear. Slow to catch on, the serger is 
now considered indispensable by many home-sewing enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I use mine constantly," said Sherri Wolf, who teaches home-decorating sewing 
at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo. "It's 10 times faster and makes things 
so much easier. Once you own one, you'll sew more," said Wolf, who is making 
drapes for her home almost exclusively on a serger. "I would have never 
attempted this without it." 
</P>
<P>
 For everyone who has wrestled with keeping even one spool of thread and one 
bobbin operating in concert, the serger with its four to five spools of thread 
can seem daunting.  
</P>
<P>
 Although an experienced seamstress, Wolf admits to being intimidated at first 
by the serger's multiple threads and complicated appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "But once I got started on it, I couldn't live without it. The serger makes 
sewing so much easier that I can take on twice as many projects," said Wolf, 
who also teaches a course in overcoming serger phobia at Piecemakers Country 
Store in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Her simple approach has helped numerous serger owners understand the machine's 
threading and tension process. "It's a matter of knowing where each thread goes 
and what its purpose is in creating the seam," Wolf said. "A simple rule of 
thumb when adjusting tension is to tighten what appears too loose and loosen 
what appears too tight. Everyone catches on with a little practice and 
understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Using a serger, you can sew a ruffled pillow sham in minutes because the 
serger's ruffling attachment will gather the fabric evenly as you sew, attach 
the ruffle and finish the seam all at once. The same process is used for sewing 
bed ruffles and valances. 
</P>
<P>
 Another home-decorating advantage is the serger's ability to sew a wider range 
of fabrics, including drapery sheers and medium-weight upholstery materials. In 
fact, the machine's narrow, rolled-edge stitch is often used to give ruffled 
curtain sheers the delicate, billowy appearance of custom-sewn draperies. Use 
of the serger's differential feed option allows the user to sew straight and 
even stitches on lightweight fabrics with no puckering. 
</P>
<P>
 However amazing the serger may seem, it can't do it all. For example, it 
doesn't do buttonholes or zippers. Sergers were designed to be used in tandem 
with conventional sewing machines, in which there are also many new 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional sewing machine stitches are made by a mechanical cam linked to the 
sewing machine needle. Most are capable of only 40 kinds of stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 In computerized machines, the cam is replaced by a tiny computer chip, 
allowing a wider variety of stitch options and, in some machines, memory 
storage for custom-designed stitches. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-of-the-art Bernina 1630 computerized machine, for example, contains 
five pre-programmed alphabets, motifs and decorative borders that can be 
embroidered onto clothing and table and bed linens at the touch of a few 
buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who want to design their own embellishments, the machine will allow 
you to "sketch" the stitch on its display screen using the machine's track 
ball, a process similar to drawing on a computer screen using a mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many computerized machines will eventually allow users to do just 
that. Manufacturers are devising ways to link sewing machines to the home PC, 
allowing users to scan in or draw a design to be stitched on the machine. 
Custom-designed stitches can be stored in the machine's memory.  
</P>
<P>
 "The computerized machines are more expensive, but they are easy to use and 
provide many options," said Steve Ferris, a mechanical engineer and owner of 
Capistrano Sewing Machine and Vacuum Co. in San Juan Capistrano. "They also 
have a direct current motor, which allows you to work on thicker fabrics, even 
at low speeds." 
</P>
<P>
 Most computerized machines come with an electronic sensor device that tells 
the user when the bobbin is running low. Another sensor automatically adjusts 
tension according to fabric and stitch selection. A user-friendly tutorial 
appears on the machine's display screen to inform the user how to use the 
machine's features. It also indicates which presser foot to use according to 
the stitch selected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The computerized machines give the user a chance to be creative in a way 
that's not possible on a regular machine," Ferris said. "People tend to 
rediscover sewing when they learn what their new machine is capable of." 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude is precisely what the Home Sewing & Craft Assn. is hoping will 
bring new energy to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether you sew occasionally or often, you will probably enjoy checking out 
the new machines. It's likely you'll see machines with features you never 
dreamed of, especially if you purchased your current machine 10 or more years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 While sewing ultimately is still the process of attaching pieces of fabric one 
to another, the machines to do it have changed dramatically. Basic Machine 
Stitch 
</P>
<P>
 Seam sewn by conventional sewing machine using two threads, one top and one 
bottom, that interlock at even intervals. Edge is left unfinished. All-purpose 
stitch used on cottons and other fabrics that dont unravel easily. Serger 
Safety Stitch 
</P>
<P>
 Four-thread seam sewn by a serger. The top row of stitching overlocks the 
unfinished edge on both sides of the fabric. A separate row of stitching runs 
underneath, forming a stable, lightweight seam. Often used on woven fabrics, 
such as woolens. Serger Mock Safety Stitch 
</P>
<P>
 Variation of a four-thread safety stitch. The fabric edge is overlocked on 
both sides, and a safety stitch runs down the middle of the seam, instead of 
below it. Allows the fabric to stretch while providing additional stability. 
Used primarily on knits. Sewing Machines

Times Buying Tips 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some things to consider when shopping for a serger or computerized 
sewing machine: 
</P>
<P>
 * Shop around: Don't assume that the manufacturer of your old-reliable sewing 
machine also makes a quality serger or computerized machine. Try out several 
brands and ask knowledgeable friends which they prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Price: Expect to pay $500 to $1,500 for a quality serger. Computerized 
sewing machines run $1,000 to $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trade-ins: Many people buy less-expensive machines and then trade up to 
high-end models when their needs and skills advance. Many dealers accept 
trade-ins as credit toward a new machine. Used models are often available at 
one-third to one-half off. 
</P>
<P>
 * Try it yourself: Bring samples of fabrics you like to work with and ask to 
sew them yourself on the machine you are considering. Be sure to get a thorough 
demonstration of the machine. 
</P>
<P>
 * What to look for: Machines vary according to quality of stitch and ease of 
use. Sample all of the machine's features and make notes for comparison among 
models. Pick one that makes an even, attractive stitch and is relatively simple 
to use. 
</P>
<P>
 * Number of threads: Sergers utilizing up to four threads are fine for 
beginning to advanced users. Five-thread machines may be overkill, except for 
specific purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lessons: Many dealers include lessons on your new machine in the purchase 
price. Classes can save hours of frustration and help you get the most out of 
your investment. 
</P>
<P>
 * In-house repairs: Dealers who service machines in-house instead of shipping 
them out for repairs are usually the most knowledgeable, and, should you have a 
problem, repairs can often be done quickly. PUBLICATIONS

GARDENING; MULCH ADO ABOUT SOMETHING; ORGANIC, INORGANIC LAYERS CURB WEEDS, 
KEEP SOIL MOIST IN SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 When plants cry out for help in the hot, dry days of summer, give them a 
change of climate; give them mulch. Placing a layer of organic or inorganic 
material on top of your soil helps protect them from the heat and dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mulching modifies the climate for your plants, which is especially helpful in 
the heat of summer," says John Kabashima, environmental horticulture adviser 
for the University of California Cooperative Extension at the South Coast 
Research and Extension Center in Irvine.  
</P>
<P>
 "Plants are like humans," says Kabashima. "Drastic changes in temperature 
stress them. Mulch acts as an insulator, ensuring that the soil doesn't heat 
and cool as quickly as outside temperatures." 
</P>
<P>
 When we apply mulch around our plants on the soil's surface, such as bark 
chips, bagged mulch mixes, peat moss and compost, we are simulating what occurs 
in nature. In the forest, the ground is littered with fallen vegetation that 
insulates the trees and other plants.  
</P>

 Not only does mulch prevent plants from experiencing temperature fluctuations, 
it also increases water penetration and keeps the soil moist, which conserves a 
substantial amount of water. Experts say that there is a 50% to 60% reduction 
in water usage when mulch is used.  
</P>
<P>
 Mulch also prevents erosion, and organic mulches will improve the soil. "The 
minerals and organic matter gradually released from decaying mulch enrich 
deficient soils, replacing nutrients taken up by roots as plants grow, and 
often enhancing earthworm populations, which have something to feed on," says 
Kabashima.  
</P>
<P>
 As many gardeners know, lots of earthworms mean healthy soil.  
</P>
<P>
 Robert Browning, an English gardener in Villa Park, has been mulching his 
large garden for the last 35 years, and says he has lots of earthworms.  
</P>
<P>
 "'I've been gardening this soil for a long time, and I've finally converted 
the adobe clay to soil through mulching and digging in compost," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 For mulch Browning uses homemade compost or horse manure that has been 
composted for a few months. He routinely places mulch on his eight raised beds, 
where he grows a variety of vegetables throughout the year.  
</P>
<P>
 One use of mulch that delights most gardeners, including Browning, is to 
suppress weeds. The layer of mulch, if thick enough, blocks sunlight, which 
many seeds require to germinate, and all plants need to grow.  
</P>
<P>
 There are two main categories of mulches: plant-derived organic types and 
inorganic mulches. While both types keep soil temperatures stable, conserve 
water and prevent erosion, only organic mulch improves the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before choosing a mulch, determine your purpose for using it," says 
Kabashima. "If just keeping weeds under control is your desire, an inorganic 
mulch, like black plastic, works the best. But if you also want to improve the 
soil texture or properties, you need to use an organic mulch," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 Also consider aesthetics when making a decision. Some mulches, such as bark 
chips, are much more attractive than something like shredded newspapers.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most important thing to consider is availability. The easier it is 
to get the mulch, the more likely you are to use it.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the most widely available sources of mulch are grass clippings and 
leaves, but keep a few things in mind about this type of mulch. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some gardeners lay their fresh grass clippings around plants, 
Kabashima warns against doing this until the grass has been aged.  
</P>
<P>
 "New, green grass clippings will actually form an impenetrable layer that the 
water has a difficult time getting through," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 The one place experts suggest leaving fresh grass clippings is the lawn. A 
thin layer of clippings left on the lawn after mowing will return nitrogen to 
the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that organic mulches attract decaying-vegetation lovers such as 
earwigs, sow bugs and snails. If not properly composted, some mulches may also 
contain weed seed, which may germinate.  
</P>
<P>
 Make sure yard-clipping mulch is weed free by composting it for a sufficient 
amount of time, says Paul Rogers, director of horticulture research with 
Kellogg Supply Inc., a Carson-based manufacturer of fertilizers and nursery 
supplies. "To kill off potential weed seeds, the compost must heat to 130 
degrees," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 If you get your mulch from packaged products, make sure that they say 
composted on the label. 
</P>
<P>
 "With some products, such as bark, there are no problems with weeds," Rogers 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some gardeners are concerned that organic mulches can rob nitrogen from the 
soil as they decompose. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say it generally isn't a problem unless the organic material is 
actually mixed into the soil rather than used as a mulch on the surface. Those 
concerned about nitrogen loss can try supplementing with a nitrogen fertilizer 
when mulching. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are conflicting opinions on whether to put mulch directly around the 
base of plants. The concern is that moisture at the trunk will promote crown 
diseases and encourage pests such as sow bugs and snails. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts say you can mulch at the base of plants, if the mulch isn't 
excessively moist, while others suggest playing it safe and leaving some space 
between the plant and mulch.  
</P>
<P>
 Some organic mulches contain naturally occurring toxic compounds 
(allelochemicals) that may damage young plants. Full composting of materials 
will usually solve this problem.  
</P>
<P>
 Mulch should be applied anywhere from one to three inches thick; on the deeper 
end for weed control.  
</P>
<P>
 "Avoid applying a really thick layer of mulch, because there won't be enough 
exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen between the ground and the air, and the 
plant could be smothered," says Rogers.  
</P>
<P>
 It's important to regularly replace your mulch, as organic mulches break down 
and are incorporated into the soil, and inorganic mulches suffer from wear and 
tear.

REPAIRS; ONE LEAK DOESN'T CALL FOR A NEW HOSE, WHETHER IT'S RUBBER OR PLASTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With simple care and easy repairs, your garden hose will last a long time. 
Care basics 
</P>
<P>
 Don't leave a hose lying on the ground between jobs. Drain it and, unless it's 
on a reel or wall mount, coil it flat on the floor after each use. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never hang a hose on a nail, which can crease it. Buy a wall rack or mount 
an auto tire rim on the wall to serve as a rack. Straighten out kinks and 
creases.  
</P>
<P>
 * Keep the hose in a cool, dry place where it won't be damaged by a car, lawn 
mower or excessive sunlight. Ultraviolet rays cause vinyl to deteriorate. Don't 
store in a room where electric motors operate -- they produce ozone that 
attacks rubber. Temporary repair 
</P>
<P>
 If a hose has several leaks, it has probably deteriorated so badly that it 
isn't worth fixing. But a single leak is easy to fix.  
</P>
<P>
 * Clean and dry the hose. Temporarily plug a pinhole leak by jamming a round 
wooden toothpick into the hole. Snap off the toothpick flush with the hose's 
outer skin. As the wood absorbs water, it will swell to seal the hole. Then 
wrap the hole with plastic electrician's tape two inches on each side. Overlap 
and stretch the tape as you apply it, except for the first lap and last three 
or four turns, so the hose will bend. 
</P>
<P>
 * Also try to seal pin-sized holes by touching them carefully with the glowing 
point of a heated ice pick. Long-term repair 
</P>
<P>
 To make a more permanent repair to a hose, make straight cuts on either side 
of the leak with a sharp knife. Take the segment of hose to a hardware store or 
garden center and select a mender kit whose insert sections match the inner 
diameter of the hose. The fit should be snug but not so tight as to crack the 
hose. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use a crimp-type mender to fix a rubber hose. Insert one end of the mender 
into a hose end until it seats well. Wet the hose if the tube is a tight fit. 
Place the end of the hose on a metal anvil or wooden block and hammer down the 
prongs of the mender gently and gradually until they grip the hose tightly all 
around. Repeat procedure on the second piece of hose. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use a threaded sleeve mender to fix a plastic hose. Dip the hose ends into 
hot water to soften. Insert a threaded sleeve into the end of the hose. Push 
the coupling over the hose end until the hose seats against the shoulder. Push 
the special key (in the kit) into the notches inside the sleeve. Turn the key 
until the top of the sleeve is flush with the end of the hose. Repeat with the 
second piece. Screw the couplings together.  
</P>
<P>
 * Clamp-type menders can be used on rubber or plastic hoses.

 * If size and style permit, rotate curtains and drapes to prevent certain 
areas of fabric from becoming overexposed to sun rays. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cover leg ends of metal furniture with rubber tips to reduce scrapes and 
rust marks on patio or deck. Or coat the bottom of each leg with a heavy layer 
of silicone rubber compound. Let dry overnight before setting right side up. 
</P>
<P>
 * To keep dogs away from garbage cans, sprinkle full-strength ammonia over 
bags before placing them in trash containers. 
</P>
<P>
 * When tying up tomato plants, use pantyhose that have been cut lengthwise. 
The nylon gives as the plants grow and will prevent cuts into the vine.

DISCOVERIES: INSIDE & OUT; FAIRER FAUCETS

<P>
 Almost single-handedly, the KWC/Rohl Corporation, based in Costa Mesa, is 
changing faucet design. The KWCforma-S basin faucet (about $655 to $695, 
depending on features), which is made in Switzerland, is not only pleasing to 
the eye, but also ergonomic. 
</P>
<P>
 A retractable hand spray makes it easier to fill the basin or shampoo your 
hair. And the forward motion of the lever is user-friendly for those with 
arthritis or carpal tunnel syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 A scald-prevention control, which allows you to set the maximum water 
temperature at the faucet instead of at the water heater, is a nice safety 
feature for families with children. And by adding an available restrictor, you 
can conserve water, too. 
</P>
<P>
 KWC faucets (they also make products for the kitchen and shower), can be 
purchased in Orange County at Bath & Kitchen West in Huntington Beach, the JM 
Company in Irvine and B & C Hardware & Bath in Laguna Hills. Sculptural Form 
</P>
<P>
 A sink can just stand there, or it can stand there and make a statement. Among 
the latter is the Italian-designed Olimpia 70 from Hastings Tile and Il Bagno 
Collection.  
</P>
<P>
 The 28-inch sink ($4,495; a larger version costs $6,270) is a simple design, 
with its demi-sphere of blue glass on an inverted cone pedestal. The pedestal 
is wrapped in brushed copper and set into a clear glass countertop. It is also 
available with a frosted green basin and chrome pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olimpia 70 can be purchased in Orange County at Eurobath & Tile in Costa 
Mesa and Bath Concept Studio in Corona del Mar. Soft Touch 
</P>
<P>
 If you prefer a softer touch in the bath, a sink that bursts into bloom is the 
Peonies & Ivy pattern from Kohler of Wisconsin. The Reveries collection is 
Kohler's line of decorated lavatories and related china products such as 
decorative jars, tile and faucet trim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Peonies & Ivy pattern encircles the rim and interior of Kohler's Cantata 
self-rimming lavatory. The basin ($865), which comes in shades of rose, cream, 
lavender and green on a biscuit background, is available at home decorating 
stores throughout Orange County.

DESIGN STYLE; A CLASSIC CASE OF ANCIENT INFLUENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many home furnishings are taking a giant step back in time -- to ancient 
Athens. Neoclassical furniture is on showroom floors, and fabric and wallpaper 
patterns with shells and column motifs are coveted. 
</P>
<P>
 Step into almost any home improvement center and you'll find ready-made 
columns, rosettes and moldings as well as how-to books and videos on executing 
classical techniques such as trompe l'oeil painting. 
</P>
<P>
 "As shown by the popularity of classically inspired furnishings and buildings, 
the general public already wants this type of design," Donald Rattner says. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer interest has been growing in traditional architecture and decorating 
since the preservation movement in the 1970s. But professional interest has 
been lagging, with few designers able to pull off the look. Rattner says that's 
because schools aren't teaching how to design, build, decorate and furnish 
classical buildings. If they cover classicism at all, they treat it purely as 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the Institute for the Study of Classical Architecture, founded in 1991 
in New York City by Rattner, a graduate of Princeton University's School of 
Architecture, and Richard Cameron, a fellow New York architect and a graduate 
of the University of Toronto. The institute is under the auspices of the New 
York Academy of Art, which opened in 1982 and is devoted to figurative and 
representational art. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our main aim is to fill a gap in the education of architects and designers," 
Rattner says. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't for professionals only. Throughout the year, the institute also 
offers courses, lectures, field trips and publications for the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of classicism is to create buildings in scale with, and 
comfortable for, human beings, Rattner says. In classical buildings, each room 
is separate unto itself, and a lot of attention is called to boundaries, for 
example, with surrounds for doors and windows. In modern buildings, rooms flow 
into one another without particular boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Classical architecture conveys monumentality, but it is also based on nature 
and on the human form," Rattner adds. 
</P>
<P>
 A classical column has a base that corresponds to feet, a shaft like a human 
trunk and a crowning capital analogous to the head. A modern column is a mere 
cylinder lacking a base and a capital. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who would like to add a taste of the classical past to their present 
home, the architect offers a quick review of classical design inspirations: 
</P>
<P>
 Look for decorative details such as moldings at baseboard, chair rail and 
cornice, corresponding to a bottom, a middle and a top. If there is a classical 
column, there will usually be a beam above it. If there is a fireplace, there 
will be a mantel, and often the mantel will be enriched with carving and will 
be the room's focal point. 
</P>
<P>
 Furnishings will be derived from classically inspired styles such as Federal, 
Biedermeier or Regency. There will be echoes of colors and patterns. A Greek 
key pattern on a cornice molding might be repeated on a cushion fabric or 
window border. Classical motifs include the acanthus leaf, scroll work, laurel 
leaf or wreath, lyre, shell and urn shape. These motifs may be carved, cast, 
painted, molded and printed on fabrics and wallpaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Classical rules of design provide many answers to questions associated with 
design and decoration -- not only room dimensions and ornament, but how to 
frame a door or window, to orient a house in relation to the sun for warmth in 
winter and coolness in summer, to create a focal point and arrange the 
furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this classical style expensive to execute? Not at all, Rattner says: 
</P>
<P>
 "It is possible to build very modest traditional structures at a reasonable 
cost."

REMODELING; SUSPENDING A CEILING WITH NO HANG-UPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Go ahead, suspend your disbelief. And your ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Installing a suspended ceiling is relatively easy and often an ideal way to 
cover exposed pipes, wiring or ducts.  
</P>
<P>
 Suspended ceilings consist of lightweight fiberglass or acoustical fiber 
panels set into a framework of metal strips. The framework, or grid, is 
suspended by wires from an existing ceiling or from exposed ceiling joists. 
It's easy to get the hang of it. 
</P>
<P>
 And because the panels are laid atop the grid and not attached to it, they are 
easily removed for access to lighting fixtures or other overhead systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Gird yourself for the grid. Planning and installing the grid is the first and 
most important step. Home centers and decorating supply stores that sell 
suspended ceiling materials usually offer personalized planning help. Ceiling 
kits come with complete instructions, often including a videocassette showing 
assembly procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, a grid consists of 8- or 12-foot-long T-shaped main runners 
spanning the length of the room, perpendicular to the joists; 2- or 4-foot-long 
T-shaped crosspieces that snap into slots in the runners, and 10-foot-long 
right-angled strips called wall angles. Panels are either 2 feet square or 
2-by-4 foot rectangles. They are easily cut smaller with a utility knife. 
</P>
<P>
 The starting line. To install grid pieces, start by marking a line in each 
wall corner at the desired height of the new ceiling. Stretch chalked string 
between the wall's corners, then pull it away from the wall near the center and 
let it snap back, leaving a chalk line on the wall. Check the line with a 
carpenter's level. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut strips, not corners. Locate and mark the wall studs' positions along the 
chalk line. Cut the wall angle strips to length with tin snips and nail them to 
the walls at the stud marks, aligning the lower edge of each strip with the 
chalk line. When finished, the wall angles form a ledge around the room for 
panels to rest on. 
</P>
<P>
 Joist remarks. If the joists are not exposed, locate and mark their positions 
on the ceiling with chalk lines. Next, mark the positions of the main runners 
with chalk lines across the ceiling with exposed joists. Then, just under those 
lines, stretch strings across the room marking the main runners' positions. 
Also run strings perpendicular to them to show the locations of the 
crosspieces. Attach the strings temporarily to the wall angles by tying nails 
to the ends of the strings and wedging the nails between the angles and the 
walls from below. Make sure the strings cross each other at right angles. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut the runners to length so that the slots in them for crosspieces align with 
the crosspiece strings. If the room is longer than the runners, cut additional 
runner sections to make up the difference and join them to the ends of the 
uncut runners by snapping their interlocking ends together. Rest the runners in 
place on the wall angles, directly beneath the chalked lines. 
</P>
<P>
 High-wire act. Insert screw eyes (included with ceiling kits) into the joists 
along the chalked lines at intervals of about five feet. Thread a foot-long 
length of soft wire (also included with kits) through each eye, wrap one end 
around itself to secure the wire to the eye and run the remaining end through a 
round hole in the runner. Adjust the wire so it supports the runner at the same 
height as the wall angles, then wrap the end around itself to secure it. 
</P>
<P>
 Continue installing wires and securing the runners. When the runners are in 
place, cut and fit crosspieces between them by snapping their ends into the 
runners' slots. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep a level head. Check the grid for level, adjust any errant wires and then 
remove the strings. Install the panels by inserting them through the grid at an 
angle and then letting them drop into place. If desired, use translucent 
acrylic or fiberglass panels to cover recessed light fixtures and molding where 
the panels meet walls.

APPLIANCES; MODERATE CARE KEEPS ELEMENTS OF DISHWASHER RUNNING CLEAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you give your dishwasher a moderate amount of care, you increase the odds 
that it won't complain when you ask it to do the dishes. 
</P>
<P>
 A dishwasher is self-cleaning except near the rim of the door opening. Wipe 
this area clean before starting the machine so that spills don't bake on. It's 
also a good idea to check the tub for any remaining debris and wipe out the 
detergent dispenser. 
</P>
<P>
 Every few months, remove the spray arm or arms (some simply lift out, others 
unscrew). Shake out the arm and use a pipe cleaner to clear its ports. 
</P>
<P>
 If mineral deposits form, dissolve them by pouring a cup of vinegar into the 
empty tub and running the machine through the wash cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 If Dishwasher Won't Start 
</P>
<P>
 * Check that the door is properly locked and that the push button or dial 
setting is correct. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look for a blown fuse or tripped circuit breaker. 
</P>
<P>
 * There may be a faulty door switch, selector switch or timer. Call a repair 
service. If a dishwasher does not fill or drain properly, check the float in 
the bottom of the tub. It should move freely and not be clogged with detergent 
or debris. If that's not the problem, call a repair service because repairs can 
be complex. 
</P>
<P>
 How to Correct Noisiness 
</P>
<P>
 * Do dishes clatter during washing? Make sure they lean against the racks. 
</P>
<P>
 * A grinding noise may mean low or no water. Open the door during the wash 
cycle to check. Most machines require at least one inch of water above the sump 
area (the depression around the pump). Taking a shower, washing a load of 
clothes or watering the lawn while using the dishwasher can mean that it's not 
getting enough water. A stuck float can also be the problem. Otherwise, the 
trouble may be with the timer, the inlet valve screen or overflow switch. Call 
a repair service. 
</P>
<P>
 Tips to Correct a Leak 
</P>
<P>
 * Dishes may be improperly loaded. Reposition dishes in the racks to prevent 
accidental deflection of water through the door vent. 
</P>
<P>
 * Trickles around the door may indicate that it isn't tight. Loosen the screws 
in the lock strike and realign the strike with the door latch to create a 
firmer seal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check the door gasket. If it's worn or brittle, replace it. (Gaskets, 
available through the manufacturer, may be mounted with clips, screws or pop-in 
fasteners.) 
</P>
<P>
 * If water comes from under the machine, disconnect the power, turn off the 
water supply, remove the bottom access panel (usually clipped in place or held 
by screws) and check all the hose clamps. Tighten leaking worm-drive clamps, 
which have an adjusting screw, with a screwdriver. If a spring-type clamp is 
leaking, use pliers to remove it. Replace it with a worm-drive clamp. 
</P>
<P>
 Not Washing Properly: 
</P>
<P>
 * A common cause of poor washing is low water temperature. Run hot water into 
a glass in the kitchen sink and insert a candy thermometer. If the temperature 
is not at least 140 degrees, you may want to adjust the setting of your water 
heater. Don't set it too high, though, especially if you have children or 
others who may scald themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * If your water heater is not near your kitchen, run the tap in the sink until 
the water heats before starting the dishwasher. 
</P>
<P>
 * Follow the owner's manual recommendations for proper precleaning and 
loading, and type of detergent.

WITH PROPER CLEANING AND CARE, THERE'S NO REST FOR THE WICKER

 Summer is a good time to take stock of your wicker pieces and renew their 
beauty. Old wicker will reward an annual cleaning with many additional seasons 
in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Take your sturdy, machine-made wicker settees, chairs and plant stands, which 
succeeded late-Victorian handmade wicker, outdoors. Hose them down and let them 
dry. Avoid direct sunlight when you're cleaning the pieces and use a natural 
soap. 
</P>
<P>
 Very old wicker is too delicate for spray cleaning, but the coiled backs and 
arms are dust-catchers all the same. Take these items outside and use a 
long-handled brush to clean out the coils. Then go over them with the soft 
brush of your vacuum cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
 Old wicker should be used outside only on well-sheltered porches or terraces. 
Cushions must be sturdy and fit snugly against the back and arms to reduce wear 
against the fragile woven rattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be surprised if sprucing up the back-yard furnishings awakens a longing 
for something new. Though antique wicker is scarcer now, choice pieces are 
still to be had. Try country estate auctions for some fortuitous bargains. 
Also, reproductions of antique outdoor furniture are available from stores that 
specialize in such furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 When testing wicker furniture, pick it up to feel the heft. New pieces are 
made with lighter materials such as bamboo and won't feel as durable as the old 
pieces, many of which have hardwood frames and dowels. Sit on the pieces to 
check for comfort and sturdiness.

DO-IT-YOURSELF; STAYING ON TOP OF RE-SHINGLE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAROL V. MENZIE and RANDY JOHNSON, TIMES-POST NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once you accept that it's going to be hard labor, re-shingling a composition 
roof isn't difficult. It's not, as a woodworking friend likes to say, brain 
surgery -- though it's not for the brain-dead either, as you need to keep your 
wits about you while working on a slanted surface so far above the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure the roof to find out how many shingles to order (three bundles per 
hundred square feet), and remember to order an extra 10% to 20% for waste and 
miscalculation. If you can get the bundles easily, go for the lower figure; if 
the shingles have to be delivered from some distant warehouse, add the higher 
percentage to avoid frustration. Check whether you can return unopened bundles. 
</P>
<P>
 Check also whether the supplier has a conveyor-belt delivery system; a truck- 
or trailer-mounted conveyor can deliver the shingles right to the roof. Having 
the shingles delivered to the roof is worth paying a few extra dollars. The 
alternative is carrying dozens of bundles of shingles, each weighing 80 to 100 
pounds, to the roof on your shoulder, one bundle at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep shingles dry by covering them with a tarp or heavy plastic. If the paper 
wrapping gets soggy, the bundles could fall apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Roofing requires a hammer, a utility knife with lots of extra blades, a tape 
measure, a carpenter's square and roofing nails. To install new shingles over 
old, use roofing nails long enough to go through all layers and into the 
underlying surface at least three-quarters of an inch. Order plenty of nails -- 
each shingle takes four nails, and there are 27 shingles in a bundle. 
</P>
<P>
 You also need roofing cement and a caulk gun with silicone caulk. Tin snips, 
for cutting flashing and trimming shingles, are also useful. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you start on the shingles, go up on the roof and check out the 
flashing, the metal strips that line valleys, and go around anything that 
protrudes through the roof, such as chimney and pipes. Watch for flashing on 
the edge of the roof. If it's in good shape, all you have to do is nail down 
any loose spots. If it's damaged or worn, however, you'll have to replace it. 
(If the roof is simple, a two-sided peak, for instance, with one chimney 
protruding, you can probably replace the flashing yourself. If the roof has a 
lot of peaks and valleys, however, you may want to get professional help with 
the flashing.) 
</P>
<P>
 Once the prep work is done, you're ready to start nailing. Here are the steps. 
</P>
<P>
 * First, familiarize yourself with the parts of a shingle. We're assuming 
you're using a standard three-tab asphalt or fiberglass shingle, 12 inches high 
by 36 inches wide. The tabs, the bottom part of the shingle, are the part that 
shows, the part that has the color you have chosen. The top part is usually 
black with a row of self-sealing adhesive where the nails will be driven in. 
Read the wrapper carefully; it should tell you how to cut them and suggest a 
nailing pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 * Roofing goes on in rows, called courses, starting along the bottom edge and 
ending at the ridge. The first strip of shingling, the starter strip, has no 
tabs. It's a piece trimmed from the black part of the shingle that butts 
against the bottom of the original second course, providing a flat surface for 
the new first course. Trim several inches off one end of the first strip so old 
seams will be covered. Nail every two or three inches. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once the entire row of starter strips is in place, start on the first 
course. This course usually starts with a full shingle. It should butt against 
the bottom of the old third course, with the ends of the tabs even with the 
bottom of the starter strips. You may have to trim it an inch or so to make it 
fit -- trim the black part, not the tabs. Put nails one inch from each side in 
the adhesive, and above each tab cutout (the slot that forms the tab). It's 
important to stick to this nailing scheme so nails will always be covered. 
</P>
<P>
 * The first shingle is always trimmed, to make the cutouts stagger. It should 
say on the wrapper how much to cut off. Always cut from the same side and 
always start each course at the same edge of the roof. The cut edge of a 
shingle should always be on the outside edge of the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 * Continue to place each course, fitting it against the bottom edge of the 
next course of existing roofing, and following the pattern specified on the 
wrapper. When you come to an obstruction, a pipe or chimney, cut the shingle to 
fit around it. Nail it down and lap the next course over the nails. The trick 
is to nail only in the black parts of the shingles, and not in the tabs, where 
the nails would be exposed. If there's a little piece of shingle you can't 
nail, because the nail would show, glue it down with roofing cement. Then use 
silicone caulk around the trimmed-out edges. 
</P>
<P>
 * A traditional ridge cap is made by cutting each tab apart, through the black 
part, then folding the resulting piece sideways across the peak. (You can trim 
the black part slightly, so there won't be any black showing when the pieces 
are overlapped; trimmed ridge-cap pieces might look a bit like home plate, with 
the black being the narrower part.) Make sure the black parts of the last 
regular course of shingles won't show under the ridge cap. It may mean adding 
an extra course on one side of the roof. Nail each cap piece on each side, 
again nailing through the adhesive in the black part. 
</P>
<P>
 The ridge cap is the only place on the roof where any nails will show. The 
last piece you fold and place over the edge will have the black part showing. 
Cut the black part off of one of the cap pieces and fold it over the black part 
of the last cap piece. It goes in like the other pieces, with one nail on each 
side. Start the nail, put a dab of silicone caulk on the spot, then drive the 
nail through the caulk and smear it around to cover the nail head. 
</P>
<P>
 Newer roofs may have a ridge vent. It will have to be removed to get the 
shingles far enough under it to protect the house. Then it can be replaced 
after the shingles are nailed down. The original vent may not survive removal; 
new ones aren't expensive and come with directions on how they should be 
installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, climb down carefully, clean up any mess and take yourself out to 
dinner. You deserve it.

MULCH TYPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are many kinds of mulch to choose from, including: ORGANIC 
</P>
<P>
 Bark Chips and Ground Bark. Attractive and often used as a decorative 
material. It decomposes very slowly. On the downside, bark can harbor pests 
such as earwigs, termites and sow bugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Compost. Homemade or purchased is an excellent source of organic matter that 
improves the soil. It can be bought or made from materials found in the yard, 
such as grass clippings and leaves. If not properly composted, compost may 
contain weed seeds.  
</P>
<P>
 Grass Clippings and Leaves. Readily available for most gardeners. If not dried 
first, grass and leaves can mat and reduce water penetration. It is best to 
compost them, as this will kill weed seeds.  
</P>
<P>
 Hay and Straw. Promotes good water penetration and makes an attractive mulch. 
May contain grain seeds, however, which can germinate.  
</P>
<P>
 Leaf Mold. Adds acidity to our alkaline soils. It also looks attractive and 
natural. This can be found bagged in the nursery.  
</P>
<P>
 Newspapers. Readily available, but they aren't as visually attractive as other 
types of mulch. They also tend to blow around in the wind.  
</P>
<P>
 Peat Moss. Adds acidity to alkaline soils and contains very few weeds. It is 
expensive and resists wetting when dry.  
</P>
<P>
 Pine Needles. Add acidity to the soil and break down slowly. They should only 
be used on acid-loving plants.  
</P>
<P>
 Pressed Paper. Heavy fibrous paper for mulching, such as Hortopaper, is made 
specifically for mulching. It has good water and air penetration but does tend 
to tear after transplanting, or if it's walked on.  
</P>
<P>
 Sawdust. Improves the organic content of the soil, but if it mats, it will 
inhibit water penetration. It decomposes rapidly and may blow away. This may 
also contain an organic compound that can harm young plants. INORGANIC 
</P>
<P>
 Used Carpet. It's visually unattractive and can produce an offensive odor when 
wet, but is one of the most long-lasting and durable methods of mulching.  
</P>
<P>
 Black Plastic. It's been used for years to smother undesirable weeds. The 
plastic breaks down in a few months, however, and is not very attractive, often 
requiring a top mulch, such as bark. Weeds grow easily through any holes.  
</P>
<P>
 Clear Plastic. Similar to black plastic, but will encourage weed growth unless 
you place a top mulch on it. Weeds grow easily through any holes.  
</P>
<P>
 Woven Polypropylene and Nonwoven Polyester. Allows air and water penetration. 
It is very effective and generally long-lasting, although it can be expensive 
and unattractive, requiring a top mulch.  
</P>
<P>
 Photodegradable Plastic. Lasts indefinitely if not exposed to light.  
</P>
<P>
 Crushed Stone or Gravel. An attractive mulch, but tends to become infested 
with weeds if used alone. It is also expensive and may get hot in the sun.

OPEN ROAD RULING; LONG BEACH LOSES BID TO SHUT GATE ON HAWAIIAN GARDENS BORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI and JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For some residents of Hawaiian Gardens, a gate that would seal off a street 
between an affluent Long Beach neighborhood and the mostly blue-collar, Latino 
city, is an example of racism.  
</P>
<P>
 For some residents of Long Beach, sealing off Pioneer Boulevard at the 
boundaries of the two cities has nothing to do with race, but is necessary to 
control traffic on the busy street. 
</P>
<P>
 After a months-long battle that has attracted national attention, a Los 
Angeles Superior Court judge Friday ruled against allowing Long Beach to seal 
off the street. "It would have been a Berlin Wall," said Tamar Stein, an 
attorney representing Hawaiian Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 The gate was installed by Long Beach -- but has never been used -- after 
residents of the upscale El Dorado Park Estates neighborhood complained about 
traffic coming off the San Gabriel River Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "For four hours a day, those people have literally got (a) freeway coming 
through their streets," said Les Robbins, the Long Beach council member whose 
district includes El Dorado Park Estates. Hawaiian Gardens officials "made a 
racial issue out of it, and unfortunately I think Judge (Diane) Wayne bought 
into it," Robbins said. "This is not a racial issue. It's a traffic issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne ruled that Long Beach did not have the right to close a street that 
would affect Hawaiian Gardens. "The closure . . . promotes the health and 
safety of some of (Long Beach's) own citizens by interfering with the rights of 
others," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, after El Dorado residents complained about excessive traffic 
cutting through their neighborhood, the Long Beach City Council voted to seal 
off the road. Some residents also complained about crime they said originated 
in Hawaiian Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was to block Pioneer Boulevard, which narrows and twists as it 
passes through the Long Beach neighborhood, for one year to test the effects. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hawaiian Gardens council member Kathleen Navejas blasted the closing as 
racist. Combatants from both sides appeared on the Phil Donahue show, and an El 
Dorado resident joined with Navejas and Hawaiian Gardens to file a suit to stop 
the closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne suggested that Long Beach explore alternatives to deal with traffic, 
such as speed humps. Long Beach officials say other methods are being examined 
and that no decision has been made on whether the decision will be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach traffic studies say that few who use Pioneer are from Hawaiian 
Gardens, and that traffic would not be rerouted on other Hawaiian Gardens 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Hawaiian Gardens produced studies that officials say showed that blocking 
Pioneer would increase traffic on its roads, particularly near an elementary 
school.  
</P>
<P>
 "Their traffic engineer disagrees with our traffic engineer, which is why we 
are in court," Deputy Long Beach City Atty. Heather Mahood said. 
</P>
<P>
 For El Dorado resident Francis Workman the question is not academic. He 
worries about his four grandchildren, who play outside his house on the street 
where he said he has seen two parked cars get totaled and a motorcycle skid out 
of control onto his curb. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the fear of my life, that street," said Workman, adding that residents 
of all races in El Dorado share his concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar Galvesolo, who lives in the El Dorado Estates house closest to Hawaiian 
Gardens, said: "They say it's racist, but it's not. We're worried about 
burglaries and robberies. Sometimes drug dealers use it as a cut-through." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brandy Mancilla has a different view. She can see the gate just outside 
her Hawaiian Gardens home and it reminds her of racism. "If they want to be 
secluded from Mexicans, they should go somewhere else," Mancilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We respect that they don't want to devalue their property, but they should 
respect us too," Mancilla said. "They're disrespecting me because of who I am."

CITYSCAPES / RICHARD LEE COLVIN: FOR SOME, STREETS OF DOWNTOWN SPARK RUNNING 
LOVE AFFAIR; 'I ALMOST THINK WE SEE THE CITY IN ITS BEST LIGHT. YOU AREN'T 
INSULATED LIKE YOU ARE IN AN AUTOMOBILE.' 
</P>

<P>
 For most of its 9-to-5ers, Downtown is but a place to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The imposing edifices of commerce and banking, justice and government collect 
them in the morning and send them scurrying toward home in their cars and buses 
and trains in the evening. They are desk jockeys whose most strenuous daytime 
activity is hiking to lunch, peering straight ahead to avoid making eye contact 
with panhandlers. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't describe Lisa Haller's workday. And it doesn't describe the 
feeling she has about Downtown. For her, and for dozens or perhaps even 
hundreds of others, the heart of the city is also a place to run. 
</P>
<P>
 Dedicated morning runners such as Haller describe the odd quiet of the streets 
before 7 a.m. and covet the chance to see the details of change, the day-by-day 
metamorphosis that goes unnoticed while driving by or negotiating crowded 
sidewalks on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I love best is that I can literally watch what's going on in the city," 
said Haller, 37, the director of sales and marketing for the Hyatt Regency 
Hotel on Hope Street. One of her regular routes goes from the hotel out to the 
Los Angeles Convention Center and then loops back to the Los Angeles Music 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the Convention Center from when the land was being cleared to the 
opening," she said. Now, in addition to checking out the activities at the 
Bonaventure and the Biltmore, she is keeping track of the makeover of the 
Ahmanson Theater and construction of the new Walt  
</P>
<P>
 Disney Concert Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Other evangelists of running Downtown preach about the pleasures of seeing the 
city wake up. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Tesari used to work in the Wells Fargo Bank building Downtown. Now he's 
starting a Westside restaurant. But he still drives to the Ketchum Downtown 
YMCA from Marina del Rey most mornings to run with a group of regulars. 
</P>
<P>
 They leave the Y on Hope Street about 6 a.m. and head over to Dodger Stadium 
and Elysian Park, zigzagging along Temple Street, Beaudry Avenue, Sunset 
Boulevard and Elysian Park Avenue. The return route is usually back through 
Chinatown and down Broadway. Some mornings they run as many as 11 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 At any given time of the day, the park is probably the most popular 
destination because it is shady and relatively traffic-free even during the 
day. Also, the park's trails and roads provide several loops of various 
distances, some with hills, some relatively flat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting in the morning," he said, because the denizens of the dawn 
get to know each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an Asian gentleman who waves at us and jumps up and down when we go 
by. There's another man who's in his 80s or 90s and he sweeps the sidewalk in 
front of a bakery on Broadway every morning. He gives us the thumbs-up and 
claps for us. It's just a great feeling to start the morning to have someone do 
that for you. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost think we see the city in its best light," he said. "You aren't 
insulated like you are in an automobile and . . . you can hear and smell the 
city." 
</P>
<P>
 Noontime joggers face greater hazards. Bus fumes. Stop lights that turn a 
free-flowing jog into a frustrating series of sprints. Traffic cops ready with 
their ticket pads to nail jay-runners. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Smith, a spokeswoman for the Downtown Y, said she once got stopped by 
a police officer who wanted to ticket her for crossing at a red light on 
Olympic Boulevard. She managed to talk her way out of it by saying she didn't 
see it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm running, I don't want to stop," she said. "That's why, for me 
personally, I don't run at lunch." 
</P>
<P>
 But the most dedicated of the noontime runners exult in the curbside tumult 
that gives them the feeling of being in a race complete with cheering 
spectators every day. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the sheriff's deputies who works at the Criminal Courts Building 
Downtown runs a 3 1/2-mile loop that reaches 5th Street and Grand Avenue at its 
farthest point south and includes several hills. 
</P>
<P>
 On some inclines a pedestrian will challenge her for a block or so. "As I'm 
dying going up a hill there's always someone running in their regular clothes 
who always beats me," said the deputy, who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 Another highlight, she said, is a homeless man who is always at the same spot, 
engaged in a conversation with himself. "I always mark my time when I pass 
him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another noontime jogger, an accomplished triathlete, said he doesn't worry 
about being hassled, even while running through some of the grimier parts of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy who runs projects some confidence and people figure, 'If they're crazy 
enough to run I won't mess around with them,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, not everyone is willing to brave the unpredictability of the 
streets, the heat and the sometimes foul air that comes of a city that is 
tailored to the conveniences of cars rather than to the pleasures of running. 
</P>
<P>
 Some run indoors, pounding out 14.5 laps per mile at the YMCA. Firefighters 
and some city employees take the elevator to the roof of City Hall East and jog 
nine laps to the mile, while enjoying a 360-degree view of Downtown from 20 
stories up. Others churn away on treadmills. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who venture out, in the morning or at noon, find the pleasures of 
the city unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
 Beth Sestanovich, an executive assistant who lives in Manhattan Beach and 
works Downtown, said she prefers to run Downtown because she beats the traffic 
by coming in early. But there are other reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of hills and it's great for training," the veteran marathoner 
said. One of the hills, on Sunset, is the steepest part of the Los Angeles 
Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done it 1,000 times," and on race day, she said, "I usually trot right 
up the hill where everybody is just about to die."

COMMUNITY'S SUPPORT BUOYS OFFICER'S FAMILY

<P>
 The last time Ruth Dean saw her son was at Christmas, at a celebration and 
family reunion captured on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dean, 69, has yet to watch that footage. It is still too difficult a 
prospect as she grieves for Clarence Wayne Dean, her eldest child, a motorcycle 
police officer who fell to his death off a collapsed freeway interchange in the 
first few minutes after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will eventually watch it," she said Friday from her home in Ventura, hours 
after officials reopened the Golden State-Antelope Valley freeway interchange 
for the first time in six months, naming it for her dead son. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, what keeps Dean going are the rest of her children and the senior 
citizen activities she attends with a neighbor. And she is buoyed by the 
concern of her son's fellow Los Angeles Police Department officers, who 
spearheaded the drive to rename the interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers approved the name change earlier this week. A ceremony to formally 
dedicate the connector roads to Clarence Dean's memory will be held later this 
year, near where the officer plummeted 30 feet as he rushed to work in the 
pre-dawn blackness Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very nice gesture," Ruth Dean said, her voice breaking. "Everyone will 
remember him more that way." 
</P>
<P>
 The past few months have been trying for Dean as she comes to grips with the 
death of her son just a little more than a year after the loss of her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 To remember Clarence, whom everyone in the family called Wayne, she keeps a 
photograph of him in uniform in her living room. And she has a cupboard full of 
drinking glasses he gave her for Christmas during her weeklong stay at his 
Lancaster home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had mentioned I had wanted some drinking glasses, just four little ones," 
she recalled. "He got me a set of 16." 
</P>
<P>
 The gesture was characteristic of a man who friends and relatives say loved to 
help others. Clarence Dean, 46, joined the force when he was 21 and is survived 
by his mother, two sisters, a younger brother and two children: Guy, 26, and 
Traci, 23. He and his third wife were divorced. 
</P>
<P>
 For support, his mother relies on a network of other survivors of downed 
police officers. And two of her other children live close by, including Deborah 
Barton, 45, who lives just a few miles from her late brother's home in 
Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Barton said the deaths of her father and brother within such a short period of 
time have been difficult for the entire family. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're just grieving over one and then something likes this happens," said 
Barton, who was on hand for the reopening of the freeway interchange Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the memory of her brother still brings tears, Barton clings to the 
hope that he is now in a place beyond pain or suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to remember he's in a better place," she said. "As long as I keep that 
faith, and truly believe that, it makes it a little easier."

OXNARD PLAN OFFERS INCENTIVES FOR RECYCLING; TRASH: PROGRAM OFFERS MONTHLY BILL 
SAVINGS. NEW PROPOSAL SEEKS TO ENCOURAGE MORE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Preaching environmental responsibility is one way to coax Oxnard residents 
into separating recyclables from their trash. Instead, the city is appealing to 
their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last July, the city has offered residents a $3.50 reduction in their 
$20.67 monthly trash bill if they would use smaller rubbish containers. But 
only about 1,000 of the city's 25,000 households have signed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the City Council is considering a new program to reduce the amount of 
trash Oxnard sends to landfills and does not recycle.  
</P>
<P>
 Beginning next month, about 350 residents of the city's Rio Lindo neighborhood 
will voluntarily begin separating grass clippings and tree trimmings, allowing 
them to use the smaller, cheaper containers. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard, like all cities and counties in California, must reduce the amount of 
trash it sends to landfills by 25% by 1995 and 50% by 2000.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials say that green waste makes up about 20% of Oxnard's trash from 
homes. Simi Valley, Fillmore, and Thousand Oaks already have either partial or 
citywide green waste programs. 
</P>
<P>
 What Oxnard officials are counting on is that residents will use new free 
containers for their clippings and will not need their old 105-gallon trash 
containers, trading them in for 60-gallon models. And that will lead to more 
recycling because of lack of room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to get a good idea from this pilot program of how many people are 
going to keep the 105" gallon containers, Oxnard recycling manager Stan Hakes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cash rewards to separate trash have been effective in other parts of the state 
and nation, particularly in Seattle, said Oxnard refuse superintendent Ruben J. 
Mesa. He is confident that they will work in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's offer to cut rubbish fees caught on in only 4% of households, 
Hakes said, because the city failed to promote it properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives from several of the city's neighborhoods, including Windsor 
North, Cal-Gisler, and Bartolo Square have already expressed interest in the 
green waste program, Mesa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The green waste drums will be picked up weekly along with the rest of 
household rubbish. The grass and clippings will then be taken to the California 
Wood Recycling center in Ventura, where most of it will be turned into mulch. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials argue the program is not only environmentally sound, but also 
fiscally sound -- at least in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 Hakes said the city pays the Bailard Landfill up to $160 to take care of a 
container that holds up to five tons of trash. By contrast, the city pays 
California Wood Recycling $40 for the same-sized container of green waste. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials acknowledge that the city is not likely to save anything for 
years, because Oxnard will have buy an extra trash truck and hire extra 
employee if the program is implemented citywide. Additional up-front city costs 
include $50 for each 60-gallon drum for the green waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The city eventually hopes to find a private company to sell the recycled 
product and further reduce city costs, Hakes said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the long-term benefits are significant, partially because of the expected 
1997 closure of Bailard, Hakes said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the future, the landfill won't be there, so you're talking about 
transportation costs as well as disposal costs," Hakes said. "It always pays to 
reduce waste."

A DAY OF WINNERS; GAMES AT VENTURA SCHOOL BRING REGULAR AND SPECIAL-EDUCATION 
CLASSES TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As 7-year-old Catherine Alburger and 8-year-old Heather Nichols squared off 
for a game of gladiator, they looked anything but evenly matched. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Catherine, who is tall for her age, tower over her older 
opponent, but Heather has a slightly shrunken right hand that forced her to 
wield her stuffed sword with only her left. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, Heather lost. But she did not go down without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 And both girls came away from the game, held during a special field day Friday 
at Ventura's Loma Vista School, saying they felt less self-conscious about 
their physical differences. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the point of the round of games at Loma Vista -- bringing 300 
students from regular summer-school classes together with 140 disabled 
youngsters to learn lessons of tolerance and acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 Children from regular classes were grouped with youngsters who are blind, 
severely emotionally disturbed or otherwise disabled to play games that 
required them to work together. 
</P>
<P>
 The field day marked the first time that the Ventura Unified School District 
has brought regular and special education students together from different 
campuses during summer school. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the school year, many Ventura elementary schools teach physically and 
learning disabled children in classrooms that are next door or down the hall 
from regular classes. The two groups often mingle at recess and, under special 
arrangement, in classrooms. But even in those schools with special-education 
classes, most disabled students are of just one type. 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer, the district has traditionally kept regular students on one 
campus and disabled children on another because it is easier to keep track of 
different types of funding, educators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's field day mixed regular students with children who had disabilities 
ranging from severe emotional problems to deafness, said Linda Dubois, the 
summer school principal at Loma Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 "In summer school, we're segregated," said Andi Melvin, a teacher in the 
special-education classes, which are being held at Junipero Serra School. 
</P>
<P>
 But both regular and disabled students benefit from spending time together, 
Melvin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children from regular classes serve as "role models for how to act socially 
appropriate" for the special-education students, Melvin said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And children who are not disabled become more comfortable with people who are. 
</P>
<P>
 "For normal children, it reduces their fears," Melvin said. "It's wonderful 
for kids with no handicaps to get perspective on their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point Friday, several girls from regular classes stood staring at 
another girl who sat on the grass, smiling and eating a Popsicle. The girl, her 
skin severely mottled, has Down's syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel really, really sad for her," 7-year-old Kaytlin O'Dell said, as she 
and her friends turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 But Melvin said that if Kaytlin and her classmates had spent more time with 
the 9-year-old girl, they would have seen that she is happy and well-adjusted. 
"They could see she's not sad." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The more that regular-education students are around those who are different, 
the more they consider them as individuals, Melvin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some children seemed to be learning this lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-grader Catherine Alburger said she feared jousting with disabled 
Heather Nichols at first. "I just thought I was going to hit her," Catherine 
said. But after Heather put up such a fight, Catherine said she realized that 
Heather's disability did not matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's still a person. And people are different."

PANEL VOTES TO DELAY BALANCE OF PAYMENTS TO METROLINK; TRANSPORTATION: 
COMMISSION PRESSES RAIL AUTHORITY FOR COST-CUTTING MEASURES. HALF OF AN 
ESTIMATED $1.9 MILLION IN COSTS IS AT ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Struggling to control the mushrooming costs of Metrolink, the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission on Friday approved a payment plan for the train 
service with a built-in cost-cutting strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move that surprised Metrolink authorities, the commission agreed to pay 
half of the nearly $1.9-million estimated cost of service for fiscal year 
1994-95 and press Metrolink to cut costs before paying the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to see us give them the total amount for a full year now when there 
are still things that can be done to cut costs," said Commissioner Bill Davis, 
a Simi Valley city councilman. "Withholding part of the money keeps the 
pressure on to come down on the costs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Hidalgo, a spokesman for the rail authority that runs Metrolink, said 
his agency did not receive notice of the commission's decision until Friday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidalgo said the Southern California Regional Rail Authority's executive 
director, Richard Stanger, will meet with commission Executive Director Ginger 
Gherardi next week to discuss the commission's action.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is an unusual way of adopting a funding source from one of our member 
agencies. No county has ever approached it in this fashion," Hidalgo said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are not able to respond appropriately because we are just now evaluating 
the impact this action would have not only on the service in Ventura County but 
also the county's funding contribution." 
</P>
<P>
 Gherardi said she did not think the commission's action would lead Metrolink 
to stop running trains to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot conceive of it doing that," Gherardi said. "We have fully funded six 
months of service, and we have every intention of paying the rest of the bill, 
once the budget is correct." 
</P>
<P>
 Representing one of five counties that share the cost of Metrolink, the 
commission has repeatedly criticized the rail authority's annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In early budget negotiations, Ventura commission members helped shave about 
$4.5 million from the overall Metrolink budget for the five-county region. The 
Metrolink budget now stands at about $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The other counties served by the train are Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside and 
San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 Gherardi told the commission she came up with the plan to withhold the funds 
after she discovered that the rail authority may have overestimated the cost of 
insurance and failed to include interest it had earned on one of its accounts 
in the budget it approved in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they would adjust these things mid-year," Gherardi said. "There's 
no reason for us to pay an amount now that may come down by midyear." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has joined with agencies from several other counties in asking 
for an outside audit of the rail authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really am disturbed that we seem to be having so much trouble getting 
financial information from those folks," said Commission Chairwoman Vicky 
Howard, a county supervisor. "We really need to look at this carefully." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, the commission learned that Ventura County's annual share 
of the Metrolink cost would double, from $800,000 to nearly $1.6 million, just 
for service to Moorpark and Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of service to the stations in Camarillo and Oxnard is being paid in 
large part with federal emergency funds because the facilities were opened to 
help relieve freeway congestion after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Those funds run out at the end of September, and the rail authority has agreed 
to continue running the trains to the two stations until next summer as a trial 
expansion project, charging about $300,000 for fuel.

ANONYMOUS DEVELOPER PROPOSES LAND SWAP; VENTURA: BROKER SAYS UNNAMED CLIENT 
COULD OFFER UP TO $5.55 MILLION FOR REGIONAL PARK IN EXCHANGE FOR PERMISSION TO 
BUILD HOMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An anonymous developer says he will up the ante in a controversial land swap 
proposal, offering to pay Ventura twice as much money to construct a park in 
return for permission to build 400 homes in the city's greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Moore, a longtime Ventura real estate broker, asserts his unnamed client 
could offer the city up to $5.55 million for a regional park. In return, his 
client wants to construct about 400 houses on a city-owned lemon orchard. Moore 
outlined the proposal in a letter Wednesday to the mayor and city planners. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said he pitched the concept to his client a couple weeks ago, picking up 
the idea from local developer Ron Hertel, who proposes giving Ventura $2 
million for a park in exchange for housing allocations.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Steve Bennett, who has urged the council to hunt for other offers 
on the city's land before accepting Hertel's, called Moore's letter "really 
interesting" and said he would like to learn more about it. 
</P>
<P>
 But others on the council viewed the proposal more skeptically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't give a real close look to it," Mayor Tom Buford said. "We have a lot 
of people out there with ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore and Hertel, however, are the only two to put their proposals in writing 
to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Hertel owns 94 acres at the corner of Telephone and Kimball roads, which he 
cannot build on because they are designated as farmland until 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempting to profit from his land sooner, Hertel proposes swapping his 
property with the city's 87-acre citrus grove at the intersection of Telegraph 
Road and Petit Avenue. Also zoned agricultural until 2010, the city's land was 
purchased as a future park site, but the city does not have the money to make 
it happen.  
</P>
<P>
 Hertel says he will give Ventura $2 million for a park on his land south of 
the Santa Paula Freeway, if, in exchange, he gets permission to build 437 homes 
on the city's property. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore's client has a more lucrative proposal for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The client, which Moore describes as a development corporation, offers to pay 
the city $8.7 million for its property. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, as outlined in the letter, suggests that the city can use those 
funds to buy land for a park, and still have $4.15 million to $5.55 million 
left for the park's development. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Moore writes in the letter, the city could buy Hertel's property 
for $3.15 million, the price at which it has "recently been available." 
</P>
<P>
 That would value the land at about $35,000 an acre, which is what councilmen 
Gary Tuttle and Steve Bennett also claim it is worth. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hertel says his land is worth $65,000 an acre, and denies he ever tried to 
sell it, at any price. "That letter is not true," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore declined to say what he meant by saying the property has "recently been 
available" and would not provide proof that the land was ever on the market. 
But Councilman Gary Tuttle said he has also heard the same rumor, that Hertel 
tried to sell his property at $35,000 an acre. 
</P>
<P>
 Hertel values the city's property at about $13 million, but discounts the 
price to $7.8 million because Ventura will not let him build all his houses at 
once. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore's letter arrived at Ventura's planning department 19 days before the 
council will dole out housing allocations for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve developers want to build more than 3,000 dwellings in Ventura. Bound by 
county population and smog controls, Ventura's council members can only permit 
up to 1,018 dwellings through 1999, and the competition for those limited 
allotments is intense. 
</P>
<P>
 Hertel's proposal in particular has generated extensive publicity, pitting 
eastside sports enthusiasts against their slow-growth neighbors. Given the 
attention focused on Hertel's proposed land swap, Ventura planner Karen Bates 
said she finds the timing of Moore's letter curious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Either this person is trying to blackball Hertel's proposal," she said, "or 
he wants to go ahead and build a park and could care less about developing the 
city's property. I just can't figure out the angle." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures, who calls Hertel a close, personal friend, 
also criticized the new proposal's arrival at such a late date. In any case, 
she said, she found little of interest in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dollars, right now, are irrelevant in my opinion," she said. "They're 
clouding the issue, which is do we want a regional park on that property?" 
</P>
<P>
 Measures said the Hertel land is the ideal site for a city park. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates said she also wonders how solid the proposal is, especially since the 
letter contains typographical errors which a more serious applicant might have 
caught before mailing the document. And especially, she added, since Moore's 
client insists on remaining anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said he realized a couple weeks ago that the council might be open to 
considering other offers on the lemon orchard, besides only Hertel's. He then 
discussed the idea with his client, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his client refusing to reveal his identity, Moore said: "There's a lot 
at stake here. I'm just a broker serving a client and they're saying, 'Don't 
talk to anyone right now."'

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; FUND-RAISER WILL ASSIST BOXING CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To be a great boxer, you need determination, courage and skill -- every fan of 
the sport knows that. 
</P>
<P>
 Few people, however, realize that it also takes money, said Manuel Herrera of 
La Colonia Youth Boxing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera and other Oxnard boxing fans are holding a fund-raiser today for La 
Colonia Youth Boxing Club, where about 25 youngsters from the Oxnard 
neighborhood train. The club, located inside the Oxnard Boys & Girls Club, has 
no sponsors.  
</P>
<P>
 "When people learn about youth boxing, they think of kids beating on each 
other," Herrera said. "What they don't realize is how many kids it helps stay 
out of trouble. It's a rough sport in every sense of the word, but especially 
when it comes to finding sponsors." 
</P>
<P>
 The association hopes to raise $20,000 to buy gloves, headgear and uniforms, 
and to cover travel expenses for its star boxers, who are often invited to 
amateur tournaments around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Present at the fund-raiser will be La Colonia's two young boxing standouts: 
Robert Garcia, an undefeated professional fighter, who has a 12-0 record 
including nine knockouts, and Fernando Vargas, who at 16 is the youngest-ever 
U.S. lightweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will begin at 1 p.m. at the Oxnard Boys & Girls Club, 126 E. 7th St. 
Adults will be asked for a minimum donation of $3 and children $1.50. For more 
information, call 983-6377. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; KIDS' ARTS WORKSHOP STILL HAS OPENINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Camarillo parents searching for interesting summer activities for their 
children may still sign their youngsters up for the city's annual Creative Arts 
Workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop, which runs for three weeks beginning Monday, has openings in 16 
of the more than 70 classes offered, including drama, puppetry, beginning sign 
language and T-shirt painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the workshop is generally open to children who will be entering 
kindergarten through seventh grades in the fall, this year's lineup of classes 
also includes a math and science workshop for girls in seventh through ninth 
grades. That workshop also has openings. 
</P>
<P>
 Run by the Camarillo branch of the American Assn. of University Women, the 
nonprofit Creative Arts Workshop has been held in the city for 26 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes are held from 9 a.m. to noon at Los Primeros Structured School, 2222 
E. Ventura Blvd. Because each class lasts about 45 minutes, children are able 
to take up to four courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee for each three-week course is $25. 
</P>

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; MORE FOOD VENDORS SOUGHT FOR BEACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In an effort to make Ventura's beaches and parks more attractive to residents, 
the city is increasing the number of food vendors to offer snacks at some of 
the city's most popular public spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are seeking applications from vendors interested in obtaining 
one-year permits to operate at Arroyo Verde Park, Marina Park, Surfers' Point 
at Seaside Park, and the base of the Ventura Pier.The deadline is Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make the beaches and parks more enjoyable for people," said Debbie 
Solomon, a public affairs coordinator for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they do not have any numbers, Solomon said police and parks officials 
have reported an increase in foot traffic on the beaches and parks so far this 
summer.  
</P>
<P>
 Two mobile food vendors have been selling food at the Ventura Pier for the 
last 18 months, and the city wants to increase that number. 
</P>
<P>
 Solomon said the city does not know yet how many permits it will issue, but 
officials hope to have a range of offerings including hot dogs, popcorn, ice 
cream and pretzel vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors applying for a permit should mention in their applications the type of 
food they can provide, the site and what hours they would operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications should be submitted to: City of Ventura, Greg Gilmer, Parks 
Division, P.O. Box 99, Ventura 93002. For information, 652-4556. CHRISTINA LIMA

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; NO-CONTEST 
PLEA IN FATAL CARJACKING OF 2 STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of two men accused in connection with the carjack killings of two 
Marymount College students pleaded no contest Friday to receiving stolen 
property and being an accessory after the fact of robbery.  
</P>
<P>
 Alberto Reygoza, 20, of Long Beach, will be sentenced to 32 months in prison 
on July 29, said Deputy Dist. Atty.Janet Moore. Reygoza and the accused gunman, 
Raymond Butler, were charged following the March 25 shooting deaths of Takuma 
Ito, a Japanese citizen, and Go Matsuura, a U.S. citizen born in Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 Reygoza and Butler, 19, had been scheduled to appear in court Monday for a 
preliminary hearing. The hearing will go on as scheduled for Butler, who is 
charged with two counts of murder with the special circumstances of murder 
during a robbery and multiple murder, Moore said.  
</P>
<P>
 Butler also faces two counts of robbery and two counts of carjacking, she 
said. Each count also alleges that he used a handgun in the commission of the 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The killings made headlines in Japan, where fatal shootings are rare and 
tourism interest in the United States is high. The killings prompted President 
Clinton to express his condolences to the grieving families and U.S. 
dignitaries to rush to counter charges in the Japanese news media that Southern 
California is a gun-infested crime zone.  
</P>
<P>
 Ito and Matsuura, both 19, were each shot in the back of the head about 11 on 
a Friday night in a supermarket parking lot on Western Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects fled in Ito's 1994 Honda Civic, which was found the next day in 
San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Both victims were attending Marymount College in Rancho Palos Verdes but were 
hoping to transfer to film schools at USC or UCLA.

 A little fanfare, please, for . . . the Official L.A. Fertilizer!The paychecks 
for L.A. city employees now carry ads trumpeting, "Top Gro: L.A.'s own compost, 
for sale at Fedco & Armstrong's."

 Ron Larson of Armstrong's confirmed that the West L.A. home and garden store

 "One yelled, 'Hey!' out the window to me and my infant son," she says. 
"Startled, I looked over, visions of drive-bys in my head. Instead, he asked,

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BOONE TO RUN FOR COLLEGE BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Karen Boone, who was appointed to the board of the Ventura County Community 
College District two years ago, has announced she will seek election in 
November to the five-member panel. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old trustee, who represents the Ventura area, said she wants to 
achieve several goals over the next four-year term."I've got concerns about the 
fiscal condition of the district," she said. "Building up the reserves is a 
priority for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Boone moved to California almost seven years ago from Michigan, where she 
worked as a bookkeeper and a department manager for a retail store. She said 
her accounting background will continue to aid her in making sound financial 
decisions for the three-campus district. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd also like to focus on streamlining various processes within the district, 
like student registration," Boone said. "That needs to be more efficient and 
more expeditious for the students." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said she would like to establish an annual math and science fair to 
promote interest in those subjects among high school students who plan to 
attend one of the three colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Boone, a homemaker, was appointed after Trustee Greg Kampf resigned to take a 
job out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate filing period for elected positions on the November ballot opens 
July 18. Two other seats on the college district governing board also will be 
contested this fall. JEFF McDONALD

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COMPUTERS TO AID IN TRAFFIC CITATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard Police Department will begin using hand-held computers next week to 
issue traffic citations in a project with the Ventura County Superior and 
Municipal courts, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The computers, which were donated by the courts, will increase the efficiency 
with which traffic tickets are processed and reduce manual data entry, 
officials said.It will also make it easier for officers to issue citations. 
</P>
<P>
 The computers will also enable Oxnard police to transfer traffic ticket 
information to the courts on a daily basis, giving the courts the ability to 
more quickly notify individuals of any bail amount due, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both agencies hope to eventually use the computers to process misdemeanor 
violations such as petty theft. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol began using hand-held computers in 1990. Oxnard 
police are expected to begin using the equipment Friday. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; WOMAN WHO 
SUED TO GAIN SPERM WINS LATEST BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who won the right to inherit frozen sperm left by her boyfriend won 
another legal battle on Friday when a judge dismissed a lawsuit claiming she 
should have prevented the man's suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 The man's children, William Everett Kane Jr. and Katherine Elizabeth Kane, 
filed a wrongful death lawsuit alleging that Deborah Ellen Hecht knew William 
E. Kane was suicidal and should have prevented his death in a Las Vegas hotel 
room in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra McMahon Irwin, the children's mother and attorney, claimed that Hecht 
did not try to stop the suicide because Kane had transferred $800,000 in assets 
to his lover, who also thought she was the beneficiary of a $1-million life 
insurance policy. Irwin said she would appeal the ruling in this case and the 
earlier decision giving the sperm to Hecht. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge threw it out because the law in California requires there to be a 
special relationship that is recognized by law for there to be a duty to 
prevent a suicide," said Marvin Rudnick, Hecht's attorney.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
MILLIONS IN MEDI-CAL FUNDS LOST, AUDIT SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An audit released this week of the county's medical billing practices 
indicates that the Department of Health Services lost millions of dollars 
because it failed to bill the Medi-Cal fund in time.  
</P>
<P>
 The report focused on the department's consolidated business office, which is 
responsible for getting reimbursements from the Medi-Cal program for inpatient 
medical care at three of the county's six public hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditor-Controller Alan Sasaki said in the report to the Board of Supervisors 
that the department will not be eligible for about $12 million in Medi-Cal 
reimbursements for unbilled accounts first identified in February, 1993. The 
Health Department had to write off about $9.2 million in Medi-Cal charges for 
the 1992-93 fiscal year "because the accounts exceeded the Medi-Cal billing 
time limit," Sasaki wrote.  
</P>
<P>
 Art Bernal, manager of the billing office, said the audit does not consider 
the complexity of Medi-Cal forms. Bernal said his department had 304 full-time 
employees in 1990, but budget cuts have forced him to cut 71 positions.

 The population of Los Angeles has grown slightly over the past year but is

SMOOTHER ROAD TO CITIZENSHIP; 100 TAKE PART IN RELAXED NATURALIZATION PROCESS 
AWAY FROM INS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maria Isabel Gonzalez wanted to become a citizen, but the native of Mexico did 
not look forward to the requisite trip to the U.S. Immigration and 
Naturalization Service offices, a destination that inspires dread in many. 
Stories of protracted delays, rude treatment and frustrating encounters with 
officialdom at INS headquarters in Downtown Los Angeles are legendary. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Gonzalez signed up to become a citizen at a community agency, took 
the required U.S. history and civics exam at a private testing service, and 
Friday had her final interview with an immigration officer -- on the distinctly 
non-threatening grounds of a church. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is much more family-like, more comfortable," Gonzalez, an almost-30-year 
resident of Southern California, declared as she waited to receive her 
naturalization certificate, embossed with the bald eagle symbol of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 She is one of 100 aspiring citizens who participated Friday in a novel project 
designed to expedite immigrants through the naturalization process, which 
confers U.S. citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 During 1994, naturalization sign-ups nationwide are expected to rival record 
levels, a testament to unprecedented immigration since the early 1980s. In the 
Los Angeles area, which has eclipsed New York as the largest source of new 
citizens, naturalization numbers are expected to exceed 90,000, almost doubling 
last year's total. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday, Los Angeles-based INS officers have attended to citizenship 
applicants exclusively at service headquarters, a place that many immigrants 
would just as soon avoid. So, in an effort to allay fears, the officers 
traveled to Angelica Lutheran Church in the heavily Latino Pico-Union district. 
</P>
<P>
 The result, officials say, was encouraging: More than 90 of the 100 applicants 
were expected to qualify for citizenship -- much higher than the 70% initial 
success rate among applicants Downtown. Those who qualified are scheduled to 
take the citizenship oath this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "The process was very clean," said Richard K. Rogers, INS district director in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities hope to repeat Friday's experiment and dispatch citizenship 
officers to neighborhood sites regularly, Rogers said. Working more closely 
with community groups, the district director explained, officials seek to 
reduce delays for citizenship-seekers, who now must wait 10 months from the 
time they file applications until they swear allegiance to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make the process more user-friendly, and give people better 
service," Rogers said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not an easy task for an agency that has developed notoriety -- 
disputed by INS administrators -- as cold, uncaring and often incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last week, Altagracia Arevalo, a citizenship applicant from El Salvador, 
said she was reduced to tears at INS headquarters when an officer yelled at her 
after she had waited all day inquiring about permission to travel outside the 
United States. The officer, she said, criticized her for applying for 
citizenship through a community group -- something that the INS is now publicly 
encouraging -- and then refused to listen to her request. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been treated like that before," said Arevalo, a 61-year-old 
grandmother and El Monte resident who has lived in the United States for almost 
40 years. "It was an ugly experience. No one should be treated that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, the INS district director, said the incident was being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's experiment was organized with the National Assn. of Latino Elected & 
Appointed Officials, which has been shepherding thousands of area residents 
through the citizenship application thicket. Association staffers had assisted 
all 100 applicants who were interviewed on Friday and prepared them for their 
encounters with INS officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants are eligible for citizenship after five years of legal residence, 
or three years if spouses of U.S. citizens. Aspiring citizens must show good 
moral character, pass a basic U.S. history and civics test, and demonstrate a 
knowledge of English (the language requirement is waived for some elderly 
residents). Many find the process daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Latino association and other groups, assisting would-be citizens is a 
means of increasing clout at the ballot box -- at a time when many believe that 
anti-immigrant sentiment is on the rise nationwide. Citizenship gives the right 
to vote, along with other benefits, such as access to certain government jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our democracy is in jeopardy in Los Angeles," said Councilman Mike Hernandez, 
who noted that nearly 1 million Angelenos -- more than one in four residents -- 
are non-citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The right to vote matters to Isabel Gonzalez. She is troubled by what she sees 
as an anti-immigrant attitude in Gov. Pete Wilson's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think immigrants help this country by working hard," said Gonzalez, a 
53-year-old cafeteria worker who resides in Maywood. "I hope the governor 
learns that he has to show heart to other races as well as his own." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, Mexican natives have been hesitant to renounce allegiance to 
their homeland and swear oaths to the United States. But Gonzalez said she has 
overcome nostalgia for the old country, particularly since her five children 
were all born on U.S. soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Valles, 41, is another Mexican immigrant eager to become a U.S. citizen. 
"I never thought it could happen so fast," Valles said Friday after completing 
his interview. 
</P>
<P>
 A machine operator who lives in Montebello, Valles recalled crossing illicitly 
into U.S. territory from Tijuana in 1977 with a group that included a pregnant 
woman and an 80-year-old grandmother. Valles later gained legal residence via 
the amnesty program of 1987-88, along with about 3 million other onetime 
illegal immigrants. Most amnesty recipients are only now becoming eligible for 
citizenship; many are wasting no time in applying. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all the harsh things people here are saying about people without papers, 
I think it's better I apply as soon as possible," Valles said. "I've had 
opportunities in this country that I would never have had in Mexico."

 The city of Norwalk has agreed to pay $225,000 to two city employees who claim 
they were sexually harassed by their boss, a veteran department head who was 
fired but then won a City Council seat.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jesse M. Luera was fired as director of social services in 1992 
after city social workers Peggy Jones Flores and Velia Vargas complained that 
Luera repeatedly made sexual advances, including grabbing their breasts or 
buttocks and offering to pay for sexual favors. 
</P>
<P>
 Luera, who has consistently denied the allegations, was dismissed by former 
City Manager Richard Powers in May, 1993, a decision that was upheld by the 
city's personnel board. Although the harassment claims dogged him throughout 
the campaign, Luera was elected to the council in April. The city manager 
resigned under pressure a month later. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores and Vargas, who filed the lawsuits against Luera and the city nearly a 
year ago, will split the settlement evenly. The city also agreed to pay the 
employees' health insurance for six months. Both women agreed to resign and not 
to seek new jobs with the city, according to the settlement.  
</P>
<P>
 The suit accused the city of failing to discipline Luera after several 
complaints were filed with the city manager from 1990 to 1992, and for 
tolerating a hostile environment for female employees.  
</P>
<P>
 Neither Luera nor his attorney, Augustin R. Jiminez, was available to comment 
on the agreement. Before his City Council victory, Luera had been president of 
the Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District board. He owns a dry-cleaning 
business in Norwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neither woman was happy about giving up her job as part of the settlement, 
according to their attorney, Samuel Paz. But they felt uncomfortable at work 
after Luera's council victory, and "felt continual pressure from his 
supporters" to leave, Paz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had Luera not won the election, they would have both wanted to stay on at 
City Hall. Hopefully, the compensation will be enough for them to move on and 
give them time to find new jobs," Paz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another harassment lawsuit against Luera, filed in the midst of April's City 
Council race, is pending. 
</P>
<P>
 In that lawsuit, Luera is accused of making improper sexual advances toward 
the city's child development program director, Rachel Pedraza, over a five-year 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedraza, who claims in her lawsuit that she has suffered "severe emotional and 
mental stress," has been on medical disability leave since last fall.  
</P>
<P>
 Luera has denied these accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 The city councilman faced similar allegations in 1983, when he was placed on 
30-day paid administrative leave after a city employee alleged that he made 
suggestive comments and was verbally abusive. An independent investigator found 
the allegations to be unsubstantiated.

PLANNED COUNTY SERVICE CUTS PROTESTED AT RALLY; BUDGET: UNION OFFERS 
ALTERNATIVE SPENDING PLAN, SAYS IT WOULD AVOID DRASTIC CLOSURES AND LAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 County workers, labor representatives and community activists on Friday 
rallied against proposed cuts in county services and offered an alternate 
spending plan they say would avoid deep cutbacks and layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 people gathered at a South-Central Los Angeles health clinic to 
denounce the proposed closure of dozens of pools, parks, libraries and clinics 
as a way of closing a $400-million to $500-million gap in the county's 
$14.7-billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to begin budget deliberations next week. 
</P>
<P>
 County Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed has estimated that the state 
budget signed by Gov. Pete Wilson on Friday could cost the county more than 
$350 million, on top of $107 million in local shortfalls that have yet to be 
closed. She has proposed deep cuts in law enforcement, social welfare, parks 
and recreation and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates attending Friday's rally argued that such cuts could prove 
devastating. They cited a shooting incident at a county hospital last year and 
recent public consternation over new fees at county swimming pools as evidence 
of the strains created by service cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cuts like these create tremendous tension, almost like a flash point, at 
places where government should be seamless and focused on providing services," 
said Gilbert Cedillo, general manager of Local 660 of the Service Employees 
International Union, which represents about half of the county's 84,000-member 
work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedillo contends that the county could avoid cuts by using assets and reserves 
more creatively. 
</P>
<P>
 Among alternative revenue sources offered by the union are: 
</P>
<P>
 * $55 million in various unused reserves identified in the 1994-95 fiscal 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 * $220 million through the sale or lease of county real estate, buildings and 
undeveloped land. The union bases its figure on a 1991 study by the county's 
Economy and Efficiency Commission that found that the county owns assets of 
between $22 billion and $40 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * $100 million projected to be found through an audit of county funds and 
accounts. The union believes that an independent audit would identify hidden 
accounts with money that could be used to fund services and programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedillo said the budget alternative was sent to Reed, and union 
representatives hope to meet with her before next week's deliberations.

LAST DEFENDANT IN DENNY CASE GETS PROBATION; COURTS: JUDGE RULES ON THREE-YEAR 
PENALTY FOR LANCE JEROME PARKER AFTER EMOTIONAL APPEAL BY HIS ATTORNEY. HE WAS 
FOUND GUILTY OF FIRING SHOTGUN AT EMPTY TRUCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After his attorney's emotional appeal for mercy, Lance Jerome Parker -- the 
last criminal defendant in the Reginald O. Denny beating case -- was sentenced 
Friday to three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things worked out really well," Parker said after the sentencing, tears 
welling up in his eyes. "It was just." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker, 28, was acquitted in May of two of five charges against him and the 
jury deadlocked on a third. But jurors convicted him of one felony count of 
firing a shotgun into an unoccupied vehicle -- Denny's truck -- and found him 
guilty of a misdemeanor vandalism charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution contended that Parker rode a motorcycle into the intersection 
of Florence and Normandie avenues -- a flash point of the Los Angeles riots -- 
a short time after the violence erupted there April 29, 1992. The riots had 
started after not-guilty verdicts were reached on four Los Angeles police 
officers in a state trial that stemmed from the beating of black motorist 
Rodney G. King. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Denny -- a white truck driver who had been pulled from the 
cab of his truck and severely beaten by black assailants -- was lying 
semiconscious near his gravel truck when Parker rode up, brandished the shotgun 
and fired a blast into the fuel tank of Denny's vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the district attorney's office, Parker left, then returned about 
45 minutes later and fired several more shots at the gas pumps of a nearby 
service station. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he been convicted of all five counts against him, Parker would have faced 
a maximum sentence of almost 10 years in prison. And even though the jury 
convicted him May 2 of just two of the charges, he still faced a maximum term 
of 3 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that Parker had introduced a "loaded, sawed-off, pistol-grip shotgun" 
into "an already serious situation," Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin McCormick said 
Friday that "it is important that there be a level of responsibility for one's 
conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker's attorney, La Chelle Woodert, acknowledged that responsibility, but 
she argued that the crimes for which Parker was convicted "did not happen in a 
vacuum." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Woodert said the violence that burst forth on April 29 "was the result of a 
lack of hope, a lack of faith in the justice system." 
</P>
<P>
 Describing her 6-foot, 4-inch, 310-pound client as a "gentle giant," she said 
that when when she first saw him in a jail cell, "he looked like a little boy 
lost. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Parker is a valuable member of the community, not a violent individual 
who should be locked up," Woodert said, her voice breaking and her eyes 
sparkling with tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not crying because I want you to be lenient," the defense attorney told 
Superior Court Judge Florence-Marie Cooper. "I'm crying because I know this 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the sentence, which includes time already served in County Jail, 
100 hours of community service and restitution to be calculated later, Cooper 
said she was "not unmindful of the seriousness of this crime . . . or the 
circumstances under which the crime occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker was asked why he was crying after sentence was passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to go back over two years of pain," he said. "I'm just glad everything 
is over with. Now I can go back to work, to church, to plan my life."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; DESPITE COMPLAINTS, SCHOOL PROJECT 
OKD

<P>
 Despite pleas from a handful of Newbury Park residents, the Conejo Valley 
school board decided Friday to continue with its plans to build a 
35,000-square-foot multipurpose room and cafeteria on the campus of Cypress 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council asked the school board to hold an emergency 
meeting after two homeowners complained that the proposed two-story structure 
would block their views. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors were also angry that the Conejo Valley Unified School District 
had not told them about the proposed project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a real slap in the face to the neighbors," Dee Minazzolitold the 
school board during its Friday morning meeting. Minazzoli's home is next to the 
area where the building is to be constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should have been notified," she said in an emotional speech. "There are 
things called ethics, integrity and courtesy." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members said it was unfortunate that the neighbors were not made aware 
of the plans but added that the project had been publicized for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors asked the board to relocate the proposed multipurpose room, but 
the school trustees said that would be too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be going ahead with it," trustee Dorothy Beaubien said Friday 
afternoon. "I know they're unhappy, but we'll do everything we can to make it 
as pleasant as possible." TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 24 CITED FOR SELLING ALCOHOL TO MINORS 
</P>

<P>
 Simi Valley authorities have issued citations to 24 businesses that sold 
alcohol to "decoys" under the legal drinking age of 21, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The undercover operation on June 30 and July 1 came in the wake of a 
California Supreme Court ruling in April that police may use underage decoys in 
operations to determine whether local stores, restaurants and bars are selling 
alcohol illegally to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Simi Valley operation, police sent an 18-year-old female and a 
19-year-old male to 66 retail businesses across the city. The decoys, who 
presented valid California driver's licenses when asked and were observed by 
undercover officers, were able to buy alcohol at 24 stores, or 36% of those 
contacted, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 In similar operations between 1988 and 1992, between 10% and 35% of Simi 
Valley businesses contacted sold liquor to minors, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Store personnel who sold to the decoys were issued misdemeanor citations for 
violating state laws prohibiting sale of alcoholic beverages to minors, and the 
names of the stores were sent to the state Department of Alcoholic Beverage 
Control, police said. Punishment could include a fine, liquor license 
suspension or, in some cases, license revocation, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A state Court of Appeal in San Francisco had ruled that such programs were 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the state's constitution prohibits the sale of alcohol to minors, the 
lower court ruled that it does not contain an exception for minors working for 
law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the state Supreme Court overturned that ruling, saying stores and other 
establishments can be fined or lose their licenses for selling to youthful 
undercover police recruits. CHRISTINA LIMA

 Moorpark City Councilman John Wozniak has announced that he will seek 
reelection in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Wozniak, 46, said Friday that he had considered not running for a second term 
because of his job at the Moorpark Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very time-consuming, and along with some personal considerations I 
wasn't sure I could devote the kind of time I need to," he said of his council 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Wozniak said a change in his work schedule as a storekeeper at the school 
district's warehouse, beginning Monday, will allow him more time to attend 
evening council meetings and other council-related committee meetings. SCOTT

THOUSAND OAKS WILL CONSIDER ISSUING BONDS TO HELP MALL OWNERS FUND RENOVATION; 
DEVELOPMENT: JANSS CORP. WOULD PAY SPECIAL TAX FOR NEXT 30 YEARS. COUNCIL WILL 
BE ASKED TO AUTHORIZE UP TO $35 MILLION IN FINANCING. 
</P>

<P>
 Short of cash but long on ambition, Janss Mall developers on Tuesday will ask 
the Thousand Oaks City Council to help arrange financing for a major face lift 
at the open-air shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will consider issuing bonds to generate quick cash for the 
Janss Mall renovation project. To reimburse the city, the Janss Corp. would pay 
a special tax for the next 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of three decades, the mall owners will have paid back both interest 
and principal. Still, they expect their total costs to be less than if they 
took out a conventional bank loan, because municipal bonds typically carry 
lower interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the Janss Corp. fail to pay the taxes, the city could claim the entire 
mall as collateral. Thus the city's finance director, Robert Biery, has 
described the financing plan as prudent. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mayor Alex Fiore on Friday said he is comfortable that the bond issue 
would pose no risk to the city or to taxpayer funds because the mall stands as 
collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 And mall developer Bill Janss agreed that his firm has guaranteed to repay the 
bonds. "We're taxing ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 During a public hearing Tuesday night, Janss will ask council members to 
authorize up to $35 million in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But initially, he will request only about $18 million in bonds, to pay for a 
three-story parking garage, new landscaping and street improvements. He will 
ask for additional bonds, up to the proposed $35-million cap, only if costs 
soar beyond his expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Janss Mall occupying a central place in the city's geography and 
history, several council members said they were inclined to back the bond 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would enable a mall that needs refurbishment to have revitalization take 
place," Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski said. "What is better for the city -- to 
let a large development like that languish, or to assist it?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Frank Schillo, who has been concerned that the mall's expansion 
could hurt small business owners elsewhere in Thousand Oaks, questioned the 
financing scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Before approving the deal, he said he wanted more details about the Janss 
Corp.'s credit history. "I asked about their financial situation before and the 
guy (from the Janss Corp.) gave me a bunch of smoke," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo also said he would question Janss Mall owners about the status of 
negotiations with tenants who will be displaced during the renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Janss Corp. has offered to move affected tenants to new locations, or to 
buy out their leases. But eight business owners have refused the deals, holding 
out for better compensation or assurances that they will be able to reoccupy 
their existing stores after the renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to move," said Bruce Markowitz, owner of Yogurt Plus. "I'm not 
in the moving business. I want to sell yogurt." 
</P>
<P>
 With the bulldozers revving up to begin renovations in August, Janss said he 
believed the negotiations would wrap up soon. From his frozen yogurt and 
sandwich shop, however, Markowitz expressed doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't even come anywhere near (agreement on) terms," he said. "The last 
people (Janss) cares about are us -- the people who keep the mall running and 
make him reasonably successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Once renovated, the Janss Mall -- to be renamed the Janss Marketplace -- will 
feature a multiplex cinema, a Barnes & Noble bookstore, The Good Guys 
electronics store, The Wherehouse record store and a food court. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Janss confirmed that executives at Mervyn's department store are 
also ready and eager to move into the mall. Mervyn's officials have coyly 
refused to ink a deal, holding out until the city agrees to allow them to 
install monument signs at the mall entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that three council members have signaled their intention to permit the 
signs, Mervyn's officials have said "they're anxious to proceed," Janss said.

THE FIGHT AGAINST DOS VIENTOS DEVELOPMENT MOVES TO CITY HALL; NEWBURY PARK: 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS OPPOSED TO 220-HOME INITIAL PHASE HAVE WON SUPPORT FROM 
COUNTY AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Newbury Park activists will take their underdog fight against the Dos Vientos 
development to City Hall next week -- and they'll be backed by county and 
federal officials who believe the project could foul air, snarl traffic and 
trample wildlife habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's foes will get a chance to explain their fears at a public 
hearing Tuesday night, when council members will consider allowing construction 
of 220 single-family homes on Dos Vientos Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed as a gated community, the houses represent the first stage of a 
massive development that could eventually include 2,350 homes on the gentle 
foothills off Potrero Road in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Local environmentalists, backed by City Council members Elois Zeanah and Jaime 
Zukowski, have fought the Dos Vientos development vigorously for years. 
</P>
<P>
 With escalating anger, they have called city leaders immoral for considering a 
project that would pave scenic backcountry. And they have blasted the 
development as ill-conceived and poorly planned. 
</P>
<P>
 As they gear up for Tuesday's meeting, the home-grown activists have earned 
support from the Ventura County Department of Public Works and the National 
Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The park service's regional superintendent, David Gackenbach, has written a 
scathing letter suggesting that the Dos Vientos project could ruin sensitive 
ecosystems and degrade nearby hiking trails. 
</P>
<P>
 In the six-page letter, Gackenbach told the council that judging the project 
based primarily on "the economic benefit for the community . . . is myopic." 
</P>
<P>
 The city might enjoy a temporary fiscal boost from the development, Gackenbach 
wrote, but such gains would wither quickly. Meanwhile, citizens "will suffer 
from the effects of environmental depredation forever," he warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Such fiery rhetoric appears to have caught the attention of at least one 
gung-ho Dos Vientos supporter, Councilman Frank Schillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo helped negotiate a binding contract that the city signed with two Dos 
Vientos developers back in 1987. That document guaranteed the developers the 
right to build up to 2,350 homes in the rolling backcountry. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, the developers promised to pay the city $12.6 million. They also 
agreed to contribute money to two of the council's pet projects: the Civic Arts 
Plaza endowment fund and the Under One Roof campaign for social-service groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Since brokering the agreement, Schillo has fervently defended it, arguing 
again and again that the city has an obligation to uphold the deal and allow 
development to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that reasoning, next week's hearing might be considered a formality, as 
the council reviews the specific locations and designs of the initial 220 homes 
slated for Dos Vientos. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, after scanning the environmental critiques, Schillo said he 
would not blindly approve the construction. Before giving developers a green 
light, Schillo said he would demand adequate answers to residents' concerns 
about environmental impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have to find that the (impacts) are not a problem, and I'm not sure I 
could find that right now," Schillo said. "I'll have to decide at the public 
hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo is locked in a tight race for county supervisor with local attorney 
Trudi Loh, who has run as an environmentalist opposing the Dos Vientos project. 
</P>
<P>
 A pro-Loh group, Residents to Preserve Newbury Park, recently circulated a 
flyer urging voters to lobby Schillo to vote down the project. And other 
council members said they sensed the political pressure building to overturn 
the development agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's astounding, the sense of betrayal" voters in Newbury Park feel, Zukowski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attitude of the (council majority) is that we have this development 
agreement so our hands are tied. But what is the purpose of the city but to 
protect the long-term welfare of our residents?" Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the strong anti-Dos Vientos movement, however, activist Mike Dunn said 
he believes the council will end up approving the 220-home tract. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attitude on the street right now is that our presentation Tuesday night 
won't make any difference because the decision's already been made," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn predicted a 3-2 vote in favor of the developers. "Then we'll all go home 
and the real battle will start the next day, with a probable lawsuit" by 
environmentalists, he said.

ILL CHILD'S SPIRITUALITY COULD EASE PAIN; DYING: EXPERTS SAY THAT A CHILD'S 
RELIGION CAN PLAY A ROLE IN THEIR TREATMENT, JUST AS IT CAN FOR ADULTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Death was near for the 11-year-old boy, but his parents worried that the sick 
child had no sense of what it meant to die. 
</P>
<P>
 With his mother in the room, a doctor undertook a wide-ranging talk with the 
boy, touching on the Big Bang Theory and the David and Goliath story. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the child asked the doctor if she prayed. The boy said that 
every night, he said a prayer: "Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my 
soul to keep, if I should die before I wake. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 As the boy recited the prayer, he listened intently, said Dr. Diane Komp, a 
pediatric oncologist and professor at the Yale University School of Medicine in 
New Haven, Conn. He lived the next day -- his last -- without pain, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when he listened to himself talking, that was more important than 
what anyone could say to him," Komp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in the field of pain management in severely ill children say a child's 
religious or spiritual nature can play a role in easing physical and emotional 
pain.  
</P>
<P>
 Last month, health care professionals working on behalf of the World Health 
Organization announced draft guidelines for easing pain in children with 
cancer. They include incorporating a child's spiritual background into care. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're advocating holistic care for children. In holistic care, you would take 
into account the spiritual background, the religious background, the cultural 
and ethnic background of the child and its family," said Susan Fowler-Kerry, 
who teaches nursing at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon and was a 
co-editor of the new guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines, which also recommend treating children with morphine and 
codeine when necessary, are expected to be formally released within six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have a lot to learn from kids and how they view the world and 
dying," said Fowler-Kerry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids live largely in a much more spiritual dimension than we do," said the 
Rev. Tom McDonnell, a Roman Catholic priest who does missionary work with 
children in Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
 He said children can ask pain to go away for a while or transfer it to a doll. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the child understands about God, what the child understands about death, 
often takes away physical pain," Komp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Komp encourages families to heal troubled relationships when a child is 
gravely ill. Children who see their parents in distress often express it in 
physical pain, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to understand the meaning of the pain to the person who is 
experiencing it," said Dr. Richard Patt, an anesthesiologist and deputy chief 
of pain and symptom management at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer 
Center in Houston. "It's kind of tough to find out things like this in 10 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, said Fowler-Kerry, health care workers are too caught up in the 
fast pace of disease treatment to hear patients' spiritual concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Those can range from the need of Hutterite women in western Canada to wear 
their caps at all times to a dying toddler's visions of a pain-free existence 
with Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler-Kerry recalled a Canadian Indian woman whose leg was going to be 
amputated -- a dilemma for someone who believes the body must be buried whole. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their concern was, 'What's going to happen to my leg after it's cut off?' " 
she said. "They wouldn't get to that higher spirituality without one leg. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 "With children it's the same kind of recognition. If those cultural 
differences are important to the parents, they're also going to be important to 
the child." 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler-Kerry told the story of a 2 1/2-year-old boy whose mother didn't want 
the hospital staff to tell him he was dying. But as Fowler-Kerry rocked the 
child in her arms, she said he found a way of saying he already knew. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to see Santa Claus," the tot said, describing how he would run and 
jump and play with lots of toys when he saw Santa. It was two months before 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It won't hurt anymore when I'm with Santa Claus. . . . All the 'owees' are 
going to go away," he told Fowler-Kerry. "What he's telling me is, he's going 
to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Fowler-Kerry said the boy's mother told her, "Maybe he's trying to make it 
easier for us."

METHODISTS AIMING FOR DIVERSITY IN THE PULPIT

 Congregations with largely white memberships in Toluca Lake and Tarzana will 
welcome Filipino American women as pastors this month in striking examples of 
women and ethnic minorities increasingly filling United Methodist Church posts 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a Korean American associate minister will augment the staff at 
Northridge United Methodist Church. Two more white clergywomen will join 
pastoral ranks in the Valley, one replacing a male minister in North Hills and 
another going on the staff at Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Methodist Church has few Latino congregations in the area, but 
Mexican-born David Tinoco last month was the first Latino to be named 
superintendent for the Riverside District. Tinoco replaced the Rev. Willie 
Foreman, an African American who was named pastor of the mostly white St. 
Mark's Church in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The increasingly multicultural Wilshire United Methodist Church, which had 
always had a white pastor until this summer, began July with the Rev. Osmond 
Lindo, a minister with a black and Latino heritage, heading the 
English-speaking congregation. The Korean, Filipino and Hispanic congregations 
worshiping there have pastors of the same heritage, and the Rev. Chang Soon Lee 
serves as Wilshire's senior pastor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have felt it is timely and crucial to bring in more women clergy and 
racial-ethnic minorities, especially in the San Fernando Valley," said the Rev. 
Brandon Cho, the Chatsworth-based district superintendent. Cho oversees 62 
churches, nearly half of them in the Valley area. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointments, which were effective July 1, reflect the recommendations of 
district superintendents such as Cho, a Korean American, and the final 
decisions of Bishop Roy I. Sano, a Japanese American who leads the 
denomination's California-Pacific Conference, or region, from the Pasadena 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the United Methodist "itinerant" system of rotating ministerial 
assignments, a fair number of pastoral changes are announced each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty of about 120 recent ministerial changes in the conference were 
"cross-cultural" appointments -- those in which the pastor's racial or ethnic 
heritage was different from that of the assigned congregation, Sano said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can proceed in this direction because of the graciousness and openness of 
congregations to accept pastors from a different cultural background," said 
Sano, who succeeded Bishop Jack Tuell two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8.7-million-member United Methodist Church, the nation's second-largest 
Protestant denomination, has worked for decades toward churchwide racial and 
ethnic diversification and opportunities for female ministers. The trend is 
accelerating in Sano's region, which covers Southern California and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one white male is among 22 candidates for full ministerial status. Of 
seven elders -- the next step to full minister -- three were white women, two 
were Asian men and two were African American women. Among 15 deacons, "only one 
is an Anglo man, four are Anglo women and the rest are Asian or Pacific in 
background," Sano said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Toluca Lake United Methodist Church, the Rev. Lisa Reyes said she was 
excited about leading her first service last Sunday at the 150-member 
congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter and granddaughter of ministers, Chicago-born Reyes was graduated 
from seminary in the Philippines but returned to the United States because her 
family was here, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes was coordinating the Filipino ministry in the United Methodists' Long 
Beach district when she was appointed to the Toluca Lake church, which has no 
Filipino members. 
</P>
<P>
 Most women clergy of Asian background have found that they are accepted as 
pastors only in non-Asian United Methodist congregations because older Asian 
church members, male and female, often oppose the idea of women pastors, Reyes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Earlier, I was supposed to go to a church which had some Filipino members," 
Reyes said. But an older Filipino woman on the church's pastor-parish relations 
committee, which interviewed pulpit candidates, didn't want a female minister, 
Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that Korean American women clergy face the same cultural obstacle.  
</P>
<P>
 Cho agreed that Asian American women ministers have difficulty "dealing with 
the traditional male mind-set of Asian culture that is in fact oppressive to 
female pastors, and to younger pastors in general." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a cultural gap here that needs to be addressed," he said.

SIMI SCHOOLS APPEAL TO PARENTS FOR HELP IN CURBING VIOLENCE; SAFETY: THE PLEA 
COMES SOON AFTER ONE SUMMER SESSION STUDENT IS CUT WITH A KNIFE BY A CLASSMATE. 
</P>

<P>
 The day after a 14-year-old girl admitted slashing a classmate with a knife, 
Simi Valley school officials issued a broad appeal Friday for parents to help 
stop campus violence. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent home with more than 500 summer school students, Simi Valley 
Unified School District officials also urged students to turn in classmates who 
bring knives, guns and other weapons to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be stressed that conflict should be settled with words, not 
violence," wrote Jan Britz, summer principal at Hillside Junior High, in the 
letter to parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they know of a weapon or sharp object on campus, they must tell an adult," 
Britz wrote. "It is extremely difficult to stop fights and weapons from coming 
on any campus unless students are willing to report them." 
</P>
<P>
 Campus safety has been under intense scrutiny in Simi Valley since an 
eighth-grade boy was fatally stabbed in February. And concern intensified 
following Wednesday's after-school attack by one Hillside student on a 
13-year-old classmate. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Susan Parks said school officials dispatched the letter to 
inform parents of the incident and avoid the type of criticism directed at 
district officials after the killing of Valley View Junior High student Chad 
Hubbard six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want parents to think we were trying to hide something," she said. 
"After the Valley View (stabbing), the slightest little thing would happen, 
rumors would fly and somebody would accuse us of hiding something." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks said school officials also wanted to use the incident to remind parents 
of the importance of teaching nonviolent ways to settle differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents are just going to have to take that role," she said. "You hear 
parents all the time say, 'I taught my kids to stand up and whack them one.' 
The only hope we have for kids lies with the parents and adults." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Hushka, a Simi Valley parent serving on a school safety task force, 
said the district reacted quickly after the killing of Chad Hubbard, but did 
not continue to press the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, they'll use this as one more reason to develop conflict-resolution 
programs," she said of Wednesday's incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley school board is expected to discuss long-term ways to improve 
campus safety at meetings next fall. Recommendations from the district task 
force include tightening dress codes, teaching cultural awareness and keeping 
suspended students is special classes on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Debbie Sandland praised Britz for sending the letter home so 
quickly after Wednesday's fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a high-profile incident," she said. "The Chad Hubbard killing was not 
even a year ago and people are concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 According to police and school officials, Wednesday's fight began when a 
14-year-old girl began yelling curses at a 13-year-old female classmate on the 
Hillside campus. A short time later the girls walked off the campus and began 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 During the exchange, the 13-year-old was cut several times on the chest and 
arms, police said. She was treated at Simi Valley Hospital, but the injuries 
were not reported to school officials until later. On Thursday, the 14-year-old 
turned herself into police and admitted using a short, retractable razor knife 
during the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley Police Lt. Mark Layhew said the attack is still under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Parks said although fights during summer school are rare, 
violence involving teen-agers typically increases during the summer. And, she 
said, it is not unusual for junior high students to be involved. "They don't 
think about consequences," she said. "They allow the emotions of the moment to 
carry them to this."

OAK PARK'S REQUEST FOR ITS OWN ZIP CODE IS REJECTED; MAIL: BEILENSON AND 
VANDERKOLK APPEAL THE DECISION. BUT THE U. S. POSTAL SERVICE SAYS IT IS NOT 
LIKELY TO REVERSE ITS POSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U. S. Postal Service has rejected Oak Park's request for its own ZIP code, 
despite insistence by residents of the affluent community that sharing a ZIP 
code with part of Los Angeles County costs them money. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) announced Friday that postal 
officials in Washington, D. C., denied a request he made with Supervisor Maria 
VanderKolk on behalf of Oak Park residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park has long shared a ZIP code with the Los Angeles County city of Agoura 
Hills, even though the unincorporated community of nearly 15,000 lies entirely 
within the boundaries of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say that means they must continuously battle with insurance agents, 
sales clerks and mail-order companies who try to charge them Los Angeles County 
rates instead of cheaper Ventura County rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "This costs the county revenues too," said Kent Behringer, a member of Oak 
Park's Municipal Advisory Council.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents say many mail-order companies, judging Oak Park addresses by their 
ZIP codes, automatically send sales taxes to Los Angeles County, instead of 
Ventura County. Even the state Department of Motor Vehicles has assumed Oak 
Park car owners live in Los Angeles, residents say, and improperly divert 
registration fees to Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may not amount to a few million dollars over time," Behringer said. "But 
if you put all the revenues together it would amount to a tidy little sum that 
probably could have been used to keep our library going or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Although residents acknowledge their concern is largely financial, they also 
say having their own ZIP code would help establish a sense of identity for the 
unincorporated community. 
</P>
<P>
 The original request was approved at both local and regional postal 
authorities before being rejected by officials at the U. S. Postal Service's 
national headquarters in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson and VanderKolk have already sent a letter of appeal to the post 
office, citing loss of revenue to Ventura County as well as confusion and 
potential overcharges to Oak Park residents as reasons for the request. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're of course very concerned and disappointed," said Beilenson aide Diane 
Kinzer Brown. "So we've appealed it immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 But Postal Service spokeswoman Terri Bouffiou said the same officials who just 
rejected the plea will review the appeal as well, and that they aren't likely 
to change their minds. "I think they are going to review it and say there are 
no different circumstances from the first appeal so they will reject it again," 
Bouffiou said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in the Postal Service's Van Nuys office also filed an appeal for Oak 
Park, she said, which has already been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a local level we supported their request and we see their point," Bouffiou 
said. "It would be nice if we could grant each request." 
</P>
<P>
 But she said the post office had ruled against Oak Park because they base such 
decisions solely on the volume of mail going into a community. 
</P>
<P>
 "ZIP codes are for efficient sorting of the mail," Bouffiou said. "They can't 
be assigned on the basis of a community wanting them, because if they were we 
would quickly run out of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park resident David Ross, who has been asking for a separate ZIP code for 
the community for years, said he was frustrated and disappointed by the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a feeling that their rejection was based on not really understanding 
the issues," Ross said. "If they need letters or testimonials or anything I 
would be more than happy to participate." 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection states it was "based on the fact that the current ZIP code 
adequately meets the need of the community involved. Additionally the growth 
projections in the request package did not indicate a need for an additional 
ZIP code at this time or in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson aide Brown said she believed the post office should have responded 
to specific financial concerns mentioned in Beilenson and VanderKolk's first 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They did not address any of the issues we brought up," Brown said. "We still 
feel this request is reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park ZIP code advocates say they have made at least one gain in their 
quest; more residents now know to check sales receipts and mail-order invoices, 
and question their insurance companies about their rates. And the fight, they 
say, is not over yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't forget about it," Behringer said. "At least we made it to Washington 
this time."

OBITUARIES ; ROBERT EARLE PEGG; COMMUNITY ACTIVIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Earle Pegg, a community activist in Simi Valley who served as foreman 
of the Ventura County grand jury and twice ran for elected office, has died of 
cancer. He was 68. 
</P>
<P>
 His funeral Friday was attended by hundreds of mourners. 
</P>
<P>
 A resident of Simi Valley since 1968, Pegg served on the board of numerous 
service clubs, including the Elks Club, the Kiwanis Club and a chapter of the 
Salvation Army. He also helped establish the Free Clinic of Simi Valley and was 
a founder of Simi Valley Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had this amazing ability to stand there and talk to you, and when you came 
away from him, you realized you'd just volunteered to do something for some 
good group or organization," said Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton, who attended 
the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Pegg ran unsuccessfully for a seat on the Simi Valley school board. 
Two years later, he served as foreman of the Ventura County grand jury, before 
resigning to run for the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Before retiring, Pegg worked in the collection division of the Internal 
Revenue Service's Oxnard office. Before that he was an insurance salesman and 
served on a committee organizing ticket sales for the 1984 Olympics in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1943 to 1966, Pegg was in the Navy. He was discharged with the rank of 
chief yeoman. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his wife, Deanna. He had three sons and four daughters from 
two marriages.

 Triathlete Bernard Donner underwent surgery Friday morning to save his left 
leg from the ravages of "flesh-eating bacteria," which apparently entered his 
body through a shaving cut as he bicycled near his Santa Barbara home Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donner remained in critical condition, but it is encouraging that the 
streptococcus infection has not spread beyond the leg, said Dr. A. Richard 
Grossman, medical director of the Sherman Oaks Hospital burn center. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman said he and Dr. Michel Brones, another burn center surgeon, had 
temporarily covered an opening on Donner's left thigh about 12 inches long and 
6 inches wide with cadaver skin, a practice also used in treating burn victims. 
Next week, the doctors hope to begin replacing the cadaver skin with Donner's 
own skin. 
</P>
<P>
 The wound was the result of necrotizing faciitis -- a rare manifestation of 
the same Group A streptococcus bacteria that causes the common, usually 
harmless, strep throat. Since Donner felt the first pains Sunday night, the 
infection has destroyed half the muscle tissue in his left leg, Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman said the infection has not spread. "At this point we're treating him 
like any other burn patient," he said. "I'm encouraged today, but we're not 
going to be out of the woods until he walks out of here. However, we hope to be 
having him walking with crutches in two to three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Until his next round of skin grafts, Donner will spend much of his time in 
Sherman Oaks Hospital's hyperbaric chamber, which promotes healing by forcing 
pressurized oxygen into the blood. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime Santa Barbara lifeguard and swim camp counselor, Donner also runs, 
bikes and swims in triathalons.With rehabilitation, Grossman said, "I believe 
he'll go back and try and run again." 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference, Grossman also sought to allay public fears of the 
infection.

TROUPE BRINGS DEAF CULTURE INTO THE HEAR AND NOW; BENEFIT: QUIET ZONE WILL 
PRESENT MAGIC ACTS, MIME, SKITS AND LIP-SYNCED SONGS IN SIGN LANGUAGE AT THE 
IRVINE BARCLAY.

 Quiet Zone Theatre, an amateur troupe catering to the deaf and hard of 
hearing, will present magic acts, mime, skits and lip-synced songs on its 
seventh annual benefit program tonight at Irvine Barclay Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything will be presented in sign language, but charter member Joshua 
Vecchione assures that a "voice interpreter" will translate for those who don't 
understand the hand signals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show is for everyone," says Vecchione, who made his acting debut with the 
all-volunteer, nonprofit troupe seven years ago. He has moved up to produce and 
direct this year's show. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the cast and crew of 62 Orange County residents are deaf or hard 
of hearing; the remainder are hearing sign-language students from local 
community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always really liked our whole purpose, and I just continued to grow with 
Quiet Zone," Vecchione said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 That purpose is to provide entertainment for the deaf and hard of hearing 
(like Vecchione), raise funds for nonprofit organizations serving the deaf, and 
introduce more people to "the deaf culture" and the "beauty of sign language," 
Vecchione said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group further creates an all-too-rare opportunity for members of the deaf 
community to develop and display their talents, he said in a phone interview 
from the Mission Viejo jewelry store he owns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen some very shy people, but put them on stage, and you can't get them 
off," he said with an infectious laugh. "All of a sudden, all this hidden 
talent comes out. I get a thrill out of seeing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's two-hour program, presented earlier this year to sellout crowds at 
Laguna Playhouse and Irvine's University High School, will benefit Taft 
Elementary School in Santa Ana (whose hard-of-hearing principal, Steven T. 
Longacre, will perform magic tricks in the show). It will also benefit health 
education programs at University High School and, among other things, pay for 
one local child to attend Deaf Kids Camp in Three Rivers, Calif., near Sequoia 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Lip-syncing performers not only mouth and sign words to pop hits, but also 
dance and act out a short narrative in costume. For instance, dancers will pop 
out of graveyard coffins for Michael Jackson's "Thriller" (mimicking the song's 
video), and a toy maker will make his toys come alive for Janet Jackson's 
"Control." 
</P>
<P>
 Signing a song "is not visually entertaining for the deaf," Vecchione said, 
"unless you create a story line and make it visual." 
</P>
<P>
 Every lip-synced word and all signed gestures and dance moves are memorized, 
as is the musical timing to which they must be executed, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, he said, speakers blasting the songs are placed backstage, and, if a 
deaf performer is off-tempo or loses his or her place in a song, visual cues -- 
such as a head scratch -- are given by hearing performers sharing the stage to 
get things back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 Skits on the program include one in which Vecchione, dressed as a baby in 
diapers, pulls someone out of the audience for an impromptu "mime about 
babies." 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," he said. "It's all unrehearsed, and sometimes you'll get someone 
who really goes with the flow. Sometimes they need a little encouragement." 
</P>
<P>
 Quiet Zone members have also performed at Disneyland, Knott's Berry Farm and 
at municipal events. Some will take part July 16 in a Community Deaf Festival 
sponsored by Hands of Praise, a deaf outreach ministry of the Main Place 
Christian Fellowship, whose congregation once met in a movie theater at the 
MainPlace/Santa Ana mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations accepted for such engagements help fund the troupe's expenses, 
Vecchione said, including rent on a 2,000-square-foot rehearsal hall in Laguna 
Hills. This fall, the troupe hopes to launch sign-language and other workshops 
at the facility, which it secured in April and also uses for storage and prop 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quiet Zone Theatre's seventh annual benefit performance is tonigh t at 
Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. 7 p.m . $12. (714) 854-4646. 
* The Main Place Christian Fellowship's Community Deaf Festival, with arts and 
crafts, information booths and entertainment, is July 16 at 1701 E. Edinger 
Ave., Building H, Santa Ana. 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Free. (714) 547-3416.

KREMLIN PREPARES REFORM OF BOLSHOI; THEATER: PENDING MANAGEMENT CHANGES MAY 
MEAN LOSS OF JOBS FOR TOP-LEVEL EMPLOYEES, BUT ARTISTS WELCOME THE DEMISE OF 
ANOTHER 'TOTALITARIAN DRAGON.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Any day now, theater insiders say, a big shake-up is finally going to hit the 
Big Theater -- better known as the Bolshoi, Russia's premier performance 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Scandal has been simmering at the Bolshoi for years as the prestigious 
theater, long seen as the crowning glory of Russian culture, bled top 
performers to the West and engaged in vicious in-fighting over its artistic 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 But only this week did the Kremlin indicate at long last that it would 
intervene. Sergei Filatov, President Boris N. Yeltsin's chief of staff, told 
the Itar-Tass news agency Thursday that a pending decree would put the 
Bolshoi's staff on a new employment plan "on the basis of a contract system and 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Bolshoi workers believe, none of their jobs are safe anymore 
-- particularly those of the theater's longtime creative masters -- ballet czar 
Yuri Grigorovich, opera director Yevgeny Raykov and orchestra leader Alexander 
Lazarev. 
</P>
<P>
 The Moscow newspaper Vecherny Klub, or Evening Club, reported this week that 
the theater's general director, Vladimir Kokonin, had "liquidated" those top 
creative posts in order to exercise more power himself over what performances 
the Bolshoi puts on, since he bears ultimate responsibility.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Bolshoi officials said Friday, no jobs have actually been eliminated. 
The theater employs some 2,000 people, including 200 in opera, 200 in ballet 
and 200 in the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one has been fired yet. No one has seen this decree yet," said the 
Bolshoi's deputy director, Valery Zakharov. "It is too early to speak about any 
changes." 
</P>
<P>
 If, however, the Bolshoi is indeed in for sweeping change at the top, the news 
will bring rejoicing in many quarters, especially from performers bitterly 
disillusioned by how the theater is run. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decree would be a most welcome step that would finally destroy one of the 
last remaining strongholds of the Soviet totalitarian regime in Russia," said 
Gediminis Taranda, formerly one of the brightest stars of the Bolshoi ballet. 
"First, the KGB network in the theater fell, then the Communist Party 
organization and now this system of artistic directors, which is the third head 
of the old totalitarian dragon still riding the chariot of the Bolshoi."  
</P>
<P>
 Taranda was fired last February -- technically for missing some performances 
while he was working abroad, but actually, it appears, because he had been 
leading an opposition movement within the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow theater critic Anatoly Agamirov also hailed the prospect of new blood 
in the Bolshoi leadership, saying that the theater had turned into "a big 
collective farm." 
</P>
<P>
 "The director and head masters -- that is artistic directors -- ruled over 
everything the way they saw fit, and performers -- ballet dancers, singers and 
orchestra members -- led a very miserable existence, being totally dependent on 
the whims of their masters," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that ballet master Grigorovich had not produced a new ballet in 15 
years, though he had rearranged and revived a few old productions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bolshoi's opera and ballet repertories have become a particular bone of 
contention over the past five years, narrowing in Moscow to four or five operas 
a month -- almost all by Russian composers -- and about as many ballets. 
Critics and performers complained that the Bolshoi was growing ever mustier, 
losing its creative edge just at the moment when it could have been taking 
advantage of its post-Communist creative freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of top Bolshoi stars have left in recent years to work for other 
Russian theaters or abroad, where they enjoy more artistic liberty and 
incomparably bigger salaries. Among them were such celebrities as ballet stars 
Maya Plisetskaya, Andris Liepa and Irek Mukhamedov, as well as top singers 
Vladimir Atlantov, Tamara Milashkina and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the atmosphere at the Bolshoi appears amazingly poisonous. A 
half-dozen actors and musicians contacted by The Times on Friday would speak 
only if they could remain anonymous. One official called back from a phone 
booth and exclaimed, "Don't you know that all the phones in the theater are 
tapped?" 
</P>
<P>
 Some used the terms "snake pit" and "hornets' nest" to describe the ambience 
at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolshoi performers have good reason to be depressed. Although they work at 
what is probably Russia's most renowned cultural institution, mid-level 
performers generally earn only about $100 a month. Most depend heavily on 
foreign tours, during which they can earn from $30 to $100 a day. Those foreign 
earnings are meant in part to cover expenses, but most performers bring canned 
food from home to avoid shelling out their precious allowances. 
</P>
<P>
 Even their building may be on the verge of collapse. Built over an underground 
river, the columned pink Bolshoi edifice in central Moscow is in drastic need 
of repair, and officials say it may need to close next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding further to the gloom are employees' fears that life under Kokonin, the 
general director, may be no better than under their current masters. Like the 
artistic directors, Kokonin, too, is a leftover from the old Soviet days of 
Communist control of the arts.

'LOLLAPALOOZA': A SMASHING START; THE SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Backstage at "Lollapalooza '94," Nick Cave looks aggravated and hot after 
playing one of the most potent sets of the long afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminal rock artist's mustard-yellow shirt and creased brown '60 slacks 
are wilted from the 100-plus-degree heat and hang limp on his wiry frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Cave is characteristically unhappy with his performance, but even more so with 
the audience's reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, I thought it was kind of frightening," he says from 
behind his mirrored shades inside his dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kept looking out and thinking I saw giant question marks over 
everyone's head. They looked utterly confused," he said of the reaction to his 
experimental Gothic music. 
</P>
<P>
 Cave's feelings underscore the contradictions many fans and musicians have 
expressed about "Lollapalooza" since it was launched in 1991 with the mission 
of presenting the best of the alternative rock world to an audience beyond the 
club and small hall circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Filling the gap between the weird and the comfortable is a difficult task. 
"Lollapalooza's" challenge is to sell tickets without selling out its integrity 
by booking acts that are too safe.  
</P>
<P>
 Balancing what's genuinely on the edge and what sells is the crux of a 
continuing debate among alternative rock fans. Last summer's lineup, headed by 
Alice in Chains and Primus, was especially criticized for its mainly 
straight-ahead male rock tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to that criticism, organizers have come up with a more dynamic lineup 
this year plus other special features. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that eclecticism now continues to be centered on a second stage, but 
Thursday it attracted only a handful of people who stood listlessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocked heads watched the fringe bands on the stage -- ranging from campy 
clamor of the Frogs to the dissonant assault of the Flaming Lips -- in passing, 
as if the groups were participants in an inexplicable freak show.  
</P>
<P>
 Besides the second stage, "Lollapalooza '94" offered plenty in its Mind Field 
('Palooza-speak for everything away from the main stage). 
</P>
<P>
 In the "Electric Carnival," a colorful tent full of interactive television 
sets and on-line computers, 'Paloozians manipulated images and sound into 
surreal forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I was skeptical," admits Ashley Salisbury, 19. "I first thought 
CD-ROM was just like an advanced Sega game, or maybe something only someone 
trained and professional could create on. But there were those tools, right 
there for me, totally accessible." 
</P>
<P>
 At a new third stage called the "Revival Tent," spoken-word artists performed 
and onlookers were invited to join in "Oprapalooza," an open microphone 
session. The small platform that served as the stage got off to a bumpy start 
when few people in the tent paid any attention to pontificating poets. 
</P>
<P>
 Grumbled one poet: "I think these people just came in here to beat the heat." 
</P>
<P>
 The intense heat that drove fans into the tents and under hoses could have 
contributed to the crowd's seeming disinterest in anything musically demanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Cave nodded at the suggestion: 
</P>
<P>
 "Our music is quite complicated and takes a lot of concentration. People can't 
really be expected to do that in the blazing sun." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused, then offered a more hopeful slant as he looked forward to the rest 
of the summer tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine doing this for another 30 shows, but I do like the 
collaboration between the groups, and it's open for everyone to do their 
thing," he said, adding that he hoped audiences would follow suit, " 'cause 
that's when things become quite beautiful and strange." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it wasn't overtly apparent that 'Paloozians were picking up on new 
bands or ideas, it did happen on at least a small scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Rogozzine, 22, who drove four hours to get here, discovered on the second 
stage the Verve, a British band that plays abstract, swirling pop.  
</P>
<P>
 "They seemed pretty good. I got my ears open to them. I also got into the 
Beastie Boys, and wasn't really a fan before."

BO: SLINGS, ARROWS AND OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE; POP MUSIC: IN SPITE OF ALL HIS 
INFLUENCE AND FAME, ROCK LEGEND DIDDLEY STILL HAS A THING OR TWO TO GET OFF HIS 
CHEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "We were playing the Club Au Go Go in Newcastle, our hometown . . . the doors 
opened one night, and to our surprise, in walked the man himself -- Bo Diddley. 
. . . We were doing THIS song . . . Bo Diddley looked over at me, and he said, 
'Man . . .' took off his glasses, he said, 'Man . . . that sho' is the biggest 
load of rubbish I ever heard in my life!' "  
</P>
<P>
 -- from "The Story of Bo Diddley," by the Animals, 1965 
</P>
<P>
 "The Story of Bo Diddley" was a loving tribute tune to a man who, even 30 
years ago, was already considered a legend, a bona fide giant, a first-string 
originator of rock 'n' roll. He was held in such high esteem by young rock 
musicians that even a personal insult from his mouth was received with bemused 
affection. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, Diddley remains full of opinions, determined to stick to his own 
agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent phone interview from his home in central Florida, the affable, 
talkative Diddley, who performs Sunday at the Coach House, pontificated on O.J. 
Simpson (not guilty), gangsta rap and juvenile delinquency (sure signs of a 
society in decline), President Clinton (a kind and decent man) -- just about 
any subject but the early days of rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually he would come around, but not without much coaxing, and he never 
spoke of his career with the same relish he reserved for More Pressing Issues. 
</P>
<P>
 One could hardly blame him -- at age 65, with more than 40 years in the music 
business behind him, Diddley is impatient with what he obviously sees as 
repetitive, insipid inquiries posed by dorky rock journalists. But Diddley does 
have a way of charming even as he blusters. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Otha Ellas Bates but given the surname McDaniel when he was adopted by a 
cousin, Diddley grew up in rural Mississippi and moved to Chicago at age 8. He 
became a regular on the club scene while still a teen-ager, taking his stage 
handle from a nickname given him while a Golden Gloves boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 Diddley's idiosyncratic, signature sound was based on the use of a cranked-up 
tremolo unit on his guitar amp and a groove that many have theorized was 
adapted from an old-time hambone beat. Just don't pose that theory to his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I created that sound back in 1948," said Diddley, clearly irritated. 
"Everybody keeps talking about how it came from hambone, but hambone is nothing 
like what I'm doing. Bom-chi-chank-chi-chank-CHANK CHANK! That's the Bo Diddley 
beat. It's not the same thing, and I'm sick and tired of everybody trying to 
connect me with hambone." 
</P>
<P>
 Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Little Walter and Sonny Boy Williamson were among 
the kings of the Chicago scene in the '50s, all transplanted Southern bluesmen 
who recorded for the storied Chess label. 
</P>
<P>
 When Diddley was signed by Chess in 1955, he found it difficult to penetrate 
the inner circle of his label mates, who initially failed to appreciate the 
newfangled sound he was putting down. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all ended up buddies of mine, but it was hard to break through the ice," 
Diddley said. "They didn't want nothing to do with me. I came up with a 
different beat, and they were all blues. I changed the beat of the music. 
Everybody looked at me like I was 10 years ahead of my time." 
</P>
<P>
 But Diddley was doing something right -- he was getting through to the new 
generation of rock 'n' rollers, singing the blues in a language they 
understood. So many of his songs became instant classics that it's difficult to 
imagine what rock 'n' roll would have been like without his contributions. 
Among them: "Bo Diddley," "Diddley Daddy," "Mona," "I'm a Man," "Who Do You 
Love," "Diddy Wah Diddy," "Road Runner" and "You Don't Love Me." 
</P>
<P>
 His compositions have been recorded by many major and minor artists with an 
affinity for rock 'n' roll.  
</P>
<P>
 Many others simply appropriated his sound to their own ends, enjoying hits 
with obvious knockoffs. A 1992 compilation on Rhino Records called "Bo Diddley 
Beats" collected many of these "tributes," the lineup featuring artists as 
disparate as Buddy Holly, Gene Krupa, Smokey Robinson, Ben E. King, Johnny 
Otis, the Strangeloves and Donovan. 
</P>
<P>
 Diddley was elected to the Rock And Roll Hall of Fame in 1987, at its second 
annual dinner. But for all his contributions, influence and fame, Diddley 
claims that, like so many of rock's first generation, he hasn't been fairly 
compensated for his years of hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently sued the estate of his late former manager of 22 years, Marty 
Otelsberg, and last month won a $400,000 judgment that the court said 
Otelsberg's widow must pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marty and I had a damned good relationship -- at least I thought it was good 
until I found out he was doing some funny things through some CPAs," Diddley 
said. "He hurt me, man, by penny-pinching on me. I trusted him with my life. He 
was a good manager; he helped me with a lot of things, got me into a lot of 
places. In spite of everything that went down, I thought Marty was great. When 
he died, I felt like I lost a part of me. But I don't like what he did to me. 
He abused his position. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chess got me, too. . . . Not MCA (which bought the rights to the Chess 
catalogue some years ago). MCA has nothing to do with all this crap that went 
down prior to them. They've been paying me. I'm talking about the stuff from 
Day One -- from 1955 up until the time MCA bought them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tired. . . . I hear me all the time (on the radio), and I haven't got a 
dime to show for it. I wish the government would go in and have a look at what 
happens to recording artists, because a lot of funky stuff is going down," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's not only black artists -- my white brothers are getting (cheated) 
the same doggone way. I don't want somebody else's money; I just want what's 
mine. This is America, and I love my country. In America, you got a chance to 
become somebody. I made something of myself. So why's there all these thugs 
sitting around and stealing money from me?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Diddley has no problem with his current recording company, Triple XXX Records, 
a small independent label based in Los Angeles. He's recorded three albums for 
Triple XXX since 1991 and has nothing but kind words for the company, which 
will release his next recording, "Promises," in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Diddley said the album will contain positive, anti-drug and anti-violence 
messages for today's youth. But he quickly turned the subject around to vent 
another of his pet peeves. 
</P>
<P>
 When he lobbies against violence, he stops short of suggesting that parents 
should always spare the rod with their own children. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, said Diddley, the father of five, "if you smack your kid, you go to 
jail for being abusive," referring to a recent case in which a woman in Georgia 
was arrested after slapping her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know who in hell is doing this -- it must be them hippie dudes from 
the hippie generation that's making the laws now. Whatever lawyer is making 
these laws while I'm asleep hasn't been met in the street with these young 
thugs -- 9, 10 years old and carrying Uzis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure the old way was OK. I turned out fine by getting my (butt) kicked 
about things I did that I shouldn't have. What is this country coming to?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Bo Diddley and the Carl Verheyen Band perform Sunday at the Coach House, 
33157 Camino Capistrano in San Juan Capistrano. 8 p.m. $16.50. (714) 496-8930.

ENDING SEASON ON A HIGHER NOTE; THEATER: IN 1993-94, THE IRVINE BARCLAY'S 
ATTENDANCE RATES JUMP TO 86% -- ITS HIGHEST SO FAR -- THANKS IN PART TO 
IMPROVED PROGRAMMING. 
</P>

<P>
 As bumbershoot-toting fans paraded on stage Thursday to the music of the 
Preservation Hall Jazz Band, the Irvine Barclay Theatre ended its third full 
season with its highest attendance rates ever, theater officials announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Paid attendance for 32 IBT-presented events during the 1993-94 season averaged 
86% of capacity, up 9 points from the previous year, when IBT presented 14 
events, theater President Douglas C. Rankin said.(The venue also is rented out 
for events it does not present.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the Irvine Barclay's abbreviated season in 1991-92, the theater sponsored 
nine events and audience capacity averaged 78%. 
</P>
<P>
 Rankin attributed the attendance increase to "improved quality of 
programming." He cited sold-out shows by such varied artists as monologuist 
Spalding Gray, a "Guitar Summit" bill with Leo Kottke, Paco Pena and Pepe 
Romero, the LINES Contemporary Ballet of San Francisco and Thursday's season 
closer with the Preservation Hall band. Rankin also pointed to a stronger 
marketing campaign and audiences' greater familiarity with the 756-seat 
facility. For instance, he said, a survey taken at last month's Taste of Orange 
County food festival in Irvine showed that roughly 40% of those polled had 
visited the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a large increase over" results from a similar poll at the previous 
year's festival, he said, "when we spent most of our time pinpointing our 
location" on a map. 
</P>
<P>
 IBT has expanded its season annually since opening in late 1990, and plans 
call for a continuation of that trend, Rankin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue (the increase) in the next several years to the extent that 
we are able to (financially) support expansion," he said.

JAZZ REVIEW; SMILE: HALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've ever been to a performance by the Preservation Hall Jazz Band, you 
know how the New Orleans-based ensemble's show Thursday at the Irvine Barclay 
Theatre ended: with felicitous revelry. 
</P>
<P>
 As the septet launched into its signature piece -- "When the Saints Go 
Marchin' In" -- members of the audience, three with colorful parasols -- 
started to parade around the hall, clapping and sashaying to the effervescent 
sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon this handful of people became 30, and they were joined by the band's 
front line: trumpeter Wendell Brunious, clarinetist Michael White and 
trombonist Frank Demond. Eventually, everyone landed on stage, the paraders 
forming a semicircle around the band as the number concluded to uproarious 
applause. 
</P>
<P>
 The current touring edition of Preservation Hall worked this kind of magic 
from the opening moments of "Hindustan," the first number -- it's just that the 
members of the packed house stayed in their seats until the final song. 
</P>
<P>
 A spectrum of listeners, from senior citizens in snazzy suits to 20-ish 
long-hairs wearing faded jeans and Nikes, couldn't help but respond to the 
ingratiating musicians. The fans tapped their feet, clapped their hands in time 
to the music and, most of all, smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Preservation Hall touring band -- there are several versions that perform 
only at the Crescent City venue for which the "group' is named -- keeps getting 
younger. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Ben Jaffe, son of the Hall's late founder, Allan Jaffe, is 23, and 
joined the ensemble six months ago; Brunious, the band's leader, is 39 and has 
been on board for 16 years. Others, from Lars Edegran (piano) to Joe Lastie 
(drums), range in age from 34 to 61. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their ages, these musicians played this jubilant music with panache 
and style. Tunes were generally medium to medium fast, though Kimball's roseate 
tenor vocal on "Georgia on My Mind" was done at a crawl, as was the first half 
of "Just a Closer Walk With Thee." That latter number exploded into a fast 
two-beat as it headed toward its tumultuous finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensemble's version of "Shake It and Break It" typified its gregarious 
approach. Brunious, seated like White and Demond on a straight-backed chair, 
stomped his right foot twice on the stage to kick off the number. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he and his front-line partners played the song's melodies, though they 
never played the same parts. Generally Brunious played the lead melody, while 
Demond offered slowly slithering asides and White musically danced around the 
trumpeter with brisk, jaunty lines. The rhythm section provided a resilient 
base throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 Solos followed. White, his tone varying between reedy-sounding and pure and 
liquid, played notes that leaped and some that spun around in a circle. He 
offered long, elastic notes that whined and, at one point, a seamless smear 
that began low on his instrument and finally landed in the upper register. 
</P>
<P>
 Demond used short statements, tying together three or four notes, then 
pausing, then going again. These notes were highly rhythmical and were issued 
with a saucy tone that made them seem like huge pancakes sizzling on a griddle. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Brunious, a remarkably tuneful musician who is comfortable in any 
style from New Orleans trad-jazz to be-bop. Lightly tonguing his notes, he 
played a series that sounded like intermittent raindrops, then others that had 
a Dizzy Gillespie flavor. Then he sprayed notes as if his horn were a garden 
sprinkler. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunious, in his solo pieces, such as "If I Could Be With You," was 
uncharacteristically restrained -- at times he played so softly his notes were 
hardly louder than someone breathing. White offered perhaps the evening's most 
impassioned solo on "Summertime," climaxing with swoops, trills and thrilling, 
long-held notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Edegran, Kimball, Jaffe and Lastie got in their fair share of hot licks, 
giving the ensemble, and the performance, a pleasing roundness.

ART 'LESSONS' WERE JUST A START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I found Cathy Curtis' most recent column on her revelations regarding the 
demands and difficulties of curating a single art exhibit (originally scheduled 
to be shown at my Works Gallery in Costa Mesa in April) to be quite revealing 
and very amusing ("A Few Real-Life Lessons for the 'Graduate,' " June 21). 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest if Cathy really wants to gain the entire perspective on curating art 
exhibits, she needs to complete the entire gallery "experience." 
</P>
<P>
 First, invest $20,000 to $30,000 of your own money a month for the "privilege" 
of dealing with all those "real-life lessons" to mount an exhibition. If you 
don't sell any work, don't worry, Cathy, you lose your home or car (if you have 
one). 
</P>
<P>
 Second, work 70 to 80 hours a week, at the expense of your family and personal 
life, to deal with these nagging little problems, lighting and hanging the 
shows (all the "little" work beneath you), the transportation, the bookkeeping, 
the administration, and dealing with immense egos in this business without pay 
-- only to gain some poisonous review of your hardwork by some self-appointed 
"expert" called an "art critic." Of course, this assumes the critic even 
acknowledges your show -- which is rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Last, repeat this procedure for each show, as I did, 22 times a year, for five 
years until you are near bankruptcy. Then listen to that same critic bash you 
in the press for not succeeding, or being too mainstream, or showing work that 
might sell (heaven forbid), or of just not being up to her high standards -- 
whatever those might be. 
</P>
<P>
 After you have gone through all this and more, then I believe you might be 
qualified to discuss the "real-life" lessons you have learned about the other 
end of the art world.

THE SWEET DREAMS OF CECILIA COLEMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cecilia Coleman has dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 She imagines being signed to a major label, like Blue Note or Warner Bros. Or 
she sees herself at her piano on a European bandstand -- maybe it's the one at 
the Bilbequot in Paris, or in the Jardins des Arenes de Cimiez at the Grande 
Parade du Jazz Nice -- and an enthusiastic crowd is listening keenly as her 
quintet delivers one deeply lyrical original song after another. She feels 
ripples of excitement as the audience cheers at the conclusion of the set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to go to Europe, or New York," she says in a soft voice that doesn't 
hide her longing. "If you're playing in New York, you've made it." 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, Coleman plays mostly right here at home. And she finances her 
own recordings, supplying the money for both 1992's "Words of Wisdom" and her 
just-released CD, "Young and Foolish," which spotlights her year-old quintet. 
She acknowledges the reality of this situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "First things first," says Coleman. "I know a record with (a company) like 
Blue Note is a little ways down the road. I can pretend all I want, but the 
bottom line is I'm paying to put the record out again." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman, 31, a devoted artist who for years has worked exclusively in the jazz 
field, has been on the L.A. scene for about a decade. After studies with 
pianist Eloise Ferguson, vibist Charlie Shoemake and at California State 
University, Long Beach, she began a partnership with saxophonist Benn 
Clatworthy that led to her winning the Los Angeles Jazz Society's New Talent 
Award in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the award, named for the late drummer Shelly Manne, Coleman 
began to lead an excellent trio with bassist Eric Von Essen and drummer Kendall 
Kay. She also was heard with, among others, trombonist Jimmy Cleveland, 
saxophonist Dan St. Marseilles and flutist Holly Hoffman. Then, last year, she 
expanded her horizons and formed a quintet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started to write pieces that had a more modern sound," says Coleman. "It 
was kind of a New York sound, like Art Blakey or saxophonist Bobby Watson: 
aggressive, rhythmically more intense, harmonically more experimental. To have 
the sounds accurately represented, I needed a larger group. I couldn't get 
those sounds out of a trio." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman is an unpretentious, sometimes shy woman, who surprises people by 
writing and performing powerful, challenging works. "She's so low-key that 
you're shocked when you hear this incredible fountain of musicality pour 
forth," says singer Ruth Price, who is musical director of the Jazz Bakery in 
Culver City, where the pianist has appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Cecilia's the most stunning young talent that has come along the pike 
in a long time," Price adds. "She's all for the music. There doesn't seem to be 
anything that has to do with personal aggrandizement." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman's quintet -- Steve Huffsteter, trumpet; Andy Suzuki, tenor sax; Dean 
Taba, bass; Kay, drums -- works regularly. She's been playing about twice a 
month at such clubs as Jax in Glendale, the Atlas Bar & Grill in mid-Wilshire, 
where she performs tonight, and the Jazz Bakery. (She also plays a free noon 
hour concert at downtown L.A.'s Citicorp Plaza Wednesday.) And while she's not 
drawing huge crowds, more and more fans are starting to pay attention to her 
forceful, communicative music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Thursday night at Jax, Coleman bent over the piano, her body 
swaying back and forth easily. She seemed completely absorbed as Huffsteter or 
Suzuki soloed, or as she delivered her own spirited improvisations. A group of 
about 10 patrons seated near the bandstand responded with the same degree of 
concentration as the leader, while others, such as a couple at the bar, simply 
chatted. Coleman was pleased that even a handful were listening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, people are coming to sit and hear the group," Coleman says. "It's 
kind of a thrill to realize that people are seeing my name" and want to hear 
what the music is. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman wonders if some of the people who come to listen to her come out of 
curiosity, wanting to see what a woman is doing playing jazz. The pianist gets 
testy at the thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I want to know is what makes playing a musical instrument a masculine or 
feminine thing? To me, a woman being a plumber, I'd think, 'Wow!,' because 
that's strenuous work. But why is it so bizarre to see a woman playing music? 
People ask me what's it like to be a woman playing jazz and I tell them it's 
probably pretty much the same as a man playing it." 
</P>
<P>
 There are plenty of die-hard Coleman fans, even if they don't show up 
continually at her performances. One is Benny Green, the acclaimed pianist who 
has known Coleman for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cecilia plays with deep emotion, a fine sense of rhythm and clarity of 
thought," he says. "She's very dedicated to music and the love and sincerity 
that she puts into her craft makes her piano playing a joy to hear." 
</P>
<P>
 More people will discover Coleman next month when she travels to Colorado -- 
where she'll appear at festivals in Telluride and Trimble Hot Springs -- Utah 
and New Mexico, playing club dates in the latter two. 
</P>
<P>
 To increase her exposure, Coleman will make the trip armed with her new CD. 
She's optimistic that the album will quickly pay for itself with sales 
beginning at these festivals. "A new CD is a business card for me," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Long Beach, Coleman began classical piano studies at age 5. Ten years 
later, she discovered jazz, via the album "Satch and Josh," with pianists Count 
Basie and Oscar Peterson. Then, at age 16, Coleman encountered her first 
important teacher: Eloise Ferguson, who introduced her to such greats as Red 
Garland and Wynton Kelly. "I didn't realize at the time how hip she was," says 
Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she was in her late teens, Coleman was swept away by jazz. She 
says now that it wasn't so much a fascination with the sound of the music, but 
the camaraderie with the other players, in which she found a sense of home and 
warmth that she felt was missing from the classical world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the feeling of being involved in a group, the interacting with the 
other musicians -- how I fit in -- and with the audience as well," she says. "I 
see now that I was always looking for that."  
</P>
<P>
 Coleman's modern pianistic approach was further enhanced about 10 years ago 
when she undertook improvisation studies with Shoemake, whom she calls "a great 
teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave me a broader view of the players and their styles," she says. Then 
came her days with Clatworthy -- she's on his "Thanks, Horace" Discovery album 
-- her trio, and now her quintet. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman finds continued inspiration in the challenge of playing, and writing, 
jazz. "I listen to all the great players that have come before me and I guess 
what I keep trying to do is get to that level, or the highest level I can," she 
says. "I didn't realize that I could be as intense about anything as I have 
become about jazz. It's been a long process and I must really love it or else I 
wouldn't be doing it."

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; STORIES FOR DOLLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: Much has been made about some key witnesses selling their stories to 
tabloid television shows and publications. Are there any circumstances under 
which the selling of this potential evidence is illegal? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Not in California. However, on Thursday, State Sen. Quentin Kopp 
(I-San Francisco) introduced a bill that would prohibit potential witnesses 
from giving interviews in exchange for money before or during a trial. Thus 
far, in the Simpson case, several witnesses or potential witnesses have sold 
their stories, including a clerk at a Downtown cutlery shop who testified that 
he sold a 15-inch knife to Simpson in May. In another instance, the district 
attorney's office decided not to present a witness after she appeared on the 
tabloid television show "Hard Copy," which promised to pay her $5,000. EXCHANGE 
OF TESTIMONY

SIMPSON MURDER CASE; THE FORENSIC FILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A look at procedures and processes used in the evaluation of forensic 
evidence: 
</P>
<P>
 Preserving Evidence: Criminalists store damp evidence, such as a bloody glove, 
in a brown paper bag so that it can dry out. If sealed in a plastic bag, the 
evidence may putrefy, destroying its value. 
</P>
<P>
 Assessing the Blood Evidence: Is it blood? A red stain is treated with 
hydrogen peroxide to see if it is blood. An enzyme in blood, called peroxidase, 
releases oxygen from the peroxide. That oxygen reacts with a colorless dye, 
called phenolphthalein, turning it pink. A similar reaction is seen when 
peroxide is used to disinfect a cut: Bubbles of oxygen appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Determining Time of Death: The most reliable indicator of time of death is 
body temperature. Coroners know how fast a body cools and thus can tell how 
long ago death occurred. Rigor mortise, the stiffening of muscles, is useful 
after the body has cooled, but less accurate. The rate at which body fluids 
accumulate at the body's lowest point can also be used to estimate time of 
death, as well as to indicate if a body has been moved.

BUDGET TO BENEFIT WOMEN'S SHELTER; SPENDING: STATE PLAN INCLUDES MONEY FOR A 
VALLEY FACILITY FOR THE BATTERED, BUT NOT FOR SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS 
CONSERVANCY REQUEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the result of some behind-the-scenes state budget maneuvering, the San 
Fernando Valley moved a step closer Friday to receiving its first long-term, 
subsidized housing for battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Gov. Pete Wilson's blue pencil spelled out bad news for the 
Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, which was dealt a blow when Wilson vetoed 
more than $7 million for funding and programs outside the mountain ranges 
rimming the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the state budget outlook for abused women's housing was touch-and-go, 
the spending blueprint Wilson signed Friday retains a $100,000 allocation to 
the private, nonprofit group trying to establish the Valley's first such 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "As to why the Valley hasn't had this until now, that's a real good question," 
said Betty Fisher, executive director of Haven Hills, a provider of a 30-day 
emergency shelter for Valley domestic violence victims since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware that the project benefited from the notoriety of the O.J. Simpson 
double-murder case, Fisher said her organization is hoping to move forward 
quickly with construction plans. "This little window could close on us any 
minute," said Fisher, "so we're shooting for a spring opening. That's our 
target." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the price tag of the new transitional housing Fisher envisions -- a 
25-unit structure with apartments of up to four bedrooms apiece -- could 
ultimately reach $2 million, the state's gift of $100,000 serves as valuable 
seed money. Fisher said it will ensure enough funds so Haven Hills can close 
escrow on land. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just about that much short on the land money," she said, "so this 
will really help nail down the property." 
</P>
<P>
 Haven Hills has already submitted its proposals for review to the Los Angeles 
community development department. Plans include transitional housing for up to 
18 months for women who need assistance so they don't return to abusive 
partners or end up homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the total picture of helping battered women break from their 
abusers, Haven Hills also wants to provide long-term emotional counseling, job 
training, career advice and child care. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said the program, while long overdue, will put the Valley in the 
forefront of a growing movement to establish follow-through treatment for 
victims of domestic violence. Only a handful of such comprehensive programs 
operate nationwide, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during the Legislature's budget negotiations, lawmakers trying to 
reduce California's red ink crossed out the Haven Hills allocation. But 
Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-North Hollywood) approached the governor's 
office for support in getting the budget item restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson agreed, and Friedman -- armed with the governor's backing -- succeeded 
in getting the $100,000 placed back into the state's spending plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even before O.J. Simpson, I thought there might be a chance the governor 
would keep this in because it's an area he decided to highlight this year," 
said Friedman, who sought the funding in the first place. "So I thought there 
might be an opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was after the Simpson case broke -- with headlines blaring about a 1989 
assault of his then-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson -- that a budget conference 
committee agreed to Friedman's request to restore it. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason I'm especially pleased with the outcome is because the allocation 
survived even after the governor and Legislature committed $30 million" for a 
separate fund to fight domestic violence, Friedman said. "This is an added 
bonus for the San Fernando Valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Department of Finance, which advises the governor on budget 
issues, said it was evident that Wilson wanted to preserve the transitional 
housing funding even as he vetoed numerous other line-item requests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's clear that this $100,000 is a very high priority . . . at a time when 
we're reducing expenditures in other areas," said Diane Cummins of the 
Department of Finance. 
</P>
<P>
 One agency feeling the pain of the governor's budget ax was the Santa Monica 
Mountains Conservancy, which saw an end for now to its dream of acquiring 
property far beyond the mountain ranges it was created to preserve. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy's funding requests, in fact, amounted to an attempt to 
engineer a change in the law without going through the customary review 
process, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Klass of the state Department of Finance said the governor was concerned 
that the conservancy was losing sight of its original mandate -- to preserve 
and protect public access to suburban land in the Santa Monica Mountains zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget requests that Wilson vetoed included purchase of hundreds of acres in 
the Santa Ynez Valley in Santa Barbara County and hundreds more near Chino 
Hills State Park. All told, the governor struck $7 million worth of conservancy 
wish-list items from the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were vetoed because they were out of the boundaries of the conservancy," 
said Klass "The statutes that created the conservancy didn't envision them 
buying property in that area." 
</P>
<P>
 Conservancy officials did not return calls for comment.

ATHLETE UNDERGOES SURGERY TO SAVE GERM-RAVAGED LEG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL BETTNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Triathlete Bernard Donner underwent surgery Friday morning to save his left 
leg from the ravages of the so-called "flesh-eating bacteria," which apparently 
entered his body through a shaving cut as he bicycled near his Santa Barbara 
home Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Donner remained in critical condition, but his doctors are encouraged that the 
infection has not spread beyond the leg, said Dr. A. Richard Grossman, medical 
director of the Sherman Oaks Hospital burn center. 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference, Grossman also sought to allay the public's fears of the 
infection, known as "necrotizing fasciitis." News reports of seven cases in 
Gloucestershire, England, this spring sparked a media frenzy. Twelve deaths 
from the infection were reported across England, and international researchers 
say that incidence of the disease, which was more common before the development 
of antibiotics but had almost disappeared by the 1970s, has been increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman noted, however, that he has treated only four cases of the infection 
since 1992, and said it is still too rare to justify public alarm in the Los 
Angeles area. "If you were out on the golf course and got struck by lightning, 
that's about how frequently this occurs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman said he and Dr. Michel Brones, another burn center surgeon, had 
temporarily covered an infection-related opening on Donner's left thigh about 
12 inches long and six inches wide with cadaver skin, a practice also used in 
treating burn victims. The doctors hope to begin replacing the cadaver skin 
with Donner's own skin next week.  
</P>
<P>
 Necrotizing fasciitis is a rare and especially aggressive manifestation of the 
Group A streptococcus bacterium that causes the common and usually harmless 
strep throat. Since Donner felt the first pains Sunday night, the infection has 
destroyed half the muscle tissue in his left leg, Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Donner remains in critical condition, Grossman said the infection has 
not spread. "At this point we're treating him like any other burn patient," he 
said. "I'm encouraged today, but we're not going to be out of the woods until 
he walks out of here. However, we hope to be having him walking with crutches 
in two to three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Until his next round of skin grafts, Donner will spend much of his time in 
Sherman Oaks Hospital's hyperbaric chamber, which promotes healing by forcing 
pressurized oxygen into the blood. Donner, who was first treated at Cottage 
Hospital in Santa Barbara, was transported to Sherman Oaks Hospital on 
Wednesday because it is one of only eight hospitals in Southern California that 
has such a chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital is setting up a trust fund to help pay Donner's $4,000-a-day 
medical bills and the cost of his rehabilitation, since his insurance plan pays 
only $300 a day, Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime Santa Barbara lifeguard and swim camp counselor, Donner also ran, 
bicycled and swam in triathlons, a demanding event that usually covers a course 
of 32 miles. With rehabilitation, Grossman said, "I believe he'll go back and 
try and run again." 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics on the incidence of the tissue-destroying infection in the United 
States are unreliable because only about 22 states require doctors to report 
all invasive Group A strep infections -- of which necrotizing fasciitis is only 
one. It occurs when the infection enters and begins to rapid devour the fascia, 
the tissue that binds skin to muscles, health officials say.  
</P>
<P>
 The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in 1990, 
the last year for which statistics are available, there were 500 to 1,500 
American cases of necrotizing fasciitis. 
</P>
<P>
 "From that, you can extrapolate that about 10% of those were in California," 
said Scott Lewis, a spokesman for the California Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "This infection has been known for years," he said. "We've known it's been 
occurring for years. We've also had experience with what we call media 
clusters. It's always out there, (but) suddenly every case becomes a big deal 
because the media does a story on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Carol L. Peterson, a medical epidemiologist for the Los Angeles County 
Health Department, said authorities had received reports of "approximately 
four" cases of necrotizing fasciitis in the county so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 She could not say how that figure compared to last year. "We don't keep track 
of it that way," Peterson said, explaining that the department also asks 
doctors to report other kinds of Group A strep.  
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers (of necrotizing fasciitis cases) we have are extremely small," 
Peterson said. "We don't think the public needs to be frightened by this entity 
at this time. We are concerned about invasive Group A strep diseases and we're 
looking at this issue, but the data is not complete."

L.A. CITY POPULATION UP SLIGHTLY; GROWTH: LOCAL ESTIMATES SAY THE VALLEY LOST 
1,940 PEOPLE BETWEEN 1990 AND 1993. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles city population increased slightly between 1992 and 1993 but 
remains below the population count provided by the 1990 census, according to a 
city Planning Department estimate released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley's population decline since 1990 was slightly less than 
the citywide decrease, and city analysts speculated as a reason that the Valley 
was less affected by the April, 1992, civil unrest, which prompted a moderate 
exodus from areas nearest to the city's core. 
</P>
<P>
 As of October, 1993, the city was home to 3,467,785 residents, according to 
the city Planning Department's annual population estimate. That is up 0.2% -- 
more than 5,300 people -- from the department's population estimate for 
October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 population estimate is down half a percentage point -- more than 
17,600 people -- from April, 1990, when the federal census estimated the 
population at 3,485,398. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the Valley was populated by more than 1.2 million people, down 0.3% 
-- 1,940 people -- since the 1990 census, according to the city's estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 City analysts attribute the citywide drop in population to the region's 
sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When there are no jobs, people leave," said Jeffrey M. Beckerman, a 
demographer for the Planning Department. "The job loss is probably the best 
explanation." 
</P>
<P>
 The population estimate does not include the period since the Jan. 17 
earthquake. But Beckerman said he expects that the Valley's population has 
dropped significantly since the Northridge temblor and that this will be 
reflected in the next estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 City analysts based the city's annual population and housing estimate on 
housing stock, vacancy rates, household size and other factors, Beckerman said. 
The report includes population figures for each of the 35 planning areas in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the most telling factor in the current estimate was that the number of 
people living in multiunit buildings had dropped by more than 22,000, 
indicating the population decrease since 1990 was mainly among residents of 
apartments, condominiums and townhomes. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest population change in the Valley since the 1990 census was a 0.78% 
decrease in the Mission Hills, North Hills and Panorama City areas, a drop of 
nearly 3,000 residents, according to the estimate. Analysts said they did not 
conduct an in-depth analysis to determine why some neighborhoods differed from 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 Slight population decreases were also estimated in North Hollywood, Arleta, 
Pacoima, Van Nuys, Sylmar and Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, population increases were found in Sherman Oaks, Studio City, 
Toluca Lake, Sun Valley, Granada Hills, Canoga Park, West Hills, Winnetka, 
Woodland Hills, Chatsworth, Porter Ranch, Northridge, Encino, Tarzana, Sunland 
and Tujunga, according to the estimate. Population Changes

PARTS OF FREEWAY INTERCHANGE REOPEN; REPAIRS: THE ANTELOPE VALLEY AND GOLDEN 
STATE HIGHWAY JUNCTION IS NAMED FOR AN OFFICER WHO PLUNGED TO HIS DEATH AFTER 
QUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Los Angeles region's recovery from the Northridge earthquake reached a 
milestone Friday morning as officials reopened key sections of the Golden 
State-Antelope Valley freeway interchange, naming it in memory of the 
motorcycle officer who plunged to his death there after the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Little fanfare attended the reopening, unlike the elaborate ceremonies that 
celebrated the completion of two other major freeway restoration projects 
earlier this year. But motorists were jubilant as they honked and whooped their 
way across the interchange at the northeast exit from the San Fernando Valley, 
the most heavily traveled artery connecting Los Angeles and the Santa Clarita 
and Antelope valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 "This justifies it," project superintendent John Britt said of the 
round-the-clock work that went into completing construction three weeks ahead 
of schedule. "I wanted to see this -- and now I want to go get some sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Led by the California Highway Patrol, a stream of cars and trucks -- the tail 
end of rush-hour traffic headed toward Downtown Los Angeles -- switched 
effortlessly from the southbound Antelope Valley Freeway to the southbound 
Golden State Freeway shortly before 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers also opened the connector between the northbound segments of the two 
freeways. But with most motorists still conditioned to veer onto a truck bypass 
before the interchange, only a handful of cars came through. 
</P>
<P>
 One belonged to Debbie Castner of Westchester, who said she took the 
interchange by accident because she was lost on her way to Magic Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh really? Hot dog!" Castner, 38, exclaimed when told she was among the first 
to use the newly paved route, which spans three lanes on either side. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining transitions between the southbound Antelope Valley Freeway and 
the northbound Golden State, and from the southbound Golden State onto the 
northbound Antelope Valley, are to be completed later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire interchange has been renamed in honor of Clarence Wayne Dean, the 
Los Angeles motorcycle police officer who unwittingly rode off the end of the 
collapsed overpass in the pre-dawn darkness immediately after the Jan. 17 
quake. State lawmakers approved the name change, at the request of his fellow 
officers, earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would've liked that," said Deborah Barton of Lancaster, Dean's oldest 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
 Barton, 45, fought back tears Friday morning as cars whizzed by the spot where 
her brother was killed. "The whole thing's been hard. It was a terrible loss," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine officers who worked with Dean pulled up at 10 a.m., believing there would 
be a dedication ceremony, but officials said a formal commemoration would take 
place later. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the least we could do," said Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), who 
introduced the resolution in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The $19.6-million restoration project, paid for by federal disaster relief 
funds, came with a $100,000-a-day bonus for early completion. Finishing ahead 
of the July 28 target date will net the contractor, Kasler Corp. of San 
Bernardino, an additional $3.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonuses were also awarded for the ahead-of-schedule repair of the Santa Monica 
Freeway in April and the Golden State Freeway over Gavin Canyon in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state and federal officials scrambled to attend those reopenings and 
claim political credit for bringing them about, Friday's event was low-key, 
attracting only a few reporters and workers who watched as the barriers were 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we opened the I-5, the community really wanted to do something and the 
governor agreed. (But this time) the governor really just wants to see us get 
this work complete. We're anxious to turn it back over to motorists," said 
California Department of Transportation spokeswoman Margie Tiritilli. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need a ceremony," added Kurt Thomas, a structural engineer for 
Kasler. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said work on the bridges was especially hazardous because of their 
height. The tallest column stands 126 feet, the shortest 61 feet. By contrast, 
the Gavin Canyon overpasses were 80 feet high, the Santa Monica Freeway about 
20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 workers toiled 24 hours a day, often high above the Metrolink 
commuter rail tracks. The canyon terrain also made access difficult for supply 
trucks, said John Cluff, project manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The interchange served 125,000 cars and trucks daily before the earthquake, 
according to Caltrans. Last month, with detours and bypasses in place, the area 
handled about 105,000 vehicles per day. 
</P>
<P>
 Many commuters from northern Los Angeles County flocked to the Metrolink 
trains after the temblor, swelling ridership on the Santa Clarita line from 
about 1,000 a day to 22,000. The standing-room-only crowds have since thinned 
to about 4,000 a day in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink officials acknowledge that the Antelope Valley interchange presents 
greater competition than did the early reopening of the Golden State Freeway 
over Gavin Canyon. For many passengers who have been riding the Santa Clarita 
line, the newly restored interchange is the most convenient link to the south, 
and is expected to siphon off about 7% of their passengers, Metrolink 
estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have worked hard to keep the 2-year-old rail service attractive to 
commuters, reducing travel time, running promotions and offering discounts. 
Santa Clarita City Councilwoman Jan Heidt, an alternate member of the Metrolink 
board of directors, expressed confidence that riders would stick with the 
trains, but said the appeal of freeways was tough to counter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the freeways were repaired (too) quickly," she said. "What we say is 
'Get out of your car,' but what we do says, 'Get back in.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Heidt believes the key for Metrolink lies in marketing its improvements. "That 
will keep some of the people we gained. We're going to continue to attract 
people," she said. "I wish we had more time." 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Monday, the first workday on which the interchange will be available 
to commuters early in the morning, Metrolink will have to work on persuading 
passengers like Cheryl Anderson of Valencia to stay loyal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The earthquake made a lot of people do this," she said, preparing to board a 
Metrolink train. "It's not a permanent change for how most people get to work," 
said Anderson, 29, who works as a legal assistant in Glendale. "Who wants to 
drive 15 minutes to wait for a train when you could be in your car and already 
part way there?" 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Caltrans awarded F.C.I. Constructors of San Diego a $13.2-million 
contract to repair the remainder of the interchange. The company has 120 days 
from today to complete work.

<TEXT>
<P>
 After correcting some spelling, the city of Calabasas has approved the Spanish 
names of three new streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The streets -- all located in the Calabasas Ranch development near the south 
end of Calabasas Parkway -- will be called Prado de la Luna, Prado de las 
Estrellas and Prado de los Arboles, said City Manager Steven Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 City reports had listed the names as Prada de la Luna, Prada de la Arboles and 
Prada de la Estrella, but Harris said the spellings have been fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 In upcoming Calabasas business, the City Council on Wednesday will hear for 
the first time proposals regarding the planned Calabasas Park shopping complex, 
which has been both touted and opposed by residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said he expected a large and vocal crowd at the 7:30 p.m. meeting, 
which will be held at A.E. Wright Middle School, 4029 N. Las Virgenes Road, in 
order to accommodate more people. ERIC SLATER

 New Horizons, a nonprofit organization providing housing for mentally retarded 
people in the San Fernando Valley, will celebrate its 40th anniversary today 
with a groundbreaking for two new group homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the organization, which currently operates seven homes, will 
gather at the New Horizons headquarters at 15725 Parthenia St. at 5:30 p.m. for 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening will serve as a fund-raiser for the planned group homes, group 
spokeswoman Gloria Griskevitch said.  
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the homes -- one at 8733 Haskell Ave. and the other at 15917 
Chase St. -- is scheduled to begin in November, Griskevitch said. Residents 
will be moving in about this time next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Following groundbreaking ceremonies, Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) will

<P>
 During the first four years of its toilet rebate program, the Las Virgenes 
Municipal Water District has handed out cash incentives to more than 4,000 
homeowners who replaced old toilets with more water-efficient models. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very happy, especially considering that most of the homes around 
Calabasas are built with newer toilets that don't need to be replaced," 
district spokeswoman Bobbe Wymer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district offers $75 to anyone who replaces a toilet that uses 3.5 gallons 
of water per flush with a new toilet, which by state law must use less than 1.6 
gallons per flush. The district also offers $100 for each additional toilet 
replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get everyone to replace all their old toilets at once," Wymer 
said. "This is a desert environment and drought is the norm. The more water we 
can conserve, the more we will have for drinking." KURT PITZER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; REACTION MIXED TO WIDER INTERSECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Encino community leaders are expressing mixed reactions to a city 
transportation department proposal to widen the intersection of Ventura 
Boulevard and Hayvenhurst Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency wants to add a second westbound right-turn lane on Ventura 
Boulevard at Hayvenhurst to relieve traffic congestion expected from the 
planned Encino Marketplace development on the northeast corner. 
</P>
<P>
 To do this, the department proposes to widen Ventura Boulevard east of 
Hayvenhurst by 10 feet for 320 feet along the north side, and by four feet for 
370 feet along the south side. That would widen the street by a total 14 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Sobel, executive director of the Encino Chamber of Commerce, said the 
chamber is concerned because the widening would narrow the sidewalk along 
Ventura Boulevard adjacent to Gelson's by four feet, making it likely that the 
upscale supermarket will have to remove landscaping next to the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea of the (Ventura Boulevard) Specific Plan was to make certain 
areas pedestrian-friendly," Sobel said. "If you make a narrow sidewalk and abut 
brick buildings to the sidewalk, then that's not conducive to making it 
pleasant to walk about." 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners of Encino President Gerald A. Silver, however, said he approves of 
the widening as a means to improve traffic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traffic flow is more important to the community than a handful of bushes," 
Silver said. "As far as pedestrian-orientation is concerned, that's a joke. 
People don't walk to Gelson's. Virtually all of Gelson's business drives 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it would take away the landscaping, I don't think (the widening) 
would be advisable," said Bill Jasper, president of the Encino Property Owners 
Assn. Jasper said he favors the additional turn lane, but added that he does 
not know whether the project could be completed by widening only the north side 
of the street. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jeff Brain, president of the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan 
Review Board, the department has added an additional lane in other areas by 
widening the street by only 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we're intending to spend so much money to landscape sections of Ventura 
Boulevard, perhaps they could find a way to make 10 feet work in this 
location," Brain said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allyn Rifkin, principal engineer for the department's planning section, and 
Compton-based Arden Group & Co., which owns Gelson's, could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Brain and Silver predicted that the issue of intersection widenings will 
continue to come up as communities weigh the sometimes-conflicting values of 
smooth traffic flow and pedestrian-friendly ambience. KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; LAWSUIT SERVED AS SCHOOL BOARD MEETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Burbank school board members were served with a lawsuit during a 
televised meeting Thursday, visibly angering board President Denise Lioy 
Wilcox. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox grabbed the papers, containing sex and race discrimination claims filed 
by a former high school principal, from a courier and threw them over her 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me get this straight," she said. "I'm being served as an individual board 
member and I'm being sued as an individual board member to take away my home 
and my property. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a thankless job." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Burbank High School Principal Keiko Hentell filed the lawsuit in 
federal court two months ago, charging sex and racial discrimination played a 
role in her demotion in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit asks for unspecified punitive damages and names district Supt. 
Arthur Pierce and individual board members as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Hentell, a Japanese American, has said she was demoted because of her close 
work with minority students at the high school -- a charge the school board has 
denied. 
</P>
<P>
 She declined to discuss her lawsuit, but said Thursday night's event was 
"something arranged by my attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox and board members Elena Hubbell and William Abbey were served during a 
brief break between reports on guidance and reading programs at Burbank's 
elementary schools. Pierce and board members Robert Dunivant and Joseph Hooven 
have already received copies of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a flashy way to do it," Hubbell said. "Why wait until we were on 
television? It was done intentionally." VIVIEN LOU CHEN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TARZANA; MULHOLLAND PARK SOLD IN FORECLOSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 J.M. Peters Co., a Newport Beach home builder, has paid $26 million in cash 
for 175 estate-size housing lots in Tarzana in a foreclosure, company officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Called Mulholland Park, the 125-acre, gated community in the Santa Monica 
Mountains with a view of the San Fernando Valley was sold to J.M. Peters by 
Bank of America, which took over the property from a development partnership in 
a foreclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulholland Park was designed for luxurious custom residences, with lots 
ranging from 10,000 to 17,000 square feet. J.M. Peters plans to build houses on 
those lots ranging from 3,500 to 5,500 square feet and priced between $500,000 
and $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "As our initial project in post-recession Los Angeles County, we are sparing 
no effort to make Mulholland Park the jewel in the crown of our entire 
Southland building program," said Dale Dowers, chief operating officer. Work 
will begin at the end of this year, Dowers said. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-May, J.M. Peters sold $100 million worth of junk bonds to pay down debt 
and buy land. The company, like most Southern California home builders, has 
been hard hit by the real estate downturn. Since posting a string of losses in 
the early 1990s, however, the company reported a $3.9-million profit for its 
latest fiscal quarter. DEBORA VRANA

 For those who like to do their holiday shopping early, there is the upcoming 
"Christmas in July" gift fair sponsored by the Independent Living Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five local crafts people will tout their wares -- from handmade dolls 
to lamps -- at the center July 30 and 31 to raise funds for a pre-employment 
program for people with severe disabilities, according to community education 
coordinator Sherman Pearl. 
</P>
<P>
 The pre-employment program provides training in office, homemaking and 
horticultural skills for people with physical, developmental and sensory 
disabilities, as well as for survivors of traumatic brain injuries.  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the program's participants joined with the Urban Greening Program of 
the U.S. Forestry Service to plant greenery in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearl said he hopes the crafts fair will raise about $5,000 for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas in July will take place at 14151 Haynes St., Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 It will begin at 10 a.m. both days.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; RESIDENT GROUP PROTESTS PLAN TO REOPEN LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It could have been a messy protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying sacks of garbage, a crowd of about 60 residents of the northeast San 
Fernando Valley marched to a building owned by landfill operator 
Browning-Ferris Industries. It was a coals-to-New Castle approach to a protest 
concerning the proposed B.F.I. Sunshine Canyon landfill project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need no more trash," Jesus Romero of San Fernando said after he led 
the mostly Latino crowd in a chant of "Abajo con B.F.I.," meaning "Down with 
B.F.I." 
</P>
<P>
 B.F.I is in the midst of a court battle to reopen and expand the landfill, 
which closed in 1991 when its permit with the city of Los Angeles expired. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest was planned by Valley Organized in Community Efforts (VOICE), an 
activist group of local church and synagogue volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you see any notices in Spanish (about the landfill) in the local 
community?" asked Father David Ullrich, pastor of Santa Rosa Catholic Church in 
San Fernando, using a microphone to address the crowd in front of the B.F.I. 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," came the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd laid the bags of garbage in front of a door of the building, which 
they believed was the company's Western regional office. 
</P>
<P>
 But that office was across the street -- the garbage had been left at another 
company building, said B.F.I. spokesman Arnie Berghoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they were exercising their constitutional right to free speech," 
Berghoff said. "They were very peaceful. We don't have any problem with what 
they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Lopez, the organizer of the protest, said the company was called ahead of 
time and asked to meet with a representative, but no one from B.F.I. came out 
to speak to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Berghoff said he was in Downtown Los Angeles when he heard about the call and 
did not have time to respond. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court Judge is scheduled to decide July 12 on whether 
to make a temporary injunction against the expansion of the landfill permanent. 
Berghoff said that if the expansion, first proposed in 1984 and battled out in 
the courts many times already, goes forward, B.F.I. will be a good neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that once the landfill is open, we will be able to work with the 
community," Berghoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the protesters said nothing has been done specifically to inform the 
Spanish-speaking populations near the landfill about the expansion. "It's like 
someone knocking on your door and running away," Felipe Samano of Sylmar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's very bad, not only for me, but for everyone," said Maria Lozano 
of in San Fernando, who added that she was worried about what effect the dump 
would have on her eight children. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstration ended with the protesters chanting, in Spanish, "The quiet 
community will now be heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the demonstrators picked up the garbage they had placed at the door of 
the building and carried it off the property. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; PASTOR RETURNS FROM FACT-FINDING TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Darrel Meyers, pastor at the First Presbyterian Church in Van Nuys, 
recently returned from a visit to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was no see-the-religious-monuments sightseeing tour. Meyers was among 
23 U.S. citizens -- including journalists, former statespersons, health 
officials and educators -- chosen by the Washington-based human rights group, 
Council for the National Interest -- to go on a "Political Pilgrimage" to 
Jericho and the Gaza strip for the purpose of seeing first-hand the political 
and social problems there. 
</P>
<P>
 While there, they met with ministers, religious leaders, political acitivists 
and families. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of their friendship tour, the envoys debriefed members of 
the Administration and Congress on their findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation, Meyers said, was especially struck by the plight of the Iraqi 
people suffering from starvation and lack of medical care as a result of the 
sanctions on Iraq, according to what they were told by the Catholic Bishop of 
Amman on their stop in Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last three years, 400,000 civilians have died due to lack of food and 
medicine," said Meyers. "The sanctions aren't hurting Saddam Hussein, they're 
killing the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers discussed with Palestinian and Israeli leaders the problems over the 
water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average Israeli settler drinks 27 times the amount of water that 
Palestians drink," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, when an Israeli foreign minister met with the group, Meyers said he told 
them that the Palestinians waste half their water. 
</P>
<P>
 Among one of Meyers' personal goals for his visit was to establish a sister 
church in East Jerusalem to his Van Nuys congregation. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers discovered that the task was not so simple as he had thought. 
</P>
<P>
 "The leading Christian leaders were interested," said Meyers. "But they're 
very suspicious of we in the West who want to give a little money and advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers said he will explore ways to create a more cooperative, and less 
paternalistic, approach to set up the sister relationship between the churches.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The public is invited to join about 100 youths today in a cleanup of North 
Hollywood sponsored by Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which will begin at 8 a.m. at St. Mary's Church, 6903 Radford St., 
will sweep into Hart and Radford streets before ending at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 The event will be followed by a lunch on the church grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths, many of whom are a part of Alarcon's 7th District Youth 
Improvement Council, will remove trash and graffiti, sweep the gutters and 
collect items dumped illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 The supplies for the cleanup are being provided by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other community organizations are expected to participate, including 
the Panorama City and Sun Valley Graffiti Busters, New Directions for Youth, 
the Holy Rosary Youth Group, the St. Patrick Youth Group and various 
Neighborhood Watch groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7th District Youth Improvement Council, formed by Alarcon in February, has 
grown to about 200 youths representing area schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which meets regularly to discuss ways to improve the community, has 
held two earlier cleanups this year. JEFF SCHNAUFER

OAK PARK'S REQUEST FOR OWN ZIP CODE REJECTED; MAIL: BEILENSON AND VANDERKOLK 
APPEAL THE DECISION. BUT THE POSTAL SERVICE SAYS IT IS NOT LIKELY TO REVERSE 
ITS RULING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Postal Service has rejected Oak Park's request for its own ZIP code, 
despite insistence by residents of the affluent community that sharing a postal 
code with Agoura Hills costs them money. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) announced Friday that postal 
officials in Washington, D. C., denied a request he had made with Ventura 
County Supervisor Maria VanderKolk on behalf of Oak Park residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park has long shared a ZIP code with Agoura Hills, a Los Angeles County 
city, even though Oak Park -- an unincorporated community of nearly 15,000 -- 
lies on the other side of the county border, entirely within the boundaries of 
Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say that means they must continuously battle with insurance agents, 
sales clerks and mail-order companies who try to charge them Los Angeles County 
rates instead of cheaper Ventura County rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "This costs the county revenues too," said Kent Behringer, a member of Oak 
Park's Municipal Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say many mail-order companies, judging Oak Park addresses by their 
ZIP codes, automatically send their sales tax payments to Los Angeles County, 
instead of Ventura County. Even the state Department of Motor Vehicles has 
assumed Oak Park car owners live in Los Angeles, residents say, and improperly 
divert registration fees to Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may not amount to a few million dollars over time," Behringer said. "But 
if you put all the revenues together it would amount to a tidy little sum that 
probably could have been used to keep our library going or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Although residents acknowledge their concern is largely financial, they also 
say having their own ZIP code would help establish a sense of identity. 
</P>
<P>
 The original request was approved by local and regional postal authorities 
before being rejected by officials at the U. S. Postal Service's national 
headquarters in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson and VanderKolk have already appealed the decision, citing the loss 
of revenue to Ventura County as well as the confusion and the potential 
overcharges to Oak Park residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're of course very concerned and disappointed," said Diane Kinzer Brown, an 
aide to Beilenson. "So we've appealed it immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Postal Service spokeswoman Terri Bouffiou said the same officials who just 
rejected the plea will be the ones who review the appeal, and they aren't 
likely to change their minds. "I think they are going to review it and say 
there are no different circumstances from the first appeal so they will reject 
it again," Bouffiou said. 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence, she pointed to an appeal on behalf of Oak Park made by officials 
in the Postal Service's Van Nuys office, which already has been rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the U. S. Postal Service ruled against Oak Park because it bases such 
ZIP code splits solely on the volume of mail going into a community. 
</P>
<P>
 "ZIP codes are for efficient sorting of the mail," Bouffiou said. "They can't 
be assigned on the basis of a community wanting them. . . . If they were, we 
would quickly run out of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park resident David Ross, who has been pushing for a separate ZIP code for 
the community for years, said he was frustrated and disappointed by the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a feeling that their rejection was based on not really understanding 
the issues," Ross said. "If they need letters or testimonials or anything, I 
would be more than happy to participate." 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park ZIP code advocates say they have made at least one gain in their 
quest: More residents now know to check sales receipts and mail-order invoices, 
and question their insurance companies about their rates. And the fight, they 
say, is not over yet. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't forget about it," Behringer said. "At least we made it to Washington 
this time."

RELIGION / JOHN DART; JEWISH SCHOLAR EXPLORES SOURCES OF THE ANCIENT 
ISRAELITES' BELIEFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ancient Israelites were flailed for centuries by biblical prophets as 
shameless, compulsive idolaters who scoffed at God's laws. Now a Jewish scholar 
hopes to give them a much-belated fair hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziony Zevit of the University of Judaism, who has been awarded a prestigious 
Guggenheim Fellowship that begins next month, said he will use the time and 
money to go beyond the biblical polemics to determine the range of beliefs of 
the Israelites, the people whose religion eventually gave rise to modern 
Judaism and Christianity as well. 
</P>
<P>
 He expects to be helped by inscriptions and other material from ritual sites 
discovered by archeologists in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the books of what became the Hebrew Bible, called the Old Testament by 
Christians, were written between 1100 B.C. and a period shortly after 586 B.C. 
when the temple of the Jewish King Solomon, called the First Temple, was 
destroyed by the Babylonians. The biblical texts represent the viewpoint of the 
priestly elites of Jerusalem, advocates of monotheism -- one God instead of 
many -- who ultimately prevailed over Israelite polytheists who believed in a 
number of gods, Zevit said. The Judaism of rabbis and synagogues developed 
several centuries later. 
</P>
<P>
 "What seems to be emerging" from his eight years of research, Zevit said in an 
interview, "is that the monotheists were a small and insignificant movement 
until after the destruction of the first Jerusalem Temple -- not the mainstream 
religion from which everybody was falling away" when the biblical prophets 
excoriated them for backsliding. 
</P>
<P>
 That means, Zevit said, that the Bible is not representative of what most 
Israelites were thinking 25 centuries ago because the later victors in the 
ideological struggles obscured the beliefs of the polytheistic losers in 
Israel's early history. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought that polytheism can be nothing other than stupidity, so they 
couldn't represent it fairly," said Zevit in his office at the hillside campus 
in Sepulveda Pass. "It's reasonable to think that people thought what they were 
doing was right because they were instructed that it was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Zevit, professor of biblical literature and northwest Semitic languages at the 
university, which is aligned with the Conservative branch of Judaism, was the 
only one of the 147 scholars awarded a 1994 Guggenheim Fellowship nationally 
whose research focus is on religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran archeologist William Dever of the University of Arizona, in a 
telephone interview, praised Zevit as eminently qualified both in 
historical-critical analysis of the Bible and in archeology -- which Dever 
called a rarity among scholars specializing in that era. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is deeply committed to Judaism but is willing to look at new sources, no 
matter how disturbing," Dever said. Zevit's book on the history of Israelite 
religion resulting from the research "will be a landmark study," Dever 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Zevit and Dever are not alone in seeking a better understanding of those 
scorned by the prophets Hosea and Ezekiel as "whores" to idols and ridiculed by 
Isaiah for seeking advice from "ghosts and the familiar spirits that chirp and 
mutter." 
</P>
<P>
 Dartmouth scholar Susan Ackerman wrote in last fall's Journal of Biblical 
Literature that since the late 1970s many studies have tried to redefine the 
varieties of Israelite religion in light of new archeological discoveries and 
more nuanced study of biblical texts. "We have thus come to doubt the rather 
homogeneous picture presented by the biblical writers," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Zevit said important inscriptions have been found at three sites in lands once 
populated by the early Israelites that link Yahweh, the God of the Bible, and 
Asherah, "the name of the goddess we know very well from Canaanite mythology," 
Zevit said. The Canaanites were Semitic neighbors of the ancient Israelites. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bible only knows the Canaanite gods Baal and Asherah, but here we have 
sites where Yahweh and this goddess are clearly associated," he said, 
indicating they were once worshiped together. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bible itself, Zevit noted, there are prohibitions against holding 
religious sacrifices in high places, but in the book of Kings it is mentioned 
that none of the kings have moved to high places because the people are still 
worshiping there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people are obviously doing things in specific violation of the Pentateuch 
(the law-giving five books of the Bible)," Zevit said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that Israel's neighbors in that time seemed to have their own 
national gods," he said. "The Israelites may have been hedging their bets or 
had divided loyalties -- the God of Israel takes care of these things and these 
other gods take care of other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Zevit compared the scenario to modern-day Japan, where Shinto beliefs and 
practices concerning death and ancestors find popular accommodation with 
Buddhist beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 In another example, Zevit said that the Pentateuch prescribes that an altar 
have four horns, upon which the blood of the sacrificial animal was to be 
placed to atone for sins. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you supposed to think when you find altars that don't have horns at 
all?" he asked. "Archeological data are giving us a whole bunch of altars with 
horns, without horns and other variations." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jerusalem Temple built during Solomon's reign was supposed to be the only 
place of worship for the Israelites, but to the south in Arrad have been found 
the remains of a temple-fortress that functioned for almost 300 years during 
the Israelite period, he said. "Furthermore, at the temple at Arrad they find 
curved standing stones, which are specifically prohibited in the Pentateuch." 
</P>
<P>
 "We also know of a temple that was excavated at Hazor," active in the same 
era, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bible has to be seen as a collection of partisan documents -- sometimes 
preaching to the converted, but also written to convince others, Zevit said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the historical books -- Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings (but not including 
Chronicles, which is a later version of Kings) -- from the moment that Joshua 
dies, Israel starts to go downhill, as the story is told," Zevit said. 
</P>
<P>
 "God is always sending figures to redeem, to teach, to preach, to convince 
Israel to change," he said. "Ultimately, nothing happens. At the end of the 
book of Kings, the people are in exile. All of the prophets held the threat 
over Israel's head that the worst (punishment would be) the exile of the people 
from the land, because that's the cancellation of the covenant that was made at 
Sinai between God and the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Zevit said the final authors of Kings were advancing an answer to the question 
of why the Israelites were then in enforced exile: "Here is the history that 
proves that you have blown it consistently. Why? You haven't obeyed these laws 
and these laws, and you can't plead ignorance. Why? Because God sent the 
prophets." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in contrast to the biblical picture that monotheism had reached the status 
of an orthodoxy which backsliders or pagans resisted, "Israelite religion was 
very heterogeneous in a lot of its practices -- much more than the biblical 
literature would allow us to suspect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not enough to say, 'Oh, that's not Israelite religion, that's paganism.' 
Paganism is the name we give to something we don't like," he said. "Many of 
these people were thinking they were good, pious and did what was expected of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This wasn't a matter of good people and bad people, but a lot of people with 
competing ideas," he said. "The struggle that monotheism underwent to be 
accepted was long and immense." 
</P>
<P>
 Zevit said he will spend a year working primarily in two Jerusalem museums 
during his fellowship and visit several archeological sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Dever, the archeologist, said Zevit's comprehensive synthesis of biblical, 
inscriptional and archeological materials will be unparalleled. 
</P>
<P>
 "My work will be of interest to the professional scholars, a minor percentage 
of our population, but it will also be of interest to people who take the Bible 
seriously," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is sometimes surprising, Zevit said. The professor said he was invited to 
speak a month ago to a group of people having only passing familiarity with the 
Bible. To the shock of a friend, he decided to talk on "The Theory of Sacrifice 
in Ancient Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 But the response then and in later phone calls was enthusiastic, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people out there -- Jews, Christians, believers, nonbelievers, 
affiliated, non-affiliated -- still take the Bible seriously as an intellectual 
monument to the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very curious about it," he added. "The religious can be curious 
about what their spiritual forerunners believed. Atheists and agnostics can be 
interested in what their intellectual forerunners thought. 'Ah,' they say, 
'that's the religion I don't believe in but I didn't know about it before.' "

FUTURE OF CHURCH-STATE TIES MAY REST ON PRINCE CHARLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From all the pomp, circumstance and tabloid furor that attends him, it's clear 
that the Prince of Wales is no ordinary fellow. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the recent broadcast of a controversial documentary of his life, it 
became clear that Prince Charles is no ordinary Anglican either. 
</P>
<P>
 If and when Charles succeeds his mother to become Great Britain's ruling 
monarch and head of the Church of England, there is a growing sense in Britain 
that the relationship between the church and the crown may never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am one of those people who searches," Charles told Jonathan Dimbleby, the 
well-known British journalist who hosted "Charles: The Private Man, the Public 
Role," broadcast nationwide June 28 on Independent Television. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the great prophets, all the great thinkers, those who achieved a far 
greater awareness of the aspects of life which lie beneath the surface, all 
share the same understanding of the universe, of the nature of God, of the 
purpose of our existence," he said. "And that's why I feel it's so important to 
understand the common threads which link us all in one great important 
tapestry." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles is heir not only to the British crown, but to the title "defender of 
the faith," bestowed by Pope Leo X on King Henry VIII in 1521 for his defense 
of Catholic Orthodoxy from the attacks of Martin Luther. He will also assume 
the role of supreme governor of the Church of England, which began with Henry 
VIII's assumption of power over the church after his break with Rome in 1534. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prince's evident interest in all religions and his statements that the 
king should represent not only Protestants but all believers has once again 
raised the question of "disestablishmentarianism" -- whether the Anglican faith 
should no longer be Great Britain's official religion. 
</P>
<P>
 The future king acknowledged in the interview that he preferred to be regarded 
as the defender of all faiths rather than the defender of one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would much rather it was seen as defending faith itself, which is so often 
under so much threat in our day, where the whole concept of faith or belief in 
anything beyond this existence, beyond life itself, is considered almost 
old-fashioned and irrelevant," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always felt the Catholic subjects of the sovereign are equally as 
important as the Anglican ones or the Protestant ones," Charles continued. 
"Likewise, I think that the Islamic subjects or the Hindu subjects or the 
Zoroastrian subjects of the sovereign are of equal and vital importance." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview with The Times of London, Archbishop John Habgood of 
York said any move to separate church and state would be "difficult and 
dangerous" and could jeopardize both the monarchy and the union between England 
and Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of the Church of England's disestablishment will come up at the 
Church of England's general synod, which began in York Friday. Bishop Colin 
Buchanan has called for the lifting of direct state control over the 
appointment of bishops and over legislation approved by the synod. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the British prime minister has the final say in the appointment of 
bishops; Parliament has the power to veto any measures approved by a church 
synod. Bishops are nominated by a panel of church and government leaders and 
approved by the crown. 
</P>
<P>
 But the long-simmering issue is not likely to be settled soon. The synod is 
expected to push for an amendment that will merely ask the archbishops of 
Canterbury and York to set up a commission -- the fifth this century -- to 
review the constitutional relationship between the Church of England and the 
state.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; TRANSIENT ARRESTED IN FATAL DESERT FIGHT 
</P>

 Sheriff's deputies on Friday arrested a 28-year-old transient on suspicion of 
murdering another transient in a desert fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies were also investigating a separate violent incident in which a 
17-year-old youth was seriously wounded by gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 The stabbing victim, a transient whose name was withheld pending notification 
of his family, was involved in a fight with Kevin Nudell at 10:10 p.m. Thursday 
in a desert area near 32nd Street West and Avenue M, said Sheriff's Deputy 
Diane Hecht. 
</P>
<P>
 Nudell was arrested in a parking lot just blocks from the crime scene and 
booked on suspicion of murder. Bail was set at $1 million, according to Deputy 
Rich Erickson of the Sheriff's Information Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who was stabbed in the abdomen, was taken to Antelope Valley 
Hospital, where he died at 4:15 a.m. Friday, Hecht said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second incident, deputies arrested two men in connection with the 
shooting early Thursday of Matthew Montague, 17. Deputies said Montague 
answered a knock at the door of his family's house in the 44000 block of 
Kirkland Avenue, talked briefly to two people at the door, then was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Montague remained in serious condition Friday at Antelope Valley Hospital with 
two bullet wounds, said Investigator John Kalita. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalita said the injured youth has been unable to talk about what the dispute 
in the doorway of his house concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, deputies arrested Jeffrey Burgener, 18, of Lancaster, who was 
jailed at the Antelope Valley station on suspicion of attempted murder and 
possession of illegal drugs. He was also being held in connection with a 
no-bail warrant issued because of an unresolved Juvenile Court case, Kalita 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies also arrested Robert Russo, 19, of Lancaster on suspicion of 
attempted murder. He was being held in lieu of $570,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Kalita said Burgener is suspected of driving Russo and a second suspect to 
Montague's house and waiting in the car while the shooting took place. Russo is 
believed to be one of the two people who fired at Montague in the doorway, the 
investigator said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The second suspect is known, and I'm trying to find him now," Kalita said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; KIDNAP-RAPE SUSPECT WON'T FIGHT EXTRADITION; 
CRIME: TIMOTHY SHUE, ACCUSED OF ABDUCTING A REAL ESTATE AGENT, COULD ARRIVE IN 
L.A. FROM UTAH BY MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Timothy Daniel Shue, accused of kidnaping and raping a Val Verde real estate 
agent last week, Friday waived his right to fight extradition from Utah, where 
he was apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue, 38, could be back in Los Angeles as early as Monday, according to a 
prosecutor assigned to the case. If convicted, Shue could face life in prison 
without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 He is wanted in several other states on similar charges, but California will 
get the first chance at convicting him. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue, a resident of Cadillac, Mich., allegedly abducted Paula Harrington, 26, 
at gunpoint after posing as a prospective customer June 29. She was found tied 
up in a motel room July 1 in Gila Bend, Ariz., a small town about 68 miles 
southwest of Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 To block or at least stall the extradition, Shue could have called upon 
prosecutors to convince a federal judge or grand jury that probable cause 
exists that he committed the kidnaping, according to Reid Lambert, his 
court-appointed attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shue decided a challenge would be futile, Lambert said, since such a 
standard is usually met easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "He indicated a desire to get this thing to California as soon as possible," 
Lambert said. "He'd like to face up to it down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Shue was arrested Tuesday in Ogden, Utah, when he allegedly displayed a 
handgun to a topless dancer in a club. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Magistrate Ronald Boyce ordered Shue held without bail, stating he is 
a flight risk and danger to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Shue could be in Los Angeles for arraignment as early as Monday, 
according to Assistant U. S. Atty. Debra Yang, the extradition could take 
several days or even a couple of weeks depending on how quickly the U.S. 
marshal's office moves to transport him here. 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert declined to comment on the content of discussions he had with Shue, 
who previously served a prison sentence in Michigan for armed robbery, but 
Lambert described his client as a person who "you would be surprised to learn 
has any criminal history." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would describe him as being very even," Lambert said, describing his mood. 
"He's a little melancholy, but I would say he's generally in a reasonable 
mood." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials suspect Shue of kidnaping, raping and robbing at least four women in 
Michigan and Ohio and another in Oregon. Law enforcement officials in those 
states said they intend to pursue charges against Shue, especially if he is 
acquitted or receives less than a life sentence in the Harrington case.

 In the Wiener Dog Summer Nationals, the contestants' bellies nearly scrape the 
ground, but a larger problem is coaxing dachshunds to run all the way down a 
100-yard straightaway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to have one of his favorite females at the end of the finish line to 
keep him going," said Kathleen Ayres, whose Otto will be among the entries 
today at the Multnomah Greyhound Park in suburban Portland, Ore. First prize is 
a year's supply of dog food. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs are trained to chase a plastic bag hooked to a wire on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Wiener Dog: "The crowd will go wild," predicted Larry Sorenson, president 
of the Dachshund Club of America. "The dogs put so much heart into it. They're 
kind of comical when they run, but they're dead serious about it. They have 
that long back and they coil it like an inchworm." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 15,000 spectators are expected for the annual affair. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think a dachshund is more or less a couch potato," one owner 
said. "That's not really true. They love to run their little hearts out." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who was the first American golfer to win the British Open? 
</P>
<P>
 Top priority: Folks who went to the Six Flags Over Mid-America amusement park 
in St. Louis this week were out of luck if they wanted to ride the Thunder 
River attraction. It was used as the whitewater course for the Olympic 
Festival's canoe-kayak competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Believe it or not: According to the National Safety Council's 1993 study of 
outdoor recreation-related injuries, a badminton player is more than four times 
as likely to suffer an injury requiring medical treatment as a hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Badminton players suffered 33.4 injuries per 100,000 participants, hunters 
only 7.4 per 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodby, Pooh: From Shaun Powell, in the Sporting News: "Pooh Richardson knew 
his days with the Pacers were numbered when his teammates voted him only a 
one-third share of playoff money. There weren't many tears being shed when 
Richardson was sent to the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Some of the guys felt he could've played (Richardson had a shoulder injury) 
and felt he was letting us down by not playing,' veteran Vern Fleming says." 
</P>
<P>
 One man's view: From David Letterman: "I'm really starting to get caught up in 
the World Cup. I just imagine millions of people watching all those games, 
yawning in a hundred different languages." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Letterman: "I can't believe how desperate ESPN has gotten for programming. 
Every time I've turned it on this week, they've been showing kickball." 
</P>
<P>
 Great start: Former figure skating champion Tonya Harding made her debut in 
pro wrestling as a guest manager of Al Barr in a match in Vancouver, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr wrestles under the name "American Love Machine."

<P>
 Brazil vs. Netherlands 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 12:35 p.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ABC, Univision 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: This is a game worthy of the semifinals because many believe 
undefeated Brazil (3-0-1) and the Netherlands (3-1-0) are among the four best 
teams in the World Cup. Romario and Bebeto will take their explosive attack to 
the Dutch. If they can break loose often enough, Brazil will be in great 
position. But Brazil cannot overlook the aggressive Dutch style. Led by Dennis 
Bergkamp, Holland can be as explosive as Brazil. While much has been said about 
Brazil's offense, it has almost gone unnoticed that the team has allowed only 
one goal in four games, that in a 1-1 draw with Sweden. Brazil's best defense 
is controlling the ball with its remarkable finesse. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: When teams at this level meet there are few surprises. The players 
know each other from club play and know what to expect. Brazil has replaced 
Leonardo, suspended for four games for elbowing Tab Ramos, with Branco. Neither 
team will change tactics today. "We can't change our system," Brazilian 
midfielder Mazinho said. "We have to keep playing the way we do." Said Dick 
Advocaat, Holland's coach, "We will try to play our game and we will try not to 
allow Brazil to play their game. That is all we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: Everyone will be watching the famous strikers, but the match will 
turn on defense. No doubt each side will get its chances, but the team that 
advances will be the one that plays error free. One defensive mistake is all it 
will take to lose. The midfield will carry the burden of trying to befuddle the 
other team's attack, stopping a threat before it becomes serious. The 
Netherlands needs another performance like its stirring 2-0 victory over 
Ireland in the second round. If it plays as erratically as it did in Group F, 
it could be in serious trouble. The Brazilians have something intangible that 
gives them the edge. Although this is not one of the great Brazilian teams, it 
has enough talent to continue on its quest for a fourth world championship. But 
not by much. This could be decided by penalty kicks. Brazil, 2-1. ELLIOTT

RAVELING, GARRETT RIFT CITED; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: LONGTIME COACH CLOSE TO 
ACCEPTING SETON HALL JOB OFFER AMID CONCERNS OVER USC FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 George Raveling's decision to explore the vacant basketball coaching position 
at Seton Hall is partly a result of differences with USC Athletic Director Mike 
Garrett, sources have told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, 57, who had a base salary of about $200,000 last season, has been 
offered a $500,000 contract at Seton Hall and is leaning toward taking the job, 
according to Seton Hall sources. The eight-year USC coach was tendered the 
offer Wednesday by Larry Keating, Seton Hall's athletic director. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday morning, Raveling and Garrett met at USC to discuss the Seton Hall 
offer and Garrett did not give Raveling any assurance about his future at USC, 
according to sources. Raveling has two years remaining on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, nothing has changed," said Raveling, who has been at UC Irvine 
this week preparing the U.S. national team for the Goodwill Games, which begin 
July 23. "As far as I am concerned, I'm still the basketball coach at USC." 
</P>
<P>
 The rift between Raveling and Garrett, who declined to comment Friday, is 
believed to have started when Garrett replaced Mike McGee as athletic director 
last year after Raveling reportedly withdrew himself as a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 With USC facing financial problems budgeting the athletic department, Garrett 
pointed to the USC basketball program as an area that needed improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, which has had difficulty with attendance at the Sports Arena, continued 
to have problems drawing crowds last season, averaging only 3,724 fans for 15 
home games despite gaining a berth for their fourth consecutive postseason 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 According to USC sources, Raveling's involvement with activities outside USC 
also was a concern as people questioned his ability to lead the Trojans to 
their first Pacific 10 Conference title since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Reportedly, Raveling is currently involved with at least 21 organizations, 
from the Black Coaches Assn. to the NCAA men's basketball rules committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling previously said he will not make his decision until late next week. 
But additional factors pointing toward Raveling's departure are the huge pay 
increase and the chance to go to an area near where he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling was born in Washington and attended high school near Philadelphia. He 
graduated from nearby Villanova, was an assistant basketball coach at Villanova 
for seven years and was an assistant at Maryland for three years. Seton Hall is 
in South Orange, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 The job would also take Raveling nearer to two of his closest coaching 
friends, Georgetown's John Thompson and Temple's John Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's gone through a lot since he's been here," said Mark Boyd, who graduated 
in May after starting four years under Raveling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there was a lot of conflict between him and Garrett at times, but I 
don't think that he'd run from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling did not improve his standing with Garrett when USC struggled to a 
16-12 record after bringing in four highly regarded freshmen to go along with 
returning starters Lorenzo Orr, Tremayne Anchrum and Boyd.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; FOR BRAZIL, A WINNING NUMBER?; SOCCER: AMID 
COMPLAINTS BY ROMARIO ABOUT MIDFIELD PLAY, TEAM TRIES TO KEEP IN STEP AGAINST A 
DANGEROUS NETHERLANDS SQUAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mario Jorge Lobo Zagalo has the cure for triskaidekaphobia, the fear of the 
number 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil's assistant coach likes the number. 
</P>
<P>
 The way he figures it, 13 is going to play a major role at the Cotton Bowl 
today when Brazil plays the Netherlands in the feature game of the World Cup 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, it had no effect at all. Holland defeated Brazil in the '74 
semifinals in West Germany, 2-0. Zagalo was Brazil's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 But usually the number game ends positively for Zagalo. He played on the great 
Brazilian teams that won world championships in 1958 and '62. The '58 title, he 
can readily explain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five plus eight equals 13," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1967, the left winger helped lead Botafogo of Rio de Janeiro to the 
national title. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six plus seven equals 13," he says of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 He was coach of Brazil's 1970 championship team, another aberration in 
Zagalo's strange world of figures. 
</P>
<P>
 And now? 
</P>
<P>
 "Add up the letters of Holland and Brazil and you get 13," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody likes 13, but I like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Zagalo's superstitions make any difference is debatable. He failed to 
mention this is World Cup '94, and nine plus four also equals 13. In a match of 
this magnitude, every little bit counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil (3-0-1) will begin today's game with unrest, but that's nothing new. 
Romario, the team's great striker and greater talker, has been running off at 
the mouth as much as around the practice field. 
</P>
<P>
 He has continued his tirade about the midfielders not getting him the ball 
enough. Dunga, Mazinho and the others have become frustrated by the 
accusations. They are playing the way Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira tells them, 
and Romario, the mouth that scored, cannot change that. 
</P>
<P>
 The stress of going for a fourth world championship has been evident. Rai, who 
again will be replaced in the midfield, was told of the change in front of 
teammates Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Not one to complain, Rai said Parreira embarrassed him. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not quite a team in turmoil, but Brazil's squabbling makes Dutch Coach 
Dick Advocaat smile. Not that he is saying anything. Holland is trying to play 
it cool in the oppressive North Texas heat. 
</P>
<P>
 With temperatures expected in the high 90s, Brazil thinks it will have a big 
advantage. The Dutch say they can handle heat after playing in the sauna of 
Orlando and Washington during first-round action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it is going to be even warmer because Brazil can handle it better than 
the Dutch," Bebeto said after Friday's practice. "It's going to be very 
difficult for the Dutch to follow the Brazilian rhythm of playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Parreira said the other day in Addison, Tex., that the heat will be a major 
factor in the outcome. He said Brazil will try to use its superior technical 
skills to control the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to conserve energy, go for the short passes," he said. "There is no 
other way to cope with the heat." 
</P>
<P>
 Romario, as usual, was more pointed in talking about the heat and FC Barcelona 
teammate Ronald Koeman, a Dutch defender. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know him," Romario said. "With the heat in Dallas, in the second half he 
won't survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Advocaat dismissed the remarks, saying Romario was simply trying to motivate 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of worrying about what Romario is saying, Koeman is concerned with his 
ballhandling and shooting. Holland's captain, Koeman will play a pivotal role 
in trying to stop the dazzling forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is impossible to mark him very well for the whole match," he said. "He has 
so much speed and he is very fast the first few meters. Bebeto is also very 
dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Romario did praise defender Stan Valckx. Romario and Valckx are friends and 
former teammates on a Dutch club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'll be in a real match playing against him," Romario said. "Holland 
will try to play against us, and that's better for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch will try to launch an assault led by Dennis Bergkamp, Peter van 
Vossen and Marc Overmars. If clicking, Holland (3-1) can be devastating, which 
will not be better for Romario and Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to play our game, and that is to attack," said Ed De Goey, Holland's 
goalkeeper. "That is always the spirit of the Dutch team." 
</P>
<P>
 The spirit of Brazil is questionable. It has not won convincingly except in a 
3-0 victory over Cameroon in first-round play. It reached the quarterfinals by 
defeating the United States, 1-0, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Netherlands also struggled in the first round and lost to Belgium, 1-0, in 
Orlando. But the Dutch were devastating in their 2-0 victory over Ireland in 
last weekend's second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Brazil, the Netherlands was not considered a strong contender for the 
Cup. Thus, Brazil is facing intense pressure, particularly from a soccer-mad 
populace that demands excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 How does Parreira handle it? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to hide, so you just have to face them and then do what you 
think is right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it means finding a combination that adds to 13.

 Think of the last two Super Bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 Then imagine similar outcomes, in similar games, for the last 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, think of Italy and Spain. And think of today. 
</P>
<P>
 On a soccer field surrounded by a stadium filled with blue and white 
hostility, Spain battles history and reputation in a quarterfinal World Cup 
soccer game against the favored Italians. 
</P>
<P>
 This is about more than earning a date in the semifinals next week in New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 It is about neighbors who have been pecking at each other from across a pond 
for more than 500 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite all conventional wisdom, there are still some in Spain who feel that 
Christopher Columbus belongs to them," huffed Giancarlo Galavotti, noted 
Italian journalist. "Those are the same people, I suppose, who think Pinocchio 
was written by Walt Disney." 
</P>
<P>
 When a generation of Spanish soccer players have wished upon a star, this is 
the victory they have wished for. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy narrowly leads the series, 8-6, with eight ties. But in important games 
other than in the Olympics, Italy almost always prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians set the tone for the rivalry in the first major professional 
meeting between the countries in 1934, in the second round of the second World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 They not only defeated Spain in overtime, they pounded them so badly that only 
four Spaniards could take the field for the extra session. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash forward 60 years. In May, Italy bullied the Spaniards again. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, it was Italy's best pro team, AC Milan, whipping Barcelona, 4-0, in 
the European Champions' Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen players from that match are in this game; nine from Spain, seven from 
Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Spanish players say they have already forgotten about May. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no thought of pay-back, they say. The World Cup is far too important 
for such distractions, they scold. 
</P>
<P>
 But defensemen Abelardo Fernandez says everyone is fibbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game is special," said Fernandez, who did not play for Barcelona. "It is 
a chance for some guys on this team to get revenge. I know I am rooting for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who has ever cheered for an underdog -- yes, all of you who have wept 
with football's Bills for the last four years -- will be cheering for Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 In eight previous World Cup appearances, Spain has advanced to the semifinals 
once, and never beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 In 12 appearances, Italy has won three championships, and also has finished 
second and third. 
</P>
<P>
 But unfortunately for the Spaniards, most of those cheering for them will not 
be able to get seats at Foxboro Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 While Boston-area officials were fuming when Ireland's games were sent 
elsewhere, they were forgetting that their second-largest immigrant population 
hails from Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks to Italy, people are going crazy about this game," said E.J. Kahn of 
the Boston Host Committee. "We could fill three Foxboro Stadiums with the 
demand for tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Spain Coach Javier Clemente, who said the referees in earlier World Cup games 
have been affected by the crowds, hopes this will be an exception. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we will not be the home team, but that will be OK -- as long as the 
referee is neutral," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 All things being equal, Spain believes it has its best chance to break the 
spell. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we do not fear the Italians," said Spanish goalkeeper Andoni 
Zubizarreta. "They've had a lot of personal problems. We've been playing well." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Italy came within minutes of being eliminated from the tournament by 
Nigeria before two dramatic goals by Roberto Baggio last week, whereas the 
Spaniards were flawless in a 3-0 second-round victory over Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy Coach Arrigo Sacchi -- "They once said he was the best in the world, now 
they say he is the worst in the world," Clemente said -- is also planning four 
lineup changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The most notable involves flashy forward/midfelder Giuseppe Signori, who is 
expected to be benched in favor of playmaker Antonio Conte. With that move, 
Sacchi is essentially clearing the lane for Baggio, hoping to take advantage of 
his extraordinary ballhandling skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spaniards, meanwhile, have never been more stable. If star midfielder 
Fernando Hierro's groin injury allows him to play, they will have their entire 
regular team available for the first time in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain also, finally, has an attitude . The Spaniards admitted Friday that 
their noticeably unshaven appearances have been part of their strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 They think their goatees and stubble will bring them luck. They say it worked 
for their 1992 Olympic champion soccer team in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
 A victory for them here would almost be something out of a book of fairy 
tales, which is where you can find the name of Carlo Lorenzini, an Italian from 
Florence. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1883, he wrote "The Adventures of Pinocchio." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the Spaniards care about stories involving a puppet swallowed by a 
whale. Not when, once again, it could happen to them.

ANALYSIS; EXPECT FAVORITES IN SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By HENRY A. KISSINGER and ANTHONY DAY, Henry Kissinger is the unpaid honorary 
chairman of World Cup USA '94. Anthony Day is Los Angeles Times senior 
correspondent. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After encountering the brutal, stifling heat of Dallas and Orlando, Germany 
and Belgium opened the second round of the World Cup in Chicago in welcome 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 It was like a typical summer's day in Northern Europe. It was chilly. It was 
windy. It was rainy. And both teams played well in one of the two best games of 
the round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Franz Beckenbauer, the great German player and coach, remarked in 1990 that 
the World Cup did not begin until the second round. It was true also in 1994, 
even though this year, due at least in part to FIFA's rules and procedure 
changes designed to step up the pace, the first-round games were more 
interesting than four years ago and the goals-per-game average was about 
one-third of a goal higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "Depend upon it, sir," wrote Dr. Samuel Johnson, "when a man knows he is to be 
hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully." And when the 
World Cup has moved to the single-elimination stage, the certain knowledge that 
minutes from now it's either you or the other guys can produce some terrific 
concentration and splendid games between well-matched teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckenbauer before the Germany-Belgium game, put the Johnson aphorism into 
soccer language: "Everything henceforth depends on speed, power and 
concentration." 
</P>
<P>
 He thought that if Germany fulfilled its potential, it would go through to the 
final, that of its possible rivals on the way there, Italy had the best 
material and that the new football powers like Saudi Arabia would fall by the 
wayside. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany and Belgium surely fulfilled that prediction. Germany was the stronger 
and faster, but Belgium played courageously and tenaciously. Its spectacular 
goalkeeper, Michel Preud'homme, saved Belgium from several German goals. 
Belgium could have used the obvious penalty kick the referee neglected to 
award, but the truth was that the Germans, for the first time in the Cup, 
played with tremendous power, led by forward Juergen Klinsmann and 34-year-old 
striker Rudi Voeller, called back from retirement, and nearly every attack 
threatened a goal. 
</P>
<P>
 A German team playing like the one that beat Belgium, 3-2, is likely to reach 
the final. 
</P>
<P>
 The other splendid game of the second round, a great game in any World Cup, 
was Romania's 3-2 dispatch of Argentina in a moderately hot and quite smoggy 
Rose Bowl. These teams are each capable of arousing extraordinary cynicism. But 
on this occasion, what you are bound to remember for many years was their 
commitment and verve: Romania's creative fast breaks, propelled by a brilliant 
Gheorghe Hagi, and Argentina's marvelous passing game. The rapid, end-to-end 
sweeps as Argentina attacked and Romania counterattacked produced a match that 
only a churl could have asked to be more exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 Spain swamped the Swiss in a fast, rough game in which Spain ordered 18 fouls 
to 12 shots at the goal against a Swiss side that lacked the power to keep 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden, playing very methodically, beat Saudi Arabia, 3-1. The Saudis were 
charming to watch but they still lack the experience to break into scoring at 
this level of competition. It was a tribute to their skill and courage that 
they got this far. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland, losing to the Netherlands, 2-0, played with verve and toughness. But 
important as defense is, no team can win consistently if it scores only two 
goals in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dutch, at 3-1, are looking strong. They seemed confident and determined. 
They have scored six goals and given up only three, but they lack the fluidity 
and imagination of the great Dutch teams of the '70s. When they face Brazil in 
the heat in Dallas, it will be power against panache. 
</P>
<P>
 The real question is whether the Brazilians are suffering from the Brazilian 
disease of subordinating goal scoring to technical brilliance. Their footwork 
is elegant but they have trouble finishing. Except for their 3-0 defeat of a 
squabbling Cameroon in the first round, they have scored no more than one goal 
from the field in any game. (Their second goal against Russia was on a penalty 
kick.) 
</P>
<P>
 It was much to the credit of the United States that it held Brazil scoreless 
in the first half and allowed only one goal in the second in the classic 
American football stadium at Stanford University under the clear blue sky and 
crisp air of Northern California. The United States, not having yet developed 
an identifiable soccer culture, confused the seasoned Brazilian team with its 
recklessly aggressive defense. But if Brazil does not develop a better 
finishing touch it will not prevail through the final week. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor Mexico! After slogging it out with Bulgaria to a 1-1 tie, it lost, 3-1, 
after overtime on a humiliating run of failed penalty kicks. Theirs was by far 
the more skilled side, but the defensive tactic it adopted seemed not to fit 
with its national style. It seems strange to us that Mexico waited for the 
penalty kicks and made no serious attempt to decide the game in its favor 
during overtime. A measure of this resignation was that Mexico didn't make any 
substitutions in overtime, despite the obvious exhaustion of some of its 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 This Cup's enigma has been Italy. It is a stereotyping cliche to call its 
sudden resuscitation and end-of-game 2-1 victory over Nigeria operatic, but it 
would be an accurate description of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 The renowned Roberto Baggio, who had done little for three games and most of 
the fourth, sprang to life in the 89th minute to tie Nigeria with a clever 
shot, then set the stage for a penalty kick in the 102nd minute by lobbing the 
ball over the head of a defender who committed a foul in a desperate effort to 
recover. Nigeria at its best played beautiful, muscular soccer. But in the game 
against Italy, it let itself be drawn into a European-style tactical game, for 
which it lacks the experience and perhaps the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy played much of the game with one man out. So did Brazil. If that is the 
way to win, perhaps FIFA, instead of awarding a penalty kick to a team, should 
reward it by taking a man off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 In the quarterfinals, Brazil will have trouble against the Dutch today in 
Dallas unless it can develop more power in its attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy's problem is psychological. No team has technically more accomplished 
players. It is not clear whether its coach can make them play together. If 
Italy -- and Baggio -- can mesh their great abilities today, it should take 
Spain in a close game. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the other quarterfinals, in the Romania-Sweden game Sunday, everything 
depends on which Romanian team shows up. If it plays as brilliantly and 
purposefully as it did against Argentina, Romania is likely to beat Sweden. But 
if it performs as poorly as it did in the first round against Switzerland, it 
will return to Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria has some first-class players. But Germany seems too strong. Our 
prediction for the semifinals is Germany-Italy and Brazil-Romania. But we could 
easily be surprised.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; SORCERY AFOOT?; DUMITRESCU YET ANOTHER 
ROMANIAN WITH SEEMINGLY MAGICAL ABILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What sort of magical spell do these Romanians put on the soccer ball, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 It is one thing for Gheorghe Hagi to bedevil a goalkeeper with a crazy 35-yard 
lob into the upper-right corner, such as the one that stunned Colombia's Oscar 
Cordoba in the first World Cup game at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps even more breathtaking was forward Ilie Dumitrescu's goal in the 11th 
minute against Argentina on Sunday, a hooking shot off a direct free kick on 
the left flank from just outside the penalty box. That's the simple 
description. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumitrescu's extraterrestrial shot was spinning and curving wildly -- topspin, 
side-spin and maybe even with backspin too. It didn't fool Argentina's 
goalkeeper, Luis Islas. Rather, the shot mocked him, curling over his left 
shoulder into the net's top-right corner. 
</P>
<P>
 "I practice a lot in training, the free kick," Dumitrescu says. 
</P>
<P>
 What shocked the Argentines was that they were waiting for Hagi to line up on 
that side, not Dumitrescu. They didn't know that the free kick is one of 
Dumitrescu's specialties. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my first free kick from the left side -- and I scored," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The world had not known much about the feats or feet of Dumitrescu until the 
second round of this World Cup tournament. He has been a star in Romania, the 
southeastern European country slightly smaller than Oregon in square miles. But 
the 25-year-old has escaped greater scrutiny by remaining at home, playing for 
Steaua Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of Romania's starters play outside the country, and Dumitrescu surely 
will make it nine after the World Cup. He has been quite open about saying he 
will play in the West and apparently his destination is Italy. Hagi has been 
playing for Brescia in the Italian league for the last two years and 
high-scoring teammate Florin Raducioiu was with Brescia before moving to AC 
Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, Raducioiu's absence let Dumitrescu emerge. Raducioiu was given two 
yellow cards in the opening round and was ineligible for the Argentina game. 
And Dumitrescu said he had not been himself in the first three games, trying to 
adjust to the time difference and flying to and from Pontiac, Mich., for the 
loss against Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagi was not surprised by the way Dumitrescu stepped up against Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 "We showed we are not a team of individuals, but rather a very good whole," 
Hagi said afterward. "Today Dumitrescu was the star. Tomorrow, it could be 
somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, that had been the rap against Romania -- too many stars and not 
enough teamwork. But Hagi and Dumitrescu, playing fast-break soccer, ran the 
Argentines into the ground and took turns setting each other up for goals after 
Dumitrescu had opened the scoring on the free kick. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, it was Dumitrescu showing marvelous vision, turning a 
two-on-one break into a three-on-two, waiting and holding up in the middle 
before passing off to the right to Hagi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hagi and I know each other well," Dumitrescu said. "I have been taking passes 
from Hagi since we played together at Steaua Bucharest." 
</P>
<P>
 At Steaua, Dumitrescu made a favorable first impression on the coach, Anghel 
Iordanescu, who became the Romanian national coach in June, 1993. He not only 
showed he had superior speed but that he can deliver a solid, accurate shot 
with either foot. And his passing and dribbling skills fit into the Romanians' 
often deadly and swift counterattack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Iordanescu had faith in me," Dumitrescu said. "I am happy I did something 
for the trust he placed in me." 
</P>
<P>
 Dumitrescu scored 54 goals in 138 games for Steaua from 1988-93 and more 
recently scored five in three games during a one-week span with the national 
team in February. In a warm-up match against the United States in 1993 at Santa 
Barbara and another game in early 1994, Dumitrescu scored all three of 
Romania's goals. 
</P>
<P>
 All of that was warm-up stuff for Dumitrescu's exploits on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think now we are in history," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumitrescu and his teammates are still adding chapters. Which is why the 
players -- other than Hagi -- have not been making themselves available this 
week before Sunday's quarterfinal here against Sweden. Romanian team liaison 
Julian Stanculescu went to Dumitrescu with a faxed list of questions from a 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he loves me very much and would like to help," Stanculescu said. "But 
he said he cannot do this. He must only think of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 So, one must watch Dumitrescu on the field to truly learn about him. But he 
could become a favorite in America. After all, this was his recent answer when 
asked his favorite aspect of the United States: 
</P>
<P>
 "The way Americans behave," he said.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / QUARTERFINALS; COMMENTARY; WITH TIME, GAME COMES INTO CLEAR 
VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In general, press coverage of World Cup soccer has been highly positive. The 
event has been a new experience for many of us and has been an attractive thing 
about which to write. So there has been a rush to gush. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's pause amid the puffing and praising and do a little panning. Let's 
be an ugly American. Let's take a look at soccer from the bar stool of a 
baseball fan -- which might be the very essence of an ugly American. 
</P>
<P>
 First, this yellow card-red card routine is silly. Every time I see one of 
these referees, dressed in his cute little shorts and knee socks, dash up to a 
player who has committed a foul and reach into his breast pocket to pull out a 
card and flash it in the offender's face, I snicker. 
</P>
<P>
 Picture this: Bruce Froemming has just called Mike Piazza out at home on a 
close play that costs the Dodgers the lead run in the ninth. The dust clears, 
Piazza is furious and in Froemming's face, and Tom Lasorda charges the plate, 
eyes bulging and veins popping in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Froemming braces, standing his ground as only Froemming can. Lasorda unleashes 
vulgarities and spittle. Froemming, having heard enough, reaches into his 
pocket and flashes a pink doily in Lasorda's face. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda, instantly mortified, turns and marches off through the dugout and 
into the clubhouse, serving his expulsion in shame. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day in The Times, the headline reads "Dodgers Blow Lead as Lasorda 
Gets Hanky. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the issue of soccer injuries. Frankly, until Tab Ramos was 
leveled, I didn't think real soccer injuries existed. I was convinced that Greg 
Louganis missed his calling by not trying soccer. The only problem is, these 
guys all do the same dive: forward tuck to fetal position, degree of difficulty 
zero. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember where we are coming from now. Our ugly American is sitting on a bar 
stool, eating pretzels, swigging beer and belching a lot, while he curses 
Lasorda under his breath for letting Tom Niedenfuer pitch to Jack Clark years 
ago, and before him on the big-screen TV appears a soccer game. 
</P>
<P>
 Quickly, one player is bumped by another and the first player crumbles to the 
ground in apparent agony. Our bar stool fan is concerned, because active pro 
athletes don't usually have seizures during games. 
</P>
<P>
 So he watches as the bumper is scolded and flashed a yellow card and the 
bumpee is carted off on a stretcher. He is mesmerized, because in the NFL, they 
don't use a stretcher for anything less than three broken bones. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, as if the hand of God has reached down to heal the sick, the bumpee 
bounces off the stretcher and sprints back into the game. Lo and behold, it is 
another medical miracle in soccer! 
</P>
<P>
 After a few more pretzels and a few more belches, our fan understands that 
what he is watching is part sport and part play-acting. So he reaches his 
conclusion easily: Real men don't eat quiche and don't play soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, there is the matter of the single referee. This sport takes a field 
bigger than a football field, 74 by 115 yards; puts 11 player-actors on each 
side, places a high measure of the outcome on the calls made, and then expects 
one person to see all and call all. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL has officials positioned strategically all over the field. The NBA 
went to three refs a few years ago and it is playing in a tiny area compared to 
soccer. The NHL does it with one guy, but he's also got much less territory to 
patrol and he is on skates. Baseball has an umpire on each base. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer throws this one poor guy out there, then sends him home in shame when 
he misses a call, even though he has to make most of them from 20 to 30 yards 
away and is dealing with better actors than they have on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the degrees of fouling are so vague. One player tackles another in what 
is deemed an illegal action and all that happens is that play is stopped for a 
few seconds, the ball is put down by the offended team and play resumes 
immediately. But soon after that, one player tackles another and, although it 
looks about the same as the previous infraction, it brings a stoppage of play 
and all sorts of formations and discussions and defensive walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The policing of the sport is a swirl and a jumble. Players are diving all over 
the field, the referee is pointing, signaling and gesturing while everybody is 
running around in circles, and linesmen along the sidelines are waving flags 
and pointing them like a couple of guys riding on the backs of convertibles 
during a Fourth of July parade. 
</P>
<P>
 To the untrained eye of our guy on the bar stool, this all appears to be some 
sort of foreign conspiracy to confuse and distract us until they are ready to 
invade. To him, watching soccer is not only stupid, but stupefying. 
</P>
<P>
 But then he figures it out. He sees that there is one hugely redeeming quality 
to soccer: It would be a cinch sport to bet. 
</P>
<P>
 All you have to do is research the referee, because he controls everything. 
Penalty kicks that he can award fairly easily are sure goals. Key players who 
are the goal-scorers can be red-carded right out of the game. Almost any goal 
that is scored can be called back by an offside ruling. Ticky-tacky fouls can 
be turned into life sentences. The referee is the game, and if you figure him 
out -- his politics, leanings, strengths, weaknesses, tendencies toward Italian 
restaurants -- you've got it. 
</P>
<P>
 So soccer, like all major American sports, will become a game played most 
seriously in Las Vegas. Vegas, which would promote action on seniors croquet if 
it thought it could make big bucks, will start giving over-unders on corner 
kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, our guy on the bar stool will be interested because he is betting -- 
betting because you are interested is not the American way -- and the growth of 
soccer in this country will be assured. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm positive about that.

 at Foxboro Stadium 
</P>
<P>
 Foxboro, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy vs. Spain 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 9 a.m. PDT 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ABC, Univision 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: Millions around the world will be watching the same thing as 
the Spaniards -- Roberto Baggio's legs. Baggio, No. 10 and wearing the braided 
ponytail, carries most of Italy's hopes. Will he be the daring player who 
scored twice in the final 35 minutes of an overtime victory over Nigeria in the 
second round? Or will he be the disappearing player who has only those two 
goals in four games despite having taken 15 shots? With forward Giuseppe 
Signori benched after missing 14 shots, the entire Italian offense will finally 
revolve around Baggio. But Spain's Albert Ferrer and Abelardo Fernandez say 
they will be ready. They are two of the hardest hitting defenders in the 
tournament. Between them they have committed 20 fouls and have been assessed 
three yellow cards for bad behavior. They also have manned a unit that has 
allowed only one goal a game. Assisting them will be two of the best 
midfielders in the Cup, Juan Antonio Goikoetxea and Miguel Nadal. The Italians 
will counter with a defense led by AC Milan stars Alessandro Costacurta and 
Paolo Maldini. The best matchup will be in the style section. The Italians will 
be pretty, the Spaniards rough. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Can this really be happening? Can the Italians, who have looked 
terrible in winning only two of their four games, really be headed back toward 
the final again? The Spaniards, undefeated in four World Cup games, one a tie 
with defending champion Germany, believe it is finally their turn for glory. 
They were nearly perfect against Switzerland and fully expected to be riding 
that emotion in a quarterfinal game against Nigeria. The last thing they 
wanted, or expected, to hear at Foxboro Stadium today was the Italian national 
anthem, and Italian players talking about destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: First, a secondary prediction. The winner of this game will play 
for the championship in the Rose Bowl. Germany, which probably will advance 
from the other quarterfinal in this bracket, will be no match for the skilled 
Italians or the determined Spaniards. So which will it be? For that answer, 
we'll look not at the statistics, but the calendar. The Spaniards have had six 
days of rest, the Italians three. In an emotional game between teams this 
close, an extra breath might be the difference. That noise you hear around noon 
today will be the good people of Barcelona, raising their roofs. Spain by a 
goal. In overtime, of course. BILL PLASCHKE

 In the "It's never too late to learn something new" category: Zacchary Bryan, 
12, of Glendale gave the Raiders' Nolan Harrison a lesson in juggling a soccer 
ball at a preview day of SoccerFest on Thursday at the Los Angeles Convention 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ring in the center of the 500,000 square-foot soccer festival, Bryan 
showed that he was clearly more adept at juggling -- keeping a soccer ball in 
the air by kicking it -- than Harrison. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a football player, I thought I was quick-footed," Harrison said. "But I'm 
not as quick as these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Final score: Bryan 15, Harrison 3.

 Joao Havelange, president of FIFA, said Friday in Dallas that the 
international governing body of soccer can do little to prevent such tragedies 
as the murder of Andres Escobar, the Colombia defender who was shot in Medellin 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Havelange said nothing could be done by FIFA to stop fanaticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at his first news conference of World Cup '94, Havelange said FIFA 
made its sentiments known by asking for two minutes of silence before the two 
games on the day of the murder. Escobar was shot for accidentally kicking in an 
own goal during a game against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot expect FIFA to be in every country and legislate what is 
occurring," Havelange said. "You cannot expect FIFA to send troops to try to 
bring about a type of calm to this disorder." 
</P>
<P>
 Sepp Blatter, FIFA general secretary, said it would be impossible for FIFA to 
take any action to quell the emotions of soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the United Nations are not able to stop any assassinations, how can FIFA, 
with only its spoken power, stop such cases?" he asked. ELLIOTT ALMOND

 Maybe It's a Cultural Thing: Ireland welcomed home its team Thursday with a 
celebration in Dublin's Phoenix Park.Officials, speculating that this was a 
form of the traditional joyous Irish wake, said that the crowd, there to salute 
a team that had been ousted rather ignominiously in a 2-0 defeat by the Dutch, 
numbered about 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, in the World Cup in England, Italy lost to North Korea, 1-0. When the 
Italians returned to Rome, they were greeted by fans throwing rotten fruit.

 "Any agent worth his 10% will be in America this weekend to assess a

 "Klinsmann v. Stoitchkov, (Martin) Dahlin v. (Gheorghe) Hagi, Romario v.

 How important is today's game against Spain for Italy's coach, Arrigo Sacchi? 
This important, according to the Turin-based daily La Stampa under a Page 1 
headline: "Tomorrow . . . the coach risks the guillotine or the altar." 
</P>
<P>
 Writes Curzio Maltese: "Is he crazy? A genius? Simply unlucky? Dictator? 
Fanatic? Scapegoat? Half of Italy is gnawing at the clinical and judicial 
'case' of Arrigo Sacchi. . . . (Nothing will) distract the popular tribunal 
made up of 30 million Italians who are summoned tomorrow night to see the 
Italian team win, or the rolling of a bald head with glasses." 
</P>
<P>
 Reports Giorgio Tosatti in the Milan daily, Corriere della Sera: "The country 
is disputing over Sacchi, who would be well advised to admit to some small 
errors, seeing as how we have been almost eliminated twice."

 "Foosball (table soccer). That's the best way to define the style of soccer

</P>
<P>
 "It's worth remembering that the goal against the U.S. team was scored only 
after Parreira's plan fell apart. . . . The duel against Holland in the 
quarterfinals is a good chance -- maybe the last -- for the coach of the 
national team to produce creativity in the midfield."

too foolish to admit that we can learn from a tournament in which we were not 
good enough to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our players and managers must open their minds -- and referees should be 
tough, even if it means a proliferation of red and yellow cards. It would mean 
a happy, glorious new year for British football."

 Jeff Idelson, a press officer at the Dallas venue and former media relations 
director of the New York Yankees, couldn't understand why Yankee minor league 
shortstop Robert Eenhoorn told him to say hello to Dutch goalkeeper Ed De Goey. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out that Eenhoorn, who was briefly called up by the Yankees earlier this 
season, is from Rotterdam, where De Goey plays club soccer for the Feyenoord 
club. Eenhoorn works out with the soccer team during the baseball off-season.

COMMENTARY; TO SETTLE THESE SCORES, IT WON'T TAKE MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Four big football games on tap this weekend. The Orangemen are at the Cotton 
Bowl. The Vikings are in San Francisco. Two of the game's longest-standing 
rivals meet in Foxboro. And Giants Stadium plays host to a classic tussle from 
the Black and Blue Division. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you haven't received your latest issue of Pro Futbol Weekly, expect to 
see four low-scoring games, dominated by strong running attacks, defense, 
tackling and ball control. 
</P>
<P>
 And look for the kickers to decide it in the end, each and every time. . . . 
BRAZIL-NETHERLANDS 
</P>
<P>
 Site: The Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Line: Brazil by 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches: Brazil has Carlos Alberto Parreira; the Netherlands has Dick 
Advocaat. At the moment, Parreira has very few advocaats -- not after millions 
of testy Brazilians watched their boys tie Sweden and go scoreless for 73 
minutes against the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brazil has the ball: Brazilian journalists will be yammering into their 
cellular phones, lambasting Parreira for benching Rai, for starting only one 
goalkeeper, for using 11 men instead of 10 (it worked so well against the 
Americans, no?), for getting Leonardo suspended and for not playing Pele. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Netherlands has the ball: The Netherlands' two best players, Marco 
Van Basten (out, sprained ankle) and Ruud Gullit (out, sprained ego) will be 
nowhere near it. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: The Netherlands routed Brazil, 2-0, in the semifinal round of the 
1974 World Cup. This has absolutely nothing to do with players competing 20 
years later, but serious soccer journalists will insist that the carry-over 
effect is tremendous. Major edge in momentum to the Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Chance for international incident: Greatly diminished since a) that 
Netherlands beat writer who joked about carrying a bomb aboard the Dutch team 
plane has been taken into custody and reprimanded, meaning no more plane 
evacuations and five-hour flight delays; and b) the Dutch are not playing the 
Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: 1-0. ITALY-SPAIN 
</P>
<P>
 Site: Foxboro Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Line: Italy by 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches: Javier Clemente for Spain and Arrigo Sacchi for Italy. Unless Italy 
is trailing at halftime. Then it would be Javier Clemente for Spain, Arrigo 
Sacchi's top assistant for Italy and Arrigo Sacchi on the first flight out of 
Logan to Paraguay. 
</P>
<P>
 When Italy has the ball: Thousands of headlines for the next day's Il 
Manifesto and Il Giorno will be written and rewritten. Baggio dribbles across 
midfield. Headline: "Viva Azzuri! " Baggio loses ball. " Woe Is Italia !" 
Baggio tackles Spaniard, regains possession. " Joy Is Ours !" Baggio slips on a 
hot dog wrapper. " Italia's Darkest Hour! " Baggio gets up, wipes himself off, 
heads ball toward Spanish net. " Comeback Of The Century! " Spanish goalie 
makes save. " Tears Of Despair Bathe Our Streets! " 
</P>
<P>
 When Spain has the ball: 58 million Italians hold their breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Spain is undefeated in games in which it scores a goal and the 
opposition does not. 
</P>
<P>
 Chance for international incident: Very good. It has been 502 years and these 
countries are still arguing about who gets credit for Columbus discovering 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: 1-0. ROMANIA-SWEDEN 
</P>
<P>
 Site: Stanford Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Line: Romania by 0.425. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches: Anghel Iordanescu and Tommy Svensson. Let's see, who coaches where? . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 When Romania has the ball: Play-by-play commentary to pop aspirin to. 
"Petrescu to Lupescu . . . over to Popescu . . . crossing pass to Dumitrescu . 
. . who waves at Iordanescu . . . back to Petrescu . . . who runs into Popescu 
. . . I escu, wasthatamiscue?" 
</P>
<P>
 When Sweden has the ball: Watch out for Tomas Brolin, Sweden's preeminent 
"withdrawn striker." Which is saying something, considering Sweden leads the 
world in withdrawn strikers. 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Swedes are undefeated since midfielder Klas Ingesson plowed his car 
into a moose in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Chance for international incident: Virtually nil. This rivalry's been nowhere 
since Borg and Nastase retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: 1-0. BULGARIA-GERMANY 
</P>
<P>
 Site: Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Line: Germany by 0.5667. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches: Dimitar Penev for Bulgaria, Berti Vogts for Germany. Penev coaches 
traditional European football -- pack the defense in, counterattack when 
possible, build around the goalkeeper. Vogts coaches traditional American 
football -- blitz the guy with the ball, sack him, pound him, whack him in the 
head, knock his teeth loose . . . and advance to the quarterfinals because the 
referee isn't looking. 
</P>
<P>
 When Bulgaria has the ball: It had better duck and cover, especially when it 
traipses inside the German penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
 When Germany has the ball: German fans begin to yawn. What they want to see 
are Bulgarians eating grass, Bulgarians wrapped around the goal post, 
Bulgarians getting carted off the field. Action, Berti, action! 
</P>
<P>
 Key stat: Germany is winless in the last two world wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Chance for international incident: Downgraded, if the reports from FIFA are to 
be believed. According to FIFA, the referee for the Bulgaria-Germany game will 
be permitted to wear a whistle, and blow it, unlike the referee for the 
Belgium-Germany game. 
</P>
<P>
 Prediction: 1-0 (on penalty kicks).

 Saying the courts were being used as a bargaining chip, a federal judge in New 
York on Friday ordered the NBA and the Players Assn. to resolve contract issues 
this weekend or face a one-day trial next week in which they would have to live 
with his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Kevin Duffy would be left to determine the legality of the NBA's salary 
cap, draft and restricted free agency, but Duffy said he doubted either side 
wanted that. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll have to live with something you don't like," Duffy said, noting both 
sides had brought the issue to court several times before.

 A Louisiana judge extended a temporary restraining order in New Orleans that 
prevents the NBA from publishing a 1994-95 schedule, despite an order from a 
federal judge telling the state court to halt proceedings in the matter.

 U.S. District Judge James Rosenbaum last week ordered a halt to proceedings in 
Judge Bernette Johnson's court arising from a suit filed by Top Rank of 
Louisiana. Top Rank filed suit and won the restraining order in Johnson's court 
after the NBA refused to approve Top Rank's plan to buy the Minnesota 
Timberwolves and move the team to New Orleans.

order. Track and Field

OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; FAWCETT GOES FROM COACH TO PLAYER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARA NAJARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joy Fawcett knows the drills. 
</P>
<P>
 She ought to. 
</P>
<P>
 She usually is in charge of them, as coach of the UCLA women's soccer team.  
</P>
<P>
 Here, when she participates in drills, she usually is the best at them, which 
isn't surprising when you know that she is also a member of the U.S. national 
soccer team, and for the last two weeks, a member of the Olympic Festival's 
West team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of nice, not to have to coach," Fawcett said with a laugh. "I 
wasn't looking to go into coaching, when I started at Long Beach (City 
College). I thought it would be a good way to go to school, earn my teaching 
credential and make a little money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ended up loving coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, Fawcett has been a feet-on coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I jump in to show them how to do something," she said. "Sometimes 
it's just easier than explaining." 
</P>
<P>
 But she can't explain her good fortune at drawing coaching jobs.  
</P>
<P>
 Fawcett started coaching at Long Beach CC after a parent of a player suggested 
she apply. The team went only 5-9, but that was a school best. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Sigi Schmid, UCLA men's coach, suggested she apply at UCLA. She 
did, got the job and guided the Bruins to a 10-6-1 record in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Although soccer seems to come easily to Fawcett, she maintains that she always 
has more to work on, another step to go.  
</P>
<P>
 Playing for the Festival team might be construed as a step back for a player 
on the national team -- usually the Olympic Festival is for younger players to 
gain experience -- but because women's soccer will become a medal sport at 
Atlanta in 1996, competition for spots on the national team has intensified. 
</P>
<P>
 Fawcett, 26, of Huntington Beach, has been part of the national team for seven 
years and was selected as female player of the year by U.S. Soccer in 1988 and 
1989. This is her third Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the best places for a woman soccer player to train," she said. 
"There's not that many opportunities for women's soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 But other circumstances as well prompted her to join the Festival team. 
</P>
<P>
 She became pregnant with her daughter, Katelyn, 10 1/2 months ago, so she was 
concerned about staying on top of her game and how the pregnancy might affect 
her fitness. So, Fawcett is using the Festival to get back into the swing of 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that she was ever really far out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Through her seventh month, she ran two miles three times a week. She continued 
step-aerobics right up to May 17, when Katelyn was born. 
</P>
<P>
 After a two-week workout break, she started running again with Katelyn in tow. 
Actually, her daughter was being pushed in a contraption that looks more like a 
go-cart than a stroller. 
</P>
<P>
 Fawcett has lost all of the 22 pounds that she put on during pregnancy and 
still takes Katelyn on her exercising excursions, whether practicing or 
running. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of living in the athletes' village here, Fawcett is staying with a 
family that watches Katelyn during games. During practices, friends and 
teammates help with Katelyn. 
</P>
<P>
 West Coach Lesle Gallimore, who played with Fawcett at California and still 
does on the national champion club, Ajax, said that Fawcett proves that 
aspiring Olympians can have a life outside athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 But it isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I don't get as much sleep as I used to," Fawcett said. "(Katelyn) likes 
to stay up late and get up early. But it is fun." Olympic Festival Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Fawcett's West team lost to the East, 2-1, in the gold-medal game. Julie 
Harris of Los Alamitos scored for the West. . . . In cycling, Meghan O'Brien of 
Tustin finished third in the women's 60-kilometer road race. Cori Book won and 
Ryan Kelly was second. . . . In the men's 110 kilometers, Norman Carter of 
Redlands had a lead that provided his Southwest squad with an edge of nearly 
five minutes before faltering. Carter finished 10th. Cory Domingues finished 
first and Damon Kluck was second for the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Joyner-Kersee won the 100-meter hurdles in 12.69 seconds, the fastest 
time in the United States this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Her time also was a Festival record, breaking the mark of 12.76 set by Gail 
Devers last year.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; OFFERMAN NOT IN PLANS DESPITE SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Offerman is reportedly playing well at triple-A Albuquerque, but the 
Dodgers say they have no immediate plans to bring him back as the starting 
shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Claire, executive vice president, said Offerman's return depends on the 
needs of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as Rafael (Bournigal) continues to play well and, along with that, 
the team continues to do well, I don't see any reason to make a change there," 
Claire said. "If we are playing well and are in first place, that is not a 
combination that I want to break up." 
</P>
<P>
 Bournigal, recalled from Albuquerque on June 27, has been playing exceptional 
defense, taking away hits as well as making routine plays. He is batting .258 
since his recall, with one strikeout in 31 at-bats. In Albuquerque this season, 
Bournigal struck out nine times in 208 at bats.

 "Here's a kid that three or four years ago they were going to make a coach, 
but they had some injuries and moved him up and he played well," said Coach 
Bill Russell, who made Bournigal his starting shortstop at Albuquerque the past 
two seasons. "He makes great plays -- if he gets to the ball, you're out. His 
weakness is that he doesn't have a strong arm, but Ozzie Smith didn't either. 
And he won't strike out." 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1991 season, Bournigal said there were two shortstops at 
Albuquerque, Offerman and Luis Martinez, and no place for him. So the club sent 
him to Class-A Vero Beach to be a player-coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin Kennedy, (then a minor league manager) told the club, 'Hey, this guy 
can play,' so I went to double-A and played everyday," Bournigal said. "In two 
or three weeks Offerman was called up and I went to triple-A again. Then the 
following year Billy (Russell) said that I would be his starting shortstop. He 
told me not to worry, because I was going to play." 
</P>

<P>
 Jim Gott, making his first rehabilitation start for Class-A Bakersfield, gave 
up no runs and two hits in two innings. Twenty of his 27 pitches were strikes.

 Utility outfielder John Cangelosi, put on waivers Tuesday by the New York 
Mets, was released Friday after he cleared and then turned down a minor league 
assignment. In 62 games, Cangelosi batted .252 with four doubles, no home runs, 
four runs batted in and 14 runs scored in 111 at bats. . . . Met center fielder 
Ryan Thompson was sidelined with a strained left thigh. MARYANN HUDSON

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; BOSTON'S VALENTIN MAKES SOLO TRIPLE PLAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortstop John Valentin made the 10th unassisted triple play in major league 
history and then touched off a three-home run outburst by the Red Sox as Boston 
defeated the Seattle Mariners, 4-3, Friday night at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 With Seattle runners moving from first and second base in the top of the 
sixth, Valentin went to one knee to catch a line drive by Marc Newfield. He 
then stepped on second base to double off Mike Blowers and trotted a few steps 
to tag Keith Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy didn't run, so I thought there was one out. I looked up to see the 
board and realized there was nobody out," Valentin said. "So I tagged him." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first unassisted triple play since Mickey Morandini made one for 
Philadelphia against Pittsburgh on Sept. 20, 1992. The previous one in the 
American League was by Ron Hansen of the Washington Senators at Cleveland on 
July 30, 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentin then led off the bottom of the inning with his sixth homer. Andre 
Dawson followed with a double to knock out starter Dave Fleming, and Tom 
Brunansky greeted reliever Bill Risley (6-5) with his sixth homer. Two outs 
later, Rich Rowland hit his fifth homer. All three homers went into the screen 
atop the left-field fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Rodriguez, 18, the first choice in the June 1993 draft, became the 
youngest player to appear in the major leagues this season when he made his 
debut with the Mariners at shortstop. Rodriguez went hitless in three at-bats 
but made a diving stop in the hole on Tim Naehring's grounder in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 13, Oakland 3 -- The Orioles ended Bobby Witt's scoreless-inning 
streak at 28 and stopped the Athletics' five-game winning streak with a rout at 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Witt (7-8) had allowed only nine hits in throwing three consecutive shutouts. 
But after pitching a scoreless first inning, he gave up two unearned runs in 
the second and a three-run homer to Chris Hoiles in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Mussina (13-4) gave up a run and five hits in seven innings, walking one 
and striking out a season-high eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 9, Milwaukee 5 -- Julio Franco and Bob Zupcic homered and Norberto 
Martin drove in three runs as the White Sox moved into a tie for first in the 
Central Division at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Raines added two runs batted in for the White Sox, who with their 50th win 
moved into a tie with Cleveland for first. Jason Bere (9-2) got the victory 
after three consecutive no decisions as Chicago won for the 16th time in 20 
games, including eight of nine on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 7, Texas 3 -- Cecil Fielder and Junior Felix hit home runs to help the 
Tigers end a three-game losing streak with a victory over the Rangers at 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, who lost four of five games to the Rangers last weekend in Texas, 
scored three runs in the fourth and two in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City 6, Toronto 5 -- Vince Coleman's run-scoring single capped a 
two-run rally in the ninth inning that gave the Blue Jays their seventh 
consecutive home loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 5-4, Felix Jose singled leading off the ninth against Darren Hall 
(1-3), and stole second. With one out, Brent Mayne singled to center to bring 
in Jose with the tying run. Terry Shumpert's single moved Mayne to second, and 
one out later, Coleman grounded a single to center. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 8, Cleveland 6 -- Shane Mack hit the fourth grand slam of his career 
in the first inning and the Twins built a seven-run lead and held on at 
Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Tapani (9-5) controlled the Indians through five innings before running 
into trouble in the sixth, when he allowed a three-run homer to Carlos Baerga.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; LEFFERTS 'WASN'T GETTING THE JOB DONE' 
</P>

<P>
 The Angels released veteran left-hander Craig Lefferts and activated relief 
pitcher Scott Lewis from the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Craig just wasn't getting the job done," Manager Marcel Lachemann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefferts struggled after Lachemann became manager, posting an 8.27 earned-run 
average in 16 appearances. Under Buck Rodgers, Lefferts had a 1.47 ERA in 15 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels had been trying to trade Lefferts but his contract got in the way. 
He earns a base salary of $400,000 and already has been paid $150,000 in 
incentives this year. He was scheduled to earn $75,000 in incentives for his 
35th and 40th appearances, and then start earning $100,000 for every five 
games. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Pitching coach Chuck Hernandez rejoined the team after the birth of his son, 
Cody Chase (7 pounds 14 ounces). Cody was in intensive care after delivery but 
Hernandez reports that the baby is home and doing fine, as is Donna Hernandez, 
wife and mother. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Designated hitter Chili Davis says he doesn't really care if he gets an at-bat 
in the All-Star game Tuesday, but. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm in it, I'm going deep." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was bypassed for the home-run hitting contest in favor of Albert Belle, 
Ken Griffey Jr., Ruben Sierra and Frank Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 But to hear him tell it, nothing could happen at the All-Star game that could 
surpass his thrill Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I got to meet Mickey Mantle today," he said. "Can you believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever John Dopson, put on the disabled list June 24, will not have to 
undergo surgery on the bone spur in his right shoulder. He still is unable to 
even play catch, however, and the Angels don't expect him to go on a 
rehabilitative assignment until possibly August. BOB NIGHTENGALE

 San Francisco Giant all-star second baseman Robby Thompson will be out for the 
year after undergoing surgery on his right shoulder. Thompson, 32, underwent a 
1 1/2-hour operation to repair a tendon in the rotator cuff and remove damaged 
tissue and cartilage from the shoulder.He was batting .209 with two home runs 
and seven RBIs in 35 games. In 1993, Thompson batted .312, hit 19 home runs and 
had 65 RBIs. . . . Florida Marlin closer Bryan Harvey, who has pitched only 10 
1/3 innings this year because of injuries, will undergo groin surgery next week 
and may miss the rest of the season. Rehabilitation is expected to take at 
least six weeks. . . . Toronto Blue Jay reliever Duane Ward underwent an 
arthroscopic procedure in Birmingham, Ala., and is finished for the season. 
Ward, who has been on the disabled list all season, was found to have a partial 
tear of the rotator cuff as well as some deterioration in the upper lip of the 
cuff. James Andrews directed the surgery on the 30-year-old pitcher, who led 
the American League with 45 saves last season.

USC'S BOSEMAN TO SIT OUT A MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 USC guard Stais Boseman will be academically ineligible for the first month of 
next basketball season and could sit out the entire season if his summer school 
grades are inadequate, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Boseman, a 6-foot-4 freshman from Inglewood who played in all 29 games last 
season and led the team with 38 steals, will sit out at least the first five 
games for the Trojans. If he fails to pass two summer school courses after not 
earning enough credits during the spring semester, he will sit out season.  
</P>
<P>
 Boseman's ineligibility comes one month after fellow freshman Avondre Jones, a 
6-foot-11 center, was released from his scholarship over an apparent dispute 
regarding his playing time. LONNIE WHITE

BOXING; GONZALEZ DEFEATS DIAZ BY TECHNICAL KNOCKOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five months after his greatest victory, Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez returned 
to the Forum ring Friday night radiating confidence, paving the way for a 
potential $1-million payday this October. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, possessor of two-thirds of the major light-flyweight titles, scored 
a technical knockout over Armando Diaz before 3,443, the fight being stopped 
after three rounds when Diaz was discovered to have suffered a broken nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, it took Gonzalez 10 rounds, and more than 1,000 punches, to 
defeat Diaz. This time, Gonzalez knocked Diaz (22-17) down with a left-right 
flurry to an already-bloody nose late in the third that all but ended the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the fourth could begin, ringside physician Adam Karns examined Diaz and 
recommended that referee Pat Russell stop the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't harder or easier than the last time," Gonzalez said. "I was just 
able to take him out quicker." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few days, negotiations have heated up to stage a third bout with 
former champion Michael Carbajal, who lost his International Boxing Federation 
and World Boxing Council titles to Gonzalez last February at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Carbajal knocked out Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 After Friday's fight, Gonzalez (39-2, 27 knockouts) said that he is prepared 
to take on Carbajal again whenever Carbajal wants -- as long as Gonzalez is 
paid $1 million for the third match, the same amount Carbajal made for the 
first rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal is scheduled to fight July 15 for the World Boxing Organization 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Mendoza, Gonzalez's adviser, said an agreement might be finished by 
early next week.

<P>
 Matt Williams hit his 32nd and 33rd home runs to tie Ken Griffey Jr. of 
Seattle for the major league lead, and the Giants defeated the Philadelphia 
Phillies, 3-2, Friday night at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Bonds tied the score in the sixth with his 23rd homer, and Williams put 
the Giants ahead with his second home run of the game. Williams, who also hit a 
solo shot in the fourth inning, has 10 homers in his last 16 games and is on a 
pace to tie Roger Maris' record of 61 homers in a season, set in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 All three San Francisco homers came off Fernando Valenzuela (0-2), who was 
making his third start for Philadelphia, which lost its sixth in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Strawberry got his first hit for the Giants in the fourth when he hit a 
bouncer to third and beat Mariano Duncan's throw. The throw was wide and 
skipped past first baseman John Kruk, allowing Strawberry to take second. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 14, San Diego 0 -- The Expos pounded out 11 extra-base hits, 
including a team-record four triples, and Kirk Rueter pitched seven strong 
innings at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal, 7-0 against San Diego this season, established a season-high for 
runs and had 18 hits, one shy of its best total this season. Rueter (4-2), 
allowed three hits, struck out five and walked two in seven innings. He also 
had a run-scoring single. Andy Benes (6-10), coming off a one-hit shutout 
against New York, allowed seven runs and nine hits, eight for extra bases. He 
left without retiring a batter in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida 5, Colorado 2 -- Gary Sheffield and Jeff Conine homered and three 
Florida pitchers combined on a five-hitter at Miami, as the Marlins ended the 
Rockies' four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Weathers (8-7) allowed all five hits and two runs in 6 1/3 innings. 
Sheffield hit his 18th home run in the fourth inning after Jerry Browne singled 
for the first hit off Lance Painter (2-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Weathers' strong pitching performance came the same day the Marlins announced 
that closer Bryan Harvey will have surgery on an aggravated muscle near his 
groin and might be lost for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati 12, Pittsburgh 4 -- Thomas Howard's three-run home run highlighted 
an eight-run third inning that powered the Reds to their eighth consecutive 
victory over the Pirates at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati -- which had four starters out of the lineup in left fielder Kevin 
Mitchell, center fielder Deion Sanders, shortstop Barry Larkin and second 
baseman Bret Boone -- sent 11 batters to the plate in the third for its 26th 
comeback victory of the season. John Smiley (9-8) won his fifth consecutive 
start by allowing six hits over eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 2, Atlanta 0 -- Bob Tewksbury pitched a four-hitter at Atlanta, for 
his first shutout in almost four years and the fourth of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Tewksbury (10-7) gave up two singles in the first inning and a double by Jeff 
Blauser in the fourth. He retired 17 in a row until Blauser singled with two 
out in the ninth, then retired David Justice to complete his first shutout 
since Aug. 17, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Maddux (11-5) suffered his third loss in his last four decisions.  
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 6, Houston 5 -- Mark Grace led off the 11th inning with his third home 
run of the season at Chicago, as the Cubs ended the Astros' six-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Grace homered off John Hudek (0-1) to end a four-game losing streak for the 
Cubs. The winning pitcher was Jose Bautista (3-3), who worked one inning of 
scoreless relief.

WEEK AFTER BEING HIT BY BULLET, LPGA'S WILLIAMS SHOOTS A 68

<TEXT>
<P>
 A week after being hit by a stray bullet, Kim Williams shot a three-under-par 
68, only two strokes back of the leaders in the opening round of the LPGA Jamie 
Farr Toledo Classic at Sylvania, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Open champion Lauri Merten, Amy Alcott and last week's winner at 
Youngstown, Tammie Green, shared the lead with 66s. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was shot last Saturday night as she was approaching a drug store in 
Niles, Ohio. She was among the leaders in the Youngstown-Warren Classic but was 
unable to play the final two rounds after being injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet remained deeply embedded in a rib after hitting Williams in the 
neck and traveling through her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams went to the first-aid room at the conclusion of Friday's round, and 
tournament officials said she was unable to speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Meg Mallon was one shot back at 67 and seven golfers joined Williams at 68, 
including Hall of Famer Nancy Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Davies , was among seven players who shot 69 on the 6,270-yard, par-71 
Highland Meadows Golf Club.

GOLF / THOMAS BONK; CASPER'S NO GHOST OF HIMSELF AS SENIOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Billy Casper won the U.S. Open twice and the Masters once, he won at least one 
tournament a year for 16 consecutive years and he won a total of 51 tournaments 
on the PGA tour -- more than anyone but Sam Snead, Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, 
Arnold Palmer and Byron Nelson. But with nine victories, Casper has won more 
money on the senior tour than he did in his 'other' professional golf life. 
</P>
<P>
 Casper, 63, who lives in Chula Vista, acknowledges that he is experiencing the 
good life. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can keep from falling out of a golf cart or stepping in a hole and 
hurting myself, I can probably make $10,000 a week, maybe more," Casper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego native turned pro in 1954, joined the tour a year later and in 
1956 began a career that included a streak of tournament victories each year 
through 1971. The only golfers with longer such streaks are Nicklaus and 
Palmer, who won at least one event a year for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The era was marked by dominant players, including Nelson, who set a Joe 
DiMaggio-like record of 11 consecutive victories, from early March to early 
August in 1945. Those days are long gone, Casper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many fine players now -- they're great players -- but I don't 
think anyone will win 50 tournaments again," Casper said. "It's parity. You 
have a nucleus of potential superstars, but whether they gain the prominence of 
the Nicklauses and Palmers, we'll have to wait and see." 
</P>
<P>
 Casper said he is active in charity work and will be the host professional for 
the first Jackie Robinson Invitational golf classic July 18 at Riviera Country 
Club. Dodger owner Peter O'Malley, ARCO chairman Lodwrick M. Cook and Rachel 
Robinson, Jackie's widow, are in charge of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jackie Robinson Foundation awards college scholarships of up to $5,000 a 
year for four years to top minority high school graduates with financial need. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to play are Dick Butkus, Don Newcombe, Joe Morgan, Johnny Mathis, Al 
Downing, Walt Hazzard, Alan Thicke, Joanna Kerns and Ann Meyers Drysdale. 
Casper will conduct a clinic and will play one hole with each foursome.

 Golf shrink: Donna LaTreill is a Newport Beach hypnotherapist and 
psychologist, and she also has studied parapsychology. In short, she could be 
the perfect person to cure tormented golfers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are desperate people out there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are on the golf course, according to LaTreill, who has released a 
self-help video called "Mental Golf," which carries the message that the key to 
successful, enjoyable golf is to think positively and avoid stress. 
</P>
<P>
 LaTreill said she realized the need for her video after watching the golfers 
on a par-four hole from her home along the fairway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen 90% of the people going miserably by, throwing clubs, yelling 
obscenities," she said. "There are some things that are very undesirable in 
their games." 
</P>
<P>
 LaTreill, who is also on the test panel for Callaway Golf, said golf relates 
to broader areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can improve your golf, you can improve your life," she advises.

 Nice drive: Colleen Walker's hole in one in the final round of the 
Youngstown-Warren LPGA Classic last weekend was the right shot on the wrong 
hole. She could have won a car if she had aced another par three. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get a car," Walker said. "All I got was a couple of 'Nice shots.' "

 What about Rider Cup? Should senior golfers be allowed to ride golf carts in 
USGA events? 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Palmer doesn't think so, at least in major tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if you are going to play in championships such as this, you should 
walk," Palmer said at the U.S. Senior Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you physically can't walk, then you go ride the golf cart (elsewhere) 
and go enjoy the game and the hitting of the golf ball but not in a major 
championship -- not one you would consider putting up on your wall," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Associated Press, a majority of the senior golfers ride carts 
during Senior PGA Tour events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love golf carts. I use them myself," Palmer said. "But in a major 
championship, you have to hoof it. That's part of the physicalness of winning 
the golf tournament."

 Simon says be happy: After winning the U.S. Senior Open, Simon Hobday kissed 
his golf ball, then got down on all fours to kiss the green at Pinehurst three 
times. Hobday also kissed the trophy and gave USGA officials high-fives during 
the awards ceremony.

MARE BREAKS RECORD FOR MILE BY A TROTTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Beat The Wheel set a world record for a mile by a trotter on Friday, circling 
the Meadowlands Racetrack in 1:51 4/5. 
</P>
<P>
 Beat The Wheel, a 4-year-old daughter of Defiant Yankee, broke the record of 
1:52 1/5 set by Mack Lobell as a 3-year-old in 1987 at Springfield, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Beat The Wheel surged in the stretch to defeat Pine Chip. There was no 
wagering on the race because there were only five starters including Pine Chip, 
winner of last year's Breeders Crown 3-year-old colt and gelding trot and the 
Kentucky Futurity, third leg in trotting's triple crown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never even thought about beating Pine Chip," said Cat Manzi, Beat The 
Wheel's driver. "Turning for home, though, she was full of trot. I moved her 
out and she just blew by. 
</P>
<P>
 "She threw a shoe at the quarter pole and it hit her and cut her a little bit 
on the stifle. She's a little rocky (coming from) behind sometimes anyway, and 
losing the shoe made it worse. It's amazing she stayed trotting." 
</P>
<P>
 Pine Chip finished 1 1/2 lengths behind Beat The Wheel. Racing timekeepers 
equate one length to one-fifth of a second, meaning that Pine Chip also 
challenged Mack Lobell's record. Only the winner's time is official, however.

THOROUGHBRED RACING; LAKEWAY, SARDULA WILL TANGLE AGAIN IN THE HOLLYWOOD OAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New York has been both kind and cruel to trainer Gary Jones in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Monday, Jones ran Kingdom Found in the $350,000 Suburban Handicap at 
Belmont Park. It was a long way to travel for a colt to finish last and be 
beaten by more than 15 lengths. Jones could have stayed home and run Kingdom 
Found in the $750,000 Hollywood Gold Cup, over a track on which the horse came 
within a neck of beating The Wicked North last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' rationale was that he had only one horse to beat at Belmont, Devil His 
Due, and that Kingdom Found would carry nine pounds less than the favorite 
there, compared with only a six-pound break against The Wicked North at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good idea that didn't work," said Jones, back at his barn office at 
Hollywood Park. "We didn't do anything where we went, and we didn't hurt the 
winner here (Slew Of Damascus) by staying away." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' previous trip to Belmont, for the Mother Goose Stakes on June 12, was 
more enjoyable. Lakeway, his talented 3-year-old filly, easily defeated a field 
that included Inside Information, the New York-based filly who had won her two 
Belmont starts by 18 1/2 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks before the Mother Goose, Lakeway went into the Kentucky Oaks 
undefeated, but her four-race streak came to an end when she lost a tight 
finish against Sardula at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 These results, combined with Sardula's easy victory in the Princess Stakes at 
Hollywood on June 18, form the backdrop for another Lakeway-Sardula showdown, 
in Sunday's $200,000 Hollywood Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Indicative of the respect for Lakeway and Sardula, only eight other fillies 
were nominated for the 1 1/8-mile race, and only two -- Fancy 'N Fabulous and 
Sportful Snob -- are expected to run. Lakeway drew the rail, and outside her in 
the gate, in order, will be Sardula, Fancy 'N Fabulous and Sportful Snob. All 
will carry 121 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It says something for the owners of these two fillies that they're not 
ducking one another," Jones said. "They should put on a good show. It's the 
kind of a race where you want to see the best horse win." 
</P>
<P>
 Lakeway, having won the Las Virgenes and Santa Anita Oaks in California, was 
sent to Churchill Downs early, so she could train over the track and Jones and 
her owner-breeder, Mike Rutherford, could determine whether to run her in the 
Kentucky Oaks on May 6 or against colts in the Kentucky Derby on May 7. 
</P>
<P>
 But after a mile workout on April 28, something wasn't right about Lakeway, 
and Jones couldn't get to the bottom of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd gallop her, and she'd be perfect," the trainer said. "Then we'd jog her 
and she'd be lame." 
</P>
<P>
 Valuable training time was lost. By race week, Jones wasn't able to get 
another workout for his filly. A protective rubber boot caused a hoof 
infection, similar to what bothered Soul Of The Matter as he prepared for the 
Kentucky Derby this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days before the Kentucky Oaks, Jones decided to send Lakeway to a clinic 
at Lexington, Ky., 70 miles away, for a full checkup. The filly had to be 
tranquilized for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pouring rain, all the way over to Lexington," Jones said. "In the 
clinic, she was surrounded by all these horses that were coughing, and I was 
afraid that she might catch something. The X-rays came out fine, they didn't 
find anything. But I was still going into a race without the preparations that 
you'd like to have. I didn't have her as right as I would have liked." 
</P>
<P>
 Sardula, who usually sprints to the lead, dropped back in the Oaks, as jockey 
Eddie Delahoussaye let some other speedy fillies set the pace. On the far turn, 
there were three horses ahead of Sardula, who was getting dirt kicked in her 
face for the first time, and Kent Desormeaux was outside Delahoussaye's filly, 
preventing her from going around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't blame Kent for the way he rode the race," Jones said. "He had Sardula 
right up on the rear ends of those other horses. But when Kent went on with 
Lakeway, the horses ahead of Sardula opened up, and she was able to get 
through. Maybe we would have got beat anyway, because Sardula is a racehorse 
son of a gun, and Brian (Mayberry) did a heck of a training job with her. He 
got her ready for a tough mile and an eighth off of just one sprint race at 
Santa Anita." 
</P>
<P>
 Lakeway got ready for the Hollywood Oaks by working five furlongs in 58 4/5 on 
Tuesday. That was the fastest of 34 horses working that distance at Hollywood 
that day, with the next fastest time 59 2/5. For Jones, Lakeway's work may have 
been too fast. But, looking back to Kentucky, it was better than no work at 
all. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Delahoussaye has won three of the last five runnings of the Hollywood 
Oaks, with Hollywood Wildcat last year, Fowda in 1991 and Gorgeous in 1989. 
Kent Desormeaux won the stake with Pacific Squall in 1992. . . . Alex Solis, 
the leading rider at the Hollywood Park meeting, will ride Fancy 'N Fabulous, 
and Pat Valenzuela has the assignment on Sportful Snob. . . . Fancy 'N Fabulous 
was second, 5 1/2 lengths behind Sardula, in the Princess, and ran second, 
three lengths behind Lakeway, in the Las Virgenes. . . . Sportful Snob was 9-1 
when she won the Railbird Stakes by four lengths on June 5.

HUSBAND FACES MURDER CHARGES; CRIME: SPECIAL ALLEGATION COULD MEAN DEATH 
PENALTY FOR MAN WHO CONFESSED TO STABBING WIFE AND MOTHER-IN-LAW, SETTING HOME 
AFIRE.

 A Santa Ana man was charged Friday with murder and arson after allegedly 
confessing to killing his estranged wife and her mother in a jealous rage and 
then setting their Anaheim home on fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuan Ngoc Le, 32, also faces a so-called special circumstance allegation of 
multiple murders, meaning he could face the death penalty if convicted of 
fatally stabbing Loi Thanh Phan, 30, and her mother, Sao Thi Nguyen, 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Le's arraignment in North Orange County Municipal Court was postponed to Aug. 
12. He is being held in the Orange County Men's Jail without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Le's court-appointed attorney could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to relatives, Le had a history of abusing his estranged wife and had 
repeatedly threatened to kill her in the past. He told Orange County Sheriff's 
deputies he killed the women after learning that his wife was car-pooling to 
work with another man, said Sgt. Randy Benicky. 
</P>
<P>
 He told deputies he went to the home Wednesday morning to confront her and 
then used a knife to attack her, Benicky said. 
</P>
<P>
 But relatives question whether Le had planned the attack. They say Le knew 
that the man who was taking Phan to work was a relative and had no reason to be 
jealous. They also say Le's pride was hurt when Phan had found a good-paying 
job with an Anaheim electronics firm, while he had to borrow money to make his 
rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had recently emigrated from Vietnam with their 4-year-old daughter. 
They were experiencing marital problems, but were together over the July 4th 
holiday weekend and were discussing getting back together shortly before the 
slayings took place, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor who ran to the house when he saw smoke billowing out a window said 
he found Le washing his hands and a knife in the kitchen. The bodies were found 
in the living room, where Le allegedly set afire the carpet and a lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
 Phan's eldest sister, Lien Thi Phan, 46, suffered smoke inhalation and burns 
to her feet during the ordeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Clyde P. Von Der Ahe said prosecutors will determine 
whether to seek the death penalty against Le.

STUNG BY PELLETS, CYCLIST GIVES CHASE; SHOOTING: LAKE FOREST MAN CATCHES UP AND 
THEN STRUGGLES WITH ATTACKER IN CAR, ENDURING FOUR MORE BLASTS AT CLOSE RANGE.

 Bicyclist Dan Barberich didn't think twice when someone in a passing car shot 
him with a pellet gun Friday morning. He pedaled after the car -- and got hit 
four more times while struggling with the shooter. 
</P>
<P>
 Barberich, who was riding to his job installing pool fences, suffered six ugly 
welts to his side. But the incident, he said, left his prized mountain bike -- 
his only means of transportation -- crumpled under the car and his sense of 
justice ruffled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little angry just how stupid people can be," said the 21-year-old Lake 
Forest resident. "It didn't make any sense to me that they did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Barberich, who was wearing a T-shirt and shorts, felt the first two shots 
fired from a passing Subaru as he pedaled along Ridge Route Drive just before 8 
a.m. He said he recognized the sting from having been shot while playing with 
pellet guns as a youngster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like a pellet gun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barberich, who is 6 feet tall and weighs 270 pounds, said he raced after the 
car -- loaded with five men in their late teens or early 20s -- and caught up 
as it stopped at a traffic light a block away. He tossed his mountain bike in 
front of the car to block it and began struggling with a man in the passenger 
seat through the open car window. The man shot Barberich four more times in the 
side. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapon was described as a six-inch-long pellet handgun. Pellet guns use 
pressurized air to fire rounded chunks of lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The bicycle was lodged under the car as it pulled away and was destroyed. But 
as the driver stopped and pulled over to free the wreckage, a passerby offered 
Barberich a ride and followed the assailants long enough to get their 
license-plate number. 
</P>
<P>
 Barberich's mother was relieved her son's injuries were minor but was not 
surprised he gave chase. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just a working kid who tries to go out and make a living, and jerks like 
this pull something. . . . It would have made him angry," said Debbie 
Maitrejean. "He's like me." 
</P>
<P>
 The bike isn't exactly blessed. Barberich had to repair the bike after he 
crashed into a parked car four months ago, cutting his hand and smashing a tail 
light on the car, Maitrejean said. "It's just one thing after another," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies were seeking the mustard-colored Subaru, which is 
registered in Elsinore in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just lucky this is a pellet gun instead of a real one or we'd have a 
real mess here," Sheriff's Lt. William Francis said. "We don't recommend doing 
what he did."

BOARD EXPECTED TO OK SPECIAL JAIL CELLS FOR TB; PREVENTION: THE $30,800 PROJECT 
WOULD ALLOW THE ISOLATION OF INMATES TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF TUBERCULOSIS IN 
JAILS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors is expected to approve funding Tuesday to 
modify six jail cells to isolate inmates who have contracted or are suspected 
of contracting tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to cost $30,800 and involves renovating four cells in 
the county Intake/Release Center and two units at the Women's Jail in a move to 
prevent the spread of the highly contagious disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote on the project funding Tuesday. 
None of the supervisors has voiced opposition to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hugh F. Stallworth, the county's health officer, has said the precautions 
at the jails are being proposed because of the disease's rapid growth in Orange 
County and concern over the overcrowded nature of local jail facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of close living conditions and health problems brought into the jail 
system, inmates are generally considered to be at higher risk of contracting 
some diseases, including tuberculosis, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three cases of TB have been diagnosed in the jail population so far 
this year, compared to a total of six recorded last year. In those cases, 
inmates had to be transported to Western Medical Center-Anaheim, where they 
were quarantined and provided medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The new cells, officials said, would allow inmates to be isolated much faster, 
provide for more treatment and eliminate some transportation to and from the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates assigned to the modified units, to be outfitted with special 
ventilation systems that would circulate contaminated air directly outside, 
would typically spend two to three weeks in the units while undergoing 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 While not a serious problem at the jail, the disease has raised concerns in 
the past two years at La Quinta High School in Westminster, where more than a 
dozen students have been treated for active TB. 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials recently prescribed treatment for 79 students whose 
skin tests revealed that they harbored bacteria which could trigger the disease 
at a later time. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis is a bacterial disease that is spread by airborne droplets from 
coughing or sneezing. Generally, the disease is spread by prolonged contact 
with an infected person. Symptoms of the disease are coughing, fever, night 
sweats, weight loss and the coughing of blood.

FAITHFUL GATHER IN ANAHEIM FOR HARVEST FESTIVAL; CRUSADE: ABOUT 30,000 
WORSHIPERS ENJOY INSPIRATIONAL SERMONS AND GOSPEL HYMNS IN FIRST NIGHT OF 
EVANGELICAL EVENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Thousands of the faithful crowded Anaheim Stadium Friday for the fifth annual 
Orange County Harvest Festival, one of the largest evangelical crusade efforts 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the event, involving 450 area churches, predicted 150,000 people 
would hear Riverside minister Greg Laurie and entertainers including country 
music star Ricky Skaggs during the three-night crusade. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival was held at the Pacific Amphitheatre its first year, in 1990, and 
has been at the Anaheim Stadium every year since. Each year, the festival's 
distinctive multicolored bumper stickers have become ubiquitous. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd Friday night, estimated by the sponsors at 30,000, filled the seats 
along three decks of the base lines, leaving the outfield stands empty, as at 
most Angels games. 
</P>
<P>
 Interpreters for the deaf stood atop the third base dugout, leading small 
groups of signing worshipers during the 90-minute program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harvest Festival's aim is to offer worship in a "non-traditional, 
non-church environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Graley, 36, of Alta Loma was attending the crusade for the second year 
with his wife and three children. Graley said he planned to attend all three 
nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the atmosphere; God is promoted here. I like the family values and the 
worship. It brings a good moral value not only to people my age but to the 
kids," he said with his arm around a son. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, "I need this as much as they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Rhodes, 49, of Newport Beach, said she had changed her work shift to 
attend the crusade for the first time. She also brought eight friends, some 
from work. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhodes said she enjoyed the atmosphere of the crusade, and "I like the songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Quinlan, 36, of Riverside said he had joined Laurie's regular 
congregation years ago because "I like his sermons." Now, at his third Orange 
County crusade, he was helping with the event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're bringing them in, so they can know the Lord," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie, 41, spoke after a dozen pounding, bouncing gospel hymns were performed 
by various artists -- with crowd members singing along as lyrics flashed on the 
stadium's scoreboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie recalled his dissolute youth as a student at Newport Harbor High School 
in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always had a problem with authority figures, always lipping off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie said his life was changed through the intervention of the Rev. Chuck 
Smith of Calvary Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 He warned that young people today face an epidemic of crime and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marijuana and LSD are making a comeback," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Young people, he said, "are empty. They're searching . . . they're spiritually 
empty." 
</P>
<P>
 Crusade officials said the money to put on the harvest festival, about 
$100,000, comes from nightly donations, local churches and T-shirt royalties.

FAIR'S OPENING FARES WELL; MORE THAN 24,000 VISITORS HAVE A HEYDAY AT 
WESTERN-THEMED EVENT

 The Footsie Wootsie is Rick and Kathy Byers' best friend this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach couple visits the coin-operated foot massage machines every 
hour to allay sore feet during 12-hour days at the Orange County Fair, which 
they have not missed for 15 years. In fact, they had their first date here. 
</P>
<P>
 So on Friday, the Byers observed their tradition by joining more than 24,000 
people at the opening day of the 102nd fair. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with this year's Western theme, "Saddle Up for Fun," cloggers and a 
horseback rider dressed as Darth Vader entertained outside the gates as the 
crowds arrived. The Byers arrived before the gates opened at 10 a.m. The real 
estate agents have skipped work every year around this time to devote entire 
afternoons and evenings to tasting various wines, playing games and often 
spending up to $200 a day on food, tickets and mementos. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most essential part of their visit has remained the same price for 11 
years; 25 cents still buys a one-minute foot massage at Footsie Wootsies 
strategically placed throughout the fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "People at work think we're crazy," said Kathy Byers, who worked as a cotton 
candy vendor here 15 years ago while in college. "But we look forward to the 
fair every year." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple began their trek through a mock Western street that included booths 
for gold panning, a blacksmith and a saddlery. 
</P>
<P>
 Lines for most rides were sparse late Friday morning, but a small crowd 
gathered near the Ejection Seat, a catapult that towered above onlookers. For 
$40 per ride, fair-goers were hurled into the air in a two-seat vehicle, which 
then bounced them up and down for three minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 William and Juanita Arnwine, a retired couple from Fullerton, were here for 
tamer stuff. "The weather was cool and we were tired of hearing about the O.J. 
story, so we decided to come," Juanita Arnwine said. 
</P>
<P>
 They usually visit the pavilions displaying cake decorations, quilts and 
"engineering gadgets," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 William Arnwine said he was simply enjoying the horses and the hay.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a country boy raised in Oklahoma. It kinda takes me back." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 668,096 attended the fair, which was a decrease of 17,144 from the 
1992 record of 685,241. Attendance for the opening day in 1993 was 32,427. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-day fair continues through July 24 and will include a cattle drive on 
Fairview Road Friday and a Mexican fiesta on the last day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Byers planned to watch the Pointer Sisters perform at the Pacific 
Amphitheatre Friday night. And then maybe they would go home. 
</P>
<P>
 As Rick Byers eased his feet onto a foot massager for the second time in 90 
minutes, he considered, "Maybe we'll use the (Footsie Wootsies) every half 
hour."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; REDESIGN PLANS FOR JUNIOR HIGH SHOWN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Architects unveiled the proposed $1.7-million redesign of the Buena Park 
Junior High School to the Buena Park School District Board of Governors this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The governors will vote on the plan, which includes a brick-and-concrete 
amphitheater and a semicircular multipurpose room, during their regular meeting 
at 7:30 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new construction is the last major project of the district's master plan, 
developed in 1984 when two junior high schools were consolidated.  
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Jack Townsend said the school's redesign will complete the 10-year 
improvement program. 
</P>
<P>
 The governors had some minor concerns but were generally happy with the 
design. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like what we asked for and what we've worked for the past year," 
Board President Lloyd Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school has about 960 students, Townsend said. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; LIBRARY REOPENS AFTER REFURBISHING

<P>
 Walking past the branch library this week, a dark-haired woman stopped 
abruptly on the sidewalk and stared at the library's front doors. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in three months, they were flung wide for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're open!" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the afternoon Thursday, residents wandered in and out of the 
freshly refurbished building at Park Avenue and Glenneyre Street, flipping 
through magazines, checking out books and letting library workers know they are 
happy to have them back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten a lot of compliments, everyone seems to like the changes," 
manager Dolores Madrigal said between greetings. "We've seen so many of our 
very loyal patrons. It's just fun seeing them again." 
</P>
<P>
 The library, the only one in the city, closed April 14 to allow the 
22-year-old building to undergo a $500,000 face-lift. The new building is 
almost 800 square feet larger than before. 
</P>
<P>
 While it looks much the same, the building has better lighting, a new alcove 
for fiction and an expanded local history collection.  
</P>
<P>
 Within hours of the building's reopening, Jay Stallings was perched before one 
of the computer terminals doing research on Southeast Asia. Stallings said he 
visits libraries as often as four times a week and has sorely missed his local 
branch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach library is open from noon to 8 p.m. Tuesday and Wednesday, 
noon to 6 p.m. Thursday and 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturday. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; COUNCIL, PANEL BLASTS UTILITY-TAX PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Councilman Chris Norby tried this week to get the city's controversial 2% 
utility tax on the Nov. 8 ballot but failed when he received no support from 
his colleagues on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Even members of the Fullerton Recalls Committee, who had asked to get the 
year-old tax on the ballot last year, were against Norby's proposal.Committee 
members said Norby's proposal simply was too late. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee last month led a successful recall campaign against Mayor A. B. 
(Buck) Catlin and Council members Molly McClanahan and Don Bankhead because 
they previously voted for the utility tax. Hundreds of residents opposed the 
tax last year and said that if they would have had a chance to vote on it then, 
or during the June 7 recall election, there would have been no recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, it's like double jeopardy," said Bruce Whitaker, Recalls Committee 
treasurer. "The voters spoke on June 7. They voted 'yes' on recall because of 
their opposition to the utility tax. . . . Rather than scheduling an 
unnecessary vote on the utility tax, this City Council should eliminate" it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankhead blasted Norby and said his "suggestion to put the utility tax on the 
November ballot is terribly misguided." 
</P>
<P>
 "For you to suggest that we muddy up the water with a smoke-screen vote on the 
utility tax is irresponsible and is obviously only done for you to gain some 
notoriety for some other selfish motive," Bankhead told Norby at Tuesday's 
council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Norby said he just wanted to give residents a chance to vote on the tax and 
didn't expect so much opposition to his proposal.MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; OIL-SPILL ACCIDENT PLAINTIFFS ARE SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local residents who suffered economic damage resulting from the 1990 
Huntington Beach oil spill are being asked to join a class-action suit filed 
against the owners of the oil and the vessel that carried it, as well as 
various other companies involved in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our belief that there are in excess of 1,000 people who were 
economically damaged by the spill," said Gretchen Nelson, one of the attorneys 
who filed the suit four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles federal court certified the action in May, Nelson said, and 
notices were recently published in local newspapers seeking individuals who 
were damaged by the Feb. 7, 1990, spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Those most likely to have been affected, Nelson said, include commercial and 
sportfishing boat owners, tour boat operators and owners of certain other types 
of businesses in Newport Beach and Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Defendants named in the suit include American Trading Transportation Co. Inc., 
owner of the tanker from which the oil leaked; BP America Inc.; and BP Oil 
Supply Co.DAVID HALDANE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; YOUTHS TO SADDLE UP FOR JUNIOR RODEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rodeo isn't just a sport for men and women decked out in 10-gallon hats and 
boots.  
</P>
<P>
 Boys and girls in the Junior Rodeo Assn. of California start learning how to 
rope goats and calves and race horses around barrels at the age of 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 130 cowboys- and cowgirls-in-training will show off their rodeo prowess 
today in the first Junior Rodeo ever held at the Ortega Equestrian Center.  
</P>
<P>
 The rodeo, which is the association's sixth Junior Rodeo this year, will begin 
at 9 a.m. at the center, 27252 Calle Arroyo. Admission is free. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths, who are between the ages of 4 and 18, will compete in 21 events, 
ranging from steer and calf riding to barrel racing and team calf roping. 
</P>
<P>
 Association secretary Barbara Chaffee, whose 14-year-old son has competed in 
the Junior Rodeo for four years, said rodeo teaches sportsmanship, how to care 
for animals and perseverance. 
</P>
<P>
 "In rodeo team events, the kids learn that, even if you're having a bad day, 
you have to be there for your partner," Chaffee said.LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; CHILDREN ENRAPTURED BY WILDLIFE SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 100 children, parents and nurses gathered outside Children's Hospital of 
Orange County Friday morning to get a close-up view of some tamed wild animals 
introduced by Peter Gros, co-host of "Mutual of Omaha's Wild Kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
 Gros, who also directs the Wildlife Heritage Trust of Omaha, said he considers 
children to be the hope of the future for wildlife preservation. "It's a bit 
harder to teach older people about conservation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gros and his assistants carried or led a range of animals to show the kids, 
most of whom seemed to fall in love with a sharp-nosed, highly-flexible, 
black-footed ferret. The animal can maneuver around narrow tunnels underground 
to ferret out other animals and rodents, Gros explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the ferret because he wiggled around," said Ashley Alcantar, 5, from 
Anaheim, who was wiggling quite a bit herself while watching the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashley was too scared to appreciate the nine-foot python that wrapped most of 
its huge body around Gros's arm while the children watched. "Maybe we should 
call this one Caesar Squeezer," Gros suggested. The kids were also treated to a 
view of a recent layer of Caesar's skin, which he apparently slid out of a 
couple of days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Snakes, like ferrets, also are a tremendous benefit to the balance of nature, 
since they feast largely on rodents. 
</P>
<P>
 Holly Delrosso, a 10-year-old patient from Anaheim, loves snakes precisely for 
their slippery reputation. "I like them because they're slimy and they're 
slithery," she said with a wide grin. 
</P>
<P>
 Another crowd pleaser was a 2-month-old llama, which fortunately did not use 
its long neck to spit on any observers. If pushed, this relative of the camel 
could have targeted that spit up to 25 feet away. "It burns," Gros said. "I 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 Patient J. R. Riggs, 15, of Huntington Beach, was unperturbed by this threat 
and was captivated by the animal's thick woolly coat. "It's just the fur," he 
explained. "He's very furry. It was cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Gros and co-host Jim Fowler travel worldwide to make videos to distribute to 
schools, senior citizen centers "and anyone who teaches at a grass-roots level 
about conservation," Gros said. LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; RESERVOIR WORK STIRS DUST, NEIGHBORS' IRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents who live near Lindbergh Park don't need to be told that change is 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
 They know it every time they step out of their homes to a fresh layer of dust, 
which settles every few days as workers complete construction of an 
18-million-gallon reservoir next to the Orange Street park. 
</P>
<P>
 The reservoir project will increase the size of the park, providing residents 
with a large grassy field. The city also plans to make $40,000 worth of 
improvements at the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Most residents support the park expansion. They said it will provide needed 
recreational space in a district with few small neighborhood parks. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have expressed concerns about the noise and dust generated by the 
reservoir construction. Residents are also demanding a say in how the city will 
spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to avoid spending a lot of money on (design) studies," resident 
Michael Dunlevie said. "We want the money spent on the park." 
</P>
<P>
 The underground reservoir is being built by the Mesa Consolidated Water 
District on about six acres of land on the old Lindbergh school site. The 
reservoir will be topped by a cement cover. The grassy field will be installed 
above the cover and will probably serve as a soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of the field will increase the size of the park, which now 
consists of a small playground and some benches on about a half-acre plot of 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents complained about the park's condition at a public meeting last week. 
They said that some of the wood benches had decayed and that the swing set 
squeaked. 
</P>
<P>
 The city responded to the residents' concerns by removing a bench, replacing 
one picnic table and greasing and oiling the swings, said Keith Van Holt, Costa 
Mesa's director of community services. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently allocated $40,000 to make various improvements to 
Lindbergh Park. Public meetings will be held later this year to decide how 
precisely to spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Dunlevie and other residents are eagerly awaiting completion of the 
reservoir in May, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents sued the water district in 1991, contending the reservoir project 
would disrupt the neighborhood. In settling the case, the district agreed to a 
variety of mitigating factors, including limiting hours of construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlevie said that he can see two large construction cranes from his back yard 
and that his patio furniture becomes covered with a layer of dust every few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll definitely be glad when this is over," he said.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; RELOCATION REQUIRES TRUSTEE RESIGNATION

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Morgan, a member of the Westminster School District Board of Trustees, has 
announced his intention to resign effective July 31. 
</P>
<P>
 At the board's regular meeting Thursday, Morgan, 41, tearfully praised the 
district as a superb educational environment but said that his family's planned 
move out of the district next week required that he give up his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just need a bigger home. We have five kids and they need a place to spread 
out," Morgan said of his move to Villa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, who has served on the board for five years, said that unless escrow 
problems complicate the move, he will turn in his resignation letter within the 
next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking during his last meeting as a trustee, Morgan repeatedly praised the 
district for its employees' commitment to children, its parents' involvement 
and the board's willingness to make tough decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been an absolute honor, a great delight" to serve on the board, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was originally appointed to the board in 1989 and was elected to office 
the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 Because fewer than four months remain until the next election, the board is 
not required to fill the vacancy and does not plan to do so, district 
spokeswoman Audrey Brown said. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; ATHLETE TRAINS TO RUN FOR LEUKEMIA SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six days a week, Paul Pancoe jogs, swims and rides a bike to prepare for the 
upcoming San Francisco marathon. But he doesn't do it for fun. 
</P>
<P>
 He does it to help save the lives of many people he has never met. 
</P>
<P>
 Pancoe, 38, is training for his first marathon in 10 years, in an effort to 
raise money for the Leukemia Society of America and help find a cure for the 
deadly disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be an athlete and I looked at this as a way to help people. It's a 
good deed and it needs to be done," said Pancoe, who has already shed 30 pounds 
while training for the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Through recent fund-raisers, Pancoe and his co-workers at Ingram Micro in 
Santa Ana have helped raise $8,000 on behalf of a Lake Forest girl suffering 
from the disease. Although the money will not go to benefit 9-year-old 
Christine Muratori directly, it will pay for research to help children like 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 The Leukemia Society recently chose Christine as Paul's fund-raising partner 
and the two have become friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a nice, funny, kind man," said Christine, who lives in Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 For her part, Christine is pleased to help raise money to find a cure so that 
other children won't have to go through the years of painful treatment that she 
has endured. 
</P>
<P>
 She encouraged people to donate because "they're not just helping me, they're 
helping other kids that have it or they don't know that they have it. This is 
so there could be a cure for more cancers." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she says, her own prognosis is good: "All the cancer is gone and 
we're hoping that it will stay gone and not come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Pancoe, who lives in Irvine, is one of 10 people countywide who will run in 
the July 31 marathon to raise money for the Leukemia Society. Each runner is 
paired with a fund-raising partner who has the disease, spokeswoman Denice 
Lanuti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pancoe said that he is trying to raise an additional $7,000 during the 
upcoming race and is seeking donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people so far have just given a couple dollars. We've been stressing 
participation over large donations and it's worked out well for us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone interested in contributing may send checks to: The Leukemia Society of 
America, 1744 W. Katella Ave. 8, Orange, Calif. 92667. JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; SCHOOL TO BE SOLD TO FUND MAINTENANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westminster School District Board of Trustees has approved a plan to sell 
a recently closed school, a vacant portion of an open campus and also lease a 
third campus to generate income for badly needed maintenance projects 
districtwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted on Thursday to sell Virginia K. Boos Elementary School as well 
as a portion of the joint Finley Elementary/Dr. Russell I. Johnson Middle 
School. Also, the board agreed to lease James Franklin Elementary School to 
help pay for $31 million worth of renovation projects at schools throughout the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decision followed recommendations made last month by the 
district's Property Advisory Committee, a seven-member group comprised of 
parents, staff and community members. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee made its recommendations based on enrollment estimates that 
predicted modest growth for the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people attended the public hearing to urge the board not to sell the 
properties and to find an alternative for raising the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Ron Morgan said the district had exhausted every other avenue for 
raising funds. He said that voters have rejected bonds and assessment districts 
and state officials have choked off the flow of revenue to schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have done our homework. We have $31 million of facility needs that we 
could spend tomorrow just to get our schools up to snuff. We're not getting the 
money from the state and we're not getting it from the taxpayers. The only way 
we can get it is through our facilities," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, Boos will be sold to developers for the construction of 
single-family homes, but only if developers agree to reserve a portion of the 
site as a park for the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the vacant lot next to the Finley/Johnson campus will be sold only if 
developers work with residents and the local Little League sports program to 
ensure community access to the campus' athletic fields, she said. JON NALICK

GRADE-CHANGE AUDIT TO DECIDE IF A BROADER INVESTIGATION IS NEEDED; EDUCATION: 
REPORT IS DUE JULY 18 ON THE UNAUTHORIZED ALTERING OF STUDENT TRANSCRIPTS AT 
BREA OLINDA HIGH SCHOOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An auditor Friday began looking into past grade-changing practices at Brea 
Olinda High School to determine if a broader investigation is warranted, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel Alcorn, a registrar at Sunny Hills High School in Fullerton, was hired 
by the Brea Olinda Unified School District Board of Education on Thursday to 
audit the high school's computerized transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have said that former guidance counselors unlawfully 
changed more than 360 letter grades of students from the 1992-93 school year to 
simple "pass" notations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the grade changes, some course titles were changed, allowing 
students to take the same course twice and earn double credit, district 
officials said. The changes boosted grade-point averages and increased chances 
for graduation and entrance to colleges and universities, they acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcorn is scheduled on July 18 to inform the board of her findings and 
recommend whether a broader investigation is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcorn said she spent her first day checking the computer files and figuring 
out where student transcripts are stored. 
</P>
<P>
 She has worked as Sunny Hills' registrar for the past eight years and 
constantly deals with student grades and transcripts there, she said. Although 
she is from the Fullerton Joint Union High School District, she said she is 
familiar with Brea Olinda High's computer system. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to hiring Alcorn, the Board of Education on Thursday night decided 
to use the Orange County Department of Education's legal counsel to help 
determine what past procedures led to the grade changing and what policies 
should be developed to prevent a recurrence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is anxious to get on with the (investigation) and not have it drag 
out," Trustee Leonard MacKain said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they hope the investigation will be completed by 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members said once they know who changed the grades and why, they 
will determine whether to consider disciplinary action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm reserving any opinion I might formulate with respect to disciplinary 
action until this investigation is final," Trustee Todd A. Spitzer said. "But 
I'm pleased that we're handling this issue in a very appropriate way." 
</P>
<P>
 District administrators said last month that they did not plan any 
disciplinary action because they believed the grade switching was done only to 
help students -- not to intentionally deceive. They also hired an auditor last 
month without informing the school board. That auditor later refused to take 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Edgar Z. Seal conceded he knew about the grade changing since February 
but did not tell the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea Olinda's principal, John Johnson, ordered the switched grades restored 
when he learned of the situation last October. But the school board did not 
become aware of the matter until May when the Brea Olinda Teachers Assn. filed 
a grievance, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After much dissension on the appropriate way to handle the serious nature of 
this investigation, I'm glad that the administration is now keeping the board 
apprised of everything as it develops," Spitzer said. In turn, the board will 
keep the public informed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter describing "grading irregularities" and providing information on the 
school board's most recent action to correct the matter is being mailed to 
parents and district staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board's goal is to keep the parents informed as to what the nature of the 
problem is and what's being done about it," MacKain said.

FIRE DEPARTMENT TO BURN VACANT HOMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fire Department will conduct several controlled burns of vacant houses 
along Bristol Street, north of Edinger Avenue, Monday11 through Friday, a 
department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters will burn the houses as part of a study with the National 
Institute of Standards and Technology to determine how overcrowded living 
conditions affect the spread of fire in a home. Technicians for the institute 
will provide specialized data recording equipment to monitor the blaze, Deputy 
Fire Chief Wayne Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first burn may be done as early as Monday afternoon, depending on how 
quickly the measuring equipment is installed. All the burns will be done along 
the 1300 block of South Bristol, he said.

PROSECUTORS BIASED, MORGAN LAWYER SAYS; COURTS: DEFENSE ATTORNEY SAYS HE WILL 
ASK A JUDGE TO APPOINT THE STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE TO TAKE OVER FOR THE 
COUNTY IN THE MURDER CASE AGAINST PAROLED SEX OFFENDER. 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County prosecutors should be removed from the case of a paroled sexual 
offender who faces a possible death sentence if convicted of sexually 
assaulting and murdering a young Huntington Beach woman, a defense attorney 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Steve J. Biskar said he fears local prosecutors -- who 
have come under fire for their handling of Edward Patrick Morgan Jr.'s prior 
sexual offenses -- may try to compensate by seeking the death penalty against 
his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Biskar said he will ask a judge to appoint the state attorney general's office 
to step in and take over the prosecution of Morgan, who has pleaded not guilty 
in the May 20 slaying of Leanora Annette Wong, 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Lewis R. Rosenblum declined to comment on the defense's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong was sexually assaulted before her bloodied body was abandoned in an 
Orange parking lot across the street from the Australian Beach Restaurant & 
Nightclub, where she was seen talking to Morgan. Key evidence in the case will 
involve footage captured by parking lot surveillance cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was arrested four times in the past decade on charges that he sexually 
assaulted young Orange County women. He was convicted of one rape, and allowed 
to plead guilty to lesser charges in two other cases. In the fourth case, 
Morgan was sent back to prison for one year on a parole violation when 
authorities declined to prosecute him for rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was on parole in May when the attack on Wong occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, however, have defended their actions. They say the victims in 
three of the cases had credibility problems, making it unlikely that the rape 
charges could be successfully prosecuted before a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Biskar said he just wants his client to have a fair chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to have someone who doesn't have any baggage to make that 
decision" on whether to seek death, Biskar said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the killing, Morgan went to Northern California and vowed he would not 
give up without a fight. "Shoot me! Shoot me!" he yelled before he was taken 
into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Orange County Superior Court Judge David O. Carter ordered Morgan's 
shackles removed when he appears before the court in the future. After 
Rosenblum noted Morgan's earlier vow, the judge warned Morgan not to pull any 
fast moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope you're not so foolish, because the deputies will just shoot you," the 
judge said with a slight smile, as Morgan grinned in response and nodded his 
promise to behave.

TUSTIN GIVES ADULT-BUSINESS LAW INITIAL OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council gave preliminary approval this week to an ordinance 
regulating public nudity as a way of discouraging adult-oriented business. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting City Atty. Lois E. Jeffrey said the ordinance "reflects the latest 
thinking of the United States Supreme Court on the issue," and gives the city 
"more effective tools for regulating public nudity than exist in the current 
city code." 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court has held that cities may restrict adult businesses but may 
not outlaw them. Such businesses are considered protected under the First 
Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey said the Tustin ordinance addresses "nude conduct, wherever that might 
be." Anaheim and Mission Viejo have similar laws, she said. Jeffrey 
acknowledged that "if somebody wanted to open up a nude establishment in the 
city, (the ordinance) would cause them to think about whether they wanted to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager William A. Huston said there is a concern that adult-oriented 
businesses will attempt to open in Tustin as they have in other areas of the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The adult-entertainment industry, if you want to call it that, is pretty 
clearly making overtures in cities throughout Orange County," Huston said. 
"Because of that, we want to be in a position where our ordinances are 
up-to-date." 
</P>
<P>
 The attempted openings of adult-oriented businesses often evoke strong 
emotions among city officials and residents. Last month in La Habra, more than 
200 residents gave the Planning Commission a standing ovation when it voted 
unanimously to keep a "bikini bar" out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cypress, the City Council recently extended a moratorium on issuing permits 
for adult-oriented businesses. And in Newport Beach, the city was granted a 
preliminary injunction in March that prevents an adult theater and topless 
dance bar from opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Huston said Tustin has not received any formal proposals to open such 
businesses in the city. "But if it were to occur, and we hope it doesn't, we'll 
be prepared," he said.TUSTIN (CA)

COUNTY REJECTS KIN'S CLAIM IN SCHOOL TB CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county has rejected claims for damages filed by the parents and elder 
sister of Debi French, the teen-ager who underwent surgery to have part of a 
lung removed in her fight against tuberculosis she caught during an outbreak at 
La Quinta High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Bunker, the county claims manager, said their claims were rejected 
because they missed legal deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bunker said the county decided to waive the time limit for Debi French's 
own claim for unspecified damages, because she was a minor within six months of 
filing it. She turned 18 in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has 45 days in which to decide whether to honor that claim. It 
alleges the Orange County Health Care Agency could have halted the spread of TB 
at the Westminster high school and should have taken steps to inform students, 
parents and the community after the outbreak was discovered last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Any claim which the county denies can be appealed through the legal system. 
Richard McCain, the French family's attorney, could not be reached late Friday 
to say whether he would take the rejected claims to court.  
</P>
<P>
 While French was the only one to contract TB, the rest of her family tested 
positive in October for the TB bacteria and were given drugs to reduce the 
possibility that they might become ill in the future.

BREAK LED TO TEENS JAILED IN TOURIST DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A traffic stop in Newport Beach led to the arrest of three teen-agers accused 
of shooting a German tourist to death and wounding her husband, according to 
recently unsealed warrants. 
</P>
<P>
 All three teen-agers have been charged with murder and armed robbery.Accused 
gunman Thongxay Nilakout, 17, was also charged with attempted murder, and the 
two others, Xou Yang and Kamchan (Brett) Ketsouvannasane, both 19, were charged 
with assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury indictments were issued Wednesday and unsealed Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents showed a Newport Beach officer stopped Yang's car a week before 
the murders and noticed a purse and credit cards stolen in an earlier robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 When detectives in Riverside learned of the incident, they tracked down the 
car, which was allegedly used in the robbery, and found the teens painting it, 
an affidavit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they would not ask the death penalty. Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Richard Bentley said life in prison without possibility of parole would be the 
maximum sentence for Nilakout, a minor being tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Nilakout is the accused gunman, the others shouldn't get stiffer 
sentences, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gisela Pfleger was shot to death during a robbery May 16 at a scenic turnout 
in the San Jacinto Mountains near Lake Fulmor. Her husband, Klaus, 62, was shot 
in the face and back. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe Nilakout shot the 64-year-old woman twice in the head 
after she had been knocked to the ground in a struggle for her purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside Superior Court Judge Robert J. McIntyre also ordered the unsealing 
Thursday of search warrants used in the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 All three suspects were scheduled to return to court July 25.

ATTITUDE, LEADERSHIP, VOICE HELP HIM EXCEL; SOCCER: WORLD GAMES GIVE MISSION 
VIEJO HIGH GRADUATE SCOTT ROGERS A CHANCE TO SHOW HIS SKILLS ON THE FIELD -- 
AND AS A SINGER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ROHWER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Scott Rogers watched Monday's World Cup game between Brazil and the United 
States, his feelings of allegiance were tempered by concerns of 
self-preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, 19, will leave at the end of summer to spend two years in Brazil as a 
Mormon missionary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very stuck," Rogers said about watching the game July 4. "I wanted to 
see the U.S. win, but I was actually worried, with what happened to the 
Colombian player." 
</P>
<P>
 That Colombian player -- midfielder Andres Escobar -- was murdered last 
Saturday in his hometown of Medellin in apparent retaliation for knocking the 
ball into his own net June 22 during Colombia's loss to the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers was afraid for his well-being should the U.S. team score another upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very worried that Brazil, if they would lose to the U.S., their fans 
might not like me much when I went down there." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, who says he has always been a fan of Brazilian soccer and especially 
enjoys watching their playmaking, will be staying in Porto Alegre, about 900 
miles south of Rio de Janeiro. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect to pick up some soccer tips here and there," Rogers said. "I hope to 
bring back some of their culture, their way of life . . . and a little more 
knowledge of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, who graduated from Mission Viejo High in 1993, already is pretty 
knowledgeable about the sport, having played since he was 6. He has two 
brothers and two sisters who also play. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, a brother, Mike, 17, is his teammate on the Mission Viejo Vikings, 
one of the American Youth Soccer Organization teams participating in the 
inaugural World Games this week in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Games, featuring 3,200 players between the ages of 8 and 19, began 
Tuesday night with opening ceremonies at Trabuco Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers was asked to sing the national anthem in front of more than 6,000 
players, coaches, parents and fans in the school's football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 He said being so honored didn't come as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started singing in talent shows when I was 5 years old," said Rogers, who 
had no formal voice lessons until he reached high school. "I made the highest 
choir there is at high school, then I started taking professional lessons. I've 
been taking lessons about three years now. My teacher tells me I have a natural 
ability to sing." 
</P>
<P>
 He also is a natural on the soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers chose not to play soccer while attending Saddleback College on a 
part-time basis this past school year. Instead, he worked full-time in Laguna 
Niguel with a contract agency for the Immigration and Naturalization Service 
and continued with his AYSO team. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Irvine, coach of the Vikings, has high praise for his team captain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scott is a very dependable young man and a pleasure to coach," Irvine said. 
"He treats the responsibility of being team captain as he does playing soccer 
-- very aggressively and completely. He helps players with morale problems and 
is good with the younger kids up to the older kids with their different 
personalities. He's a very good intermediary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scott is a very enjoyable kid to have around and working with you, not for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what sets him apart from his peers, Rogers downplays his soccer 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the best, skill-wise. (Mike) has me beat in skill," Rogers said. "I 
think it would be my attitude. I'm not a real negative player. I'll get upset, 
and I'll get mad, but I don't usually vent frustration. I've learned leadership 
abilities as far as keeping people cool on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been one of the higher-ranked (skill) players, but not No. 1. I 
can play anywhere on the field, including goalie. It's just my dribbling skills 
aren't what they should be. But I keep a good attitude on the field, and that 
helps me play better." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers' skills and leadership are currently being put to the test in the World 
Games, which feature teams from throughout Southern California, Arizona, Utah, 
New Mexico and Hawaii, as well as teams from Germany, Denmark and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition began Thursday and will continue through the division 
championships today and Sunday at sites throughout Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really excited to play," Rogers said of the games. "I can't predict who's 
going to do real well . . . I would expect Germany to do well, but then I would 
be stereotyping. It's all pretty exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 World Games are being played simultaneously in Honolulu, Kalamazoo, Mich., and 
Sunnyvale, Calif., during the break between the World Cup's Round of 16 that 
ended Tuesday and the quarterfinals beginning Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers is happy about the exposure his favorite sport is receiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "For someone like me, who's been playing for 13 years, it's like, 'The World 
Cup is coming to the U.S.A. . . .' Good, maybe people will wake up. It's really 
exciting to see people getting excited about soccer."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; LEFFERTS 'WASN'T GETTING THE JOB DONE'

 The Angels released left-hander Craig Lefferts and activated relief pitcher 
Scott Lewis from the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Craig just wasn't getting the job done," Manager Marcel Lachemann said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lefferts struggled after Lachemann became manager, posting an 8.27 earned-run 
average in 16 appearances. Under Buck Rodgers, Lefferts had a 1.47 ERA in 15 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels had been trying to trade Lefferts but his contract got in the way. 
He earns a base salary of $400,000 and already has been paid $150,000 in 
incentives this year. He was scheduled to earn $75,000 in incentives for his 
35th and 40th appearances, and then start earning $100,000 for every five 
games.

 Pitching coach Chuck Hernandez rejoined the team after the birth of his son, 
Cody Chase (7 pounds 14 ounces). Cody was in intensive care after delivery but 
Hernandez reports that the baby is home and doing fine, as is Donna Hernandez, 
wife and mother. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Designated hitter Chili Davis says he doesn't really care if he gets an at-bat 
in the All-Star game Tuesday, but. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm in it, I'm going deep." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was bypassed for the home-run hitting contest in favor of Albert Belle, 
Ken Griffey Jr., Ruben Sierra and Frank Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 But to hear him tell it, nothing could happen at the All-Star game that could 
surpass his thrill Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, I got to meet Mickey Mantle today," he said. "Can you believe it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Reliever John Dopson, put on the disabled list June 24, will not have to 
undergo surgery on the bone spur in his right shoulder. He still is unable to 
even play catch, however, and the Angels don't expect him to go on a 
rehabilitative assignment until possibly August. BOB NIGHTENGALE

PORTLAND BEATS SPLASH IN REMATCH; SOCCER: ANAHEIM, WHICH HAD DEFEATED THE PRIDE 
MONDAY, LOSES THIS TIME, 6-5. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Splash Coach George Fernandez wanted proof. 
</P>
<P>
 Proof that when his veteran squad blew out three teams before Friday's game 
against Portland, it wasn't a fluke. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash, which twice has lost a rematch against expansion teams, was 
stunned Friday by the Pride, 6-5, in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash (7-3) had beaten Portland (5-6), 8-2, Monday. But it failed to 
prove that game wasn't a fluke in front of 4,153 -- the largest crowd since 
opening night's 4,721 -- at The Pond of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We created a lot of chances, we just didn't finish them," defender Denis 
Hamlett said. "We only gave up five goals; that's still pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash has a half-game lead over San Diego in the Western Division and 
plays host to Carolina (1-7) at 7:35 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's performance was reminiscent of the Splash's two losses on its recent 
four-game trip, during which it also blew second-half leads. The Splash lost to 
Houston, 7-5, and San Jose, 13-9, two teams the Splash had beaten by a combined 
score of 22-4.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would like for this team to prove to me that after they blow out a team, 
they can sustain that," Fernandez said before the game. "They have to prove 
they will not take this game lightly." 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash outshot Portland, 42-24, but had nothing to show for it after Steve 
Piercy's goal at 2 minutes 32 seconds into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash, the Continental Indoor Soccer League's second-highest scoring 
team, added two midfielders: Mike Laposha, who had 25 blocks in 38 games with 
the National Professional Soccer League's St. Louis Ambush, and Jaime 
Francisco, 31, who played 10 years of Division 1 and Division 2 soccer in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have so many guys going forward, we didn't have enough playing defense," 
Fernandez said. "We felt we needed someone who was defensive-minded and could 
give us a little bite." 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing worked. The Splash was a half-step slow and let Portland gain 
confidence as the game progressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Portland) stuck to the game plan and got back quickly defensively and 
frustrated us," said Dale Ervine, who had a goal and an assist. "We have no one 
to blame but ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Castro scored in his 10th consecutive game this season and 14th over the 
past two, a league record. 
</P>
<P>
 Raffaele Ruotolo scored twice; the second one gave the Splash a 5-4 lead 1 
minute 40 seconds into the fourth quarter. Armando Valdivia gave the Splash a 
3-1 lead early in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ervine: "There shouldn't be any excuses at this level. This definitely 
should open our eyes that we're maybe not as good as we thought we were when we 
were 6-0." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Adding midfielders Mike Laposha and Jaime Francisco to the roster cut into the 
playing time of Paul Ratcliffe; another midfielder, Sam George (broken foot), 
was placed on injured reserve for the remainder of the season and the team's 
oldest player, midfielder Glen Ervine, 33, was waived earlier in the day. 
Ervine, the brother of starting forward Dale Ervine, was a member of the 1984 
Olympic team.

ORANGE COUNTY GROUP, RAMS SHARE CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders of the Task Forces to Keep the Rams in Orange County got a better idea 
of what it will take to prevent the NFL team from leaving Anaheim during a 
meeting Friday with Ram Executive Vice President John Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams weren't specific in saying that if the county was able put a certain 
package together it would keep them here," said sports agent Leigh Steinberg, 
who is heading the group. "But it basically comes down to a new or refurbished 
stadium, better luxury boxes, better attendance and a new lease." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg and former Disneyland President Jack Lindquist met with Shaw for 
about an hour and a half at the Rams' Los Angeles offices. Shaw termed the 
first meeting "preliminary" but declined to discuss specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force, which has been meeting once a week in Anaheim, has broken up 
into subcommittees to explore different aspects of the situation and hopes to 
have a proposal for the Rams within two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said the proposal would likely include a major renovation of Anaheim 
Stadium, including the luxury suites, or a new stadium at the same site; a 
transformation of the stadium area into an entertainment/shopping district; a 
commitment from the business community to invest in luxury suites and buy 
season tickets, a new lease, and an investment group that would purchase a 
minority interest in the team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are being heavily courted by Baltimore, St. Louis and Hartford, 
Conn., cities offering new stadiums built with public funds and lucrative lease 
terms, and that have sent representatives to Los Angeles to meet with Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Shaw) was open to what we had to say, but the ball's in our court," 
Steinberg said. "Can we in Orange County put a competitive bid together to keep 
the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 "He made it clear that they were moving along in discussions with other 
cities, but I made it clear to him that Orange County was the best place for 
the Rams. I'm optimistic that if we can put the right package together we can 
keep the team here."

U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; ROUNDUP; DUMBLE HUMBLES THE FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A model, the son of a former Olympic champion and a veteran sprinter were 
outperformed by a discus thrower from Panorama City on Friday as Olympic 
Festival track and field competition got underway at a new, $5.5 million 
stadium at Southern Illinois University. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn Dumble, a 22-year-old thrower who starred at UCLA, won the discus with a 
toss of 185 feet 11 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumble's last big victory came more than a year ago when she won the NCAA 
shotput title. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoria Herazo of Valencia, a member of the Screen Actors Guild and a 
professional model, finished fourth in the 10-kilometer walk in a time of 47 
minutes 45 seconds, but was disqualified by race officials afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 In the decathlon, Tom Richards of Thousand Oaks was in fifth place with the 
final five events of the competition scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards, son of Bob Richards, a two-time Olympic champion in the pole vault, 
placed eighth in the 100 meters (11.54), sixth in the long jump (20-11 1/4), 
second in the shot put (43-0), fifth in the high jump (6-4) and fifth in the 
400 meters (51.93). 
</P>
<P>
 Richards, who finished fifth in the decathlon at the NCAA championships 
representing Stephen F. Austin University, has 3,556 points, 551 points behind 
the leader, Matt Shelton of Chattanooga, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing one of the biggest cheers of the night from a crowd of almost 10,000 
was Alice Brown, a former Cal State Northridge All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a three-time Olympian, was making a record ninth appearance in the 
Olympic Festival. Already the owner of a Festival-record seven gold medals in 
track, Brown celebrated her return to the competition by helping earn a medal 
of a different color. 
</P>
<P>
 The West's 400-meter relay team, with Brown running the leadoff leg, won the 
bronze medal in a time of 44.85, a half-second behind the gold-medal winning 
North squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 33, will run in the 100-meter race today, seeking to tie Terri Dendy's 
Festival record of 13 medals. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Olympic Festival action: 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Reux, a fencer from Canoga Park, helped the West team win a silver medal 
in foil. The West dropped a 25-21 decision to the North in the gold-medal bout. 
</P>
<P>
 In volleyball, Jennifer Johnson of Sherman Oaks was second on the South team 
with 15 kills and four blocks, but the North won the bronze-medal match, 15-6, 
15-17, 9-15, 15-3, 15-11 at the Washington University Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Anita Zakharyan of Glendale and partner Ann Alvarez of East Brunswick, N.J., 
won two of three matches to advance to today's semifinal round in table tennis. 
Zakharyan is ranked fourth among U.S. women singles players. 
</P>
<P>
 In the men's competition, Masaru Hashimoto of Pacoima and partner Sean 
Lonergan of Gaithersburg, Md., won one of their three matches and were 
eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 At Busch Stadium, the West, with Bryan LaCour of Chatsworth, Randy Wolf of 
Woodland Hills and Jon Schaeffer of Tarzana on the roster, fell to 0-2 by 
losing to the South, 7-3. Schaeffer, a Stanford-bound Harvard-Westlake High 
graduate, had a double. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first day of sailing, Robbie Dean of Newbury Park was last among 12 
competitors in the Laser event at Lake Carlyle, Ill. Dean had a best finish of 
10th in four races.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW: ERIC REYNOLDS; INJURIES PUT PREMATURE WRAP ON RUNNING 
CAREER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As an account manager for a financial company in Westlake Village, Eric 
Reynolds doesn't fancy himself an author. 
</P>
<P>
 But should he decide to write a book, the topic would be easy: No one is more 
of an expert on high school athletes trying to live up to other people's 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year old Ventura resident was the most-highly recruited high school 
distance runner in the country as a senior at Camarillo High in 1983. He chose 
UCLA, but a multitude of injuries prevented him from ever tapping into his vast 
potential in college. 
</P>
<P>
 Herb Potter, Reynolds' primary coach in high school, attributes his protege's 
injury woes to increased training mileage at UCLA, but Reynolds disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds says his mileage -- approximately 60 miles a week -- changed little 
in college. Rather, numerous factors, ranging from coming back from injuries 
too soon, to running frequently on pavement, to physical characteristics such 
as high arches and tightly strung muscles and Achilles' tendons, made him 
susceptible to leg and foot maladies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did everything I could to try and beat it," Reynolds said. "I took time 
off. I worked out in the pool at UCLA. I did a lot of (cycling). I went through 
who knows how many different kinds of shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to four or five different podiatrists and wore several different pairs 
of (inserts), but nothing worked. (The injuries) were just something that would 
always reoccur." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite undergoing surgeries on his left shin and his right knee, and 
suffering "three or four" stress fractures during his college career, Reynolds 
doesn't blame anyone for his woes. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he has fond memories of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 He points out that there he met his wife, the former Nancy Brown, made a lot 
of friends and received a free education. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most importantly, the injuries helped him become "Eric Reynolds, the 
person, instead of Eric Reynolds, the distance runner." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the phenom label weighed heavily on Reynolds in his senior year at 
Camarillo, he had earned the distinction. 
</P>
<P>
 After running 10 minutes 5 seconds for 3,200 meters as a freshman, he timed a 
superb 9:00.71 to finish ninth in the 1981 State championships as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, he ran poorly in the 1981 Southern Section 4-A Division 
cross-country championships due to an illness, but bounced back to finish sixth 
in the Kinney West regional and third in the Kinney national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 In track, he lowered his personal best to 8:52.92 in the 3,200 to finish 
second in the State championships behind Harold Kuphaldt (8:51.99) of Fair Oaks 
Bella Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 Which set the stage for Reynolds' senior year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Smith, who took over Camarillo's cross-country program in 1982, recalls 
vividly words veteran Simi Valley Coach Jim McCullough said about Reynolds at a 
preseason coaches meeting that year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, you could coach your whole life and never get a kid like that," 
McCullough said wistfully to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim was one of the most respected coaches around so when I heard that, I 
realized just how good Eric must be," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Reynolds exceeded Smith's expectations during an undefeated 
cross-country campaign that was capped with victories in the Southern Section 
4-A Division, Kinney West regional and Kinney national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds' 14-second victory margin in the national championships is the 
third-largest in the 15-year history of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amazing thing about that year is that Eric was never really challenged," 
Smith said. "He could have run faster, but he basically ran every race alone 
after the 1 1/2-mile mark." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he wasn't quite as dominant during the 1983 track season -- Reynolds 
was beaten by Jeff Cannada of Greenway (Ariz.) High in a two-mile in the 
Sunkist Invitational in January -- he posted some superb times. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran 8:54.75 or faster five times in the 3,200, topped by a clocking of 
8:44.0 to place sixth in the open two-mile -- which is 18 meters longer than 
the 3,200 -- in the Pepsi Invitational at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 The time moved Reynolds to fourth on the all-time national high school 
performer list behind Jeff Nelson of Burbank (8:36.3 in 1979), Craig Virgin of 
Lebanon, Ill. (8:40.9 in 1973) and Steve Prefontaine of Marshfield, Ore. 
(8:41.5 in 1969). The effort also underscored his ability to maintain an even 
pace -- he ran 4:22 for each mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eric just did not fatigue the way a normal human being fatigues," Smith said. 
"He had the most unusual physiological makeup I've ever seen. There were 
runners on the team who were faster than Eric over (400 meters), but they 
didn't have the cardiovascular capacity that he did. He was amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds went on to win the State championship in 8:54.75 -- his 9.91 second 
margin of victory remains the largest in meet history -- but he was "totally 
burned out" when he won the 3,000 in the Golden West Invitational a week later. 
He concluded the season with a disappointing third-place time of 9:01.52 in the 
two-mile in the International Prep meet. 
</P>
<P>
 By that time, running had become less enjoyable to Reynolds. He had basically 
trained by himself for the last two years of high school because there was no 
one at Camarillo who could keep up with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was very hard and there was pressure too," he said. "People just weren't 
expecting me to win. They thought I should be breaking some record every time I 
stepped on the track. If I didn't set a (personal record) every race, they 
thought something was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The burned-out feeling was followed by something even more ominous: injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he trained lightly for six weeks after the International Prep meet in 
order to recharge his batteries, he hurt his left shin in August and the injury 
forced him to redshirt his first year at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the most frustrating time to me," he said. "When I went to UCLA, it 
was a completely different environment than what I was used to. I went from 
being someone who everyone on the Camarillo campus knew to nobody knowing who I 
was at UCLA and nobody caring if they knew me. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other athletes on the team were older than me and many of them weren't 
real accepting because they looked at you as someone who might take their 
spot," he said. "So it was just very, very lonely the first couple of 
quarters." 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds underwent surgery on his shin in the summer of 1984, but he never 
went longer than three months after that without an injury interrupting his 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Bob Larsen figured that with Reynolds' talent, he could be a very 
good college runner if he could get his training mileage up to even 50 miles a 
week on a consistent basis. Unfortunately, that never happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very, very frustrating," Larsen said. "Because he wasn't just a good 
athlete, he was an extremely talented athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 After failing to shake injuries for three years, Reynolds appeared healthy in 
the fall of 1987, his senior year. But after being the No. 1 runner on the 
Bruins' cross-country team for the first half of the season, he pulled a 
hamstring and that injury was followed by a stress fracture in his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides my freshman year, that was the only other time I got really 
frustrated," he said. "I was so close to being all the way back." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from UCLA in 1988 with a degree in economics, Reynolds ran 
29:58 in a 10,000-meter road race in Camarillo that summer, but never seriously 
contemplated another comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that in order for me to ever be serious again, I would have to get my 
injuries problems taken care of," he said. "But after five years of trying 
unsuccessfully, I just didn't see that happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, he began work as a real estate agent for a 
Northridge-based firm owned by Syd Leibovitch, a teammate of Reynolds at UCLA 
and a former standout at Chatsworth High. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked there for five years before starting at Hamilton Financial Corp. 
nine months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the job requires him to spend a lot of time on the road in Ventura, 
Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, it has allowed Reynolds and his 
wife to move from Northridge to Ventura, which is closer to his parents in 
Somis. 
</P>
<P>
 Somis, a small agricultural-based community, is where Reynolds lived during 
his glory days at Camarillo High. But he does not dwell on those times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very proud of what I accomplished in high school, but quite honestly, 
what I accomplished in high school has no effect on my life now," Reynolds 
said. "There are a few people in Camarillo who still recognize my name, but 
other than that, I don't talk much about it."

PRO BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; LAKER FOUND STROKE AFTER FINDING HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Had Tim Laker just figured this out last year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Laker, a former Simi Valley High and Oxnard College catcher, hadn't hit higher 
than .242 at any of the five minor league stops at which he had more than 35 
at-bats. But this season he is hitting .311 with five home runs and 32 runs 
batted in at triple-A Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just finally really learning how to hit," said Laker, in his seventh year 
of organized baseball. "I'm getting a better understanding of what I'm doing 
instead of going up to the plate and just swinging." 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of Laker's success is that part of it may be attributed to him not 
being in the major leagues. He has spent the entire season at Ottawa. Last 
year, when he made several trips between Ottawa and the Montreal Expos, he 
spent a lot of time on the bench and hit a combined .221. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think last year he was a victim of circumstances where he kind of bounced 
back and forth between triple A and the bigs," said Kent Qualls, Expos' 
director of minor league operations. "But this year, when it was decided that 
he wasn't making the big league club, we wanted to send him to triple A, where 
he could play consistently. He's playing every day and that helps from a 
hitting standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Laker agrees the stability has helped somewhat, but he'd still rather be in 
the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps getting in a groove in that sense," he said. "But it kind of gets a 
little frustrating. I'm having the best year I've ever had and I'm still here." 
</P>
<P>
 Laker, 24, who will play in the triple-A all-star game on Wednesday in 
Nashville, Tenn., might be having a career year, but so is Darrin Fletcher, the 
Expos' starting catcher. Fletcher, who will play in the All-Star game in 
Pittsburgh, is hitting .289 with 10 home runs and 47 RBIs. And Fletcher's 
backup, Lenny Webster, is batting .302. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't look like I'm going anywhere," Laker said. "(The Expos) are 
winning and both catchers are doing well." 
</P>
<P>
 But if Laker, always considered an excellent defensive catcher, can continue 
his hot hitting, the odds are he'll find his way into the major leagues 
somehow, even if it's not with the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I'm hoping for," he said. "If the opportunity is not here than 
I'll go somewhere else. It doesn't really matter to me where I play, as long as 
it's somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Qualls still believes Laker will make it with the Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim Laker is well-liked in this organization," he said, "and we are sure he's 
going to have a good career with the Montreal Expos." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All-Stars: Besides Laker, five area players have been selected to play in the 
double-A and triple-A all-star games. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver pitcher Andrew Lorraine (Hart High) and outfielder Garret Anderson 
(Kennedy) and New Orleans infielder Jeff Cirillo (Providence) have been named 
to the American League squad. Laker and Buffalo first baseman Rich Aude 
(Chatsworth) will play for the National League team. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Cirillo may not play in the game, having been recalled by the 
Milwaukee Brewers on Friday to replace John Jaha, who was sent to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 The only area player selected to play in the double-A all-star game, to be 
held Monday in Binghamton, N.Y., is El Paso shortstop Mark Loretta (St. 
Francis). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In this corner: West Palm Beach, Fla., relief pitcher David Eggert, a former 
Cal State Northridge standout, was involved in an ugly incident in the Florida 
State League last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In a game between West Palm Beach and Charlotte, a bench-clearing brawl 
erupted after a home-plate collision. Every player in uniform from both teams 
was given a two-day suspension. The suspensions were staggered so the teams 
could continue the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a melee, more or less," Eggert said. "There were a few (punches 
thrown) but a lot of people were just out there trying to break it up, to get 
it under control." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The hook: Stockton catcher Bobby Hughes wondered why he was getting pulled out 
of a game in the second inning Wednesday night, especially after he'd hit a 
home run in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
 But Manager Lamar Johnson then gave him the news that he was going to be 
promoted to double-A El Paso. The Class-A Ports were well ahead in the game and 
Johnson wanted to give Hughes a rest before his journey to Wichita, Kan., where 
El Paso was playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes, who played at Notre Dame High, was leading Stockton with 15 doubles, 
three triples, nine home runs and 47 RBIs. He was hitting .277. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No respect: The Seattle Mariners recalled 18-year-old shortstop Alex 
Rodriguez, the first pick in the 1993 draft, from double-A Jacksonville, Fla., 
on Wednesday so they could move Felix Fermin to second base, filling a 
troubling void. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already tried four second basemen and we've got no one in the minor 
leagues to come up and play," Mariner Manager Lou Piniella told the Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
 But second baseman Torey Lovullo, a former Montclair Prep standout, was 
hitting .315 with eight home runs and 31 RBIs at triple-A Calgary, including a 
recent 17-game stretch during which he hit .391. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Honors: Sarasota, Fla., pitcher Jeff Suppan, a Crespi graduate, was named June 
pitcher of the month in the Boston Red Sox organization. He was 3-1 with a 1.64 
ERA. In 33 1/3 innings Suppan gave up 22 hits and struck out 43, but his month 
ended on an unusual note. 
</P>
<P>
 While running on June 24, Suppan passed out. Team officials held him out of a 
few starts while they kept an eye on him, but they couldn't find anything 
physically wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppan, who has improved to 5-6 with a 3.95 ERA, is scheduled to pitch 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moving up: Second baseman Derek Swafford, a graduate of Ventura High, was 
named June player of the month for Welland, Canada, of the short-season Class-A 
New York-Penn League, earning a promotion to Augusta, Ga., of the Class-A South 
Atlantic League. 
</P>
<P>
 A third-round pick of the Pirates mainly because of his speed, Swafford hit 
.190 at rookie-level Bradenton, Fla., in his first pro season last year. The 
Pirates kept him in extended spring training for more than two months this 
year, but he hit .375 with three triples and eight stolen bases in his first 16 
games at Welland. He reported to Augusta on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chergey update: Dan Chergey, a graduate of Thousand Oaks High, is still 
enjoying his taste of triple A, and he would like to stay for the rest of the 
season, despite his lack of success. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first five appearances at Edmonton, Chergey was 0-1 with an 18.69 
earned-run average. His first effective outing was Tuesday night, when he 
pitched one scoreless inning, retiring the side in order. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm learning how to pitch up here," Chergey said, "while I had been getting 
guys out just with good stuff in Class-A ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Chergey was promoted from Class-A Brevard County, Fla., to Edmonton last month 
as a reward for his success in the Florida State League. Chergey said he has 
been given no indication how much longer he'll be in triple A. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea," he said. "Hopefully for the rest of the year."

U.S. OLYMPIC FESTIVAL; ERASING DOUBT; LACOUR'S CONCERNS OVER FACING 
HARD-THROWING PITCHERS VANISH IN FIRST TWO TIMES AT PLATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bryan LaCour had the look of a hungry ballplayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Disappointed when he wasn't a starter for the West team in its first Olympic 
Festival game earlier this week, the former Chatsworth High shortstop quickly 
produced once he was inserted into the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 LaCour turned two grounders to short into outs and had two hits, including a 
double, in his only plate appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of (angry) I didn't start, so I wanted to show something," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 His ninth-inning double, a line drive down the left-field line, was just one 
of several highlights in a long but memorable day. 
</P>
<P>
 LaCour arrived at Busch Stadium at 4 p.m., three hours before the start of the 
game. His team's pregame routine included a 4:45 batting practice and a long 
series of warm-up drills which the some of the players did not anticipate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're used to showing up an hour before the game and warming up then," LaCour 
said after the West dropped a 4-2 decision to the North. "Shoot, I'm starving. 
I haven't eaten since noon." 
</P>
<P>
 Gobbling up grounders and feasting on a couple of fat pitches didn't resolve 
that appetite. However, it did help settle his stomach in another sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was tight," LaCour said. "Thank God it didn't show. When I made the play on 
that first ground ball, all the nervousness went away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wanted to prove that I could play here. I had my doubts going into the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Doubts? Whoa! LaCour seems like an unusual candidate for an inferiority 
complex. In his senior season at Chatsworth, he batted .481, drove in 41 runs 
and scored 36, stealing 17 bases without being caught. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, but that was high school," LaCour said. "This here is the real world. 
All these players here put up numbers. It didn't matter what I did in high 
school once I got here." 
</P>
<P>
 LaCour's primary concern was being able to catch up with the pitchers. "Some 
of these guys are blowing gas," he said. "I'd seen only one guy this year like 
that -- Randy (Wolf)." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf, LaCour's former rival from El Camino Real High, is one of his West 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor in deflating LaCour's confidence was the professional draft and 
his place in it: left out. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were saying, 'You didn't get drafted?' It gets to your head 
sometimes," LaCour said. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth be told, LaCour didn't even know what days the draft was being held. 
Having already accepted a scholarship to Stanford, he didn't consider himself 
much of a professional prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not many scouts even talked to me," LaCour said. "I didn't think they were 
going to fork out the money to get me away." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, LaCour had been pleasantly surprised before. 
</P>
<P>
 After his outstanding junior season, he had declined an invitation to enroll 
in a summer camp at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 By passing on the offer, LaCour assumed he would be crossed off Stanford's 
recruiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically they said . . . they weren't going to recruit players that didn't 
go to the camp," LaCour said. "They wanted to see me there." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he stayed home and enrolled in summer school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'That's the end of Stanford,' " LaCour recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 To his surprise, Cardinal coaches contacted him again toward the close of the 
summer. He signed an early letter of intent with the Cardinal last November. 
</P>
<P>
 And he is glad he did, because despite his impressive statistics, LaCour 
wasn't all that satisfied with his final high school campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got hits, but my swing was mechanically messed up," he said. "I wasn't 
hitting the ball well at all, even though I was putting up the numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 LaCour felt like he still was struggling early this summer at the start of the 
American Legion season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just up there swinging, so mentally tired I didn't care," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A well-deserved respite seemed to energize him. For a week, LaCour went to the 
beach, spent time with his girlfriend and didn't worry about planning his life 
around baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't touch a baseball or a bat," he said. "I just kicked back." 
</P>
<P>
 Rejuvenated, LaCour hit a home run in his only Legion game before leaving for 
the Olympic Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "The break helped me," he said. "I'm hitting the ball better now then I have 
in a month or two." 
</P>
<P>
 That much was obvious against the North's Brad Jaster, a 6-foot-2 left- hander 
from Rock Island, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 In four shutout innings, Jaster allowed two hits -- both to LaCour, who said 
experience facing Wolf came in handy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just looked out there and said, 'I think Wolf's tougher than that lefty,' " 
LaCour said. "That helped." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolf probably also could have helped Jaster, had the pitcher inquired. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he approached LaCour during the high school season, Wolf replied, 
"Very carefully." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to give him anything too good," Wolf said.  
</P>
<P>
 "He'll take advantage of every mistake you make. I always thought if I worked 
around him and he got a walk, well, then he got a walk. I wasn't going to get 
careless." 
</P>
<P>
 LaCour fought off a good pitch by Jaster in his first at-bat, managing to loop 
a single into center field.  
</P>
<P>
 "He almost broke my hand he jammed me so hard," LaCour said. "I got lucky on 
that one." 
</P>
<P>
 The next time up, Jaster left a pitch over the plate and LaCour ripped it into 
the left-field corner for a stand-up double. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, LaCour hopes his hitting will earn him a starting 
assignment for now on -- even if it's back at third base, a position he hadn't 
played in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Long range, the United States will select a team to compete in the World 
Championships from the field of participants at the Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 LaCour is approaching the selections with a wait-and-see attitude.  
</P>
<P>
 "If it happens, that's great," he said. "But if I do well here and they don't 
pick me, then they're the ones missing out and that's fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy with the way I've started off here, and if I'm happy with the way 
I've played and I have fun, that's all I need." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, at least. Some day, LaCour said, he would like to return to Busch 
Stadium and perform wearing a professional uniform.  
</P>
<P>
 Watching the Cardinals play the last game of a home stand earlier this week 
drove the point home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were there when the players came walking in," LaCour said. "It was 
awesome. I'd love to live their life. Come in at 3, rest, go out and play and 
go home. Awesome. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where I want to be."

GONZALEZ INJURED IN ALL-STAR GAME; FOOTBALL: HUNTINGTON BEACH GRADUATE WHO 
PLANS TO PLAY TWO SPORTS AT CAL HURTS KNEE IN THE FIRST QUARTER. NORTH WINS, 
12-6. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Tony Gonzalez, a standout in basketball and football who will play both sports 
at California, injured his right knee Friday night in the 35th Orange County 
North-South All-Star football game. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, a graduate of Huntington Beach High School and one of best 
all-around athletes in county history, suffered the injury while playing tight 
end for the South team during the first quarter of the North's 12-6 victory in 
front of approximately 6,000 spectators at Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury occurred with 3 minutes 19 seconds left in the quarter when 
Gonzalez caught an 11-yard pass in the middle of the field thrown by 
quarterback Kevin Daft of Foothill, and was immediately slammed to the turf by 
several defenders at LeBard Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 He lay reeling in pain on the grass for a few minutes before being helped to 
the South's sideline. Gonzalez remained seated with his right leg resting on a 
training table until halftime, when teammates said he was taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 X-rays performed at FHP Hospital in Fountain Valley revealed that Gonzalez 
suffered a mild sprain, hospital nursing supervisor Dianne Cochrane said. 
Gonzalez was admitted to the hospital at 9:10 p.m. and released at 10:48 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochrane said Gonzalez did not require a brace.  
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez's absence hurt the South, which struggled on offense throughout the 
game. The Times' Orange County lineman of the year, Gonzalez led Huntington 
Beach in receiving with 63 receptions for 950 yards and 14 touchdowns in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time a high-profile athlete has suffered a knee injury 
in association with the game. Former Santa Ana High linebacker George Tuioti 
tore ligaments in his left knee while practicing for the game in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 While officials said Gonzalez's injury is not believed to be serious, many 
spectators in the stadium Friday night were understandably concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 The tone of the game was subdued after Gonzalez's departure. The North's Grant 
Pearsall was named the game's outstanding defensive player after making two 
spectacular plays -- the first to open the scoring and the second to seal the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Pearsall, a defensive back from Villa Park High, intercepted the first pass 
thrown by the South's Scott Bertoni (Fountain Valley) in the second quarter and 
returned it 72 yards down the left sideline for the game's first touchdown with 
6:05 remaining in the half. The North led, 6-0, after the point-after attempt 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just standing there all alone," Pearsall said. "I just wanted to 
concentrate on not dropping the ball. Once I got out there the whole field just 
looked huge." 
</P>
<P>
 Pearsall sealed the victory by slamming Daft for a six-yard loss with the 
South at the North's 22-yard line as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Tucker gave the North a 12-0 lead when he scored on a 15-yard reverse 
with 11:46 to play in the game. The receiver from Los Alamitos raced untouched 
to the end zone, but, again, the point-after attempt failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The South's touchdown came with 1:52 left. Tony Mathis, formerly of Irvine 
High, scored on one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 North quarterback Paul Waldrop (Savanna High) was named the game's outstanding 
offensive player after completing seven of 11 passes for 64 yards. The North 
leads the series, 19-14-2.

VENTURA RACEWAY; BARTELS RUNS AWAY WITH SECOND STREET STOCK VICTORY 
</P>

 Bill Bartels of Los Angeles ran away with his second Street Stock 20-lap main 
event before a small crowd Friday night at Ventura Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartels, who started fourth, took the lead on the fifth lap from Westlake's Al 
Adam. 
</P>
<P>
 Adam had gotten the jump at the start on pole-sitter Curtis Dietzch of 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara's James Weston spent the evening chasing Bartels but could not 
come up with enough power to make a pass, and when the pair hit lapped traffic 
with two laps remaining, Bartels was able to put the slower cars between 
himself and Weston to guarantee the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion and current points leader Paul Moore finished third. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartels also won the first seven-lap heat, while Ventura's Jason Secor took 
the second Street Stock heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo's Richard Webster went wire to wire in the 15-lap Mini Stock main 
after winning the second of two seven-lap heat races. Points leader Bruce 
Dunson of Ventura grabbed the first heat, and finished fourth in the Main. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster needed only one lap to take command in the heat race, after starting 
fourth in a five-car field. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-lap Pony Stock Main Event featured five lead changes and an apparent 
dead-heat finish, as Oxnard's Trish Remley crossed the finish line in tandem 
with Don DeAzevedo. 
</P>
<P>
 DeAzevedo, who led five laps in the middle of the race as well as the final 
lap, was set back to fourth place for rough driving, giving Remley the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Verdun and Michael VanDeventer won the two seven-lap heat races. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Cole of Santa Maria added to his lead in the points standings with a 
victory in the 15-lap IMCA Modified feature. Bill Lauer, also of Santa Maria, 
won the eight-lap heat, with Cole finishing fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Howard of Ventura won the 15-lap IMCA Sprint feature by one-quarter lap 
over his teammate, Daryl Rogers of Palmdale.

WELCH, OLDER AND WISER, TAKES SERIOUS APPROACH; VOLLEYBALL: HE HAS CUT OUT THE 
THRILLS OF SKIING TO FOCUS ON TRAINING THAT WILL PRODUCE SUCCESS ON THE BEACH 
TOUR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Wes Welch runs the words through his mind every morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Nutrition.  
</P>
<P>
 Strength.  
</P>
<P>
 Focus.  
</P>
<P>
 Three simple words that remind him that every time he steps on the beach, he's 
there for work, not play. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the job description of a pro beach volleyball player. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need that focus on volleyball," he said, "instead of focusing on some of 
the extracurricular activities like skiing and partying." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an odd reminder for a 34-year-old man, but one Welch uses daily. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing professionally in Switzerland for four years, Welch made a big 
impact on the beach tour as a rookie in 1991, upsetting three top-ranked teams 
with a variety of partners. 
</P>
<P>
 But his dedication to volleyball was rivaled by a passion for skiing and 
snowboarding. It took a painful moment on the Mammoth ski slopes last February, 
as well as a tough off-season conditioning program, to set his priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch has a history of problems with his right knee, but when he fell off his 
skis at Mammoth, he strained ligaments in his left knee and ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had snowed for a week and it was chest-deep," Welch said. "Then the sun 
came out and set the snow up pretty tight -- Sierra Cement, they call it -- and 
it was so thick that I couldn't turn my ski and I fell." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Welch, his knee and ankle didn't require surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to an off-season weight and conditioning program developed by his wife, 
Kelly, Welch was able to play -- although not 100% -- when the Assn. of 
Volleyball Professionals' tour started in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kelly had been training me down at San Clemente Gym," said Welch, a former 
Laguna Beach High and USC standout. "It was hard core and I was really getting 
into it. I was in the weight room six days a week in the off-season and I added 
15 pounds in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That work made me stronger and faster, and I think it helped me (recover 
from) my injuries (quicker)." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the injuries cost Welch six weeks of valuable training time entering 
the season, and delayed his teaming with Tanner. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just before I got hurt," Welch said, "I played well (with partner Andrew 
Smith), at the Evian qualifying tournament here at Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Troy and I were talking about playing together as soon as the season started, 
but after I got hurt, I was out six weeks prior to the start of the season, and 
that fell through." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner is Welch's San Clemente neighbor. They had played well together against 
San Clemente's Karch Kiraly and Pacific Palisades' Kent Steffes, the tour's 
top-ranked team, in practice matches at Capistrano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Troy and I knew we could beat anybody out here," Welch said. "We match up 
well with just about anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner opened the season playing with Culver City's Dan Vrebalovich, and Welch 
teamed with Smith, a model and younger brother of Sinjin Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andrew and I were competitive," Welch said. "We had a couple ninth-place 
finishes. I was only about 60 or 70%. Then, when I got to be 100%, Troy and I 
finally got together." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner and Welch played their first tournament together May 6-8 in Dallas, and 
they shocked everybody on the tour by finishing second to Kiraly-Steffes. 
</P>
<P>
 That tournament set the table for the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch and Tanner were third at Phoenix behind Kiraly-Steffes and Randy 
Stoklos-Adam Johnson, dropped to 13th in San Jose, then came back a week later 
with a second-place finish behind Johnson-Stoklos at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Welch was enjoying unprecedented success with the partner he had 
always wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wes and I work well together because both of us do a lot of things well," 
Tanner said. "Lately, we've been struggling a little bit, and I think we need 
to be more focused." 
</P>
<P>
 Focus. Now there's a familiar word in Welch's vocabulary. Wasn't that 
something he and Tanner were working on? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, but we still get distracted a little bit," Tanner said. "It's nothing 
big, just like letting a bad call by an official affect us. Or hanging out with 
friends too long at a tournament. Everyone wants five or 10 minutes with us now 
because we've had some success. We have to learn to turn it on and off." 
</P>
<P>
 It's certainly new to Welch. The tour's rookie of the year in 1991, he played 
with a variety of partners, including Laguna Beach's Leif Hanson, San 
Clemente's Larry Mear and Santa Monica's Mark Eller, over the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch's best finish was a third in 1991 with Eller, and he had never 
consistently finished in the top five -- until Tanner came along. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a little frustrating since we've hooked up," Welch said, "because 
there's a lot of pressure playing with Troy and we feel we that if we're not in 
the winner's circle every week, it's a disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Troy takes losing hard, but you have to realize that nobody is there (in the 
finals) every week, except for Karch and Kent. You just can't get bummed out 
about a loss." 
</P>
<P>
 Not when the prize money keeps rolling in. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch has earned $36,523 so far this season, by far his best since playing 
indoors in Switzerland. Having played in a couple of TV matches, Welch picked 
up Speedo as a sponsor to go along with Hobie sunglasses. 
</P>
<P>
 At 34, Welch is one of the older players on the tour, but not the oldest. On 
an early July day when Sinjin Smith, 35, was playing one of his final matches 
at the Manhattan Beach Open, Welch observed that being thirtysomething in a 
sport of twentysomethings isn't so bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting a few yards away from Welch in the players' tent is former Laguna 
Beach High standout Dain Blanton, fresh off his senior season at Pepperdine. 
Blanton recently joined the beach tour full time. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach senior Dan Styles, 17, playing his first major tournament as an 
amateur, stops by to say hello. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go get 'em Danny," Welch yells. 
</P>
<P>
 Styles smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's great," Welch says. "He reminds me a lot of Karch when he was in high 
school. He hits the ball hard. He just goes after it." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to see them (Blanton and Styles) out here. You see them winning here 
or there. Pretty soon they'll be regulars out here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys like them look at me and see a guy reaching his prime at 34. They have 
to be stoked about that, knowing they have more than 10 years to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Welch pauses, then ponders another question. 
</P>
<P>
 He wonders who was the oldest player to win his first pro tournament. Will it 
be him? 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, it's a record the AVP doesn't keep, but it's one that veteran 
volleyball observers think would be Welch's if he wins a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to play another five years," Welch said. "Ron Von Hagen won a 
tournament (not his first) when he was 38, and that's what I'm shooting for." 
On the Move 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1994, Wes Welch's best finish on the Assn. of Volleyball Professionals' 
beach tour was a third with Mark Eller in 1991. But since joining San Clemente 
neighbor Troy Tanner in early May, Welch has four top-four finishes. A look at

GASTON QUALIFIES FOR U.S. OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Andrea Gaston of Canoga Park continued her dramatic comeback to tournament 
golf by tying for medalist honors at a U.S. Women's Open sectional qualifying 
tournament Friday at Old Ranch Country Club in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston fired a one-under-par 71 to earn one of eight available berths in the 
Open, to be held July 21-24 at Indianwood Golf and Country Club in Lake Orion, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston, beset by debilitating putting woes, quit the game as a top amateur in 
1978 and didn't return until 1992. Gaston was the low amateur at Old Ranch and 
was one of four players to shoot 71, a list that included Muffin 
Spencer-Devlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to hours of practice, her short game has held up well for months. "I've 
really been working hard on it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the second time Gaston has qualified for the Open and the second 
time she has won a sectional qualifier. She won a sectional in 1977 in Modesto, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, Gaston, 36, has advanced to the semifinals of the U.S. 
Women's Mid-Amateur and won the State Amateur and Long Beach City Women's 
championships. She was runner-up last month at the Broadmoor Classic and is the 
15th-ranked amateur in the nation by Golfweek magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Chen Olsen of Northridge, a member Porter Valley Country Club along with 
Gaston, shot 73 and was eliminated in a five-way playoff for the final Open 
berth.

WRIGHT, GASPAR ARE SET TO SIGN; BASEBALL: FORMER KATELLA PITCHER IN AGREEMENT 
WITH CLEVELAND. PEPPERDINE PITCHER HEADED TO DETROIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Katella High School pitcher Jaret Wright, the 10th pick in the June 
draft, has reached agreement with the Cleveland Indians on a deal that includes 
a $1.2-million signing bonus, believed to be the highest ever received by an 
Orange County player. 
</P>
<P>
 And Pepperdine pitcher Cade Gaspar, a former Capistrano Valley High School and 
Saddleback College standout, isn't far behind. Gaspar, the 18th pick in the 
draft, is flying to Detroit today to sign a contract with the Tigers that will 
include a bonus "substantially higher" than the $700,000 a team offered before 
the draft, according to his father, Rod. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said Cade's bonus was not higher than Wright's $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "A friend of mine makes $9 an hour, and I think that's a lot of money," said 
Wright, a right-hander who was The Times 1994 player of the year. "I can't even 
think about how much money I'm making." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said he will fly to Cleveland in the next two or three weeks to sign a 
contract, then report to the organization's rookie league team at Burlington, 
N.C. Included in the deal is $80,000 that Wright can use for college tuition if 
he decides to attend school. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, when contract talks appeared to reach an impasse, Wright's 
parents said the pitcher would likely accept a scholarship to UCLA. Wright was 
seeking a bonus comparable to the $1.55 million that pitcher Brien Taylor got 
from the New York Yankees in 1991, but Indian General Manager John Hart's 
initial offer reportedly was $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their scouting director, Jay Robertson, came back and was very fair, very 
cordial," said Clyde Wright, Jaret's father and a former Angel pitcher. "There 
wasn't a lot of bickering back and forth. We put the cards on the table, moved 
them around, and this is what we came up with." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, a 6-foot-2, 220-pounder, was 7-2 with a 2.98 earned-run average and 
led the county in strikeouts with 100 in 75 innings. His fastball has been 
clocked at 95 m.p.h., and some observers believe he has the potential to pitch 
in the major leagues within three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clyde's going, 'You know, I signed for $10,000 (in 1965),' " Vicki Wright, 
Jaret's mother, said. "You can't even fathom that kind of money. Of course, the 
government takes 42% off the top -- they whittle it down to something you can 
survive on." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaspar, a 6-foot-3, 175-pound right-hander whose fastball has been clocked in 
the 90-m.p.h. range, also is the son of a former major leaguer. Rod Gaspar was 
a reserve on the New York Mets team that won the 1969 World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Cade pitched in Little League but played shortstop in high school and for much 
of his community college career. He pitched some in relief at Saddleback and 
returned to the mound on a full-time basis last season at Pepperdine, where he 
went 6-1 with a 2.30 ERA and 67 strikeouts in 82 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a real fresh arm, and that's one thing the scouts like a lot," Rod 
Gaspar said in April. 
</P>
<P>
 After spending this weekend in Detroit, Gaspar will report to Lakeland, Fla., 
to pitch for the Tigers' Class A team in the Florida State League.

NOVAK PACES WOODLAND HILLS WEST'S 8-4 VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Novak went three for four with two doubles and two runs batted in, 
leading Woodland Hills West to an 8-4 victory over Encino Friday in an American 
Legion baseball District 20 Western Division game at El Camino Real High. 
</P>
<P>
 Novak was the leader of a 12-hit attack, but Justin Balser also had three 
hits, including a double.Billy Burnette added two hits and an RBI for Woodland 
Hills West (10-4), which pulled closer to Encino (12-2) in the Western Division 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Kmet pitched a complete game for Woodland Hills West, striking out one 
and walking six. Three of those walks came in the bottom of the seventh inning, 
when Encino threatened by loading the bases with two out. But Jessie Slade 
flied out to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino managed only five hits. The biggest was Brad Farlow's two-run home run 
in the first inning.  
</P>
<P>
 Farlow's homer pulled Encino to within a run after Woodland Hills West had 
taken a 3-0 lead in the top of the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Encino tied the game with a run in the bottom of the second, but Woodland 
Hills West regained the lead with a run in the third.
