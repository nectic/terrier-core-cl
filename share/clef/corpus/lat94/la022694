 Vittorio Rieti, 96, prolific composer for ballet, operas and instrumental 
ensembles. The American composer was born in Egypt, studied in Italy, including 
the University of Milan where he obtained a doctorate, and served in the 
Italian army during World War I. His first international success came at the 
ISCM Festival in Prague in 1924 with the performance of his "Concerto for Winds 
and Orchestra."He divided his early years between Rome and Paris, writing 
mostly for Parisian ballet and theater, and the chamber music group he helped 
found, La Serenade. He immigrated to the United States in 1940 and became a 
citizen in 1944. His American ballets were choreographed by George Balanchine 
and his symphonies conducted by such luminaries as Arturo Toscanini. Rieti 
taught composition at the Peabody Conservatory, the Chicago Musical College, 
Queens College and the New York College of Music. On Feb. 19 in New York.

GEN. J. STEINHOFF; WW II ACE, NATO OFFICIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gen. Johannes Steinhoff, an ace World War II fighter pilot who helped rebuild 
Germany's postwar air force and later chaired NATO's military commission, has 
died at the age of 80. 
</P>
<P>
 A career military officer who was badly burned in the crash of a jet fighter 
near the end of the war, Steinhoff became instrumental in rebuilding Germany's 
air force, the Luftwaffe. 
</P>
<P>
 He served as Germany's representative to the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization from 1960 to 1963 and became Luftwaffe inspector in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, as a four-star general, Steinhoff took over the chair of 
NATO's military commission and held the job until his retirement in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Steinhoff attended a weekend aviation art show in Irvine, 
encountering two Russian fliers who had been adversaries during the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fighter fraternity is always a close club," he told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinhoff said the get-together was only possible because of the collapse of 
the former Soviet Union. He said that earlier efforts by German pilots to meet 
their Russian counterparts had never succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now," he said, "we are happy we come together in peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinhoff bore scars from his wartime burns. During 993 combat missions for 
Germany, he was shot down 12 times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is hard to make predictions," Steinhoff told The Times in 1992. "No one 
predicted that the Soviet Union would fall apart. No one predicted that Germany 
would be reunited. I am careful not to make predictions. But one thing will not 
happen again: that we will fight each other. That is over." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinhoff died Monday. He is survived by his wife and two children.

JEAN SABLON; ELEGANT FRENCH JAZZ SINGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jean Sablon, the regal troubadour who recorded popular medleys of anguished 
love songs accompanied by some of the biggest names in French jazz, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinica, a hospital in the French Riviera town of Cannes-La-Bocca where he 
was admitted recently, said Sablon died Thursday night at age 87. 
</P>
<P>
 At the height of his popularity in the decades of the 1930s, '40s and '50s, he 
was known as the "French Bing Crosby." But he had been out of the public eye 
and reportedly ill for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Sablon was gifted with a sensuous sound that was first heard in public in his 
late teens at the Bouffes Parisiennes, a celebrated Paris variety house. 
</P>
<P>
 He was performing for $50 a month alongside another future star, Jean Gabin. 
There, Sablon attracted the attention of singer Mistinguett, and became a 
sought-after performer in other Parisian cabarets. Sablon cut his first record 
in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he became a near-overnight success, some criticized him for being the 
first French singer to use a microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 Detractors of the new amplification device called him the "singer without a 
voice." But with songs such as "J'attendrai" (I'll Wait), "C'est le Printemps" 
(It's Spring), "La Chanson des Rues" (Song of the Streets), "Please, James" or 
"Sur le Pont d'Avignon," Sablon established a lasting repertoire enhanced by 
his elegant silhouette and soft, Continental style in which he sometimes 
whispered rather than sang terms of endearment. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his early influences was the American singer "Whispering" Jack Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 From France, Sablon traveled to cabarets in Mexico City, Montreal, London and 
in 1934 to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in this country that he began wearing the pencil-thin mustache that 
became his trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was credited with helping popularize jazz in France through his 
collaborations with violinist Stephane Grappelli and guitarist Django 
Reinhardt. 
</P>
<P>
 For years he resisted offers to perform on American radio because networks 
would not import his favorite musicians for the broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sablon was known as a man of character. He refused to accept the prestigious 
Legion of Honor, saying his brother and sister -- who created the "Song of the 
Partisans" in London during the World War II occupation of France -- earned the 
award for military contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to get it," he said, "for pushing little songs." 
</P>
<P>
 His farewell concert was in 1983 in Rio de Janeiro.

 Don't you dare call them victims of Reaganomics: After perusing county 
records, editor John Karevoll of the Real Estate Observer newsletter reports 
that Ronald and Nancy Reagan have had their Bel-Air mansion reappraised at a 
paltry $2.2 million -- down more than half a million from its purchase price.  
</P>
<P>
 This, incidentally, is the residence whose numerals were changed to 668, 
reportedly because Nancy Reagan didn't like the fact that the original numbers 
-- 666 -- represent Satan in the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 But her precaution obviously couldn't protect the Reagans from what has turned 
out to be a devil of a recession. 
</P>

 Reading al fresco: Sure, they've gussied up Pershing Square with plenty of 
eye-catching sculptures, including that ornamental earthquake fault.  
</P>
<P>
 But 60 years ago the park boasted one feature that's missing today (see 
photo). 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, we suppose the library would be reluctant to trust books to some 
of the denizens of the area. You know, all those stockbrokers and lawyers. . .

 All together now -- follow the bouncing city: Still no word from Randy Newman 
on whether he'll take our advice and rewrite his tribute to this city as "Still 
Love L.A." (We're sure we could work out an amicable arrangement over the 
sharing of the profits, etc.) 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, in the meantime, Mike Delamater has reworked an old ditty by the Mamas 
and Papas and come up with "California Reelin": 
</P>
<P>
 All the hills are brown  
</P>
<P>
 The fires burned them away

<P>
 California reelin' -- it's just another day

 Then my apartment got demolished

<P>
 You know I'm unemployed and homeless  
</P>
<P>
 But so is most of L.A. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On a scale of 1 to 10, we'd give it a 6.8. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait till Don King finds out: The Pasadena Athletic Club is offering "Cardio 
Boxing" workouts in which daring yuppies can "train like a boxer without 
climbing into a ring. . . . Learn all the basics of boxing, such as punching, 
footwork, offensive and defensive drills." 
</P>
<P>
 The club says that "boxing gloves (are) provided for the class," but 
mouthpieces aren't needed. One other element of the boxing experience is also 
excluded -- the art of speaking to reporters. And that's a shame. 
</P>
<P>
 We've idolized onetime heavyweight champ Primo Carnera ever since we read the 
reply he gave when asked what he thought of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knock him out in three rounds," Carnera growled. miscelLAny:

<P>
 The noble aim of its bra museum, says Frederick's of Hollywood, is to salute 
"the stars of stage, screen and television who glamorized lingerie." Those so 
honored include Cher, Mae West, Lana Turner, Milton Berle and Tony Curtis.

STAGE REVIEW; 'LAKEBOAT'S' ACTORS SAIL A TAUT SHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN BRESLAUER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Mamet, master of testosterone theater, used to be known for bruising 
plays full of dialogue you can't print in this newspaper. He's gotten off that 
track in recent years. But "Lakeboat," in a stellar production at the Tiffany, 
takes you back to a time when men were men and Mamet was Mamet. 
</P>
<P>
 An early 1970s comedy about guys working on a freighter on the Great Lakes, 
"Lakeboat" is Dudes at Sea with a nod to Act I of Eugene O'Neill's "The Hairy 
Ape" -- without the heavy-handed politics, though, or any dingy rich dames. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of one nasty, brutish Yank you get eight Yanks of different sorts. And 
from the fresh-faced college kid to the grisly older hands, they all go on and 
on about booze, sex and egg-salad sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 The subject is not male bonding, but male anomie and the affable misogyny that 
goes with it. "Lakeboat" isn't as rich a play as "American Buffalo" or the 1984 
Pulitzer-winning "Glengarry Glen Ross," but it does hold up -- thanks to 
Mamet's uncanny ear for dialogue and, yup, the trademark f -wordy Mamet-speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "Lakeboat" is more a chain of monologues and dialogues than a play. 
It's a high-order actors' vehicle with no real dramatic arc and an arbitrary 
ending. It wouldn't resonate on as many levels as it does here without 
first-rate performers adding dimension to the characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the singular feature of this production is its exquisite ensemble 
of male character actors, gracefully and precisely directed by longtime Mamet 
associate Joe Mantegna. Garnishing the text with a few choice bits of 
nautically themed period and show tunes, Mantegna plays off pop culture's 
romanticization of this quintessential guy gig. 
</P>
<P>
 Mantegna has the men materialize at various points on and around John 
Paoletti's set of metal ramps, trapped in pools of light (by Geoffrey Bushor). 
He opts for a measured pace that draws clear lines between the many short 
scenes, emphasizing the crew members' alienation from one another. 
</P>
<P>
 The actors, however, are anything but alienated. Their teamwork is so finely 
calibrated and coordinated that it's hard to say where the individual 
performances stop and the company starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Neill ("Married . . . With Children") is so at ease as a middle-aged guy 
who wants to open up to someone that it seems as though he's making up Mamet's 
dialogue on the spot. George Wendt ("Cheers") gets laughs with no more than an 
expression or inflection and never upstages the other actors when he easily 
could. J. J. Johnston is equally judicious, and Jack Wallace turns in standout 
work in one of the emotionally flashier roles. But, really, there's not a bad 
performance onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Lakeboat," Tiffany Theatre, 8532 Sunset Blvd., West Hollywood .

POP MUSIC REVIEW; JR. WALKER TAKES SHOW FROM A JOG TO AN ALL-OUT RUN; AFTER A 
MUZZLED START, THE SAXOPHONIST AND HIS ALL STARS JAM ON THE 1966 HIT 'ROAD 
RUNNER' AND KEEP UP THE RED-HOT PACE FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jr. Walker is so closely identified with his nearly 30-year-old hit "Shotgun" 
that the tune's title has become part of his name. Thursday at the Coach House 
his guitarist, Harvey Williams, repeatedly introduced his boss as Jr. (Shotgun) 
Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 But Walker seemed to favor another name, "Road Runner," when he talked about 
himself between numbers, and the designation somehow seemed more apt. It wasn't 
until he struck up that 1966 hit well into his 90-minute set that things took 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, problems with feedback and an apparent lack of enthusiasm kept 
the man and the music muzzled. Luckily, "Road Runner" got the saxophonist 
firing on all cylinders. And by the time he loaded up for "Shotgun," Walker, 
and the audience, were having a blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Walker came out, singer Robert Stone warmed up the All Stars -- 
guitarist Williams, organist Delby Littlejohn, bassist Michael Wakes and 
drummer Jerome Teasley -- with roadhouse-styled versions of "Got My Mojo 
Working" and "Sweet 16" sung in a strong voice and decorated with the expected 
risque asides and gestures. Williams' up-neck guitar solo on "16" hinted at 
good things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Walker on stage and the squealing distraction of feedback, the band 
seemed hesitant to cut loose. Walker tried to get it started on "What Does It 
Take (to Win Your Love)" by picking up the tempo and issuing squeals of his own 
from the tenor. But the All Stars didn't take the bait. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he answered a call from the audience for one of his funkiest numbers, 
"Homecookin'," by saying, "Now that's goin' back in the files" and explaining 
that his current band was too young to know it. Instead he jumped into "How 
Sweet It Is (to Be Loved by You)," but the good-time number, complete with call 
and response from the audience, fell flat. 
</P>
<P>
 But everything fell together during "Road Runner." Suddenly, Walker's cries, 
shouts and stuttering rhythmic lines dropped into place behind tough bass lines 
from Wakes. Drummer Teasley, playing a surreal-looking drum set that appeared 
to have melted askew under a hot sun, drove the rift with snapping snare hits 
and tom-tom rolls. And organist Littlejohn got the Hammond to whine. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the main attraction was Walker, pushing into his solos from up top 
before breaking into a series of guttural clucks and chicken scratch. His play 
has changed little since charting 20 some tunes in the '60s and early '70s, and 
his trademark calls and caterwauls serve as a touchstone to those times. But 
his sound is hardly dated, and younger R&B sax aspirants, such as Everette Harp 
and the vastly popular Dave Koz, would do well to give the man a serious 
listen. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker continued to fire up even the more conservative numbers, including 
"These Eyes" and "Pucker Up, Buttercup," with bouncy play and gruff, spirited 
vocals. The funk of "Hip City," with Walker's calls to "get on the hip side of 
town," brought out a percussively delivered rap. When he finally moved into 
"Shotgun," his voice, like his tenor play, was rough, tough and assertive. 
</P>
<P>
 Blues guitarist John Heussenstamm's trio preceded Walker with a sharp, 
electric program that covered Albert King, James Brown and Jimi Hendrix. 
Heussenstamm showed he has licks galore but seldom delivered anything to sink 
teeth into. His solo on King's "Born Under a Bad Sign" was appropriately dark 
and foreboding while avoiding reliance on King's trademark lines. Bassist 
Armando Compean upstaged Heussenstamm in the vocal department, but, as an 
instrumental unit, the band was tightly knit.

 Today's sampling of local records turns up a diverse and solid batch of new 
releases. There's blues from Sydney Ellis, bluegrass from the Andy Rau Band, 
alternative rock done with cerebral care by Volkwood Ghost and with grungy

 Volkwood Ghost*** 
</P>
<P>
 "Wagon Train" (15-track CD) 
</P>
<P>
 "Wagon Train" (seven-song cassette) 
</P>
<P>
 Kismet Ghreen  
</P>
<P>
 There's just a one-song overlap in this Garden Grove band's two concurrent 
releases. Both the CD and the cassette are worth having for Volkwood Ghost's 
intelligent and tuneful sketches of lives falling into isolation, alienation 
and disaffection. 
</P>
<P>
 The edgy, concisely riffing guitars of Mike Schnee and Doug McGuire frame the 
band's psychedelic garage-rock style. Janette Neumann's violin provides 
European-folk shadings that seek to unsettle rather than provide sweet 
comforts. These elements place Volkwood Ghost in line with such worthy '80s 
college-rock forebears as the Dream Syndicate, Green on Red and Camper Van 
Beethoven. 
</P>
<P>
 The CD risks settling into sameness as Volkwood Ghost goes for a pervasively 
brooding mood, but the band burrows deeply enough into that mood to turn the 
collection into a good, slowly incremental evocation of the mounting 
desperation that can make people snap. The cassette offers a more pithy and 
varied take on similar themes. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnee's nasal, sharp-toned sneer takes some getting used to. At first, it 
suggests a dyspeptic wise guy, a la Gordon Gano of the Violent Femmes. But a 
dimension of anguish lends resonance and keeps his stuff listenable. McGuire's 
voice is similar but not as abrasive. Neumann takes the lead on one song on the 
cassette, "Myths," and makes a strong case for a heavier workload with airy 
singing that conveys both strangeness and an off-handed intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Volkwood Ghost's theme of the desperation underlying seemingly normal, 
everyday surfaces has parallels in the movies of David Lynch. People do 
ordinary things in Volkwood Ghost songs -- they go off to work at dawn ("6 
a.m."), drive around in the dark ("Lost in Hollywood"), and try to decide 
whether to hold on to a beleaguered independence or look to dad to bail them 
out of a tight spot ("Help Is on Its Way"). They try to seize a spark by 
playing rock 'n' roll, but gig night brings more of the niggling 
disappointments they had hoped to leave behind ("All at the Scream"). Cornered 
by their immediate surroundings, they seek solace in motion -- even if that 
means rolling on to uncertain destinations in "Wagon Train" or driving for the 
heart of nowhere in "Desert Convertible." Of course, one can always visit the 
"City of Beer" for a more conventional form of escape. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a dark vision of the human lot, but it's a lot the band prefers to 
explore and feel deeply rather than dismiss with easy cynicism.

 Sydney Ellis*** 
</P>
<P>
 "Goin Home" 
</P>
<P>
 Black Wallet  
</P>
<P>
 To say that this Huntington Beach-based blues singer projects a strong 
personality is to put it far too mildly. Growling, shouting, rasping and 
snapping, Ellis is out to make sure her listeners -- and the errant men she 
addresses in several songs -- get it through their heads that she is a force to 
be reckoned with. While these intensifying gestures may be partly intended to 
compensate for a somewhat limited vocal range, Ellis uses them in a natural, 
conversational way that adds bite and humor and never seems merely histrionic. 
And her voice isn't at all bad: It's a deep, sturdy and full-bodied platform 
from which she can jump to a wide range of blues-based styles, including 
trad-jazz-inflected New Orleans romps, straight Chicago shuffles and 
gospel-tinged laments. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-effacing band could undermine the vibrant impression Ellis means to 
make, but she surrounds herself with local players who carve their own mark. 
Pianist Luther Tucker, guitarist Michael Parisi and the nimble clarinet-and-sax 
player, Steve Hooks, provide a lively backdrop. The eight original songs on the 
album were co-written by Ellis and members of her band. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the sassy, salty numbers, like "Bitch With an Attitude" and "Piece of 
Crap" that jump out and define her style. But Ellis takes care to include more 
somber material. Her cover of the Nina Simone song "Nobody's Fault but Mine" 
shows that she has the gravitas and dramatic savvy to register deeper meanings. 
Here, she musters a fine blend of defiance and anguish. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ellis comes on strong enough to put one in mind of the blues-R&B firebrand 
Etta James, that comparison also points to what's missing from her debut album: 
the sense of loss and vulnerability that James can capture amid declarations of 
self-hood. In songs such as "Cryin' the Blues," Ellis does sing of sadness and 
emotional blows endured, but she emphasizes the strength that will allow her to 
weather them, without giving wretchedness its full due. "Graveyard Blues," a 
sparse, darkly meditative number in the John Lee Hooker tradition, is well 
sung, but Ellis doesn't cut to the stark core of terror that the lyric implies. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves her something to shoot for. For now, Ellis and her band have 
provided plenty to savor, with hot sauce included.

 Sublime** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 "Robbin' the Hood" 
</P>
<P>
 Skunk  
</P>
<P>
 Life's too short to waste time, and this Long Beach rock 'n' reggae trio 
spends too much of it padding its second album with dull spoken-word snippets 
and noodling digressions aimed at establishing its hip underground credentials 
(it also wants to establish hip-hop credentials: note the cover's opportunistic 
bannering of the address, "Long Beach, CA," now rap's coolest place to be, 
given the success of Snoop Doggy Dogg and Domino). 
</P>
<P>
 Especially grating are three sessions with a profanely raving geezer who stops 
the album's momentum whenever he appears. It's almost beyond belief that a band 
would wait until its album's fifth track to provide something substantial -- in 
this case a good, spacey, synth-based cover of Peter Tosh's "Steppin' Razor" 
that is as much a plaintive plea for nonviolence as it is a threat to use force 
("I'm a steppin' razor, watch my sides, I'm dangerous, so dangerous"). 
</P>
<P>
 But once Sublime gets untracked, the results are varied and interesting. 
Singer Brad Nowell writes from a street's-eye point of view in which drugs, 
booze and the shadow of violence are givens, but not objects for glorification. 
Music itself is held out as a beacon in "Boss D.J.," which Nowell renders as a 
solo-acoustic number. It's a fine song that could have considerable commercial 
appeal given a fleshed-out pop-rock arrangement. "Pool Shark" and "Mary" are 
also solo-acoustic highlights, both frankly sexual laments of relationships in 
jeopardy. "Freeway Time in the LA County Jail" displays good blues instincts as 
Nowell, again by himself, lays down a laid-back, Canned Heat-style boogie. With 
his huskily emotional voice, Nowell's real calling might be as a solo folkie. 
</P>
<P>
 But that would take away the genre-jumping fun Sublime gets into on full-band 
numbers that slide through quirky changes that can send a song oscillating 
between skipping ska, hammering punk rock and spacey, slowly skanking reggae 
with toaster-style rapping. It creates an elastic, anything-can-happen sense of 
possibility and tension appropriate to the urban precincts the band explores. 
Among the best full-band numbers are the collage-like "STP" and "Saw Red," a 
duet with Gwen Stefani of No Doubt in which time shifts and racing ska beats 
capture the exuberant if risky ride of a burgeoning romance.

 Andy Rau Band** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 "On the Horizon" 
</P>
<P>
 Turquoise  
</P>
<P>
 The Andy Rau Band is nominally a bluegrass band, but it doesn't play in the 
flashy, high-octane style of traditional bluegrass. "On the Horizon," the 
band's debut CD, is actually folk-pop that abides by the all-acoustic rules of 
bluegrass. It's a companionable, ever-wistful collection of songs that lack 
bite and suffer from a degree of sameness but nevertheless make for 
consistently pleasant listening. Call it pastel bluegrass. 
</P>
<P>
 The personality that comes across in Rau's singing simply isn't suited to a 
high-octane approach. His voice is small and mild, with a bit of Paul Simon (a 
very laid-back Paul Simon) in it. Many of Rau's songs have attractive melodies, 
but the performances are a bit callow. One suspects that a craggier voice of 
experience, a Guy Clark type, perhaps, could find more depth of feeling in 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Toss on the CD and you'd think the singer's name was Andy Rue. The album opens 
with a long string of gently lovelorn numbers in which the melancholy Rau 
succumbs to quiet self-reproach, but never hints at bitterness or betrays an 
arresting flare-up of harsh feeling. The emotional climate improves on the 
album's second half, as Rau moves toward gently celebratory songs about 
love-gone-right. It's left to Dennis Roger Reed, the band's bassist and himself 
a well-established local songwriter, to serve up a song that portrays the 
lacerated feelings that linger when love goes wrong. The reproach in his "Just 
Look in the Mirror" isn't mild, and it isn't directed at himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The band is solid instrumentally, although it falls too readily into lightly 
glistening, rippling patterns. Again, some perturbation would help. Within the 
band's limited scope, though, appealing things happen. Rau's banjo work is 
light and dexterous, never falling into the clunky kerplunking that is the 
instrument's stereotype. And Les Johnson is a gem of a guitarist whose leads 
flow and swirl as naturally as a stream on a temperate day. Johnson 
occasionally plays slide guitar, generating rounder tones that bring some 
needed presence and definition to these pastel sounds.

<P>
 Ragabash ** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 "Stoned" 
</P>
<P>
 Lethal  
</P>
<P>
 The A side of this vinyl single is "Stoned," about a guy who becomes 
antisocial when inebriated, and the flip-side is "Hammered," wherein the 
stinking-drunk narrator looks at his overindulgent habits with a sardonic sense 
of self-disgust. "Everything's here and anything goes, God knows," goes the 
refrain of "Hammered," as pithy an expression as you could wish of the sources 
of youthful aimlessness and excess. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragabash plays it heavy and grungy. "Stoned" could be a Soundgarden outtake, 
complete with the darkly glowering, Jim Morrison-influenced singing that is a 
staple of Seattle grunge. One good, surprising element is the lead guitar line 
that cuts through "Stoned" with a tightly wired acuity. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragabash isn't pushing the envelope, but it delivers hard stuff the masses 
crave. The humorous shrug of "Hammered" is a welcome touch.

SINGER STEPHANIE HAYNES GIVES 'SWING' A PUSH; JAZZ: THE VOCALIST'S LATEST ALBUM 
IS ON HER OWN LABEL, AND IT SHOWS OFF HER VERSATILITY AS WELL AS THAT OF HER 
LONGTIME COLLABORATOR, PIANIST DAVE MACKAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Singer Stephanie Haynes has taken matters into her own hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Her three previous recordings, including the critically praised 1989 release, 
"Here's That Rainy Day" with pianist Cedar Walton on the Trend/Discovery label, 
were all for someone else's label. But her latest, "Two on a Swing," is all her 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pretty much know what the situation is today with the recording companies 
-- both the majors and the independents," she explains, over the phone from her 
home in San Juan Capistrano. "They're not signing new talent, especially 
singers. They're mainly involved in reissues. And I didn't want to wait around 
until someone decided to pick up what I had done." 
</P>
<P>
 So Haynes recorded her own disc, a duo with pianist Dave Mackay, at 
keyboardist Daniel May's Band-Ade studio in Long Beach last year, and formed 
her own label, Why Not Records, expressly for the release. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first started recording, we didn't really have a plan to do an album, 
but it began to unfold when we got together at Daniel's studio. We were trying 
to cover a broad spectrum of moods and, as we went along, it sounded awfully 
good to us. So we began to think in terms of doing an album." 
</P>
<P>
 May was instrumental in bringing Mackay and Haynes together. As music director 
of the Loew's Hotel in Santa Monica, he paired the two to sing in the hotel's 
lobby lounge, one of the city's premier showcases for vocalists. Before that 
date some three years ago, Mackay and Haynes had not worked together. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Daniel kept us on, playing every Saturday, for almost a year," Haynes 
says. "Dave and I developed a good rapport. He knows a lot of tunes. I know a 
lot of tunes. So we just seemed to hit it off. He's one of the best solo 
pianists there ever was and has made many recordings. But none show him off to 
the extent this one does." 
</P>
<P>
 Mackay, whose credits include work with saxophonist Sonny Stitt, trumpeters 
Chet Baker and Don Ellis and vocalists Vicki Hamilton and Bill Henderson, says 
he enjoys his association with Haynes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always excited to work with Stephanie because I know something great is 
going to happen. She has a beautiful, full voice and can also get down and be 
very funky. She's a very creative singer who brings new things to old tunes 
every time she does them. She takes the music to a different place." 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes attributes their success to the fact that Mackay is also a vocalist. 
"He understands what the singer is going for. And he's an extremely intuitive 
and sensitive player with technique to burn. Not only that, but he's extremely 
versatile and knows a lot of piano styles." 
</P>
<P>
 The album will be available by mail order and at Haynes' various gigs around 
the area. Orange County residents will have their first chance to buy the disc 
when Haynes celebrates its release Sunday with a performance at the Bob Burns 
Restaurant at Fashion Island Newport Beach. A Los Angeles release party was 
held Thursday at the Club Brasserie in West Hollywood's Bel Age Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 * Stephanie Haynes and Dave Mackay appear Sunday at 5:30 p.m. at Bob Burns 
Restaurant, 881 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 644-2030.

MUSIC REVIEW; CHAMBER ORCHESTRA PLAYERS LIVEN 'BRANDENBURG' CONCERTOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there was any negative artistic fallout from the recent announcement of the 
Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra's fiscal problems, it was not reflected in the 
band's playing of the six "Brandenburg" Concertos of J.S. Bach at Ambassador 
Auditorium on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever failings might have been detected could be attributed not to the 
instrumentalists but to the too-easygoing leadership of veteran conductor 
Helmuth Rilling. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, it is difficult in this age of heightened stylistic awareness to 
respond to the sort of gently contoured, unincisive Bach espoused by Rilling. 
Nor is there much to be said in favor of using as large a body of strings as 
was employed for the Fourth Concerto, whose tutti sounded alternatingly thick 
and slick on this occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 The performances took wing, however, when the soloists, all members of the 
orchestra, were in charge, most hearteningly when focus was established by 
concertmaster Ralph Morrison, the orchestra's linchpin and driving force. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrison's energetic, stylishly inflected solo in No. 4, for instance, might 
have served as a lesson in pacing and shaping to any baton conductor. 
</P>
<P>
 And elsewhere during a long but engaging evening one could savor the 
fulfillment of the most important truism about the Los Angeles Chamber 
Orchestra: that it is at once a tightly knit ensemble and a gathering of gifted 
individuals, to wit, the superbly secure work of hornists Richard Todd and 
Steven Becknell in the second Trio of Concerto No. 1; the airborne flutes 
(although the woody timbre of Bach's prescribed recorders would have been 
welcome) of David Shostac and Susan Greenberg in No. 4; the propulsive, 
sure-fingered execution by Patricia Mabee of the harpsichord cadenza in No. 5; 
the lithe interplay of violists Roland Kato and Laura Kuennen-Poper in the 
finale of No. 6; the grandly assertive oboe of Allan Vogel and the agile 
trumpet of David Washburn in No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 LACO, as we've been told many times of late via the spoken and printed word, 
is a unique and priceless component of our artistic community. On Thursday, its 
most potent spokesmen, it musicians, showed us why. 
</P>
<P>
 The program will be repeated Sunday night at 7:30 at Ambassador Auditorium in 
Pasadena. HERBERT GLASS

DANCE REVIEW; PACIFIC ENSEMBLE DELIVERS A VARIED PROGRAM; THE FIVE-PART 
CONTEMPORARY BILL AT THE BRENTWOOD SCHOOL SHOWCASES FIVE DISTINCTIVE STYLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL, TIMES DANCE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Displaying their versatility by tackling five distinctive contemporary styles 
during a single Thursday program at the Brentwood School, the members of 
Pacific Dance Ensemble also managed to highlight something the choreographers 
had in common: reliance on drastic juxtaposition as a major element in their 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy Perez's company is no longer large enough to perform his 1985 "Fall-Out" 
and Ferne Ackerman's locally based group no longer exists, so the evening 
offered pleasures available nowhere else -- in particular Ackerman's powerful 
new "Perseverance." 
</P>
<P>
 A brilliantly structured whirlwind of a dance, "Perseverance" harnesses the 
dynamism of music by Shostakovich to propel sharply defined yet engulfing 
movement dialogue between four dancers in green and three in orange. This 
physical counterpoint, and the constant changes of level and direction in the 
vocabulary, builds up tremendous force before Ackerman's sly, surprise payoff 
at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Although complemented by Lloyd Rodgers' score, the equally incessant contrasts 
of "Fall-Out" looked less like inspired music visualization than pitiless 
social satire. Here, sleek, identically dressed dancers hurtle through brief 
spasms of activity divided by fearful pauses -- their self-control constantly 
eroding as walking steps turn into rigid marches or woozy staggers. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Goode's clever new "Notes on L" offered a few passages of tidy, academic 
modern dance, but most of the time shaped gestural movement to underscore -- 
and often ironically undercut -- quasi-autobiographical texts spoken in turn by 
each of the five dancers. The subject? Love in all its banal, crazy, 
uncontrollable splendor. 
</P>
<P>
 The same theme informed the inventive 1992 character-based duet, "Deadman," by 
Jeffrey Moore and Shel Wagner. Here the ultimate dysfunctional 
dance-partnership inexorably evolved into the ultimate dysfunctional -- yet 
enduring -- marriage. An antic Derek Penfield and a deadpan Danielle Shapiro 
conveyed the comedy skillfully enough, but the darker edges of need in the work 
remained unexplored. 
</P>
<P>
 A Led Zeppelin suite designed to counter what choreographer Janis Brenner 
calls " '60s-bashing," her new "Ton of Led" seemed to aim for the validating, 
anarchic freedom of Bebe Miller's "Jimi Hendrix Project." Unfortunately, 
Brenner quickly became bogged down in distracting literal pantomime (people 
getting stoned, for instance) that seldom funneled interest into her propulsive 
group dances. 
</P>
<P>
 The dances themselves sometimes quoted period originals and elsewhere adopted 
more recent concepts such as women lifting men. Everything Brenner tried 
clashed with something else and the result kept misfiring or fizzling out. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances continue through Sunday afternoon.

HEY, ACE, HOMOPHOBIA'S NOT SO FUNNY! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "More Giggles Than Groans in 'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective' " (Feb. 4), Chris 
Willman asks who could resist Jim Carrey as Ace Ventura. I know I sure can. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't laugh at characters that behave as though homosexuality is revolting 
and subhuman. There are at least four such "jokes," including one montage where 
Ventura discovers that he has kissed another guy and runs into a shower to 
cleanse himself. Ha, ha, hmmm. 
</P>
<P>
 How unfortunate that even with Hollywood's recent strides toward gay 
tolerance, it still spits out such insulting, insecure "entertainment."

 Carrey is a very talented comedian, which makes his choice of homophobia as a 
comedic element of Ace Ventura so tragic. Carrey says Ace's reaction to having 
kissed a man "is so ridiculous it can't be taken seriously" ("It's Zany and 
Aces With Fans," Feb. 18). Guess again. The clear message that comes across is 
that to be "cool" like Ace includes despising anything remotely homosexual, an 
attitude that leads to discrimination and condones physical violence against 
gays. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the message you put out, Mr. Carrey. Whatever your intentions may 
have been, we gays have Hollywood and you to thank for yet another message of 
hate insidiously buried in an otherwise delightful movie. What a waste, what a 
shame.

LISTEN TO THE RAPPERS

 Years ago Woody Guthrie used the traditional format of the "Talking Blues" to 
create "Talking Dust," "Talking Merchant Marine," "Talking Constitution" to 
express his anti-Establishment views. Later, Vern Partlow wrote "Old Man Atom," 
which ended with ". . . peace on the Earth or the Earth in pieces."Since then, 
many folk singers have used the format to express their own critiques of 
society -- the Vietnam War, the population explosion -- with great effect. 
Notably, these songs have been absent from the airwaves as "subversive" and 
"radical." 
</P>
<P>
 Now we have a new genre called rap, with its more extreme gangsta rap as an 
expression of the black ghettos ("Rap Finds a Supporter in Rep. Maxine Waters," 
Feb. 15), where the failure of society to address the real problems such as 
poverty and dysfunctional families has led to rage, violence and the widespread 
use of drugs. Is it any wonder that gangsta rap has developed as an expression 
of frustration? 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than ban it from the airways and record stores, wouldn't it be much 
more effective to listen to what its practitioners are trying to tell us and 
address the root causes of poverty, inadequate education and lack of 
opportunity? Wouldn't this channel the energy and rage of young people 
constructively? Banning gangsta rap will not make the problems it exposes go 
away!

KISSIN AND COUGHIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't know whether Los Angeles concert audiences are the worst in the world, 
but they are certainly the worst I have ever experienced. At the Yevgeny Kissin 
recital at the Music Center on Feb. 20, the coughing was incessant, signal 
watches and pagers were beeping, cellular phones were ringing, there was 
endless shuffling and, of course, there was the ever-popular Los Angeles 
favorite, inappropriate clapping at every pause. 
</P>
<P>
 This appalling audience etiquette has become the norm and demonstrates a lack 
of respect for both the artists and fellow audience members. If Los Angeles 
wants to be the world-class city culturally that it now pretends to be, its 
audiences are going to have to undergo some behavior modification.

JAZZ ALBUM REVIEW; DUO SWINGS IN A WIDE RANGE OF TEMPOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephanie Haynes-Dave Mackay*** 
</P>
<P>
 "Two on a Swing" 
</P>
<P>
 Why Not Records Stephanie Haynes is a major talent who deserves wider 
recognition. "Two on a Swing" showcases why. The wide range of material on the 
album, from Cole Porter, Antonio Carlos Jobim, Horace Silver, Johnny Mandel and 
Ivan Lins, gives Haynes a chance to display her range and competence no matter 
the tempo or mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans who have seen her locally will realize that she's in especially good 
voice here, working in warm, strong tones that never lose their character 
despite the pitch.  
</P>
<P>
 She doesn't need to rely on stylistic gimmicks but doesn't avoid playful 
slides, wide vibratos or suggestive twists in her voice either. In short, she's 
an intelligent, tasteful singer with a fine vocal instrument. The duo setup 
gives pianist Dave Mackay a role as equal, and he delivers with a host of 
tempos, dynamic treatments and out-of-the tradition style references, including 
boogie, bop and stride. But his major contribution is melodic as he improvises 
with all the lyrical simplicity of a good storyteller. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter's lament "Why Can't You Behave" is given a bluesy, gospel-tinged 
treatment, while "This Heart of Mine" is a swinger that emphasizes Haynes' 
rhythmic smarts. Her narrative skills surface on "Where Do You Start?" as she 
works her way through Marilyn and Alan Bergman's touching lyric with heartfelt 
sincerity. As a further display of her utility, she sings Brazilian Lins' 
sultry "Doce Presenca" in Portuguese. 
</P>
<P>
 The duo's best effort comes on "Get Out of Town," in which her intense, 
somewhat foreboding delivery is supported by Mackay's expanse of shifting 
chords. "Two on a Swing" is one of the best vocal collections in recent memory 
and proves that the jazz singer's craft, though often maligned of late, lives 
on.

ART REVIEW; FOWLER'S 'SANTOS DE PALO' REVEALS ACTS OF DEVOTION; SPIRITUAL 
HUNGER OF PUERTO RICAN WORKERS IS THE FORCE BEHIND THE HAND-CARVED PANTHEON OF 
HOUSEHOLD SAINTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Santos de Palo: The Household Saints of Puerto Rico" at UCLA's Fowler Museum 
of Cultural History should not be missed for the education it provides, the 
sheer affection it inspires, and the lie it gives to the cliche that all folk 
art looks alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by Yvonne Lange for New York's Museum of American Folk Art, it 
includes some 150 small treasures from the collection of Alan Moss Reveron. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first traveling show ever devoted to the religious carvings of the 
island. At a scan, the santos seem to depict the most familiar of Catholic 
themes -- the Nativity, three wise men, Blessed Virgin, Christ crucified. The 
works look quite a bit alike, but reading the slender catalogue reveals that 
their makers don't give a hoot if they look alike because that's not the point. 
The works are made as acts of devotion, not exercises in individuality. 
</P>
<P>
 Puerto Rico was discovered by Christopher Columbus on Nov. 19, 1493, on his 
second sally into the New World. Spain pretty well neglected the island until 
1815 when she decided to squeeze profit out of the property. She prodded her 
own laborers to emigrate and imported African slaves to join the racially mixed 
indigenous population. The black workers wound up in sugar-growing areas along 
the coast; everybody else tended to work on the coffee plantations in the 
uplands. The islands were short on everything from schools to hospitals. To 
make matters worse, churches were few, badly staffed and hard to reach. 
</P>
<P>
 To make up for this, pious workers handy at whittling tried to reproduce 
images from church or religious prints so they could worship at home. They 
often turned their straight razors to the task. The santero is a frank copyist 
who unabashedly uses templates to guide his work. But he makes the templates. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the santos are not blessed, they need not conform to approved 
patterns. Originality seeped through this iconographical crack. Catholicism was 
privatized. This art was largely unknown until 1931 when Dominican friars 
recognized its expressive and aesthetic worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Puerto Rican santero unwittingly followed the same cultural pattern as the 
rest of Colonial Spain. In trying to reproduce Catholic models, he inevitably 
mixed his native tradition and individual skills to produce a unique hybrid. 
Puerto Rican santos don't, for example, look like those of the Hispanic 
Southwest. They lack the ferocity and preoccupation with death that links with 
the Mexican Day of the Dead and harks back to the blood rituals of the Aztec 
and Mayan civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a sweetness and wistful poetry about the Puerto Rican work that is at 
once humbly respectful and intensely intimate in its little turns of 
interpretation. It's attracted to pathetic subjects like "The Most Forsaken 
Soul in Purgatory." It seems to thrive in the intimate format of the niche. In 
one such Cornell-like work, the santero waxes ebullient, lettering, "Viva 
Dios!" the way a revolutionary might shout, "Viva Zapata!" 
</P>
<P>
 If the santero thinks the Blessed Virgin looks nice in a red dress, she gets 
one -- even if scarlet is a carnal color. Santeros have adopted distinctive 
versions of the Marian legend, such as one where a bull's odd behavior uncovers 
a statue of the Virgin buried long ago to save her from profanation by invading 
Moors. 
</P>
<P>
 When a santero gets hold of a kitsch chromolithograph of "The All Powerful 
Hand of Christ," he gives it magic. The Last Supper becomes less a moment of 
tragic drama and more a reverie on generosity with all the figures and all the 
trappings of the table carved with toy-like care and simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fowler folks have added a revealing touch to the show. It reproduces the 
bedroom of Ana Maria Pena, who was a traditional Puerto Rican spiritualist 
healer. There is a simple bentwood rocker, a wooden cross and a hand-made rag 
doll depicting a stereotypical robust black woman. Any multi-culturalist 
inclined to find this offensive should know that such dolls are made out of 
respect and believed to have healing powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Senora Pena's spiritualist altar is also reproduced here. Such altars are kept 
in secluded parts of the house; the whole healers practice is confidential, if 
not secret. The altar is an ecumenical affair with a white cloth, purifying 
water and Catholic images, as well as a powerfully modeled head of a 
brown-skinned man and a red glass Buddha. Evidently, the more various the 
spiritual forces that aid the healer, the better. 
</P>
<P>
 A tableau is the work of Ysamur Flores-Pena, consulting curator for the 
exhibition and a UCLA folklorist. His contribution is educationally edifying. 
It's also impossible to avoid noticing that it's a lovely personal homage to 
his mom. That pretty well sums up the spirit of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 As in other spheres, mass production and mass migration are having their 
effect on Puerto Rico's santeros. The kids are leaving for the mainland; 
production of cute plastic and plaster santos lessens demand. Already these 
acutely personal expressions of faith are turning into trinkets for tourists 
and aesthetic baubles for collectors.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; DALTREY CELEBRATES TOWNSHEND -- SORT OF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA ROBBINS, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Jackson Family fiasco in Las Vegas was muddled by irrelevant guests and 
an inability to stay focused on who was being honored, it was clear from the 
outset of "Daltrey Sings Townshend" Wednesday night that the vocalist was there 
strictly for his own benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with Pete Townshend's refusal to reunite The Who and Daltrey's exclusion 
from the rebirth of "Tommy," the vigorous and trim singer used the occasion of 
his 50th birthday to mount his own post-rock interpretation of Townshend's 
work, complete with a full-fledged Juilliard orchestra and ace electric 
musicians, in a classy upscale setting, Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 (The concert will be available for TV viewers tonight who are willing to pay 
$24.95 or thereabouts. Call you local cable system for details.) 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the pretext of paying homage to the songwriter responsible for his 
rock 'n' roll career (a debt he openly acknowledged), Daltrey didn't press the 
point, leaving Townshend's name out of it until late in the three-hour show, 
when he finally brought the honoree onstage. With 28 Townshend tunes providing 
the evening's music, it was impossible to discern the line between celebration 
and exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Early on, Daltrey's choice of material for himself (roughly half the set) 
included two surprises, delicate songs that actually benefited from the vast 
instrumental array: "Imagine a Man" (from "Who by Numbers") was lovely and 
enriched by the texture of strings, while the gentle "Song Is Over" (from 
"Who's Next") used brass to punch up the song's stirring bridge. Also before 
intermission, Alice Cooper had brash fun with "I'm a Boy" and Lou Reed 
contributed a languorous jazz reading of "Now and Then" from Townshend's recent 
"PsychoDerelict." 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the first segment was awful: an obnoxious Townshend-lite orchestral 
overture, Daltrey's slow lounge-jazz version of "I Can See for Miles," an 
over-arranged "You Better You Bet" that revealed the hoarseness of his upper 
register and "Love, Reign O'er Me" reconfigured as a drippy French film score. 
</P>
<P>
 The hapless renditions of "I Can't Explain" and "Substitute" by the Spin 
Doctors were an embarrassment. Turning "Dr. Jimmy" (from "Quadrophenia") into a 
car wreck of missed notes, Linda Perry -- the 4 Non Blondes singer whom Daltrey 
compared with a straight face to Janis Joplin -- sounded like a contestant in 
an Ann Wilson scream-off. 
</P>
<P>
 But the show's second half got off to a riveting, inspiring start with Eddie 
Vedder of Pearl Jam. Appearing alone onstage with just an electric guitar, he 
brought obvious familiarity and care to stripped-down but letter-perfect 
renditions of "The Kids Are Alright," "Sheraton Gibson" (with excellent finger 
picking) and "My Generation," done in late-'70s Who style, first as a slow 
blues and then a strong rocker. If any real tribute was going to be paid 
Wednesday, Vedder wrote the biggest check. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted by the moronic boos that greeted her, Sinead O'Connor joined Daltrey 
and the Chieftains (with whom Daltrey has previously appeared) for a Gaelic 
variation on "Baba O'Riley," blending her precise and declamatory delivery with 
his slurry rock roar. 
</P>
<P>
 Given Townshend's recent reclamation of his rock opera, Daltrey was unwise to 
delve deeply into "Tommy."

TV REVIEW; 'NORTH AND SOUTH' RISES AGAIN ON ABC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When we last encountered that epic miniseries "North and South," the Civil War 
was just ending and Patrick Swayze and Lesley-Anne Down's antebellum mansion 
Mont Royal was in ashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, eight years later, the inevitable has happened: a second sequel -- ABC's 
"John Jakes' Heaven and Hell: North and South, Part III" (beginning Sunday and 
continuing Monday and Wednesday, at 9 each night on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42). 
</P>
<P>
 The focus this time is on the nation's painful rebirth, the westward movement 
and the bitter legacy of Reconstruction. But don't expect serious history here, 
although a depiction of the sturdy 10th Negro Calvary does lend the story a 
measure of historic responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, this is romance fiction in the tradition of a Harlequin paperback. 
Characters are either very good or very bad, and there's one lovemaking scene 
exceptionally graphic for network TV in which Lesley-Anne Down rips the shirt 
off James Read (returning as the Northern hero George Hazard), digs her nails 
almost into his buttocks and claws up his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Down's plantation widow Madeline Main and Read's Yankee entrepreneur 
George Hazard do fall in love across old enemy lines. The fact that the 
beauteous Down, playing a woman of newfound strength and courage, is almost 10 
years older this time out actually works in her role's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Swayze, a Southern general who played Down's husband in Part II, is 
not back. He's killed off in a patch of fog during the opening credit role by 
that twisted sicko and old West Point nemesis Elkanah Bent (the insidious 
Philip Casnoff, who sneeringly reprises his sociopathic figure). 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the characters, Bent is the most fun, with the possible exception of 
Rip Torn's grinning Native American trader, who leaves the movie unfortunately 
early. Peter O'Toole, of all people, pops up as an alcoholic frontier 
Shakespearean actor in a touch of humorous folklore. But you kind of hate to 
see O'Toole's talents almost self-mocked here. 
</P>
<P>
 The production, adapted from Jakes' novel "Heaven and Hell" by Suzanne 
Clauser, is routinely directed by Larry Peerce and is very choppy, leaving 
story strands dangling all over the screen. Still, "Part III" of the saga of 
the tormented Main and Hazard families mercifully limits itself to six hours. 
The original two parts, which aired the same season (1985-86), stretched 12 
hours apiece. By now the entire opus straddles 30 hours! RAY LOYND

TV REVIEW; REVISITING AN 'ASSAULT AT WEST POINT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to portraying racist characters, television has never been 
reluctant to use extreme examples, such as white-sheeted Klansmen and 
epithet-spewing rednecks. What distinguishes "Assault at West Point" (Sunday at 
8 p.m. on Showtime) is its willingness to intelligently explore a more 
insidious form of racism that often lurks beneath a proper and respectable 
veneer. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in 1880, this real-life drama is centered around a black Army cadet named 
Johnson Whittaker (Seth Gilliam) who is bound, beaten and mutilated by several 
of his West Point classmates. Yet rather than mount a legitimate investigation 
into this nearly fatal attack, the military Establishment decides to 
court-martial Whittaker for allegedly staging the incident. Its claim is that 
the sole black cadet at the academy was trying to avoid taking a philosophy 
exam that, if failed, would have prevented him from graduating. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the inherent drama surrounding the plight of Whittaker, the more 
captivating and socially resonant aspect of this film involves his two defense 
attorneys. Richard Greener (Samuel L. Jackson) is a Harvard-educated black 
lawyer fighting an uphill battle for personal and professional respect. Daniel 
Chamberlain (Sam Waterston) is a prominent white attorney who is unwilling to 
acknowledge his own subtle and sometimes overt prejudices. 
</P>
<P>
 What helps to make Chamberlain such an involving character is his relatively 
strong civil rights background. In the past he's taken stands against slavery 
and, as the governor of South Carolina, he allowed blacks into higher 
education. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Chamberlain's defense of Whittaker lacks moral fiber. In court, 
he portrays him as somewhat cowardly and mentally dull rather than as a victim 
of a hate crime. Chamberlain infers that he's attempting to gain sympathy from 
the five mostly conservative judges. But Greener, in several emotionally 
incisive scenes, exposes Chamberlain as a condescending figure who views blacks 
as being inferior to whites. 
</P>
<P>
 Written and directed by Harry Moses, "Assault at West Point" suffers from some 
stiff dialogue and occasional periods of tedium, but there are enough 
thought-provoking aspects to the drama, as well as a fine performance by 
Waterston, to keep most viewers hooked. JON MATSUMOTO

YOUTH CALLED 911 BEFORE KILLING OFFICER, TAPE SHOWS; VIOLENCE: CHRISTOPHER 
GOLLY TOLD POLICE 'I'LL SEE YOU WHEN YOU GET HERE' AFTER SAYING HE HAD SHOT HIS 
FATHER TO DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moments before killing a rookie police officer, 17-year-old Christopher Golly 
called 911 to say that he had just killed his father and that "I'll see you 
when you get here," according to a dispatcher's tape released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a chilling omen of the bloody ambush that followed, Golly ignored the 
dispatcher's repeated requests to put down his weapon and to stay on the phone 
until police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Golly's call came immediately after a call from a woman who had been in the 
house and had taken a cellular phone outside. 
</P>
<P>
 When Los Angeles police got to the Amestoy Avenue house in Northridge about 
1:20 a.m. Tuesday, the troubled methamphetamine user was hiding outside with a 
loaded AR-15 semiautomatic rifle. He sprayed the three squad cars with bullets, 
killing rookie Officer Christy Lynne Hamilton, 45, with one shot that pierced 
her chest through an armhole of her bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the 911 tape reinforces statements that Golly made to a friend 
hours before the shooting: that he planned to kill his father and then ambush 
officers responding to the crime. The friend told police about Golly's 
statements after the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "In hindsight, knowing what we know now . . . , it appears very ominous," said 
Lt. John Dunkin, a police spokesman. "Knowing now everything that went on, 
(including) his conversation with his friend, it lends a different meaning of, 
'I'll see you when you get here.' It's almost eerie." 
</P>
<P>
 Until they released the 911 tape late Friday, police had not disclosed that 
Golly had tried to make sure the ambush would play out as he planned by calling 
police himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the indications on the tape that an armed killer may have been 
waiting for them, police said they had no idea of the troubled teen-ager's 
intentions to open fire. They continued to defend the tactics of the officers 
who inadvertently pulled up in front of the house, making Hamilton a vulnerable 
target. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said officers responding to the home were aware that someone had been 
shot and that a gunman could still be there. He said officers followed tactical 
procedure, thinking they were stopping several houses away to assess the 
situation before acting or calling in a Special Weapons and Tactics unit.

 Dunkin said Hamilton's slaying was the result of several factors that were 
beyond the control of the responding officers. It was too dark to see the 
numbers on the houses, police said, and the Golly home was on a corner, despite 
the address leading officers to believe it was in the middle of the block, 
where they saw a woman waving to them. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a police helicopter that could have helped authorities see Golly 
hiding behind a brick wall was grounded because of high winds, Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every officer wants to make it home at night. Who in their right mind would 
pull up right in front of a house where there is a guy inside with a gun?" 
Dunkin asked. "They certainly did not do that intentionally." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Michael Albanese, a SWAT unit supervisor, confirmed that department 
policy calls for SWAT members to be called only after patrol officers have 
responded and verified that a gunman is inside a house. 
</P>
<P>
 After patrol officers were deployed and after Hamilton was shot, Albanese said 
he and other SWAT team members were called. Shortly before 6 a.m., SWAT 
officers fired tear gas canisters into the house, entered and found the bodies 
of Golly, who had shot himself to death, and his father, Steven. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 911 call, Golly sounded flippant as he told the police dispatcher what 
he had done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, yes, I'd like to report a murder," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened," the dispatcher asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shot my dad," Golly said, adding that he had thought "it would be nice" to 
shoot him. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked where the gun was, he said: "It's . . . on my shoulder right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispatcher asked him to put the gun down. Golly responded, "Nah." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a Los Angeles Fire Department paramedic is patched into the call. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put the phone down, I mean put the gun down. . . . We're not playing around," 
the paramedic said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right," Golly answered.  
</P>
<P>
 Several minutes later, Golly said: "I'll see you guys." 
</P>
<P>
 The operator asked him to stay on the line and to put the gun where police 
could see it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nah," Golly replied again. "I'll see you guys when you get here." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, no. Chris?" the operator asks. But by then, Golly had hung up. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Golly went to the side of the house and waited for the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton stopped her squad car behind two other police vehicles on Septo 
Street, which intersects with Amestoy in front of the Golly house. Although it 
was not clear if Golly had fired any shots before Hamilton left the car, she 
was crouching behind her door and reaching for a portable police radio when she 
was shot, her father said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Brondell, Hamilton's father, said he has talked to his slain 
daughter's partner about what happened. Brondell, a 30-year LAPD veteran, said 
his daughter had put herself at risk by doing what officers are trained to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if someone is lying there in wait, the officers can't stand a block away 
and wait," Brondell said. "Someone has to move up. It just has to be done."

FORMER DEPUTY DENIES HE PLANNED TO BUY COCAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILES CORWIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy testified Friday that he never 
planned to buy cocaine with $151,000 found in the trunk of his rented car but 
thought the cash was to be used for "money laundering." 
</P>
<P>
 In Rickey Ross' first comments about the case since he was arrested in 1992, 
he testified that he was set up by a government informant, who had promised 
financial assistance and lucrative business opportunities if Ross transported 
the cash for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution contends that Ross, who was in the rented Cadillac with former 
Dodger Derrel Thomas, planned to use the cash in the trunk to purchase 22 
pounds of cocaine. They were arrested April 24, 1992, in a McDonald's parking 
lot during a federal Drug Enforcement Administration sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas has testified against Ross during the trial in exchange for a prison 
sentence of no more than three years. Ross faces up to 11 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross, an 18-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department, was arrested in 1989 for 
allegedly killing three prostitutes, although the charges were dropped. After 
he was released, the Sheriff's Department sent him a termination letter but he 
was later allowed to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross testified Friday that after he left the department, he had trouble 
finding steady work. He said that before his second arrest, he was broke and he 
was facing foreclosure on his Rialto house. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time he was trying to sell to movie production companies the rights to 
his story of being wrongly accused and spending 82 days in a top-security unit 
of the County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 While he was negotiating with several production companies, he testified, he 
ran into an acquaintance at a bar whom he had met years earlier. The man was "a 
real wheeler-dealer," Ross testified. He said he thought the man was in the 
import-export business and had connections with movie production companies. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that the man was an informant for the DEA, a convicted drug 
dealer who was trying to set up sting operations in exchange for a reduced 
prison sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross, 45, testified that the informant promised to lend him $12,000 and help 
him set up a movie and book deal worth up to $500,000 if he would transport a 
shipment of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The former deputy testified that he headed out to an Upland restaurant and met 
an associate of the informant who tossed a gym bag full of money into the trunk 
of the rented car. Ross had rented the car a few days earlier, he said, because 
his car was not running. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed the loan from him to save my house from foreclosure. . . . He told 
me he could get me one hell of a deal with movies and books," Ross said in 
court. "He pressured me to pick up the money and drop it off to him. I thought 
he might be involved in money laundering, not drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas had testified earlier that the informant also promised to set him up 
with movie executives to further his fledgling acting career if he would help 
set up the cocaine deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution contends that Ross ended up in the parking lot of the 
McDonald's, along with Thomas and the informant, with the intention of 
purchasing the 22 pounds of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Jane Winston has said that Ross, who was with several 
undercover DEA agents, opened the trunk, opened the gym bag and displayed the 
stacks of bills. The men eventually returned to the agents' van, Winston said, 
where Ross was shown 10 kilograms of cocaine in a plastic bag. When he removed 
a small folding knife from his back pocket to test the cocaine, she said, he 
was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ross testified that he did not know what was in the plastic bag. After one 
agent attempted to place the bag in his hand, he said, he only used the knife 
"to peek under the flap . . . because curiosity got the best of me." A DEA 
agent, Ross said, "kept trying to get me in the van. He kept saying: 'I want to 
show you something.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked under the flap and said: 'I don't want this. I didn't come here for 
this. . . . You guys got it all wrong.' I turned away and tried to walk away 
from the vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 Winston said she intends to focus on Ross' scenario during her 
cross-examination. "It seems pretty clear" she said in an interview, "that he 
had every intention of sampling the drug and engaging in a narcotics buy." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross testified that a few hours after he was arrested, a detective from the 
San Fernando Police Department, who was working with the DEA on the sting 
operation, talked to him about a lawsuit he had filed against the Los Angeles 
Police Department in 1989. After the murder charges were dropped, Ross filed 
the suit, which is pending, alleging that the LAPD and former Chief Daryl F. 
Gates violated his civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross testified that the San Fernando detective told him that if he dropped the 
suit, "they would drop this case against me." 
</P>
<P>
 Winston later called the story "preposterous."

IMPACT OF MASSACRE FELT IN L.A.; MIDEAST: JEWISH AND MUSLIM LEADERS CONDEMN 
KILLINGS IN HEBRON. THEY CALL FOR AN END TO EXTREMISM AND EXPRESS WORRY THAT 
THE PEACE PROCESS WILL BE THREATENED. 
</P>

<P>
 As Los Angeles awoke Friday, the awful news of the massacre came drifting over 
the airwaves: 48 people killed in a Hebron mosque as they prayed at dawn. 
Perhaps a dozen more in the riots that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 So much bloodshed. Yet another terrible chapter, another horror story, in the 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the hours that followed the news, Jewish and Muslim leaders in Los 
Angeles rose in unison to condemn the killings, to say that terrorism of any 
stripe could not be condoned. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time to play the game fair and talk about Jewish terrorists and Jewish 
fundamentalists as well," said Maher Hathout, spokesman for the Islamic Center 
of Southern California. "We want to fight extremism, all extremism." 
</P>
<P>
 The dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, Rabbi Marvin Hier, joined in 
condemning the massacre and terrorism from any quarter: "Those of us who have 
been in the forefront of condemning terrorism cannot condemn it only when it 
comes from the other side. We have to condemn it in unequivocal terms when it 
comes from our side as well. This was senseless, wanton murder that dishonors 
the principles of Judaism and there is no cause that is worthy of such action." 
</P>
<P>
 It was close to noon Friday when Muslim worshipers began filing through the 
doors of the Islamic Center mosque on Vermont Avenue, answering the call to 
prayers just as the Palestinians of Hebron had only hours earlier. They came 
from a variety of Islamic sects and soon filled the mosque to overflowing. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a special time in the Muslim world, the holy month of Ramadan, devoted 
to fasting and prayer and introspection. Devout Muslims neither eat nor drink 
from sunup to sundown. 
</P>
<P>
 After the recitation of Koranic verses, Hathout stood before the worshipers. 
He said he had planned to talk about generosity, about having unconditional 
love for everyone. But that theme no longer fit the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I find myself forced to talk about a certain kind of love, a love of the 
victim," he said. "Now I find myself forced to talk about a special kind of 
compassion for the murdered and aggrieved. We were awakened by the ugly, 
brutal, criminal act of terrorists when bullets were showered in the mosque in 
Hebron. The floor of the mosque that is always to be kept clean has been 
smothered with the blood of innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
 As Hathout talked, his voice became even more emotional as he spoke about how 
the gunman and his compatriots had been allowed to build their settlements in 
the occupied territories, as well as live in Hebron. He wondered aloud how so 
many people could have been killed without the Israeli army stopping the 
killer. And he bitterly denounced the Israeli government over the number of 
Palestinians killed in the riots after the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 At events throughout Los Angeles, other religious leaders joined in adding 
their condemnation of the massacre, carried out by an American-born doctor who 
lived in a nearby Jewish settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Joel Rembaum, president of the Southern California Board of Rabbis, took 
pains to note that Palestinians have been guilty of their own atrocities in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 "One ought not forget there have been more acts of this kind . . . from the 
other side over the years and as we condemned those, we have to condemn this," 
he said. "Violence begets violence. The only way this can stop is if violence 
can cease and that's why there has to be peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Bleiweiss, editor and publisher of the Jewish Spectator, said the 
fundamentalist group the gunman belonged to is a serious threat to the peace 
process between Israelis and Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't a clue as to how to solve it," he said. "(The problem) is not a 
divided middle but the religious extremists on both sides. In a free country, 
you cannot stop a terrorist if he wants to kill somebody, even with strong 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 "The peace process represents the best chance in 100 years. Jews and Arabs 
have been killing each other since 1891 when the first waves of Zionists came 
back to Palestine. If (negotiators) don't do it this time, it could well mean 
another 100 years of war." 
</P>
<P>
 The local chapter of the American Jewish Congress also condemned the radical 
Jewish organization and said it was a mistake on the part of the Israelis to 
allow "fevered right-wing Jewish radicals to settle in the midst of" a place 
like Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 "One must expect that people who regularly and publicly preach hateful, racist 
doctrines, when allowed to run around freely heavily armed with Uzis, will 
finally act on their ugly convictions," said Rabbi Laura Geller, executive 
director of the American Jewish Congress Pacific Southwest Region. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmed El-Gabalawy, spokesman for the Islamic Center of Northridge, the largest 
Muslim congregation in the San Fernando Valley, said the reaction there had 
been -- like everywhere else -- one of shock and outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ironically, in evening prayers at the mosque last night we recited the part 
of the Koran that talks about how Jerusalem is sacred to both Muslims and Jews 
-- and last night this happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer John Dart contributed to this story.

4 SUPERVISORS RUN OFFICES INTO THE RED; FINANCES: ONLY GLORIA MOLINA IS 
EXPECTED TO COMPLY WITH $1.2-MILLION LIMIT ON STAFF SALARIES. MIKE ANTONOVICH 
WILL SPEND $1.9 MILLION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some senior county government officials are running their offices woefully 
over budget, but the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has done little to 
rein them in. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because it is the supervisors who are the budget busters. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the five supervisors are projected to spend significantly more on 
their staffs this year than was budgeted, according to a report from the 
board's executive officer. Only Supervisor Gloria Molina is projected to 
complete the fiscal year ending June 30 under budget, with a cushion of about 
$107,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Mike Antonovich, the biggest spender on the board, is projected to 
be more than 50%, or $730,000, over budget by the time the fiscal year ends 
June 30, according to Executive Officer Larry Monteilh. He projected the yearly 
deficits based on the supervisors' expenditures through the first half of the 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Ed Edelman is projected to be $373,000 over budget, Deane Dana is 
forecast to be $257,000 over and Yvonne Brathwaite Burke is running $239,000 in 
the red. 
</P>
<P>
 Under tightened spending rules adopted last summer, the supervisors must for 
the first time live within a fixed budget when it comes to staff. Each 
supervisor was allocated $1.2 million annually for staff salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 These staff funds, which constitute a small part of the board's overall 
expenses, are among the few budgets directly controlled by the supervisors. 
Monteilh controls most of the $30-million budget for the executive office and 
other support functions for the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Although four supervisors are running their office budgets in the red, they 
have little concern about being able to pay the bills. The supervisors each 
have four other accounts that they can tap to cover their deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 They are given $385,000 for special events and programs and $33,400 for office 
furnishings, plaques, picture framing and travel. The board members also have 
allocated themselves $250,000 in so-called discretionary funds that they may 
use for just about any purpose, but were primarily intended to help local 
charities and other community organizations and programs, according to 
Monteilh. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors have still another special account they can tap for extra 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called budget deliberation discretionary fund is a $750,000-a-year fund 
that the supervisors are supposed to use for special programs in the districts, 
including community organizations, school groups and reward funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Herb Wesson, chief of staff for Burke, said that her office has recently laid 
off several workers and others were transferred in an effort to reduce the 
payroll. "We are determined to do anything and everything we can to come in 
under budget," Wesson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Geoghegan, chief deputy to Edelman, said the supervisor believes he has 
the authority to spend all the funds available as he sees fit. "We believe we 
are well within the budget allocation allotted to our district," Geoghegan 
said. He said that every supervisor's office has different needs and will spend 
its money accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Other supervisors' offices did not return calls seeking comment on the 
spending report. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich will have to tap all of the accounts available to him to pay his 
staff bill of more than $1.9 million, according to the executive officer's 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich, a four-term incumbent representing parts of the San Fernando, San 
Gabriel and Antelope valleys, was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Antonovich has argued that his office expenses are higher because 
of the size of his district -- at 2,854 square miles, it is about twice the 
size of Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Howver, most of the area is unpopulated state and federal forest and desert 
parklands. All supervisors have about the same number of residents in their 
districts, about 1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich said he must operate five field offices to properly attend to his 
constituents. But Dana staffs eight offices at a significantly lower cost. 
Burke and Edelman have three field offices apiece and Molina operates two 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich's expenses are higher mostly because he has more employees, and 
they are generally higher paid than those in other supervisors' offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich has 36 full-time employees compared to 27 for Burke and 24 apiece 
for Molina, Edelman and Dana. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich has 16 employees earning more than $50,000 a year, compared to 15 
for Edelman, 13 for Dana, 10 for Burke and six for Molina. 
</P>
<P>
 The highest-paid employee on any supervisor's staff is Antonovich's chief of 
staff, Tom Silver, who is paid $107,219 annually. Molina's chief of staff is 
paid $62,143 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 County Chief Administrative Officer Sally Reed said she was not particularly 
concerned about the supervisors going over budget because they have the 
alternative accounts to cover the deficits. But she added that next year the 
supervisors, like every other county department, will have to contend with 
budget cuts.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: INGLEWOOD; COMEDIAN 
GARRETT MORRIS LISTED IN STABLE CONDITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comedian Garrett Morris was listed in serious but stable condition Friday at 
Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, where he had undergone surgery 
for gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 A bullet remained lodged near his spinal cord and will probably be surgically 
removed soon, although Morris is not paralyzed, Dr. Randy Hawkins told 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's fortunate he did not have more severe injuries," said Hawkins, who 
described the actor as awake and alert. 
</P>
<P>
 The bullet pierced Morris' lower left arm and continued into his abdomen, 
damaging his small and large intestine, aorta and stomach before lodging in the 
spinal canal, Hawkins said. He characterized the arm wound as probably minor 
and the abdominal injuries as serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Morris' wife, Freda, briefly addressed reporters at the hospital news 
conference to thank her husband's supporters for their prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband is the most fortunate person," Morris said. "This is an 
unfortunate thing that can happen anywhere. I'm just sorry that it happened at 
all."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; COURT 
UPHOLDS BAN ON DEVELOPING ANCIENT SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Court of Appeal this week upheld a Superior Court ruling that 
temporarily blocked Cal State Long Beach from developing a university-owned 
parcel of land considered sacred to Native Americans.  
</P>
<P>
 University officials last year unveiled preliminary plans to build shops and 
faculty housing on the 2.2-acre site, which was once inhabited by the 
Gabrielinos and is revered as the birthplace of their deity.Those plans were 
stymied when Native Americans protested and sued the university, saying that 
the development would desecrate a holy site. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Stephen E. O'Neil agreed, and in September prohibited the 
university from excavating the site until a hearing could determine the 
cultural and historical value of the land. The university appealed the ruling, 
arguing that a state law protecting sacred Native American sites was 
unconstitutional because it favored a particular religion. A final trial date 
has not been set.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; LYLE 
MENENDEZ'S LAWYERS EXPECTED TO LEAVE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Both of Lyle Menendez's attorneys are expected to announce at a Superior Court 
hearing Monday that they will not defend the elder Menendez brother on murder 
charges in his second trial. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, at which Judge Stanley M. Weisberg will set a new trial date, 
chief defense lawyer Jill Lansing, 47, is expected to say she wants to spend 
more time with a young daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Burt, 41, who works for the San Francisco public defender's office and 
was appointed to the Menendez case to back up Lansing, is booked the next few 
months at death penalty cases in the Bay Area. He could not be reached Friday 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez, 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, are charged with murder in the 1989 
shotgun slayings of their parents. After six months of trial, separate juries 
were unable last month to reach verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Abramson, Erik Menendez's lead defense attorney, recently filed legal 
papers asking to be appointed -- at county expense -- as Erik Menendez's 
lawyer, saying he is indigent.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE; MEDICAL 
CENTER OFFERS TO BUY SOUTH BAY HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A major Torrance-based medical center is offering to purchase financially 
struggling South Bay Hospital in Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the publicly owned 203-bed South Bay Hospital would be 
consolidated with the 374-bed Little Company of Mary Hospital, a nonprofit 
Catholic facility in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be one hospital on two sites," said James C. Lester, president of 
Little Company of Mary Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal will be taken up next Thursday by the board of the Beach Cities 
Health District, the public agency that owns South Bay Hospital but leases it 
to American Medical International, a commercial national chain. 
</P>
<P>
 District board member Ken Johnson said South Bay Hospital was hurt by the loss 
of a major health care contract. He said the board wants to protect itself 
financially while assuring that the hospital stays open to serve Redondo Beach, 
Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consolidation makes sense on a lot of counts," Johnson said. "We're going to 
have to take a good look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 Little Company of Mary Hospital affiliated in late 1992 with San Pedro 
Peninsula Hospital, reflecting a national trend as hospitals try to cope with 
shorter patient stays and other changes in the health care field.

WARDEN OUSTED AT TROUBLED STATE PRISON IN LANCASTER; CORRECTIONS: OFFICIALS 
ORDER OTIS THURMAN TO RETIRE OR ACCEPT A DEMOTION. FOUR ESCAPES, INCLUDING ONE 
BY A CONVICTED MURDERER, HAVE PLAGUED THE YEAR-OLD PRISON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a surprise move, officials have told the warden at the state prison in 
Lancaster either to retire or accept a demotion -- probably the result of a 
series of problems that have plagued the year-old prison, including the escapes 
of a convicted murderer and three other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "The California Department of Corrections has made a decision to restructure 
the management team (at the Lancaster prison). . . . Otis Thurman, warden, has 
yet to determine which options available to him would be in his best interest 
and has decided to take some time off," said a brief statement issued Friday by 
state prison officials.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No other details were released, but several members of the prison's citizens 
advisory committee said they were told that Thurman's options were to retire -- 
after more than three decades as a Corrections Department employee -- or accept 
a demotion and be transferred to another institution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was notified Thursday the warden was being asked to take a demotion and/or 
retire," said Jake Maeders, a committee member. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden shake-up also includes the demotion and transfer of Thurman's 
second in command at the 4,000-inmate prison. Chief Deputy Warden Alex 
Marmolejo has been reassigned to an associate warden's position at the state 
prison in Tehachapi, state officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Advisory committee members said they were given little information and were 
surprised that Thurman was being replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But committee member George Root, a Lancaster councilman, said he wasn't 
surprised. "I think (Thurman's) problem was he was too laid-back," Root said. 
"I'm really happy the Department of Corrections saw fit to remove the warden 
and his deputy as a first step to reorganization of the management staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Root and other advisory committee members said the shake-up is the result of 
the four escapes, including that of two maximum security inmates, and other 
problems that have occurred since the prison opened Feb. 1, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The first escapes occurred five months after the prison opened. On July 2, two 
minimum-security inmates, one serving time for burglary and the other for 
robbery, walked away from their barracks. Both were recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 5, convicted murderer Eric Rene Johnson escaped from the 
maximum-security unit. Johnson, serving a life sentence without the possibility 
of parole, was seen about five hours after his escape at a Lancaster 
convenience store, a few miles from the prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's escape triggered an uproar in the community. Prison officials waited 
more than two hours after they suspected the escape to notify the local 
sheriff's station. The Lancaster City Council was not told for more than 12 
hours, after Johnson was recaptured. 
</P>
<P>
 The escape and how it was handled led community leaders to abandon plans to 
support the construction of a second state prison in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 13, Steven Charles Brigida, a maximum-security inmate, escaped by 
hiding in a garbage bin. He was dumped with the trash into a truck and later 
deposited at a Lancaster landfill. The prisoner, who was serving a sentence of 
life plus eight years for attempted murder, suffered broken ribs.  
</P>
<P>
 The prison and Thurman have been criticized for failing to keep the community 
informed about the escapes. And members of the citizens advisory committee have 
become frustrated by their inability to pass on information to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports on investigations into the escapes have not been released. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to have openness," said James Lott, advisory committee chairman. "We 
cannot have a perception they're hiding things at the prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Banks, a correctional officer at the prison, said that employee morale 
has been low since word of Thurman's departure spread. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know he was well-liked," said Banks, president of the local 
chapter of the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks is skeptical that the shake-up will reduce escapes. "New management 
won't make a difference. Nothing's foolproof; you try to do all the security 
measures you can."

AL MARTINEZ: THE MEN AT THE OFFICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His name is Juan Carlos Ruiz. He's a husky, 30-year-old Latino who doesn't 
expose himself, bother little children or urinate on street corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask him if he does those things and he feels insulted. "Do you?" he demands, 
and when you shake your head no, he replies, "Then why do you think I would?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it's because he's got, you know, brown skin and talks funny. It's 
because he's Mexican. It's because he's one of those day laborers you see 
trying to hustle work on street corners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need food and I need rent money, but I don't break the law," Juan Carlos 
will tell you proudly. "I'm here to work." 
</P>
<P>
 That's no crime. Not yet. But if L.A. County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite 
Burke has her way, it will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke is proposing a law that would criminalize what Juan Carlos Ruiz and 
hundreds of others throughout the county are doing: soliciting jobs on street 
corners. 
</P>
<P>
 She's responding to complaints from residents in Ladera Heights who just don't 
want the men there. Forget that they're trying to survive. Forget that they 
vehemently deny doing the kinds of things they're accused of. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say we're gambling," Juan Carlos says. "You know what that consists of?" 
</P>
<P>
 He takes a nickel from his pocket and flips it into the air. "We toss coins," 
he says incredulously. "We toss nickels to pass the time!" 
</P>
<P>
 Do they, as accused, begin drinking about noon and stay drunk half the day? 
Juan Carlos shakes his head and waves the question off with a broad gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't," he finally says with a sigh. "We have to stay sober to watch for 
immigration agents." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They call their corner at Slauson and Fairfax avenues "the office," and 
they're usually there from about 7 a.m. until 4 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 They've become a family of men, good friends who help each other get by in 
difficult times. Recently they came up with $60 in donations to help a fellow 
worker injured in an automobile accident. 
</P>
<P>
 This at a time when even the nickels they toss are hard to come by, earned 
with picks and shovels and the sweat of their brow. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke's ordinance, delayed 45 days for review, would end all that. It's not 
because most of them aren't good people, she told me the other day. It's just 
that some of them ruin it for others. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, Burke is another example of a legislator unwittingly pandering to a 
rising incidence of hatred directed toward Latinos. Rooted in the recession, it 
has come to embrace not only illegal immigrants, but anyone with brown skin, 
whether or not he's on the public dole. 
</P>
<P>
 Those we dignify as homeless are free to beg at whatever street corner they 
choose, sleep in any doorway available and piss in any park. You want drunks or 
addicts, try wandering among these people. But get the Latinos off the street 
corners. 
</P>
<P>
 I've tried a dozen or more times to hire homeless whites to do light yardwork 
for $6 an hour and haven't had a taker yet, despite the signs they hold 
offering to labor for food. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll find them on street corners too, often with small children, in a bid 
for sympathy that opens wallets and empties pockets . . . without ever swinging 
a pick or lifting a load. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I dislike being an advocate for any group, despite my surname. I don't speak 
Spanish, I don't live in a barrio, frijoles don't turn me on and I'll be damned 
if I'll ever sing "La Cucaracha" in a crowded cantina. 
</P>
<P>
 But this isn't a question of ethnic defense. It's a question of human decency. 
</P>
<P>
 I never expected that L.A., its history rooted in Hispanic culture, would be 
mean in an effort to solve or explain economic problems that immigrants had 
little or nothing to do with. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans didn't plunge this country into financial chaos. Nicaraguans didn't 
shut down the defense industry. Salvadorans didn't chase General Motors out of 
the Valley. Peruvians don't control pork-barrel politics. 
</P>
<P>
 But I hear everyone from Bill Clinton to Pete Wilson damn the immigrants. I 
hear Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer damn the immigrants. I hear City 
Council members damn the street vendors. And now I hear Yvonne Brathwaite Burke 
damn the day laborers. Even in disaster, the hard voices rise: no long-term 
earthquake assistance for illegals, they cry. To hell with compassion. To hell 
with mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to be a Latino to sense the hatred, but the men at the office 
are feeling it the most, and the pain is intense. 
</P>
<P>
 A Nicaraguan day laborer in my community, where they are also under attack, 
said it best when he said, "They're turning the lights out on us." 
</P>
<P>
 He was talking about the lamp beside the golden door.

5,000 WHITE MALES BARRED FROM TAKING L.A. FIREFIGHTERS EXAM; HIRING: CITY IS 
LIMITING APPLICANTS BECAUSE OF FEDERAL CONSENT DECREE SIGNED IN 1974 TO 
INCREASE THE NUMBER OF MINORITIES IN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 More than 5,000 white applicants for firefighters jobs will not be permitted 
to take today's exam to join the Los Angeles Fire Department because of a 
federal consent decree aimed at increasing minority representation on the 
force, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 8,000 people are expected to flock to Fairfax High School to take the 
Civil Service test, the first one offered in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have been blocked, predominantly white men, are criticizing the 
process as being unfair. They have been threatening lawsuits, calling City 
Council members for aid, and planning to picket outside the test site. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son has 2,500 volunteer hours with the Fire Department," said Nicole 
Minitello of Woodland Hills, whose 20-year-old son, Frank, will not be 
permitted to take the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "He works for an ambulance company and is a certified (emergency medical 
technician). He wants to become a firefighter so badly but he can't. He's the 
wrong race." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say their hands are tied by a 1974 agreement with the U.S. 
Department of Justice that mandates that half of those hired be black, Latino 
or Asian American to compensate for historical inequities in hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 The decree was amended in 1981 to allow officials to limit the percentage of 
white applicants in order to achieve the 50% minority figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Because city budget problems resulted in a long delay in hiring, there is a 
large number of applicants. Among whites men, only those who applied for the 
test before the middle of 1989 are eligible -- while all minority applicants 
who applied before today's test date will be admitted to the exam, according to 
Faye Washington, the city's general manager for personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We agree that it is unfortunate that (some talented) candidates . . . are not 
able to take the firefighter exam each time it is given," Washington said in a 
memo. "However, the city is obligated to follow the dictates of the consent 
decree it approved and signed." 
</P>
<P>
 Whites who are not eligible for today's test will be put on the list for the 
next test, although that could be years away. 
</P>
<P>
 Whites make up about 63% of the estimated 3,000 city firefighters, down from 
about 96% in 1975. Whites make up about 45% of the city's overall work force. 
</P>
<P>
 The consent decree does not apply to women, who are also underrepresented on 
the force. There is a separate but equally controversial effort to boost the 
hiring of women, including a special paid exercise program designed to assist 
female applicants with the physical abilities test. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefighters' union, United Firefighters Local 112, has received more than 
50 calls from white male applicants seeking the union's assistance, officials 
said, adding that they could offer little help. 
</P>
<P>
 "The union doesn't have any standing on this," union President Ken Buzzell 
said. "These applicants are not city employees. We can be sympathetic but 
that's about all."

ALLEGED CHECKS TO COUNCILMAN INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four former aides to Los Angeles Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr. were asked 
Friday by the city Ethics Commission to detail allegations that political 
contributions were brought to the freshman councilman's office several times 
last year in violation of campaign reform laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, it was learned that the district attorney's office has contacted 
at least three former Svorinich aides about their allegations of campaign 
violations. Those set to be interviewed by district attorney's officials 
include Svorinich's former chief deputy, John Vidovich, who previously spoke to 
city ethics officials, and Brian Hannon, a former aide to the councilman who is 
scheduled to talk to an Ethics Commission investigator next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Another former Svorinich aide, who declined to be identified, said he has 
already has spoken to the district attorney's Special Investigations Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Ethics Commission and the district attorney declined 
comment on whether they have launched inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Svorinich, Tom Kruesopon, said the councilman had not been 
informed of any investigation by either the city or the district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The requests for interviews came after a report by The Times that five former 
Svorinich aides said they saw campaign contributions brought to his San Pedro 
district office last year despite a ban on such activity in city offices. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the aides also said he saw the councilman holding an envelope in that 
office that contained thousands of dollars in campaign checks from a business 
based in Ft. Worth and some of its employees -- checks that Svorinich's office 
initially denied receiving. After inquiries by The Times, Svorinich filed a 
campaign finance statement this week reporting $1,400 in contributions from the 
company and six of its employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Svorinich has denied any improprieties in accepting or reporting 
contributions, although he has said one aide inadvertently received an envelope 
of campaign checks shortly after he took office last year. At the time, 
Svorinich has said, the aide was unaware it was illegal to accept political 
donations at a city office.

DIARY OFFERS A PEEK INTO COMMUNAL SOCIETY; HISTORY: RECENTLY OPENED ARCHIVES 
PROVIDE MATERIAL FOR BOOKS ON THE ONEIDA COMMUNITY OF CHRISTIAN PERFECTIONISTS, 
A 19TH-CENTURY EXPERIMENT IN GROUP LIVING, SOCIALIST INDUSTRY AND IDIOSYNCRATIC 
SEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Victor Hawley yearned to father a child, but the "breeding committee" said no. 
Instead, his beloved Mary Jones was impregnated by the son of the commune's 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds like the far-fetched plot of some futuristic soap opera. But it's a 
page out of American history. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawley was one of 300 people who lived in the Oneida Community, a group of 
Christian Perfectionists led by John Humphrey Noyes. Hawley wrote of his 
tormented love affair in a diary in 1877, as Oneida was nearing the end of its 
30-year adventure in group living, socialist industry and idiosyncratic sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarded as the most successful of 19th-Century America's 40 or so utopian 
communes, Oneida has long intrigued social historians. A dozen books have been 
written about the community, which was born in an era of religious zeal and 
ultimately evolved into the world's largest silverware company, Oneida Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 The two latest books are Spencer Klaw's "Without Sin," published last 
September by Penguin Books, and Robert S. Fogarty's "Special Love, Special 
Sex," to be published in June by Syracuse University Press. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawley's diary is the basis for the book by Fogarty, a history professor at 
Antioch College who has written extensively on utopian communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The charismatic Noyes brought his disciples to this rural spot 100 miles west 
of Albany in 1848. At the time, religious revivals were so hot in western New 
York that the region was nicknamed the "burned-over district."  
</P>
<P>
 The Perfectionists set out to create a new Eden on Oneida Creek. They built an 
imposing brick edifice called the Mansion House, where they strove to live 
without sin, selflessly sharing everything: work, play, intellectual studies, 
Bible readings, housework, child-rearing and sexual partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Monogamous marriage, which might pit a couple's interests against those of the 
group, was replaced by "complex marriage." All were as one family. Children 
were raised communally, apart from their mothers, who might otherwise develop 
an "idolatrous" love for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaw recounts how Oneida girls ceremoniously burned their favorite dolls to 
overcome the "doll-spirit," a form of "graven image" worship that distracted 
from studies.  
</P>
<P>
 Hard work was a major theme at Oneida. The commune supported itself by 
farming, canning fruits and vegetables, and making silk thread, travel bags, 
brooms, chains, rustic seats, silver spoons and, most profitably, steel animal 
traps. 
</P>
<P>
 Sex was also a big part of life at Oneida. Noyes encouraged free and vigorous 
sex within the community, comparing it to religious ecstasy. 
</P>
<P>
 There were rules, however. One was "male continence," requiring men to avoid 
sexual climax as a means of birth control. 
</P>
<P>
 Another rule involved what Noyes called "ascending fellowship." Young people 
were paired sexually with their elders for spiritual benefits. Noyes took on 
the duty of initiating virgins, as young as 13, into the "complex marriage.' 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest rule for Hawley, a dental assistant, was the one forbidding 
"special love." To prevent such romantic attachments, a committee cleared all 
sexual liaisons and kept people circulating. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Noyes became interested in "scientific breeding" to create a 
spiritually superior race. In 1869, he initiated the only major eugenics 
experiment undertaken in America. Noyes himself sired nine of the 58 
"stirpicults," as he termed the children born of committee-approved parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The community disbanded in 1881, after an aging Noyes fled to Canada, fearing 
arrest on adultery and fornication charges. By then, the religious zeal that 
sustained the community had waned, internal disputes had arisen, and no strong 
leader emerged to replace the messianic Noyes. 
</P>
<P>
 The dissolved community's assets were formed into a joint-stock company, now 
Oneida Ltd., which boasts the most-recognized name in silverware. 
</P>
<P>
 Oneida Ltd. was a true family business for decades after the commune 
disbanded, led by sons of Noyes and other former commune members. Today, there 
are few commune descendants among the corporate brass, who stress inventiveness 
and productivity rather than sex when asked about the old community. 
</P>
<P>
 Klaw, a magazine writer who lives in Connecticut, says thousands of Oneida 
documents were burned in the 1940s. Copies of those records, kept by a nephew 
of Noyes, have recently been made available to researchers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Victor Hawley and Mary Jones, they left Oneida after he nursed her 
through an agonizing pregnancy that ended in stillbirth. They married, had five 
children, and lived on their own, outside the embrace of Eden.

CLAIMS ABOUT 2 'UNOFFICIAL' GOSPELS STIR CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From The Washington Post

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the better part of 2,000 years, Christians have had four official sources 
on the life and words of Jesus: the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John in 
the New Testament. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, as Christianity approaches its third millennium, some scholars say 
the faithful should add two to the list: the gospel of Thomas and the so-called 
gospel of "Q." 
</P>
<P>
 Both documents, whose texts date to Christianity's early days, contain many of 
Jesus' well-known sayings, but not much action, lacking mention of a virgin 
birth, Crucifixion or resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence suggests "another kind of early Christianity back there," that 
eventually lost out to what became the mainstream faith, said Stephen J. 
Patterson, professor of New Testament at Eden Theological Seminary in St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The only full copy of Thomas ever found was discovered 50 years ago in an 
Egyptian village; it begins by saying it contains Jesus' "secret sayings." No Q 
manuscript has ever been found (although some swear there must be a copy buried 
somewhere). Instead, Q is a reconstructed text, pieced together by scholars 
analyzing passages in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke that appear highly 
similar. 
</P>
<P>
 Some scholars say Q and, to a degree, Thomas help portray Jesus as a kind of 
wandering sage, telling parables about God's kingdom, concerned mainly about 
the present day and not much interested in a Last Judgment -- all in sharp 
contrast to the Christ who preaches of a coming apocalypse in Matthew, Mark and 
Luke. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's at stake here is nothing less than the preaching of Jesus himself," 
Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such opinions are not widely shared among scholars and clergy. The resulting 
controversy is ironic, given that Thomas and Q have long been very obscure 
texts. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, editions of Thomas and Q are for sale in bookstores, while 
some scholars turn up on radio talk shows, saying the ancient texts hold a key 
to Christianity's origins. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, the documents have been published in a book titled "The Lost 
Gospel," by New Testament scholar Burton Mack, which details a theory about Q, 
and another book, "The Five Gospels," which places Thomas alongside Matthew, 
Mark, Luke and John, written by a group of scholars called the Jesus Seminar. 
(The latter book has a provocative format: a color-coded analysis of Jesus' 
words, which appear in red if the seminar thinks Jesus actually made the 
statement; black if they think it was the work of early Christian editors; pink 
or gray if somewhere in between.) 
</P>
<P>
 In some academic circles, the response has been critical, particularly among 
scholars who say that Mack and the seminar want mainly to popularize flashy 
theories about early Christianity outside scholarship's mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 "The success of this work is the success of marketing. It's not the success of 
peer review," said Luke Timothy Johnson, professor of New Testament at Emory 
University's Candler School of Theology in Atlanta. "It's like a pharmaceutical 
company working up a medication and selling directly at the drug store and not 
going through testing." 
</P>
<P>
 Others raise another warning, saying that what Jesus preached was settled over 
time long ago by church authorities, who decided what would go into the canon, 
the official books of the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me the canon is the property of the church," not something 
scholars can challenge by asking equal time for other texts, said Cecil M. 
Robeck, associate professor of church history at Fuller Theological Seminary in 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Michael W. Duggan, a Gaithersburg, Md., priest who has taught adult 
Bible classes for the past 17 years, said Thomas and Q were not considered 
official gospels for good reason. "The reason I would say they are not in the 
canon is they do not focus on the central event of the New Testament, the death 
and resurrection of Jesus." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Thomas' gospel contains no narrative, just 114 sayings attributed to 
Jesus. Some are familiar. Jesus recites part of the Beatitudes ("Blessed are 
the poor . . . ") and warns against tossing pearls before swine, as he does in 
the New Testament Gospels. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Thomas, Jesus also tells his disciples to say they "come from the 
light" and are "its children." Odder still, he talks about teaching a female 
follower to be male in spirit: "For every female who makes herself male will 
enter the domain of Heaven." (In "The Five Gospels," the Jesus Seminar color 
codes these passages black, meaning it thinks Jesus did not actually say them.) 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' gospel reflects the influence of Gnostics, a heretical sect within 
early Christianity, who turned orthodox teaching on its head. Gnostics believed 
they lived in a corrupt world created by an evil god; some regarded the serpent 
in the Adam and Eve story as sent by a good god to bring enlightenment to the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Scholars long knew of Thomas only through references in other Christian 
writings. But in 1945, a 1,600-year-old manuscript was found in Egypt. Jesus 
Seminar members say it may be based on an older version of the text, dating to 
the mid-1st Century, making it one of the earliest Christian documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery has encouraged scholars who study Q. 
</P>
<P>
 The process by which Q came to be known goes back 150 years when scholars 
began comparing similar passages in Matthew's and Luke's Gospels. Some, they 
decided, came from Mark's Gospel, usually considered the oldest of the New 
Testament Gospels, first written around 70 A.D. 
</P>
<P>
 But researchers also found shared passages in Matthew and Luke that did not 
appear in Mark. This material they named Quelle, German for "source," later 
shortened to Q. Some scholars (but by no means all) believe the Q material was 
a separate document that Matthew and Luke drew upon. 
</P>
<P>
 When it is presented as such -- as the "Gospel of Q" -- it is a quick read, 
familiar to anyone who knows Matthew and Luke. Jesus praises the poor, teaches 
love for one's enemies and speaks in parables about God's kingdom. But much is 
missing -- no mention of 12 apostles, for example.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The personal library and archives of the late Marija Gimbutas, considered the 
world's leading researcher on the goddess tradition of Old Europe, will soon be 
part of the Center for the Study of Depth Psychology, an independent research 
center on the campus of the Pacifica Graduate Institute in Carpinteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The provocative findings of Gimbutas, a UCLA professor emeritus of archeology, 
fired debate among scholars -- but her four decades of research into Stone Age 
cultures convinced many experts that her thesis is valid. She concluded that 
during the Neolithic period (roughly 10,000 BC to 4,000 BC) people worshiped 
female deities and women enjoyed slightly higher status than men. In all that 
time, the area known as Old Europe (Eastern Europe and Turkey) knew no war, had 
no military class and maintained near-equality between sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lithuanian-born scholar integrated paleontology, linguistics, history, 
mythology and folklore in her richly illustrated books, which were read by many 
non-academics. Her last work was "The Civilization of the Goddess," published 
in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Mythologist David L. Miller, the Watson-Ledden professor of religions at 
Syracuse University, said, "The addition of Marija Gimbutas' papers makes 
Pacifica a resource for some of the finest comparative study in ancient 
mythology." 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that the Pacifica archives already contain the library of the 
late historian and philosopher Joseph Campbell, a preeminent mythologist, and 
will also receive the library and papers of James Hillman, a prominent Jungian 
psychology theorist, practitioner and author. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute, founded in 1974, grants advanced degrees in mythological 
studies, counseling psychology and clinical psychology. "It is one of the two 
or three places in the country where one can seriously . . . combine an 
interest in the humanities and psychotherapy," Miller said. Study of the 
humanities involves the serious academic examination of religions and 
mythologies, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Gimbutas, who died three weeks ago at the age of 73 at the UCLA Medical 
Center, theorized that religion was pervasive in Old European culture -- one in 
three city dwellings was a shrine. All the shrines and burial sites are 
decorated with paintings, figures and reliefs of goddesses. Decorations on 
storage bins and ovens offer clues that grain offerings, not animal sacrifices, 
were made to goddesses, Gimbutas wrote, and the baking of bread was considered 
sacred. The utter absence of weapons, warfare or evidence of violent modes of 
death in burial grounds throughout Old Europe was striking. 
</P>
<P>
 This peaceful state of affairs lasted, she maintained, until marauding 
Indo-Europeans invaded the region beginning in the 4th millennium BC, bringing 
weapons and worship of warlike gods with them. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Karen Jo Torjesen, the Margo L. Goldsmith professor of women's 
studies and religion at the Claremont Graduate School, Gimbutas 
"single-handedly recovered a whole world of religious symbolism -- the female 
expression of the divine in Old Europe -- that is inspiring and moving to 
contemporary women. Most people don't realize that these goddess religions are 
as much a part of our European heritage as are the religious and political 
beliefs of the ancient Greeks."

FINDING COMFORT AND JOY WITHOUT RELIGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am an atheist. Obviously, George H. Gallup Jr. and Robert Bezilla 
("Importance of Religious Beliefs Grows as Americans Age," Feb. 19) are 
not.Their article gives the impression that a cultural factor, such as a belief 
in a religion, is central to finding comfort and happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 We nonbelievers enjoy our declining years as much as any, becoming ever more 
confirmed in our rationality. Perhaps that is why one finds so many older 
people at free-thought functions.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for the article regarding Ramadan (Feb. 12). It demonstrates that 
The Times has and continues to strive to report on Islam in a fair and 
objective manner.This is particularly important as the religion of Islam is 
still often misunderstood and misrepresented. I am convinced that God will 
bless those that seek to promote understanding and peace between the 
monotheistic religions (Islam, Judaism and Christianity) in this life and the 
next. Wouldn't it be a far better world?

MAHONY'S REFLECTIONS ON GOD, EARTHQUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: "Quake a Sign of God's Wrath, Clergy Say No," by Times Religion Writer 
Larry Stammer (Jan. 24): 
</P>
<P>
 When Mr. Stammer asked his question, "Is the quake a sign from God?" Cardinal 
Roger Mahony is quoted as responding "God does not deal with us like that." 
Surely this answer is incomplete at best. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem if our behavior is of interest to God and invites a response, 
we'd better take time out to wonder how we're doing, since no one would call an 
earthquake a blessing. Few would deny our society is amid a nightmare of civil 
disobedience; traditional whole families are icons of a past era. And the 
church is plagued by reports that 20% of priests live in apostasy. Without even 
the mention of sexual misconduct among our religious leaders, there is plenty 
to have earned us a good shaking.

 Editor's note: The quotation in the news story was excerpted from a 2 1/2-page 
reflection issued by Cardinal Mahony in which he took note of human and 
societal failings, but said that God did not have a "grudge" with Southern 
California. Mahony did say that the quake could serve as a "wake-up call" for 
individuals to consider again what is most important in their lives and to 
bring people of all backgrounds together.

 Re: Jeff Douthwaite's letter about God and quakes (Jan. 29): 
</P>
<P>
 If Mr. Douthwaite feels that the events of Jan. 17 can be adequately 
described, explained, expressed by the good folks at Caltech, then good for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 If, however, millions of Protestants, Catholics, Jews and Muslims believe in a 
God who controls and manipulates nature for the good of humanity, it is our 
prerogative.

CALM DOWN, LISTEN CAREFULLY; MAYORAL PANEL'S MULTIYEAR PLAN DESERVES A FULL AND 
FAIR HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles should greet the ambitious recommendations of a task force of 
local business leaders -- to pay for more police and city services by adding 
managerial innovation and eliminating $1 billion in waste and inefficiency from 
city government -- not with cynicism, petty partisanship or bureaucratic 
resistance but with an open mind and a willingness to work with Mayor Richard 
Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound idealistic? Yes, but what is the alternative? More taxes? Not 
politically likely and probably not economically desirable. Vastly reduced 
municipal services? Not politically feasible and not wise public policy. So, if 
you can't reduce government services or raise taxes, what do you do? 
</P>
<P>
 Just what the panel appointed four months ago by Riordan did: work up a 
multiyear fiscal plan that is, in effect, a program for reinventing city 
government. The panel put forward proposals the mayor has pushed before: from 
leasing the airport and the harbor to privatizing city services such as trash 
collection. Riordan's goal is to get more for less from the bureaucracy. The 
City Council's job is to weigh that goal against the long-term effects and 
risks of the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also proposed reconfiguring the city's contribution to workers' 
pension funds (often a nearly untouchable part of any city budget), speeding 
efforts to collect fees and fines and scouring for other efficiencies (lots of 
luck). 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-member panel -- headed by investment banker Michael Tennenbaum -- 
did exactly what it should have done: put a plan on the table. And not a plan 
from Mars, either. This one has elements similar to ones being tried in other 
cities. Our sense is that some of these proposals are doable and some are not 
-- we doubt, for instance, whether LAX can, or should, be leased. 
</P>
<P>
 But the goal here is to finance more police and other city services and 
infrastructure repair without significantly raising taxes. So this plan is 
Riordan's vision. The City Council is not expected to -- nor should it -- 
endorse all that the Tennenbaum panel has proposed. But the council must do 
more than criticize; it must provide alternatives when they are needed. This 
city needs fresh ideas that can work.

HATRED STALKS THE PEACE PROCESS; BUT PARTIES ARE DETERMINED IN WAKE OF MASSACRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The critical task facing Israeli and Palestinian authorities now is to use 
every means at their disposal to try to make the latest terrorist outrage that 
has occurred in the long war between their two peoples the last. 
</P>
<P>
 It is vital that the political fanatics, the religious zealots, the armed 
lunatics on both sides be disarmed and watched closely not simply because the 
delicate peace process that has been showing encouraging signs of progress must 
be defended but, fundamentally and imperatively, to prevent any more innocent 
blood from being shed. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's government, condemning the killings in the 
strongest terms, has taken an important step to tighten what clearly were 
inadequate controls over those Israelis who have made no secret of their fierce 
opposition to a peace agreement with the Palestinians. Just a few hours after 
the atrocity at the Ibrahim Mosque in Hebron the Cabinet acted to seal off the 
nearby large Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba. Residents, said one Cabinet 
minister, would have to have permission from the military from now on to leave 
the settlement, one of the most militant on the West Bank. It was from Kiryat 
Arba that an American immigrant doctor named Baruch Goldstein, armed with an 
assault rifle and an abundance of ammunition, set out early Friday morning on a 
self-chosen mission that would result in the slaughter and wounding of scores 
of Palestinian Muslims as they prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton announced soon after that Israel and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization had agreed to move their talks from Egypt back to 
Washington, and to intensify the negotiations in hope of reaching a prompt 
agreement for the first phase of Palestinian interim self-rule. The peace 
process, in short, won't be sidetracked by the fearful butchery carried out in 
Hebron. Aiding that decision may have been the good-faith offer from Israel to 
compensate the families of the mosque casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 But the horror of the Hebron massacre, like the horror of earlier wanton 
terrorist killings that have taken lives on both sides, won't soon be 
forgotten. Deir Yassin, Lod Airport, Munich, Kiryat Shmona, Maalot, Rishon 
Lezion . . . the terrorist incidents these names denote may be largely unknown 
or forgotten by most of the world, but they remain part of the modern 
historical memory of virtually every Israeli and Palestinian. The job of the 
peacemakers, more urgent now than ever, is to strive to cut loose from the 
legacy of hatred and distrust that these incidents represent.

FUTURE WATCH; DATING GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's been much ado about the collapse of the $33-billion deal between the 
giant cable operator Tele-Communications Inc. and the Bell Atlantic Corp. 
telephone company. Together the two envisioned having a defining role in wiring 
America for the information revolution.But amid the finger-pointing and 
conjecturing after the agreement failed, let it be noted that the setback is 
simply a detour on the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Others continue in the mad scramble to privately develop the infrastructure 
and technology to bring state-of-the-art telecommunications into homes and 
offices. The TCI-Bell Atlantic merger plan (combined, the companies would have 
reached 40% of U.S. households) was the biggest and most ambitious of the 
putative alliances for the development of interactive services. Bell Atlantic 
has made it clear that even without TCI it will pursue plans to deliver home 
shopping, movies and other interactive television experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies blamed the souring of the deal on the regulatory 
environment. The Federal Communications Commission this week ordered cable 
operators to lower rates by 7%. That stands to cut into TCI's cash flow, 
reducing the amount Bell Atlantic was willing to pay for it. So no deal. But 
even before the FCC order, terms of the highly complex deal were at issue, and 
negotiations were difficult because of the contrasting cultures of the two 
firms.  
</P>
<P>
 The two hit a pothole in the superhighway. But they emerged intact -- just not 
together. Who will be next to try?

CHILD-CARE CENTER INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This letter is in response to "FBI Probes Tax-Funded Child-Care Foundation" 
(Feb. 13). There are some factual errors that we believe need correction. 
</P>
<P>
 First, The Times' headline, "Learning in Luxury," gives the reader the 
distinct impression that state money is generous and that it provides some 
programs with so much extra that they can provide luxury items. The Foundation 
Center receives 65 cents per day less per child than other child-care 
contractors. Our agency strains to keep administration costs to one of the 
lowest ratios in the state. We don't hold others to our standard but we want 
the public to understand that we do more with less. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, The Times presented an issue of whether "the executive director, 
Marilyn K. Prosser, used money from the nonprofit organization to purchase 
property in her own name and lease it back to the organization." The story did 
note that the Foundation Center asserts that no public moneys were used for 
this purpose. There is nothing illegal or improper about this relationship, and 
under the laws that govern child-care programs as long as certain protections 
are observed it is permissible. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, The Times' story reported on short-term loans and high fees that were 
paid to lenders. To set the record straight, Prosser reimburses the agency for 
these fees. It is very important for the public to understand that these 
short-term loans are an unfortunate, but necessary, tool used by this agency to 
cover payroll and other expenses, such as food, when the State Department of 
Education checks are late to child-care contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 It is extremely difficult for a state-funded agency dedicated to the education 
of California's poorest children to overcome the negative public perception 
that is invited by an FBI investigation. Unfortunately, what our employees and 
supporters have learned is that you are guilty until proved innocent by these 
and other investigations that we have had to endure. During this time, we hold 
before our eyes the shining light of the children who attend our centers and 
homes because it is for their future that we continue to struggle.

 * As a working parent struggling to pay for day care on my salary, I was 
outraged at your article, "Learning in Luxury." According to your article, the 
publicly funded child-care program provides service for immigrant and poor 
children in California. 
</P>
<P>
 While parents like me are struggling to pay for child care and put food on the 
table, a program funded by my tax dollars is spending $6 for a tube of natural 
toothpaste and serving organically grown food for the lunch menu, which is 
served on china, with lit candles and flowers on the table. I buy my toothpaste 
at a discount store. The major part of our family entertainment is derived from 
the public library from books and videos. Lately, our access to the library has 
been reduced because our library is closed three days a week and open hours 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrogance and ignorance of our Legislature and the California Department 
of Education still surprise me. The California budget has a serious deficit 
this year and yet we continue to authorize spending money in such an outrageous 
manner. According to your article, the State Department of Education granted 
the foundation responsible for this program another full year contract even 
though the foundation is under investigation by the FBI for misuse of funds.

ADM. KELSO AND TAILHOOK SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Vexed by Tailhook Issue, Kelso to Quit Navy Early," Feb. 16: 
</P>
<P>
 Based upon the President Clinton's senior staff's handling of Chief of Naval 
Operations Frank B. Kelso II and the Tailhook scandal, the taxpayers should 
brace themselves for a new round of $600 and $1,200 coffeepots. To allow Kelso 
and the rest to skate is a disgrace!

 * Bad news/good news: It's deplorable that at least 90 women were indecently 
assaulted at the Tailhook convention in 1991; but thank God a thorough 
investigation has shown that there weren't any assailants.

<P>
 * In spite of Pentagon investigators concluding that at least 90 women were 
assaulted or molested at the 1991 Tailhook convention, not one person has been 
court-martialed. As far as heterosexual conduct is concerned, it appears that 
the "don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue" policy works fine. 
</P>
<P>
 If two gay sailors acknowledge having consensual sex in the privacy of their 
own apartment, however, they are to be immediately discharged.

 * The 1980 EEOC guidelines clearly state that "an employer is liable for the 
acts of its employees regardless of whether the employer knew of the occurrence 
of sexual harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 All educational institutions, private employers and governmental organizations 
have sexual harassment policies. The fact that Lt. Paula Coughlin resigned 2 
1/2 years after the Tailhook convention because of continuing sexual harassment 
says something about the despicable behavior of the top Navy officers. 
</P>
<P>
 I would imagine that the sexual harassment policy for the U.S. Navy is fairly 
short and reads something like "boys will be boys."

</P>
<P>
 Surely The Times' editors know how many words a picture is worth. By selecting 
to run a photograph of Lt. Paula Coughlin with her eyes downcast and hand over 
her mouth, The Times subverts its own description of Coughlin as a woman of 
courage. 
</P>
<P>
 This depiction of brave whistle-blower as victim is part of the continuing 
outrage of Tailhook.

 I just wanted to comment on an interesting phenomenon: In the Feb. 14 Times 
the story on Tommy Moe's Olympic gold medal in the men's downhill skiing was on 
the front page of the news section.In the Feb. 16 paper, the story on Diann 
Roffe-Steinrotter's gold medal in the women's super-giant slalom is on the 
front page of the Sports section. I would hate to be overly PC by screaming 
gender bias, but this does make one wonder.

LOBBYISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article of Feb. 14 ("Lobbyists Use All Weapons in Legislative War") 
obscures a serious California problem by focusing on the "process." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is California is facing increasing competition from other states 
for jobs created by financial institutions. The climate in California is being 
made increasingly hostile by a handful of class-action trial lawyers who sue 
banks on such things as late charges and reap million-dollar fees while the 
individual members of the class receive pennies, if anything. And it's not just 
the banks. These legal opportunists have even sued a nonprofit public employees 
credit union, Golden One, on the very same issue. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are one of the 30,000 people employed directly or indirectly by 
California card issuers, you are probably not as concerned about "spot bills" 
and "committee shopping" as you are about whether or not your job is going to 
be located in another state. Perhaps the executive director of the Arizona 
Bankers Assn. put it best when commenting on the California Legislature's 
failure to pass the legislation: "I hope they continue to do so because it is 
good for job growth here."  
</P>
<P>
 Your reporter has described the twists and turns of the legislative process. 
And our industry abides by these well-established, legal and accepted rules of 
the road, the same rules that the trial lawyers and consumer activist groups 
abide by.  
</P>
<P>
 What is disturbing is your reporter's surprising admission that he was allowed 
to "trail after" the consumer activist lobbyist who admitted "she hoped his 
(the reporter's) presence might somehow slow efforts by the bankers." Such a 
statement indicates, contrary to your reporter's assertion, that the consumer 
lobbyist was engaged in more than "arguing the bill on its merits." And with 
good reason: The class-action suits "threatened" by our legislation fund a good 
portion of the activist's lobbying activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we intend to continue to fight for our industry and its thousands of 
California jobs. And yes, we intend to employ every legal and ethical means 
that the "process" provides us, just as the trial lawyers and consumer 
activists have. But if the business climate here in California does not 
improve, the next time The Times writes on this subject it might want to 
consider having its Arizona or Nevada bureau cover the story. If the lawyers 
and activists have their way, that is where the jobs will be located.

STATE YANKS ACADEMIC TEST QUESTION, SPARKS OUTCRY; EDUCATION: RELIGIOUS GROUP 
OBJECTED TO USE OF AUTHOR ALICE WALKER'S WORK. OTHERS CALL THE DELETION 
CENSORSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks before release of the first results of California's heralded new 
system of testing student academic skills, controversy has erupted over the 
dropping of passages by prize-winning author Alice Walker that some 
conservative Christians object to as being anti-religious. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Education yanked a question based on excerpts of the 
Walker story, "Roselily," from a reading portion of the test after complaints 
by the Traditional Values Coalition. Teachers and civil liberties groups 
protested that the decision to pull the story from future versions of the exam 
is censorship and a threat to academic freedom.  
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Friday, Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont), a 
candidate for state superintendent of public instruction, said she has 
scheduled a March 16 hearing of the Assembly Education Committee, which she 
chairs, to pursue the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to determine what were the grounds for removing this item," Eastin 
said. "If they were political, that is a cause for grave concern . . . 
political correctness, whether it comes from the left or from the right, has no 
place in California public education." 
</P>
<P>
 She was joined at the Downtown Los Angeles news conference by leaders of the 
California Federation of Teachers, United Teachers-Los Angeles, National 
Writers Union -- of which the Pulitzer Prize-winning Walker is a member -- and 
People for the American Way, a liberal civil liberties organization that 
battles censorship in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 9, the state will release the long-awaited first results from the 
pioneering California Learning Assessment System, which puts California at the 
forefront of the movement to develop better ways of assessing students. State 
school officials hope that the new tests will be a key component of efforts to 
improve the education of 5.2 million public school students in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the state's previous testing system, which was based primarily on 
multiple-choice questions, the new version requires students to demonstrate 
thinking ability and show how they arrived at answers. Although this new 
system, called "performance-based" or "authentic" assessment, is considerably 
more expensive to develop and score, educators said it provides a much better 
method of determining what a student can do and can help shape reforms in 
teaching and curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Roselily" excerpt is about the thoughts of a black unmarried mother as 
she stands at the altar for her wedding to a Muslim man. The tale appeared in 
Walker's collection of short stories "In Love & Trouble: Stories of Black 
Women." 
</P>
<P>
 The excerpt was on the language arts portion of the exam given to 10th-graders 
throughout the state last spring. Students were asked to write their responses 
to the story -- a test of their reading comprehension, along with thinking and 
writing skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The test was scored, along with those given to fourth- and eighth-graders in 
reading, writing and math, over the summer by teams of teachers statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy surfaced in October, when the Riverside Press-Enterprise 
published the "Roselily" excerpt and question in a story on the new assessment 
system. Shortly after that, the state Department of Education, which had 
received complaints from the Traditional Values Coalition, headed by the Rev. 
Louis Sheldon, decided to pull the item from next year's version of the test, 
which is to be administered annually. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Anaheim-based group said Friday that the group had 
complained about the Walker story, and objected to the new system of testing in 
general because the group believes it emphasizes "emotions, not intellect." The 
Walker story "could easily be construed as anti-religious and anti-clergy," 
said spokesman Steve Sheldon. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is not censorship but discrimination against religious people, 
Sheldon said, adding that Eastin was a "demagogue" who had seized the issue to 
further her election prospects "with the ACLU types." The American Civil 
Liberties Union is among those to decry the decision to pull the test item. 
</P>
<P>
 William D. Dawson, acting state superintendent, said the decision was made in 
large part because publication of the item spoiled its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It alerted every 10th-grade English teacher in the state of California that 
it would be on the test," thus spoiling the unrehearsed nature of the response, 
Dawson said. The Walker story might be reinstated in the future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Walker's works, including the Pulitzer-winning book, "The Color 
Purple," are on the state's recommended reading lists, Dawson noted. He called 
"Roselily" a "fine, engaging, thought-provoking story that causes kids to stop 
and think hard about other people's lives and problems and how they address 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dawson acknowledged that the controversy generated by the news story also 
played a role in the decision to drop the test item. He said that after the 
story appeared, Dale Carlson, the state's testing director, recommended 
dropping the item, based on the spoiled confidentiality and the controversy. 
Dawson said he "fully backed" Carlson's recommendation. "It was our judgment 
that continued inclusion of 'Roselily' . . . would have injected a level of 
controversy that could have jeopardized the larger testing program," Dawson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker was traveling and could not be reached for comment. Controversial 
Passages 
</P>
<P>
 The following excerpts from Alice Walker's short story "Roselily" -- about a 
rural Mississippi woman's private thoughts during her wedding ceremony -- were 
included on a test of language arts skills given to sophomores statewide in 
1993. Students were asked to write their feelings about the passages. 
</P>
<P>
 * ". . . She cannot always be a bride and a virgin, wearing robes and veil. 
Even now her body itches to be free of satin and voile. . . . She wonders what 
it will be like. Not to have to go to a job. Not to work in a sewing plant. . . 
. Her place will be in the home, he has said, repeatedly, promising her rest 
she has prayed for. But now she wonders. When she has rested, what will she do? 
They will make babies -- she thinks practically about her fine brown body, his 
strong black one. They will be inevitable. Her hands will be full. Full of 
what? Babies. She is not comforted."

COLUMN ONE; THE MOB RULES IN NEW RUSSIA; ORGANIZED CRIME HAS GROWN SO BIG AND 
BAD THAT SOME FEAR IT COULD THREATEN THE YELTSIN GOVERNMENT. POWERFUL GANGS AND 
RAMPANT CORRUPTION HOBBLE THE MOVE TO A FREE-MARKET ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boris Yeltsin used to run this town. Now the mob does. 
</P>
<P>
 The new czar is a former soccer star named Konstantin Tsyganov. Police and 
fellow gangsters say Tsyganov's crime organization controls 60% of this rich 
industrial region, with branch operations in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 In or out of jail, Tsyganov is a man with clout. During a mob war last summer, 
his henchmen decided that they needed more than machine guns to battle rivals 
from the ferocious Chechen mafia. So they hijacked a state-of-the-art tank from 
a nearby military testing ground and parked it in the central square. The 
Chechens left town. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsyganov's men make regular deliveries of food, chocolate, tea and medicine to 
Ekaterinburg's overcrowded jail. The warden, who says the state has slashed his 
budget so severely that two inmates died from the poor conditions, shrugs and 
accepts the booty. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsyganov is something of a Russian Robin Hood. His thugs allegedly extract up 
to a third of the profits from businesses struggling to establish themselves. 
Yet after he was arrested on extortion charges last spring, invalids, 
pensioners and the local soccer team wrote letters of protest, extolling his 
philanthropy and demanding his release. All said they could not survive without 
his largess. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Tsyganov sat in jail, someone used a grenade launcher to blast the 
Ekaterinburg City Hall and the headquarters of the police organized crime unit. 
Thugs then gave a bone-crushing beating to a judge who had denied him bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, nearly three-quarters of residents believe that their city 
is ruled not by the government but by the mafia, according to a 1993 survey. 
And 56% believe that the police are not fighting organized crime because they 
have been bought off. 
</P>
<P>
 Ekaterinburg is not unique. Organized crime and corruption have become so 
pervasive that they are choking the development of a free-market system in 
Russia, according to a growing chorus of officials, business people and 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Some believe that the problem could even threaten the Yeltsin government 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The growth of organized crime, permeating the police and local authorities, 
threatens political and economic development in Russia, creating the conditions 
for the national socialists to come to power," said a report sent to President 
Yeltsin in January. 
</P>
<P>
 In his State of the Nation speech Thursday, Yeltsin promised a crackdown on 
crime, which has seemed to grow as fast as the private sector in the wake of 
the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 He warned that organized crime in particular "is trying to take the country by 
the throat." 
</P>
<P>
 He called on Parliament to revise the Soviet-era legal code adopted in the 
1950s to make it easier to fight crime and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 During the December parliamentary elections, Communists told voters that the 
Yeltsin administration was more corrupt than the old Soviet system, and 
ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky promised to convene tribunals to shoot 
criminals on the spot. Reformers did not make crime a campaign issue, and were 
trounced. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to deprive his conservative foes of a populist issue, Yeltsin 
called fighting crime the year's most important issue, a goal that reflects the 
realization that the lack of law and order has become a serious political 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Star newspaper wrote this month that analysts have for some time 
predicted that Russia's estimated 4,000 organized crime groups would 
consolidate, divide up turf, forge links with foreign criminal networks, buy up 
key officials and become politicized. Now it is happening, the newspaper 
asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is now clear that this phenomenon . . . poses a real threat to national 
security, threatening the political and economic development of Russia," it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report to the president by Pyotr S. Filippov, the longtime 
Yeltsin adviser who heads the presidential Analytical Center for Social and 
Economic Policy, all owners of cafes, restaurants and retail stores are paying 
protection money to mobsters, as are 70% to 80% of privatized businesses and 
commercial banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Extortionists routinely demand tribute of up to 20% of the turnover -- often 
totaling more than half the profit, the report said. This "hidden tax to 
bandits," as well as price-fixing and monopoly-building by mobsters, increases 
prices by 20% to 30%, contributing to the further impoverishment of the 
population, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized crime groups and their shady business partners are all known here by 
the umbrella term mafia , though they are smaller and far less organized than 
La Cosa Nostra or Latin American drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
 Collectively, these corrupt bands are blamed for hastening the flight of 
Russian capital abroad. Russian officials say at least $1 billion a month is 
flowing into Western and offshore banks that already hold up to $40 billion in 
Russian deposits. Unofficial sources say the real figures are closer to double 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the dollars are ferried out of Russia by businesses anxious to protect 
their money against inflation, confiscatory taxes or mafia extortion. Some of 
the outflow comes from government credits to industry, which, instead of being 
invested in rebuilding Russian manufacturing, quickly find their way into 
foreign banks. 
</P>
<P>
 But a significant portion of the $1 billion fleeing Russia each month is 
believed to belong to the mob and its growing business empire. In some cases, 
gangsters have forced banks to transfer tainted capital abroad illegally -- and 
then killed the bankers who knew where the deposits were kept, according to the 
report. Bankers now have a high mortality rate; more than 30 were slain last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when Russia faces growing unemployment, some would-be entrepreneurs 
are being scared out of business by the mob. One is 23-year-old Oleg Morozov, 
who started a private real estate company in Moscow in late 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Morozov is no shrinking violet. In the army, he spent three days in an 
underground stockade for painting a mocking mural of Felix E. Dzerzhinsky, 
founder of the Soviet secret police. Morozov said he dropped out of law school 
when he realized that students were paying bribes to pass exams and could even 
buy their degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 He and a friend cut their teeth in real estate by leasing a hotel floor for 
the ruble equivalent of $25 per room, and then renting the rooms to foreigners 
for $110 a night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was perfectly legal, but they never would have let us do it if we hadn't 
paid the hotel director and the front desk receptionist," the former athlete 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than three months after Morozov and a new partner opened a real estate 
office, racketeers came calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy who knew how to talk and four hulking guys with broken noses" 
promised they would be back in a week to start collecting an unspecified sum in 
tribute, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morozov quit then and there. He and others say the only way to stay in 
business in the face of an outrageous payment demand is to find a "reasonable" 
mafia that charges low rates -- as little as 8% -- and provides protection 
against street thugs and other would-be extortionists. Such "good mafias" are 
known here as krysha, which means roof , and many business people say it is 
impossible to function in Russia without them. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all gangsters rely on physical force to collect payment. Some merely 
threaten to report their victims to the tax inspector. Nearly every business 
fudges its income to avoid taxes that can total 90% of its profit. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ekaterinburg, which was called Sverdlovsk when Yeltsin was first secretary 
of the local Communist Party, a recent government survey of 400 enterprises 
found one-third were not paying taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrepreneurs figure it is cheaper and more reliable to pay the mob than to 
tangle with the tax police. 
</P>
<P>
 Bureaucrats and politicians also are held hostage. Filippov, the Yeltsin 
adviser, says organized crime leaders are carefully building dossiers on all 
major government officials and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ekaterinburg, organized crime investigators working in the building that 
was damaged by the grenade attack say they have evidence that mobsters are not 
only keeping files on them, but surreptitiously photographing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to crack down on organized crime have failed because law enforcement 
has been infiltrated with mob informers, Filippov said. 
</P>
<P>
 In some places, local officials seem to be cowed by gangsters, while elsewhere 
they collaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old town of Tver, officials will not issue a business license for a 
coffee shop without getting clearance from the local godfather, Filippov said. 
In the Volga city of Kazan, only mobsters are allowed to drive foreign cars or 
Volgas, the Russian luxury sedans; gangsters yank other drivers from behind the 
wheel and drive off in the prestigious vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow officials are unable to stop the dangerous and illegal sale of gasoline 
from the backs of trucks, because the gasoline gangs reportedly pay the traffic 
police to tip them off when a raid is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 With law enforcement compromised and mobsters running amok, the populist 
promises of neo-fascist leader Zhirinovsky, who campaigned on a law-and-order 
platform, have a dangerous resonance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Failure to take decisive and systematic measures to alleviate the economic 
causes of crime . . . as well as the absence of political will to fight 
organized crime, could bring the national socialists to power during the 1996 
presidential election," Filippov wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Filippov called for the creation of a Russian equivalent of 
the FBI to fight organized crime, but with a catch: Not one officer who has 
served in the police or the KGB should be hired for the unit of "Untouchables." 
</P>
<P>
 The unit's regional supervisors would be rotated frequently, he proposed, and 
officers would be dismissed at the first whiff of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, the unit would be permitted to conduct stings and to make 
preventive arrests to keep suspected gangsters in custody without charges for 
up to several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Such tactics are banned under Russian law, and would raise the hackles of 
human rights advocates, but Filippov argues that only Draconian measures will 
suffice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need a white terror," Filippov said, meaning a righteous purge of 
evildoers rather than a bloody, Bolshevik "red terror." 
</P>
<P>
 An elite squad of "300 fanatics" could put the mob out of business in short 
order, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Filippov's findings about the mob's grip do not surprise most Russians, who 
believe that their nation has been plundered by officials in cahoots with 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The police are held in pure contempt by the many citizens who have had 
occasion to bribe them. The disenchanted often remark that "the state itself is 
the mafia." 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, the media reinforces the impression that the bad guys are winning, 
and that no one is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest travesty was the Feb. 1 assassination of a revered publisher who 
had brought out the works of exiled novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei Dubov was gunned down as he left his Moscow home for a morning jog. 
Police said the killing had all the earmarks of a professional "hit," and 
newspapers speculated that Dubov had a fatal financial disagreement with the 
mob. 
</P>
<P>
 If crime abounds, punishment is rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Gangsters are far more likely to be slain by rivals than arrested. The 
conviction of a bribe-taking bureaucrat or a corrupt cop would be sensational 
news here; but such stories almost never appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the torrent of allegations of corruption exchanged by Yeltsin 
supporters and their foes in the Supreme Soviet last summer, not a single 
high-ranking official has appeared in the dock. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prosecutor's office is an exclusively political tool," said Igor 
Baranovsky, an investigative reporter for the Moscow News. "It will never work 
against the party in power." 
</P>
<P>
 Low-level officials do get nabbed, but these cases get little publicity. In 
1993, the Interior Ministry logged about 13,000 crimes by government officials, 
ranging from abuse of power to forgery, theft and graft. 
</P>
<P>
 The ministry also opened 8,000 extortion case files last year, said Gennady F. 
Chebotarev, the first deputy chief of the Interior Ministry's organized crime 
control department. 
</P>
<P>
 If the vast majority of bribes and shakedowns go unreported, it is not only 
because of fear, but because "both sides are satisfied with the arrangement," 
Chebotarev said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ekaterinburg, even the police admit that Tsyganov is a well-liked man. 
Supporters say it is because he gave fledgling entrepreneurs what their 
government has been unable to provide: protection against petty criminals and 
other extortionists, reliable debt collection, a well-connected "friend" to run 
interference with meddling bureaucrats and, sometimes, financing at much lower 
interest rates than banks offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if much of his capital was extorted from businesses or stolen from state 
enterprises, Tsyganov was trying to make his 30-odd companies into a legitimate 
business empire, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police paint a less flattering portrait of Tsyganov, who is being held in the 
nearby city of Perm because the local jail is not secure enough. Tsyganov's 
thugs once tried to batter a businessman into signing over half of his company, 
said Vyacheslav I. Latyshev, deputy head of the Ekaterinburg organized crime 
department. When the man stoically refused, Tsyganov allegedly poked a knitting 
needle in his ear until he signed. 
</P>
<P>
 The terrified victim is in hiding, and another potential witness is under 
heavy police guard after being shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Latyshev believes that both men will eventually testify against Tsyganov. But 
he bemoans the lack of a program to protect, relocate or give new identities to 
the few witnesses willing to stand up against the mob. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview in Trud newspaper this month, Yeltsin's ousted economic guru 
and deputy prime minister, Yegor T. Gaidar, pointed out that "organized crime 
thrives by uniting with corrupt bureaucrats. Without this union, organized 
crime could not exist." 
</P>
<P>
 No Ekaterinburg officials have been charged with protecting Tsyganov. Russia 
has no financial disclosure requirements for public servants, so it is 
impossible to investigate whether there are official ties to Tsyganov-owned 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Corruption is hardly a new phenomenon in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In czarist times, historian Nikolai Karamzin wrote, one could sum up his 
country's plight in a single word. " Voruyut, " he wrote -- "They are 
stealing." 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet officialdom was also notoriously corrupt. What makes the current 
situation so troubling is that the state has relinquished central economic 
control without first dismantling state-run monopolies, safeguarding ownership 
rights or stripping bureaucrats of their near-absolute powers, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized criminals, inside and outside the massive Soviet-era bureaucracy, 
have rushed in to fill the vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state monopoly was replaced by a criminal monopoly," said Yuri Y. 
Boldyrev, who was fired as Yeltsin's top corruption investigator last summer 
after complaining that the administration lacked the will to stop the plunder. 
"There is practically not a crime-free sphere in our economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's legions of ministries still have unchecked power to decide which 
firms should be given valuable export licenses, which ones should get loans, 
which ones should be given special tax breaks, all with a lack of public 
accountability that creates a paradise for payola. 
</P>
<P>
 "If in Italy corruption means handing out construction contracts, in Russia it 
means handing over buildings that are already built, giving land plots away for 
free and handing out various privileges," Boldyrev said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaidar argues that corruption cannot be fought with police methods unless its 
rich economic source is eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, government credits to industry are tightly rationed, and it has 
become common for recipients to pay kickbacks in return for the valuable loans. 
As long as all bounty flows from the state, graft will be hard to curb. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are serious about fighting organized crime, the battle must be based on 
limiting the absolute power of the bureaucracy," Gaidar said. 
</P>
<P>

OUTRAGED CLINTON SUMMONS PLO, ISRAEL FOR TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a dramatic bid to prevent the Hebron massacre from destroying the Middle 
East peace process, President Clinton on Friday summoned Israeli and 
Palestinian negotiators to Washington for nonstop talks until they complete an 
agreement on limited Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who called the slayings "a gross act of murder," has been wary of 
hands-on participation in the volatile Arab-Israeli negotiations throughout his 
13-month tenure. But he threw his own prestige behind a demand for results at 
the bargaining table after learning of the blood-spattered scene in Hebron's 
Ibrahim Mosque, where an American-born Israeli doctor killed 48 Muslim 
worshipers in a fusillade of automatic weapon fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Asserting that the killer's objective was to derail the delicate negotiations 
between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization, Clinton called for 
redoubled efforts to complete the troublesome details blocking implementation 
of the self-rule accord signed with such fanfare on the White House lawn last 
September. He said that would be the best way to thwart the anti-peace 
extremists in both the Jewish and Arab communities. 
</P>
<P>
 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, who earlier in the day threatened to pull out of 
the talks to protest the killings, and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin 
immediately agreed to send their delegates to Washington for negotiations 
beginning next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "On behalf of the American people, I condemn this crime in the strongest 
possible terms," Clinton said. "I am outraged and saddened that such a gross 
act of murder could be perpetrated, and I extend my deepest sympathies to the 
families of those who have been killed and wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Extremists on both sides are determined to drag Arabs and Israelis back into 
the darkness of unending conflict and bloodshed," he added. "We must prevent 
them from extinguishing the hopes and the visions and the aspirations of 
ordinary people for a life of peaceful existence." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli and PLO negotiators have been haggling over the fine print of 
Palestinian self-government since they signed their broad general agreement in 
September. The talks have been taking place in Cairo, Oslo, the Sinai resort of 
Taba and a variety of other venues. According to both camps, agreement is 
close, but final details have proven difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States generally has kept its distance from the negotiations, in 
part at least because Secretary of State Warren Christopher considers the 
September pact to be so loosely drawn that it amounts to a legal minefield. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the wake of the Hebron killings, Administration officials concluded 
that an arm's-length attitude was no longer good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parties have, in discussion with us, agreed that it would be helpful to 
move these discussions here, for the United States to play a role that . . . at 
this point (is) somewhat undefined, but at least to use our offices and our 
facilities here to try to help the parties make progress," State Department 
spokesman Mike McCurry said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that more active U.S. participation "might change a bit of the 
dynamics." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official, briefing reporters at the White House, said 
the United States decided to step in to make it easier for Rabin and Arafat to 
persuade the Israeli and Palestinian publics of the need to keep negotiating 
despite the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You needed to have a kind of focal point for these negotiations that both the 
prime minister and the chairman could respond to, so that the focus could again 
be on negotiations and not just on the consequences of this event," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israeli-PLO talks on the details of self-government are separate from the 
broad Israeli-Arab negotiations that have been going on in Washington for more 
than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The September agreement called on Israel and the PLO to complete their 
negotiations in time to begin Palestinian self-government by last Dec. 13. But 
as that date came and went, Rabin asserted that it was more important to tie 
down all loose ends than it was to meet an artificial deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, however, Israeli Ambassador Itamar Rabinovitch said speed was now 
very important to head off further violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an act meant to derail the peace process," Rabinovitch told a news 
conference. "It only reinforces our determination not only to keep to the peace 
process but to expedite it and to accelerate it. There is no comfort and 
consolation in this, but even such a tragic event can be the catalyst for 
movement toward agreement and toward finding a political solution to what has 
always been and remains to be a very violent and a very tragic conflict." 
</P>
<P>
 In his statement at the White House, Clinton described the killer as a lone 
madman. And he praised the Israeli government for its handling of the aftermath 
of the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations, Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali called on 
Israeli authorities "to take all necessary measures to ensure that settlers 
refrain from such criminal acts." 
</P>
<P>
 Boutros-Ghali appealed for calm, noting that he was "deeply concerned by the 
unrest generated in the occupied territories . . . and the impact that this may 
have on negotiations between the Palestine Liberation Organization and the 
government of Israel."

FOR AMES, A WIFE AND A CROSSROADS IN MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER and JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To a man of broad intellect who is also the son of an intelligence officer, 
the world of espionage offered a home that was at once familiar and 
challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 But after two decades in increasingly sensitive posts, Aldrich H. Ames faced a 
personal and professional crisis in the early 1980s as a CIA operative in 
Mexico City, where his career seemed to stall and his marriage collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 A man both witty and meek, sometimes sociable and at other times withdrawn, 
Ames began to realize that he was not destined for a senior management job or 
substantial salary increases. He then met and married Maria del Rosario Casas 
Ames, a low-level Colombian diplomat recruited to be a paid agent for the CIA 
-- and also, according to some who knew the couple, a strong-minded woman of 
expensive tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 After a tour in Rome, where Ames' job involved trying to bribe Soviet 
diplomats into spying for the United States, the Ameses returned to Washington 
in 1989 and embarked on a new life -- with a spending spree that was remarkable 
not only for its size but for the fact that no one at the CIA appeared to 
notice it. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple paid $540,000 cash for a home in Arlington, Va., poured $99,000 
into home improvements, bought two condominiums and a farm in Colombia, put 
$25,000 cash down on a new Jaguar Sovereign sedan, ran up nearly $5,000 a month 
in credit card bills and purchased more than $165,000 in stock and securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI says all this money came from Moscow in return for some of the most 
sensitive U.S. intelligence secrets, including the names of American agents 
working in the Soviet Union. Law enforcement authorities say Ames turned 
against his country in 1985 and took more than $1.5 million from the Soviets 
and, later, the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 Through their attorneys, the Ameses steadfastly deny these accusations, and 
they may be resolved only through a court case. 
</P>
<P>
 But the detailed presentation of them in court papers by investigators who 
eavesdropped on the couple and tailed them for more than a year has stirred 
urgent questions throughout the intelligence community and official Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would a lifelong CIA official sell out his country for what former agency 
Director William E. Colby called "a few shekels of silver?" How could such a 
person on the front lines of the Cold War rationalize treason? 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Ames and those who have studied such cases cite a combination 
of possible factors: greed and a shattered ego. 
</P>
<P>
 CIA associates describe Ames as extremely bright and capable, despite apparent 
blunders that led to his arrest. Yet in Mexico City, his career was not 
advancing while those who were his junior were moving up to bigger titles and 
larger salaries. Those who knew him then speculate that he could have felt 
stymied in his career by lesser minds who were better bureaucratic 
game-players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rick was in crisis, and everybody seemed to know it," said one American who 
worked with him in Mexico City. "He felt pushed from one side and pulled from 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 A CIA psychologist said that Ames could have turned against his agency, and 
his country, out of the frustrated ambition that has driven many others to 
treason. 
</P>
<P>
 "In looking at a number of major traitors in history, it was frequently a case 
that there had been a major career setback, a sense of having been betrayed by 
their own government, which did not recognize their own ability," he said. "The 
person then went on to rationalize the act quite consciously as vengeance or 
revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 The psychologist, who has profiled many of the prominent spies of recent 
decades, said that they commonly suffered professional and personal crises 
simultaneously and decided to take action to regain a sense of self-worth. He 
cited the Walkers, an American family that sold top-secret U.S. military codes 
to the Soviets in the 1980s, and the Soviet turncoat Oleg Penkovsky, who spied 
for the United States after having been denied a promotion in the Soviet 
intelligence service. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the surface, these cases look like simple venality," the psychologist 
said. "But in the heads of these individuals is the satisfaction of being a 
little man putting something over on the system. These are people with dreams 
of glory trying to restore a sense of efficacy and personal importance." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know him describe Ames as a man with an unexpected mix of qualities. 
His neighbors knew him as someone who was always able to fill in the answer to 
the crossword puzzle that stumped them. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his Arlington neighbors, William Rhoads, a retired foreign service 
officer, suspected that Ames might work for a spy agency because his manner 
seemed too humble for a foreign service officer. "He just didn't have the 
pomposity you see so often." 
</P>
<P>
 A doting father, Ames would brave an ice storm to buy a toy for his 5-year-old 
son, Paul. Although his friends in Arlington knew him only casually, he also 
had a convivial side: Friends from government service said that he could party 
for many hours and liked to have a few drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ames had strong political views, he didn't share them widely. Although he 
contributed $5,000 to the Democratic National Committee in 1991 and 1992, his 
Arlington neighbors and some Americans who knew him here and abroad said that 
they knew nothing about his politics. If he harbored any resentments toward the 
U.S. government, he never voiced them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't like some unhappy postal employee, ready to blow up," said an 
American who knew him in Mexico. "He didn't whine, he didn't complain, he 
didn't cry about how they were treating him." 
</P>
<P>
 But for all his broad knowledge, his superiors seemed to find something 
lacking in his job performance. After 32 years in the CIA, Ames at the time of 
his arrest was earning about $70,000 a year and had a service grade so low that 
it surprised some former colleagues when they learned of it in news accounts 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The portrait of Ames in the FBI's accusatory affidavit also indicated a 
feckless side, surprising in a man who held the pivotal job of head of Soviet 
counterintelligence in the mid-1980s. The FBI papers suggest that Ames risked 
capture by leaving incriminating documents at his CIA office and his home, 
showed off his wealth in a way that was likely to attract attention and 
couldn't even message his Russian contacts without numerous misspellings. 
</P>
<P>
 Even his purported allies in Russia were scornful of his allegedly reckless 
and free-spending ways. "Of course, we should not recruit such idiots who do 
not know how to live," Mikhail N. Portoranin, an adviser to Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin, said scornfully this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatively little is known of Ames' earliest years except that he and his two 
sisters lived the life of CIA "brats" -- trailing their father, Carleton, to 
several agency postings overseas before settling in the Virginia suburbs of 
Washington in 1951, when the younger Ames was 10. Ames' mother, Rachel Aldrich 
Ames, taught in the Fairfax County public schools until retiring in 1969 and 
moving to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames' father died in retirement in 1972. His mother collapsed and died at 
Ames' house in Falls Church, Va., in 1986 while visiting her son. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1959 McLean High School yearbook pictures a nerdy, bespectacled "Ricky" 
Ames hamming it up with Polly Morris as the senior class's "wittiest" students. 
He was active in the thespian society, served on the yearbook staff, sang in 
the a cappella choir and sat on the student council cabinet. He was a National 
Merit Scholarship semi-finalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior class president Corbin Thompson, now a pipe fitter in semi-rural 
Nokesville, Va., said that he remembers Ames as an exceptional student and "fun 
to be around." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had no idea that Ames had chosen intelligence as a career. "I 
thought he'd go into theatrics or be an English teacher or something." 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson said he wasn't aware until a reporter called him Friday that the 
Aldrich H. Ames arrested this week as a suspected spy was the Ricky Ames he'd 
watched in school plays. "You mean that's the same guy? I had no idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the yearbook indicates that Ames intended to attend Dartmouth College 
in the fall of 1959, the school has no record of his enrolling there. The next 
three years are unaccounted for in official accounts, perhaps reflecting Ames' 
military service or initial CIA training. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the agency on June 17, 1962, then spent tours in Washington, Turkey 
and New York before landing in Mexico City between 1981 and 1983. That tour was 
a prestigious location for someone in his work, because big Russian and Cuban 
embassies had long made the city a seat of espionage activity in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 He developed a close-knit group of friends among the 500 or so Americans who 
worked at the embassy, and his friends knew him to be in pain. His peers in the 
service were moving ahead, but Ames was struggling to win similar respect from 
his bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't move ahead, you'd be 'selected out,' as they put it," one friend 
said. "That's what everybody worried about." 
</P>
<P>
 And his first marriage was coming unraveled, leaving Ames deeply troubled 
behind a usually cheerful demeanor, friends said. The divorce in August, 1985, 
gave Ames' first wife the couple's home and alimony, according to one former 
CIA official. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at one of the embassy's many diplomatic cocktail soirees in the Mexican 
capital that Ames met the young, raven-haired Maria del Rosario Casas Dupuy, a 
cultural attache in the Colombian Embassy and the daughter of a prominent 
Colombian politician and businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 She was born on Dec. 19, 1952, in Bogota and entered the humanities college of 
the prestigious University of the Andes in 1969. She studied philosophy and 
arts, concentrating on ancient Greece, and rubbed elbows with people who became 
Colombia's political and social elite, including Ana Milena Munoz, now the wife 
of President Cesar Gaviria. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his struggles with his career, Ames returned to Washington and was 
inexplicably promoted to the prestigious post of head of Soviet 
counterintelligence. He and his wife then spent three years in Rome, where he 
was charged with "turning" Soviet Embassy personnel, before returning to 
Washington in the late summer of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1991, Ames and his wife began depositing large amounts of cash in 
checking, savings and brokerage accounts in the Washington area, according to 
the FBI affidavit. The affidavit also says the couple began a pattern of 
unauthorized contacts with Russian officials in which they used a northwest 
Washington mailbox to signal his Russian handlers, and a site he called "the 
pipe" for receiving bundles of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ames' nanny told reporters this week of the furtive life she had witnessed 
at the Ames' three-story house. She told of how she was barred from entering 
certain parts of the house and ordered to take the couple's son away from the 
house for periods of many hours. 
</P>
<P>
 By early 1993, the couple was under constant surveillance from TV cameras, FBI 
tails and even electronic monitors on their home telephone and computer, where 
FBI documents say they kept detailed records of their espionage business. 
</P>
<P>
 As the months wore on, according to the FBI documents, the couple's anxiety 
level apparently rose. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents say they listened in on a call last October in which a panicked 
Rosario Ames grilled her husband about a signal he was supposed to leave on a 
mailbox to indicate to his Russian masters that he was prepared to meet a 
Russian agent in Bogota to exchange information. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a transcript of the intercepted conversation, Mrs. Ames asked, 
"Why didn't you do it today, for God's sakes?" Her husband replied, "I should 
have, except it was raining like crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Then they reportedly bickered about when he was supposed to lay down the 
signal to the Russians, with Ames reassuring her that he still had time to pass 
the message. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, honey," Mrs. Ames said, "I hope you didn't screw up." 
</P>

BAIUL WINS GOLD; KERRIGAN TAKES SILVER; OLYMPICS: FIGURE SKATING EVENTS WIND UP 
-- IN MORE CONTROVERSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were as many arguments inside the Olympic Amphitheatre on Friday night 
about who should have won the Winter Olympic women's figure skating competition 
as there were sequins, but one thing almost everyone agreed upon was that 
Ukraine's Oksana Baiul and the United States' Nancy Kerrigan went toe-loop to 
toe-loop with the immense challenges that faced them and won. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, however, only one gold medal, and the fact that it was draped around 
Baiul's neck thrilled her supporters and angered those of Kerrigan, who 
accepted her silver medal more graciously than they did. 
</P>
<P>
 What could have been more appropriate than for the controversial events of 
figure skating's longest winter to climax with more controversy? 
</P>
<P>
 The nine judges were divided, five awarding first-place scores to Baiul, and 
four to Kerrigan after their four-minute freestyle programs, which accounted 
for two-thirds of the final score. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the decisive factor, although two judges who favored Kerrigan also 
ranked Baiul behind China's Chen Lu, who won the bronze medal. France's Surya 
Bonaly was fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 With her triumph, Baiul, 16, became the youngest women's gold medalist since 
15-year-old Sonja Henie of Norway in 1928. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost forgotten when the night began because she no longer was among the 
medal contenders after Wednesday night's technical program, the United States' 
Tonya Harding became the center of unwanted attention again momentarily when 
she had to leave the ice early in her program with a boot problem. Given a 
chance to start over later, she finished a respectable eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the first time in more than seven weeks, the buzz in the sport was not 
about Nancy vs. Tonya but Nancy vs. Oksana. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go with one judging panel, you get one result, and if you go with 
another panel, you get another result," said Christy Ness, who coached the 
United States' Kristi Yamaguchi to the gold medal in the 1992 Winter Olympics. 
"I sat there watching, and I couldn't decide." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, felt certain that Kerrigan should have been given the 
advantage because she skated almost flawlessly, while Baiul made at least one 
significant mistake in a program that was less demanding. Kerrigan landed five 
triple jumps, two in combination, and Baiul landed four, none in combination. 
Yet, three judges gave the Ukrainian higher scores for technical merit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't explain it at all," said Paul Wylie, the 1992 Olympic men's silver 
medalist who formerly trained with Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy deserved to win without discussion," said Didier Gailhauguet, who 
formerly coached Bonaly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Kerrigan looked stronger and more solid tonight than ever," said 
Frank Carroll, who coaches at Lake Arrowhead's Ice Castle International 
Training Center. "She should have won, definitely." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the medals ceremony didn't escape the melodrama that has enveloped this 
sport since Kerrigan was clubbed Jan. 6. It was held up a few minutes because 
no one could find a recording of Baiul's newly independent nation's anthem. It 
was Ukraine's first gold medal ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan, 24, said she did not watch Baiul, who skated immediately after she 
did. As for her own performance, Kerrigan said she thought immediately 
afterward that it had earned her a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, in my mind and my heart, I did," she said. "I was great." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as she was here, Kerrigan was first after the technical program in the 
1993 World Championships in Prague. But she had a disastrous freestyle program 
and finished fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 When she returned home to Stoneham, Mass., she began seeing a sports 
psychologist in an effort to overcome her nerves. That seemed to give her 
renewed confidence entering this season, but then came the assault on Jan. 6 
during the national championships in Detroit that injured her right knee. There 
was a question for the next three weeks about whether she would even be able to 
compete here. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Nancy did, she should be proud of all her life," said Linda Leaver, who 
coached 1988 men's champion Brian Boitano. "To put what happened a year ago in 
Prague out of her mind is almost as difficult as overcoming all the other 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Baiul, meantime, won the world championship at 15 last year and was in second 
place after Wednesday night's technical program, but, the next afternoon, she 
was involved in a practice collision with Germany's Tanja Szewczenko. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting herself with her own skate, Baiul sustained a two-inch long, half-inch 
gash in her right shin that required three stitches. Doctors also treated her 
for lower back and shoulder pain. After a shaky practice Friday morning, she 
was still not certain she would compete. 
</P>
<P>
 But her training partner, 1992 Olympic men's gold medalist Viktor Petrenko, 
told her: "Many times, I have skated through pain. Now, you must." 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan, performing to a medley of Neil Diamond songs, was the second in the 
last group of six competitors to skate, and she seemed tentative at first, 
turning a planned triple jump into a double. Although she was superb afterward, 
that might have cost her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She left an excuse for the judges to mark her down," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baiul, the next skater on the ice, performed a lively routine set to Broadway 
show tunes. She double-footed her second triple jump and then left out the most 
complicated elements in the middle of her program. But just as it seemed she 
would have to settle for second place or lower, she inserted a triple jump and 
a double-axel, double toe-loop combination in the last 10 seconds of her 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an astonishing move, for a world-class figure skater who has rehearsed 
her program hundreds of times to make such monumental changes under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remembered time was running out, and with it time for the gold medal," she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Baiul's father left home when she was 2, and her mother died of ovarian cancer 
when she was 13. She slept on a cot in her training rink until her coach left 
for Canada. Her current coach, Galina Zmievskaya, took her on a short time 
later and turned her into a world champion two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the troubles I have had have made me strong," Baiul said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by reporters if there was anything she wanted now that she has a gold 
medal, she said, "a Snickers." 
</P>

IN SHIFT, FDA SAYS IT COULD CLASSIFY NICOTINE AS A DRUG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major policy reversal, the Food and Drug Administration Friday asserted 
its authority to classify nicotine as a drug -- a move that could lead to 
regulating or even banning virtually all cigarettes. But the agency urged 
Congress to provide clear direction on what it should do. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to anti-smoking advocates, FDA Commissioner David A. Kessler all 
but accused the tobacco industry of stoking a public addiction, citing 
"accumulating" evidence that nicotine content in cigarettes is being 
manipulated for that very end -- thus making cigarettes, in effect, a drug that 
falls under FDA jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 If the agency eventually reached such a formal finding, Kessler noted, "it 
could have dramatic effects on our society." 
</P>
<P>
 "A strict application of these provisions could mean, ultimately, removal from 
the market of tobacco products containing nicotine at levels that cause or 
satisfy addiction," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An FDA spokesman added: "The real bottom line is: We and the Congress need to 
address this issue and determine whether or not we are to regulate cigarettes. 
Is this in fact what the public will is?" 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler's comments came in a letter to the Coalition on Smoking OR Health, 
which for years has urged the FDA to regulate cigarettes as a drug. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are surprised, but very pleased," said Scott D. Ballin, chairman of the 
coalition, which is composed of the American Heart Assn., the American Lung 
Assn. and the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tobacco industry is in the drug business. We know it. People who are 
desperately fighting their addiction to nicotine know it. And now the FDA knows 
it," Ballin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tobacco industry disagreed. "Cigarettes are not addictive," said Brennan 
Dawson, a spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute. "And if Congress were to 
consider this, it would be a very hotly debated topic." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of a House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on health, said Kessler's position will "require us to do a lot of 
thinking and force Congress to figure out a more rational scheme for handling 
tobacco." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless Congress acts, Waxman said, "the FDA is going to have only one option: 
ban cigarettes," since the FDA cannot approve a drug that is known to be 
unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 A less drastic approach, he said, may be for the government to regulate the 
level of nicotine in cigarettes and other tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman said he plans to hold hearings on the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Mike Synar (D-Okla.), who has been pushing the FDA for years to regulate 
cigarettes, said Kessler's position should add new impetus to a bill that he, 
Waxman and more than 40 other members of Congress have sponsored to give the 
FDA "explicit jurisdiction to regulate the advertising, promotion, labeling and 
content of tobacco without banning it from our society." 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler's letter capped a week in which the tobacco industry took some major 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, McDonald's Corp. announced that, effective immediately, its 
1,400 corporate-owned fast-food outlets will ban smoking and encourage its 
franchisees to do the same. On Thursday, Dr. Joycelyn Elders, in the surgeon 
general's annual report on smoking, sternly warned young people that "tobacco 
addicts and it kills." 
</P>
<P>
 The industry is further under siege because President Clinton's health care 
reform agenda proposes to raise the federal cigarette tax by 75 cents per pack, 
up from the current 24 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarette smoking has been proved to contribute to heart disease, strokes and 
a variety of cancers and respiratory ailments. Health officials blame smoking 
for an estimated 434,000 deaths annually. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, as anti-smoking measures have proliferated at local levels, 
public interest groups have stepped up their pressure on the federal government 
to take aggressive action. But until now, Washington has done little to heed 
those calls, with previous FDA commissioners adamantly refusing to assume 
jurisdiction over tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, which seeks to navigate a potential legal minefield, Kessler 
said cigarettes can be regulated as a drug because of "accumulating (evidence) 
that suggests that cigarette manufacturers may intend that their products 
contain nicotine to satisfy an addiction on the part of some of their 
customers." 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler also cited research showing that "77% of smokers desire to quit but 
cannot primarily because of nicotine addiction." 
</P>
<P>
 "Although technology was developed years ago to remove nicotine from 
cigarettes and to control with precision the amount of nicotine in cigarettes," 
Kessler said, "cigarettes are still marketed with levels of nicotine that are 
sufficient to produce and sustain addiction." 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler's letter came just days before the scheduled airing of an 
investigation by ABC-TV's "Day One" program alleging that the tobacco industry 
has "for years" added extra nicotine to cigarettes to enhance their addictive 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 But an FDA official said the timing of Kessler's letter was a coincidence. "We 
did it when the letter was finally in shape," the official said, adding that he 
has been aware of the developing legal strategy for nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his tough words, Kessler said the agency would defer to Congress on 
whether to regulate cigarettes, noting: "Given the widespread use of cigarettes 
and the prevalence of nicotine addiction, such a regulatory action could have 
dramatic effects on society," including, he said, the potential emergence of a 
black market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognize that the regulation of cigarettes raises societal issues of 
great complexity and magnitude," Kessler said. "It is vital in this context 
that Congress provide clear direction to the agency."

U.S. EXPELS RUSSIAN OVER SPY SCANDAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration on Friday expelled Russia's reputed espionage 
station chief, who officials said has worked here under diplomatic cover as a 
counselor in the Russian Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton ordered the expulsion of Aleksandr Iosifovich Lysenko -- 
described by U.S. officials as the "resident," or chief intelligence officer -- 
at the Russian Embassy after Russia failed to withdraw him voluntarily. 
Administration officials had demanded his withdrawal after the arrest of CIA 
officer Aldrich H. Ames on charges of having been a Kremlin double agent. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said they continue to hope that the Russians would voluntarily 
take other actions the Administration had insisted upon, including reducing the 
total number of intelligence agents in the United States and publicly 
identifying others. They suggested that further moves might be taken if the 
Russians declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not rule out taking additional action against any other Russian 
diplomats who are subsequently implicated in the Ames affair," State Department 
spokesman Mike McCurry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian government formally protested the action, issuing a statement 
complaining that there are "circles both in the United States and in Russia 
that are not interested in the friendship of the two major powers." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are against the attempts by special (intelligence) services to drag 
political leaders of the countries into their own mutual relations," the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The expulsion came only hours after Clinton, at a press conference, vowed that 
the United States would act "soon" if Russia did not take "appropriate action" 
in the Ames case. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Clinton appealed to Congress not to torpedo the 
Administration's plans for financial aid to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In a morning meeting at the White House, congressional leaders warned Clinton 
that aid requests for Russia are in danger because of the spying incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were at least two of us in the room of each party who indicated that 
Russian aid, at least as it is currently constructed, is in some trouble," Sen. 
Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 In his press conference, Clinton acknowledged the complaints from lawmakers 
and said he "urged them to resist calls to reduce or suspend our assistance for 
reform in Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 "Support of the United States for reform in Russia does not flow from a sense 
of charity or blind faith," Clinton said. "Our policy is based on our clear 
American interests clearly pursued." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the U.S. money goes to help dismantle nuclear weapons that the former 
Soviet Union once aimed at the United States, he noted. Most of the rest, he 
said, goes not to the Russian government but to groups trying to put together 
private enterprises in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government has long known that a certain number of Russians in the 
United States as diplomats are, in fact, spies working under cover. 
</P>
<P>
 The government tolerates their presence up to a point because the CIA uses the 
same sort of diplomatic cover in its overseas operations. When spy cases become 
public, as the Ames case did this week, expulsions generally follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Expelling Lysenko -- declaring him persona non grata in formal diplomatic 
parlance -- was in some ways an unusually harsh sanction. In most past spy 
cases, the United States has expelled lower-ranking agents rather than the 
resident himself. At the same time, the United States softened the blow by not 
expelling others and by giving Lysenko seven days to depart, rather than the 
48-hour Cold War standard. 
</P>
<P>
 The expulsions were the first since 1986 when, in a massive operation, the 
Ronald Reagan Administration kicked 80 Soviet officials out of the country -- a 
move that set off a retaliatory war of diplomatic expulsions that lasted for 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a much different time," McCurry said, referring to that case. "That 
was the time of the adversarial relationship we had with the then-Soviet Union 
in the Cold War. This is a much different era, I think, as you all know." 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry said the Administration chose to expel Lysenko, who apparently has 
only held the resident post for a few months, because he was "in a position to 
be responsible for the activities associated with the Ames espionage case." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, U.S. officials had privately demanded that the Russians 
make a voluntary act of contrition. But as the Russians dragged their feet on 
that request, Clinton began to come under heavy fire from Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not the time to negotiate," Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said Friday before 
the expulsion was ordered. "When people are caught with their hands in the 
cookie jar, then they ought to be expelled." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Nunn's comments, Clinton denied the United States had been 
"negotiating" with the Russians, saying that his Administration had told 
Russian officials what it expected and had given them a set amount of time in 
which to act. 
</P>
<P>
 The President also downplayed suggestions in some news reports that federal 
investigators believe a second double agent may have been involved in the Ames 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it happens that when you're in a criminal investigation and you're 
onto something, the investigation turns up information that could not have been 
anticipated at the beginning," Clinton said. But, he quickly added, "I'm not 
trying to raise some tantalizing inference, I'm just saying that we have to 
keep going and try to root it out."

RIOTS ERUPT IN WAKE OF MOSQUE MASSACRE IN W. BANK; 60 DEAD; ISRAEL: MORE THAN 
300 ARE WOUNDED OVERALL AS CLASHES TURN DAY INTO BLOODIEST SINCE 1967 WAR.

 Riots broke out across the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip on 
Friday, leaving at least a dozen people dead, as Palestinians protested the 
dawn massacre by a Jewish settler of 48 Muslims as they prayed in a mosque in 
Hebron, south of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 people were wounded throughout the day, scores during the 
massacre at the mosque and the rest in clashes that followed there, in other 
West Bank towns, the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem's Old City, according to figures 
compiled from hospital reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The day was the bloodiest in the occupied territories since Israel captured 
them during the 1967 Middle East War, and the carnage put in jeopardy the 
negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on 
limited Palestinian self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin called the attack "a loathsome criminal 
act of murder," and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat warned of "a very negative 
backfire on the whole peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 Baruch Goldstein, a Brooklyn-born physician in Kiryat Arba, an Israeli 
settlement on the outskirts of Hebron, burst into the Ibrahim Mosque in the 
Cave of the Patriarchs during the early morning service Friday and opened fire 
on the more than 600 Muslims praying there. The shrine is holy to both Jews and 
Muslims as the burial place of Abraham. 
</P>
<P>
 Methodically reloading his assault rifle with extra magazines, Goldstein fired 
for more than 10 minutes, according to witnesses, and killed or wounded more 
than a third of the congregation, including a number of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Unchecked by the five Israeli soldiers guarding the shrine, Goldstein was 
finally subdued by survivors and beaten to death with an iron bar, witnesses 
said. Anticipating his likely death, Goldstein had left a farewell note at the 
Kiryat Arba municipal offices, declaring his "love of Israel." 
</P>
<P>
 Active in the extremist Kach movement, Goldstein had apparently come to view 
Palestinians as "Arab Nazis" determined to destroy Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in the midst of the prayers when I heard shots and saw the head of 
the man in front of me explode," said Hamad abu Shareh, 52, a hardware store 
owner. "Then I saw others hit -- in their backs, in their heads, in their 
chests as they turned -- and blood was spraying everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I turned, I saw this Jew with a kippa (skullcap), a black beard like those 
that settlers wear and in an army uniform, and he was firing and firing and 
firing, using his gun like a hose." 
</P>
<P>
 Suleiman abu Saleh, 33, the guard of the mosque, said the gunman "was trying 
to kill as many as possible. He would fire until his (ammunition clip) was 
empty, come out and reload and go in again to fire." 
</P>
<P>
 After the attack, Rabin telephoned Arafat to express his sorrow. "As an 
Israeli, I am ashamed of this deed," he told the PLO leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a difficult day for all those, Jews and Arabs, who seek peace," Rabin 
said in a statement. "However, the crazed actions of disturbed individuals will 
not prevent the reconciliations between citizens of the state of Israel and the 
Palestinian people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will do everything necessary to advance the peace talks, to prevent 
misunderstandings, to remove obstacles in the way and to reach, together, the 
day of peace -- the day on which extremists on both sides will lose all hope of 
damaging the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian leaders in reply demanded that Rabin disarm the 130,000 Israeli 
settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, pull his forces out of the areas that 
will become autonomous under the peace accord and accelerate the transition to 
self-rule. The PLO also called for an international peacekeeping force for the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 "This atrocity proves there is no need to defend the settlers from the 
Palestinians but a need to defend the Palestinians from the settlers," said 
Faisal Husseini, the principal PLO figure on the West Bank. He warned that the 
Hebron massacre would have "a very negative impact" on the peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
 At an emergency Cabinet meeting in Tel Aviv, dovish ministers from Rabin's 
Labor Party and its leftist partner, Meretz, also called for disarming the 
settlers, outlawing Kach and other extreme right-wing groups, dismantling 
Israeli settlements in and around Hebron and pulling Israeli forces back to 
their bases to avoid further clashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin ordered that Kiryat Arba residents not be allowed to enter or leave 
their community without military permission, and he put Jewish residents of 
Hebron under round-the-clock curfew; he said he will consider the other 
suggestions over the weekend and raise them at the regular Cabinet meeting 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I warned for months that eventually something like this (massacre) would 
happen," said Immigration Minister Yair Tsaban, a Meretz member, renewing his 
demand that Kach be banned. "The writing was on the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Kach leaders praised Goldstein as a "holy hero who was killed for the glory of 
God." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Goldstein, a Jew who treated dozens of victims of Arab terror with his 
sympathetic hands, saw and felt every day the savagery of the Arabs who wounded 
and murdered Jews whose only sin was their Jewishness," the group said, 
accusing the Rabin government of failing to protect settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Baruch Marzel, a Kach leader who lives in Hebron, added, "We would have been a 
lot happier with the whole thing if Dr. Goldstein, a righteous man, was not 
killed. With him dead, we cannot be happy." 
</P>
<P>
 The slain Palestinians "were not innocent," Marzel said, accusing them of 
being in the crowd Thursday evening that had chanted "Death to the Jews" during 
services at the Cave of the Patriarchs marking the Jewish festival of Purim. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kiryat Arba, the municipal council expressed its "regret" over the massacre 
but pointedly did not condemn the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "The blame must be directed at the government of Israel and its head, Prime 
Minister and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who is abandoning security, 
(leading to) all the unending acts of murder in Gaza, Judea and Samaria, 
especially since negotiations with the PLO began," the council said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein's friends in Kiryat Arba and Hebron suggested that the father of 
four had suffered an emotional breakdown after members of a fundamentalist 
Islamic group, Hamas, gunned down a close friend, Mordechai Lapid, and his son 
in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the murders of the Lapid family, he was in crisis, a mental crisis," 
Noam Arnon said. "We could see that this incident took him out of his normal 
balance." 
</P>
<P>
 Several groups, all previously unknown, claimed in telephone calls to Israeli 
and international news organizations that they had executed the attack. One 
said the intent was to drive Palestinians out of Hebron, another said it was to 
avenge the 1990 New York murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane, Kach's founder, and a 
third said it was a response to recent murders of settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 But most Israelis, including those sympathetic to the settlers' efforts to 
reclaim all the territory that was part of the biblical Land of Israel, reacted 
with horror to the Hebron killings and the subsequent violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the opposition Likud Party, strongly condemned 
the attack as "a terrifying and abominable crime." "I call for restraint by all 
(in Hebron), Jews and Arabs, Muslims and Christians, everyone," he said. "We 
are all sitting in the same boat. We cannot drill holes in the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Angry protests broke out almost immediately in Hebron as relatives and friends 
besieged the city's two hospitals, townspeople said, and clashed with troops. 
One man was shot and killed by soldiers in front of one of the hospitals, 
according to the Palestine Human Rights Information Center here. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men were killed in refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, according to 
military sources, as troops sought to curtail protests. The region was closed 
by the Israeli military commander, preventing Palestinians from crossing into 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beit Jala, south of Jerusalem, settlers shot and killed a Palestinian after 
their bus was stoned. Two deaths were reported at the Kalandiyeh refugee camp 
north of Jerusalem, another in Nablus and four in a clash in Kufr Qaleel, a 
town south of Nablus. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jerusalem, police battled rock-throwing Palestinian youths in the Old City 
for more than six hours after midday prayers at Al Aqsa mosque. The clash began 
as youths pelted Jews praying below at the Western Wall of the old temple with 
rocks, driving them away. Police responded with volleys of tear-gas grenades 
and rubber bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 An 18-year-old Palestinian was fatally wounded during police pursuit of 
demonstrators through the Old City's maze of narrow streets, alleys and 
stairways, and more than 60 others were treated at Jerusalem hospitals for 
gunshot wounds and other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Israeli town of Kfar Sava, an elderly American immigrant, Morris 
Eisenstat, 80, a retired New York policeman and a member of Israel's volunteer 
civil guard, was hacked to death with an ax as he sat in the sun on his 
customary park bench reading the paper.

 NEXT STAR: Retiring County Supervisor Ed Edelman shouldn't be out of the 
spotlight for too long. Who knows? The next stop might be the Hollywood Walk of 
Fame. After all, ex-San Fernando Valley City Councilman Ernani Bernardi, who 
blew the sax for Benny Goodman and Tommy Dorsey, recently got a star. (B1).. . 
. Edelman, who loves the cello, has sat in with the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 LOSING PATTERN: CSUN's baseball team (4-7) these days is starting to make a 
habit of losing tight games to highly ranked teams. The latest example was 
Friday, when the Matadors lost 5-4 to sixth-ranked Oklahoma State. . . . Coach 
Bill Kernen keeps hoping players will think big against top teams: "We have to 
believe we belong in the same neighborhood." (C16)

 TIME TO HEAL: The quake inflicted serious damage on our collective psyche. 
Well, after six weeks of soul-searching, the Valley can continue the difficult 
healing process: quake-damaged Nordstrom, above, reopens today. "It will make 
people feel better to know that their store is coming back," said a Topanga 
Plaza spokeswoman. . . . Meanwhile, 105 of the mall's 130 specialty stores are 
back in business. 
</P>
<P>
 TIME TO HEAL II: Sometime this weekend, Universal Studios will put the 
earthquake ride back on its regular tour. The attraction has been closed since 
Jan. 17 because the studio has not felt it was appropriate. . . . Now it is. 
"Our thoughts are still with those affected by the quake," a Universal official 
said, "but we feel many people want to get on with their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 HOLD THE MAG: All the news, however, is not so uplifting. Valley Magazine, 
which had to stop publication because of quake damage, won't hit the stands 
again until summer.. . . But for those hungering for tips on top eateries, rest 
assured that the magazine will publish its annual restaurant guide issue this 
year. Michael Arkush

 CHANGE OF TUNE: Jewish temples are usually reserved for holy events. So why 
are they hiring a deejay, setting up rides and serving cotton candy at the 
Temple Bat Yahm in Newport Beach on Sunday afternoon? . . . Most Jewish temples 
this weekend are celebrating Purim -- a festival day -- to commemorate the 
rescue of the Jews from a wicked oppressor many centuries ago. Says a 
spokeswoman: "A carnival is one way we can acquaint the children with the 
meaning of Purim."

 DON'T BE CRUEL: Here's a thorn for Gov. Pete Wilson, who addresses fellow 
Republicans at their convention today (A37): In Orange County, the conservative 
Illuminare magazine set up an unusual poll asking readers who they wanted as 
the Republican gubernatorial candidate this year. You won't find Wilson touting 
the results in his campaign literature. . . . Young Elvis got 73% of the vote, 
Old (Vegas) Elvis got 20% and Wilson just 7%. The magazine suggests an Elvis 
write-in on the June ballot.

 HOUSE PARTY: The young men of the Sigma Chi house at UC Irvine had one special 
guest in mind for Friday evening's house dedication ceremonies: Henry 
Segerstrom. He's not only patriarch of one of Orange County's foremost 
families, he's a founder of Sigma Chi at Stanford University in the 1940s. 
Sigma Chi is part of UCI's new on-campus Greek row. "We're no animal house," a 
spokesman says. "Mr. Segerstrom can be proud of our group."

 THEY'LL DO WINDOWS: If you think the latest crop of teen-agers lack 
responsibility, take a look at what they're doing at Villa Park High School 
today. Hundreds of students, with help from parents and school staff, will 
spend their Saturday cleaning up the campus, from renovating the snack bar to 
fixing the bathroom plumbing. They're calling it "Dustbuster II," since the 
same thing was a success last year. Says Sarah Yi, 17, one of the organizers: 
"We want to see a big change . . . a glowing look."

CENTRAL AMERICA; COSTA RICANS BAFFLED, ANGRY AT STRAINED RELATIONS WITH U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This nation, with its tradition of civilian rule, fair elections and peaceful 
stability, has long been portrayed as the oasis of Central America -- the apple 
in any U.S. government's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 But a series of disputes with Washington in the last year, culminating in U.S. 
protests over Costa Rican labor laws, have strained bilateral relations and 
left Costa Rican officials baffled and angry. 
</P>
<P>
 After presidential elections earlier this month, a new government will take 
office May 8, and many Costa Ricans are hoping that the normally friendly tone 
between the two countries will be restored. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the tension, some Costa Rican politicians say, is that the outgoing 
conservative government of President Rafael Calderon and his Social Christian 
Unity Party were close to the George Bush Administration and the Republican 
Party; many of the problems seemed to have popped up during the opening months 
of the Clinton Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a series of small things that, seen altogether, do give the 
impression of a certain chilling of (bilateral) relations," said Melvin Saenz, 
an official with the Foreign Ministry. The new Costa Rican government of 
President-elect Jose Maria Figueres "will be seen as more moderate than the 
Calderon government." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem erupted over Costa Rica's labor code. The AFL-CIO, in a 
report last year, complained that the laws hinder unions from organizing and 
fighting for their rights. The American federation filed a formal protest with 
the office of the U.S. Trade Representative, which launched an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake were millions of dollars in trade benefits that Costa Rica enjoys 
through the Generalized System of Preferences and the Caribbean Basin 
Initiative, which allow Costa Rican products into the U.S. market duty-free. 
</P>
<P>
 If the AFL-CIO complaint were to advance, Costa Rica would lose the 
privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 While some Costa Ricans agree that unions here are kept weak and activists are 
persecuted, especially in the booming textile maquiladoras, others argue that 
Costa Rica nevertheless has a freer labor system than other countries enjoying 
similar trade benefits, such as China. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed at what Calderon called the "arrogant attitude" of Washington, the 
Costa Rican government scrambled to lobby U.S. officials and to pass several 
labor reforms, including explicit guarantees of protection for union activists. 
</P>
<P>
 The tactic worked, at least for the time being. The AFL-CIO agreed to suspend 
its complaint last November but said it would continue to monitor several 
cases, including the firing of unionized pilots from the state airline. 
</P>
<P>
 For Costa Rica, the labor dispute flew in the face of the democratic image 
that San Jose likes to project, and it came on top of several other sources of 
friction. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States protested what it considered unfair compensation to a U.S. 
resident whose land in Costa Rica was expropriated, and the issue threatened to 
expand as 10 similar cases moved through the Costa Rican courts. At the behest 
of Sen. Jesse Helms (R.-N.C.), U.S. aid to Costa Rica and Inter-American 
Development Bank loans were suspended for 10 months, Saenz said. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the issue of extradition. The United States has been 
pressing for the extradition of several of its fugitive citizens who have taken 
refuge in Costa Rica. In a recent case, U.S. authorities spirited a fugitive 
out of Costa Rica under circumstances that the San Jose government considered 
suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Saenz, other officials and analysts say much of the apparent shift in 
relations may have more to do with Washington's shift in focus -- away from 
sustained interest in Central America. And a new emphasis on trade also factors 
into this, the analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. governments needed Costa Rica during the 1980s. The Ronald Reagan and 
Bush Administrations pumped huge amounts of money into Costa Rica to shore up 
its economy as they worked to oust the Sandinista government of neighboring 
Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. aid, which reached $400 million a year by the late 1980s, was just $15 
million last year, according to the Foreign Ministry.

EAST ASIA; MALAYSIAN STATE ROCKS TREND OF ONE-PARTY RULE; BREAKAWAY PARTY'S WIN 
IN SABAH IS NASTY SHOCK TO GOVERNMENT COALITION. PRIME MINISTER HAD STAKED HIS 
PERSONAL PRESTIGE ON A VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The political trend in East Asia seems clearly headed toward the one-party 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 Indonesia and Singapore are just two examples of countries under the 
authoritarian rule of single-party governments that promise the voters economic 
growth and jobs instead of liberal democracy. China, Vietnam and even Myanmar 
are finding much that they like about this new political hybrid. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysia, another of Asia's fast-growing economies, seemed well down the road 
to a one-party state as well. The government is dominated by a coalition called 
the National Front, whose major component is the United Malays National 
Organization of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
 But an election last weekend in the northern Borneo state of Sabah has left 
the government's hopes of domination badly dented and has seriously embarrassed 
the prime minister, who had staked his personal prestige on a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 When the votes were finally counted, a local, ethnic-based political group 
called the United Sabah Party headed by Joseph Pairin Kitingan, the state's 
chief minister, had narrowly defeated the National Front, capturing 25 of the 
48 seats in the state Assembly. National Front candidates captured the 
remaining 23. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabah joined Kelantan as the only two states in the country to fall to 
opposition parties, though the Islamic fundamentalist party now ruling Kelantan 
differed with Kuala Lumpur more over religion than politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Malaysia has 13 states, each with its own state legislature and a chief 
minister who functions like an American governor. The federal government is 
organized on British parliamentary lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Sabah Party had once been a part of the National Front but pulled 
out in 1990 in an act that Mahathir called a "stab in the back." Since then, 
the federal government has shown little mercy toward its political opponents in 
Sabah. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Jeffrey Kitingan, brother of the chief minister, was detained without 
trial for treason under the country's Draconian security laws. He was never 
charged with a crime, but he was not released until just before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief minister himself was then charged with corruption for steering a 
$40,000 government contract to relatives, a relatively minor offense in a 
country where federal officials are widely believed to skim off billions from 
government contracts each year. But Joseph Pairin Kitingan was convicted and 
fined $270, a penalty small enough under the law for him to remain in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 During the recent campaign for the state legislature, the National Front 
showed just how much political muscle is available to a ruling party when it 
has a stranglehold on the federal government. Not only did the entire federal 
Cabinet come to the remote province to campaign, but the country's national 
television and national newspapers dropped any pretense at impartiality and 
devoted huge efforts to the National Front cause. 
</P>
<P>
 In the closing days of the campaign, Mahathir provided a thinly veiled threat 
to the electorate: Support the National Front, or the impoverished state would 
be cut off from much-needed development assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Front pledged to spend $260 million building schools and a 
university in Sabah. But the arm-twisting is what everyone remembered. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the ethnic stew in Sabah proved stronger than politics. The United 
Sabah Party is supported mainly by Kadazans, the indigenous people in Sabah who 
are Christian, while Mahathir's party is Muslim. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahathir also seemed to underestimate the voters' concerns about preserving a 
separate political identity. States' rights are so important in Sabah that 
travelers from peninsular Malaysia still have to pass through the state's own 
immigration office. A Malaysian Surprise 
</P>
<P>
 An opposition party's upset victory in the Malaysian state of Sabah has left 
the government's hope of domination badly dented and has seriously embarrassed 
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabah's population: 2 million 
</P>
<P>
 Population of Malaysia: 20 million 
</P>
<P>
 Sabah's size: 28,460 square miles, about the same as South Carolina 
</P>
<P>
 Government: Each of Malaysia's 13 state states has its own legislature and a 
chief minister who functions like an American governor. Sabah Ethnic Breakdown 
</P>

CLINTON DEFENDS PLANNED TRIP ON BEHALF OF REP. ROSTENKOWSKI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton Friday defended his plan to make a campaign-style appearance 
in Chicago Monday on behalf of Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), an important 
congressional ally who is under investigation by a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee is facing his toughest 
reelection challenge, partly because of allegations that he improperly 
benefited by swapping stamps for cash at the House post office and charges that 
he misused office and campaign funds. He has denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 And Clinton vigorously denied that his planned appearance with Rostenkowski 
amounted to White House meddling in the two-year-old inquiry being conducted by 
the U.S. attorney here. The President said that he would go to Chicago because 
Rostenkowski has a critical role in the health care legislation that the 
Administration wants enacted this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still a presumption of innocence in this country," Clinton told 
reporters. "He (Rostenkowski) has not yet been charged with anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way in the world we would do anything like that," Clinton said of 
suggestions of White House interference. He noted that he had appeared with 
Rostenkowski on other occasions after the investigation had started but was not 
criticized for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his 36 years in the House and his prominent role as the nation's chief 
tax writer, Rostenkowski could be vulnerable in the five-way primary on March 
15 because of the highly publicized inquiry into his financial affairs. At one 
point, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination to avoid 
testifying before a federal grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago lawmaker recently paid $82,095 to the House stationery store, 
acknowledging that some of the items he bought with office funds actually were 
"for personal use." U.S. Atty. Eric H. Holder recently informed the House 
leadership that the investigation of Rostenkowski was now "in its final stages 
and will be concluded in the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, sources close to the case do not believe that the grand jury will 
return an indictment before the primary. If Rostenkowski is indicted while 
still a member of Congress, House Democratic Caucus rules would require that he 
step down as chairman pending trial of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton relied heavily on the 66-year-old lawmaker during last year's 
congressional battle over the Administration's economic program, which skimmed 
through both the House and Senate without a vote to spare. 
</P>
<P>
 The President said that he would make a joint appearance with another Chicago 
Democrat -- Rep. Mel Reynolds -- who also is facing primary opposition. 
Reynolds, a member of the House Ways and Means Committee, supported Clinton on 
the controversial budget bill and the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, presidents do not show their preference in intraparty primary 
fights.

EX-HUD AIDE DEAN SENTENCED TO 21 MONTHS; HOUSING: GORE'S COUSIN IS GIVEN THREE 
IDENTICAL TERMS BUT ALLOWED TO SERVE THEM CONCURRENTLY. THE JUDGE DECRIES 
CONDITIONS AT THE DEPARTMENT.

 Deborah Gore Dean was sentenced to 21 months in prison without parole and 
fined $5,000 Friday for her part in a Ronald Reagan Administration housing 
scandal that the federal judge likened to "locusts descending on a lettuce 
patch." 
</P>
<P>
 Pronouncing the sentence, U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan was scathing in his 
condemnation of the atmosphere at the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, where Dean worked as executive assistant to then-Secretary Samuel 
R. Pierce Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "What concerns me is the sense of honor that apparently was lost in that 
particular era among not just Ms. Dean but other political appointees as well," 
he said. Without mentioning Pierce by name, the judge said that little 
leadership was shown at HUD during those years. 
</P>
<P>
 The scandal, which drew little notice until the close of the Reagan 
Administration, centered on the awarding of housing rehabilitation contracts to 
developers with political connections to Dean, HUD and the Administration. Dean 
was convicted in late 1993 on 13 counts, including perjury, conspiring to 
defraud, accepting illegal gifts and concealing information. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten other HUD officials either have pleaded guilty or have been convicted in 
the scandal. Dean, the most prominent of those charged, has tried to blame the 
improprieties on Pierce, who has never been charged. Arlin M. Adams, the 
independent counsel who successfully brought actions against the 11 officials, 
said after Dean's sentencing that he has not closed his investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 39-year-old Dean, who runs an antique shop, is a cousin of Vice President 
Al Gore. Hogan sentenced her to three sentences of 21 months but ruled that 
they would be served concurrently. Dean was released on bond pending an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogan described Dean as "a young, immature individual who was given 
responsibilities far beyond her capability at HUD, and that she never should 
have been put in that position." But he also said that "the conduct of the 
defendant was intentional and serious." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter that the judge read aloud in court, Dean said: "I mourn the fact 
that this case has cast dishonor on myself, my family and a department whose 
mission I heartily admire." 
</P>
<P>
 Dean acknowledged in the letter that HUD's Moderate Housing Rehabilitation 
program "was largely maintained to deliver political favors for the 
Administration and the Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 "Political influence dominated the process," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to one specific case, she wrote, "I should not have entertained any 
inquiries from John N. Mitchell on any HUD matter." Mitchell, a close friend of 
Dean's mother and the Richard Nixon Administration attorney general who served 
a 14-month jail sentence for his role in the Watergate affair, was linked to 
the HUD scandal in testimony at Dean's trial by former Kentucky Gov. Louis 
Nunn. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn testified that developers paid him $644,000 in consulting fees for doing 
little beyond steering them in the right direction for a housing contract. Of 
these fees, he turned over $184,000 to Mitchell for his part in moving 
contracts to the developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Such actions created what Hogan called "a major scandal that eroded public 
confidence. Individuals were favored because they had political connections," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dean's sentence was the longest meted out so far in the scandal, 
Adams has called it "far too lenient under the circumstances." Dean could have 
been sentenced to a maximum of 57 years in jail and $3 million in fines.

MUSLIM-CROATIAN CEASE-FIRE APPEARS TO HOLD IN BOSNIA; BALKANS: THE TWO SIDES 
ARE TO MEET FOR TALKS IN WASHINGTON. THE TRUCE INCREASES PRESSURE ON THE SERBS 
TO STOP FIGHTING. 
</P>

<P>
 A truce between Muslim-led government and Croatian forces in Bosnia appeared 
to be taking hold Friday on the eve of Washington-sponsored talks to reunite 
the former allies. 
</P>
<P>
 Under intense international pressure, particularly from the United States, 
both sides seemed determined to make the truce work. Many previous cease-fires 
in the 22-month war have failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The world community has been seeking to turn a truce in Serbian-besieged 
Sarajevo into a lasting peace for Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 A Muslim-Croatian truce would increase pressure on the Serbs, considered the 
main aggressors, to stop fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian-Muslim clashes continued on several fronts, including Maglaj in 
north-central Bosnia. Bosnian radio said the city was reportedly under heavy 
shelling and several soldiers and civilians were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said in a letter to the U.N. Security 
Council that Serbian guns withdrawn from Sarajevo following a North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization ultimatum were being used to pound Maglaj, and he asked the 
world body to take action. 
</P>
<P>
 The Croatian-Muslim truce took effect after Croatian President Franjo Tudjman 
gave in to Western demands and accepted a U.S.-backed plan for a joint 
Muslim-Croatian state on Thursday. Bosnia's Serbs would be free to annex their 
land to Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic and the leader of the Bosnian Croats, 
Kresimir Zubak, left for Washington to negotiate with Bosnian Prime Minister 
Haris Silajdzic, who has been there for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslim-led government troops and Croatian militias have been fighting in 
central Bosnia and the southwestern city of Mostar for nearly a year. Their 
previous alliance against the Serbs, who have captured 70% of Bosnia, fell 
apart as they each sought to control the remaining 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials and Bosnian and Croatian radio reported fighting in central 
Bosnia, particularly around Vitez, before the truce took effect at noon local 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 But by evening, the United Nations observed only "very limited small-arms 
exchange of fire in Gornji Vakuf, Vitez and Mostar," said squadron leader David 
Fillingham, reached at the U.N. Bosnia command's headquarters in Kiseljak. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Croat spokesman Veso Vegar said, "The cease-fire is being respected" 
in Mostar, which is divided between Muslims and Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 In eastern Mostar, people crept out of cellars and swarmed into the 
sun-drenched streets -- a luxury for many who have long dared to sneak out only 
at night to fetch water. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly a year, about 50,000 Muslims have been under siege there, 
sandwiched between Croats in the western sector and Serbs on the other side.

MASSACRE IN THE MIDEAST; KILLINGS HARDEN OPPONENTS OF PEACE; REACTION: PROTESTS 
AGAINST TALKS WITH ISRAEL ERUPT THROUGHOUT ARAB WORLD. PLO DEMANDS A DISARMING 
OF ISRAELI SETTLERS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Arab world, already ambivalent about making peace with Israel, struggled 
Friday to absorb the consequences of the massacre of 48 Palestinian worshipers 
in a mosque in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestine Liberation Organization demanded an emergency meeting of the 
U.N. Security Council and a move to disarm Israeli settlers, while thousands of 
demonstrators marched through the streets of a Palestinian refugee camp in 
Jordan shouting, "No to peace and yes to the gun." 
</P>
<P>
 A British tourist was stabbed in the Jordanian capital, Amman, by a 
Palestinian who apparently was enraged by news of the Hebron killings, an 
official said. The 77-year-old tourist was reported in stable condition. 
</P>
<P>
 In Egypt, riot police deployed unobtrusively during midday prayers as an 
apparent precautionary move. 
</P>
<P>
 In Libya, television and radio stations broke from normal programming and 
broadcast somber music and readings from the Koran. Libyan leader Moammar 
Kadafi called the massacre "a horrible, terroristic crime . . . officially 
planned by the Israeli government." 
</P>
<P>
 PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, already battling a widening tide of opposition to 
his peace agreement with Israel, found himself facing a new storm of demands 
for an end to the peace talks even as he agreed to send a delegation to 
Washington for stepped-up negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of peace are you talking about, if the crimes and killings against 
our people do not stop?" Arafat asked. "This will have a serious impact, not 
just on the negotiations, but on all aspects and at all levels." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to calling for an emergency session of the U.N. Security Council, 
PLO officials renewed their call for international troops to be deployed in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to protect the 1.5 million 
Palestinians living there. They also called on Israel to disarm Jewish settlers 
in occupied Arab lands. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the past negotiations, the Israeli side was stressing the Israeli 
security requirements," said Yasser Abed-Rabbo, head of the PLO's information 
department. "This massacre has proved that security is a Palestinian need 
mainly, and for this reason, without having real guarantees for the security of 
the Palestinian people, I don't think the resumption of the talks, even in 
Washington, will lead to a successful result." 
</P>
<P>
 Abed-Rabbo, a member of the PLO Executive Committee, said the attack 
"powerfully demonstrates the need to dismantle Israeli settlements in the 
occupied territories, to evict and disarm the settlers, remove the army from 
populated areas and provide international protection." 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO in its talks with Israel has proposed the deployment of international 
troops, a suggestion the Israelis have rejected outright. It has also sought 
implementation of Security Council resolutions against Jewish settlements in 
occupied lands. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cairo, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amir Moussa backed the PLO's demand for a 
Security Council session and added: "This horrendous incident confirms the need 
for confronting extremism, which has hit many societies." 
</P>
<P>
 Moussa, who has acted as a mediator during the last several rounds of peace 
talks between Palestinians and Israelis, added that the incident demonstrated 
that security is a need for Palestinians "and not that of Israel alone." 
</P>
<P>
 The Arab League, which has been asked by the PLO to convene an emergency 
session of its foreign ministers, also backed the PLO's demand for 
international intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel Meguid said the league "holds Israel 
totally responsible for the souls who were killed this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 "This incident confirms once again the settlers' indifference to the law and 
the Israeli authorities' disregard of the settlers' crimes, which leads to 
dangerous escalation and threatens the peace process," Meguid said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat went into session with his top advisers Friday night and indicated that 
he would decide how quickly to send a peace delegation to Washington after 
gauging the response of the international community and of Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat responded positively to President Clinton's invitation to resume peace 
talks in Washington even as many of his top advisers were expressing doubts 
about the wisdom of pushing forward with the peace process, which in recent 
months has drawn widening opposition in Palestinian circles as the gains at the 
negotiating table have dwindled. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident appears sure to deal a strong card to Arafat's opponents, who 
have called for toppling the PLO chairman and violently undercutting the peace 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamic fundamentalist movement Hamas called on Arafat to "annul the peace 
process with the Zionists and instead engage in holy war against the Jews." 
</P>
<P>
 A coalition of Damascus-based radical groups that have opposed the Sept. 13 
Declaration of Principles signed between Israel and the PLO issued a joint 
statement in Lebanon vowing revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will retaliate with all our means and will redouble our struggle to 
undermine the accord of treason and topple Arafat, who has sold himself to the 
Zionists," they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Iran also weighed in, declaring on Tehran Radio that "without doubt, this 
crime took place with the cooperation of the military forces of the Zionist 
regime."

FBI DIRECTOR SEES PARALLELS BETWEEN RUSSIA NOW, CHICAGO THEN; CRIME: LOUIS J. 
FREEH DOESN'T WANT A SLAVIC AL CAPONE TO ENDANGER U.S. INVESTMENTS OR UNDERMINE 
THE FRAGILE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS. AND HE IS WORKING TO HELP PREVENT IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To FBI Director Louis J. Freeh, organized crime in Russia today bears 
disturbing similarities to Chicago's in the 1920s and 1930s -- violent but 
fractionalized, a danger to itself as much as to the rest of society, and with 
a potential for much more. 
</P>
<P>
 The likes of Al Capone, unchecked by the FBI or any other law enforcement 
body, welded the Chicago mob into a unified force that preyed on the community 
for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh does not want a Slavic equivalent of Capone to do the same today in 
Russia, for fear not only of endangering American business activity there but 
also of undermining that country's fragile democratic process. And he is 
working to help Russian authorities prevent it. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Freeh said, elements of Russian organized crime are responsible for 
everything from "bushwhacking" American businessmen to dealing in materials 
that could be used in nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 If authorities do not act soon, he said, organized crime will become so 
entrenched throughout the former Soviet Union and its Eastern European 
satellites that, like the Mafia in Chicago, it will take decades to remove it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to look at it as something that's clearly directed toward the United 
States, toward our economy," Freeh said in an interview. "Even with decreasing 
resources, we can't afford to do what the FBI did with respect to La Cosa 
Nostra for 30 years, and that was to completely ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
 The situation in Russia today, Freeh acknowledged, is not as dire as in 
Chicago in the 1920s and 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 But German and Russian law enforcement authorities "are concerned about the 
very rapid inroads that these gangs are making into officialdom, into police 
and government officials," the FBI director said. 
</P>
<P>
 To help the Russians cope, Freeh wants to station up to three FBI agents in 
Moscow by the end of spring to serve as liaisons with Russian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Contacts are now handled largely by two agents based in Bonn, who have 
responsibilities beyond the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities in Russia's Interior Ministry and the Moscow police "are 
desperately in need of our help," Freeh said. "They want our training, our 
methodology." 
</P>
<P>
 He also wants to bring Russian agents for 11 weeks of training at the FBI's 
National Academy in Quantico, Va., where they would learn about laboratory and 
computer work and the other technologies that the FBI uses against organized 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Freeh said, the victims of Russia's organized crime are mostly 
Russian entrepreneurs and other business people. But he warned that American 
businesses seeking a foothold in Russia are just as vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the (Clinton) Administration's program is to give not only economic 
aid but to (assist) economic institution-building and to encourage American and 
other foreign investments" in the former Soviet Union, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the scouts for leading American corporations are getting bushwhacked in 
their hotel rooms in Moscow or, perhaps worse, establishing a foothold and 
having to face extortion and economic criminal activity they are not prepared 
to do, our economy takes a serious hit," Freeh said. "The end product is that 
the process for democracy and a free economy in Russia takes a very significant 
step backward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's an irony, but it's much harder to police in a democratic fashion 
than to police in a totalitarian fashion," Freeh said. "Police work is very 
hard if you do it according to due process and democratically." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities in the former Soviet Union "don't have that experience and haven't 
had it for 70 years. So they're having to learn all of the tools, skills and 
techniques and, at the same time, deal with a burgeoning crime crisis," Freeh 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. authorities are particularly concerned that Russian gangs "are 
aggressively looking to buy and sell nuclear materials," the FBI director said. 
</P>
<P>
 The materials so far are less than weapons grade, but they could be used for 
designing devices deadly to population centers, according to FBI intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a whole different threat than we've faced before," Freeh said.  
</P>
<P>
 He declined to give any more specifics on the threat, but said the United 
States under the law now lacks authority to fully deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the 1950 Atomic Energy Act, the FBI has authority to investigate the 
transfer or shipment of nuclear materials only if their origin or destination 
is American or they have entered and left the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeh said he has discussed with Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and other Justice 
Department officials the need for a law broadening the FBI's authority over 
such matters.  
</P>
<P>
 The FBI is also interested in the criminal activities of Russian immigrants in 
the United States, according to Jim Moody, who directs the FBI's efforts 
against organized crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1970s and early 1980s, about 200,000 people entered the United 
States from the Soviet Union, and Moody estimated that about 1% of them -- 
2,000 -- were "hard-core criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 But he regards them as second-string players who are now being replaced by 
more highly skilled, educated lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the more sophisticated conspiracies involving Russian emigres, a 
federal grand jury in Philadelphia last June charged 15 people and two 
corporations with evading federal and state excise taxes on the sale of more 
than 51 million gallons of diesel fuel in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

RUSSIA COPS ARE ROBBERS, PROTECTION RACKET BOSS SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sonni Efron and Sergei Loiko 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has a full-time army of 120 thugs who collect money from 250 businesses 
each month, and he insists he is doing his "clients" a favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the police boss . . . could guarantee businessmen what we guarantee them, 
they would go to him and ask for protection," the unapologetic racketeer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Call him Alex. The 34-year-old crime boss agreed to a rare interview with 
foreign journalists on condition that neither he nor his city, a grimy 
industrial town in the Sverdlovsk district, be named. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex has a legitimate-looking business, calls himself a merchant and does not 
think of himself as a mobster. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say his outfit is "a typical bandit organization under the direct 
control" of Ekaterinburg's most famous crime boss, Konstantin Tsyganov. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Alex and his lawyer, and to some of the businesses they protect, it is 
the cops who are the robbers in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't blame the police for taking bribes, because they have to have a 
salary of at least $640 a month to be able to feed their families," Alex said. 
"But before their salaries go up, about 70% of them should be fired. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Police now take their bribes like this: They want to buy a sheepskin coat or 
a VCR that costs maybe $400, but the stores sell it to them for $50 to avoid 
problems. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they keep raiding a certain firm until they get a car or something 
big in return for leaving them in peace," he said. "They are racketeers and 
extortionists, but are protected by the law. They milk business, but provide 
little or no protection. And they hate us, because we are their competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Alex insisted that his men have never threatened any business person into 
paying protection money. On the contrary, he said, local businesses desperate 
for powerful friends offer to pay him up to 30% of their monthly profit in 
exchange for a wide array of services. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses under Alex's wing are given a "cooperation agreement" by his firm. 
They can wave this document in the faces of competing extortionists, burglars 
and street thugs, who tend to steer clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex's security guards stop by every day, sometimes several times a day, to 
make sure their clients are not being harassed. 
</P>
<P>
 In case of trouble, Alex said, his men have a huge arsenal: pistols, 
Kalashnikov assault rifles and Uzi sub-machine guns, antitank guns, grenade 
launchers and hand grenades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The market is full of weapons," Alex said. "We can always buy weapons from 
the military. We have lots of ammunition too." 
</P>
<P>
 He believes that it will soon be needed for an impending mob war. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the protection racket, Alex said he oversees the local prostitution 
business, but he is firmly opposed to drug trafficking.

 "We all have children," he said by way of explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 If a client's car is stolen, Alex said his men find it. If an apartment is 
burglarized, they retrieve the stolen merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our ways of tracking these things down," he said. The police cannot 
be bothered to do so, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex said he cannot promise to keep the tax inspector at bay, as a new and 
vigorous collection system has recently been instituted. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not say whether he had managed to co-opt the old tax officials. The 
police, however, do not trouble his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't need to bother to try to buy the cops," Alex's lawyer said sourly.

PROSTITUTION REPORT ACCUSES U.N. TROOPS IN MOZAMBIQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The troubled U.N. peacekeeping operation -- often criticized for doing too 
much in Somalia and too little in Bosnia-Herzegovina -- felt the sting of a new 
blow Friday when an official report accused its soldiers of encouraging 
prostitution in Mozambique and buying sex there from underage girls. 
</P>
<P>
 The report was released in Maputo, the Mozambican capital, by Behrooz Sadry, 
the deputy chief of the U.N. mission, who urged reporters to look on its 
findings not as a sex scandal but as "a defense of the children of Mozambique." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadry, who headed a team of investigators, refused to release the names and 
nationalities of offending peacekeepers but said they had been sent home. 
</P>
<P>
 News reports have singled out Italian soldiers, the second-largest contingent 
in Mozambique, as the main offenders and described the young prostitutes as 
girls 12 to 14 years old. But Aldo Ajello, an Italian who is chief of the U.N. 
mission in Mozambique, has said it is "untrue, unjust and unfair" to blame only 
the Italians. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than 6,000 U.N. peacekeeping troops in the southeast African 
nation, assigned to monitor a cease-fire between government and rebel troops 
after 14 years of civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 The peacekeepers, in order of their numbers, come from Bangladesh, Italy, 
India, Zambia, Uruguay, Botswana, Portugal, Japan and Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadry said the large number of soldiers and their relative wealth in one of 
Africa's poorest countries had led to "a publicly perceptible increase in 
prostitution." 
</P>
<P>
 Accusations of sexual misconduct by the troops with child prostitutes had 
first come from foreign relief workers in Mozambique. In response to these 
complaints, Ajello ordered his deputy in December to conduct the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the sex scandal, the Mozambique peacekeeping mission is regarded as 
one of the United Nations' most successful. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the Security Council urged the Mozambicans to set a general 
election for no later than October. If that schedule is followed, the 
resolution said, the U.N. peacekeeping mission will depart at the end of 
November, when a new government is to take office.

 The United States warned Americans traveling in Israel to stay out of East 
Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip after Friday's fatal shootings of 
48 Arabs praying in a Hebron mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department also cautioned Americans to exercise caution when 
traveling throughout the Middle East and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "In light of the recent tragic deaths in Hebron and the violence which has 
stemmed from those murders, the Department of State advises all American 
citizens to avoid travel in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza at this 
time," the department said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The department warned, "Americans traveling throughout the Middle East and 
Europe should exercise special caution by being particularly aware of their 
surroundings, avoiding all crowds and demonstrations and maintaining a low 
profile."

HAITI ARMY SENSES VICTORY IN U.S.-ARISTIDE SPLIT; CARIBBEAN: 'THEY ARE 
SURVIVING THE EMBARGO AND THEY ARE LAUGHING,' A DIPLOMAT SAYS OF THE MILITARY. 
GAS FLOWS INTO THE COUNTRY DESPITE BAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The open and bitter conflict between the Clinton Administration and 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide has left the military here confident that it has 
defeated conclusively all attempts to restore the exiled Haitian president to 
power, according to diplomats and Haitian political experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have control of the country," one diplomat said of the military, "and 
they have no reason to change. They are surviving the embargo and they are 
laughing. They just don't feel the pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 The growing U.S.-Aristide dispute, which reached a public breaking point this 
week, has accompanied a virtual flood of gasoline into Haiti in defiance of a 
worldwide petroleum embargo designed to crush resistance to Aristide's 
restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 So much fuel has come over the border from neighboring Dominican Republic in 
the last week that the black market price for gasoline and diesel fuel dropped 
nearly $3 a gallon in two days from a high of nearly $9. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's still a very high price, and it's not enough to restore things to 
normal," a Haitian businessman said, "but it is certainly enough for the 
military to keep control." 
</P>
<P>
 But the sources said the military victory is even more strongly perceived in 
the angry impasse between Aristide and the United States over a plan proposed 
by anti-Aristide legislators and endorsed by the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (the military) have won," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for Aristide to name a prime minister and Cabinet acceptable to 
his domestic foes and to pardon the army officers who engineered his 1991 
overthrow before he would be allowed to return to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 While Aristide rejected that sequence on grounds that it rewarded the people 
who deposed him and would undercut his ability to govern, he was most offended 
because the proposal made no mention of a date or timetable for his 
restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide, a fiery Roman Catholic priest who won an overwhelming election 
victory on a radically populist platform in 1990, had demanded that the 
military step aside before he would name a new government. 
</P>
<P>
 He also demanded that he return 10 days after the agreement was finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not just Washington's endorsement of the proposal drafted by some of 
Aristide's strongest opponents that has disheartened Aristide supporters here. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was bad enough," said one international official connected to the 
diplomatic effort to restore democracy, "but what Christopher said all but 
killed any chance of pressuring the military to give in." 
</P>
<P>
 He was referring to a position taken by U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher earlier this week to prevent the extension of the economic boycott 
imposed on Haiti last October when the army reneged, for at least the second 
time, on an accord to bring Aristide home. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher told a congressional committee Wednesday that any strengthening of 
the embargo, now limited to petroleum products and arms, would depend on 
Aristide's acceptance of the legislators' plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide dismissed the plan again Thursday as unworthy of consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "What signal do you think that sent to the military?" asked another 
international official, who added that Christopher acted without informing or 
even consulting other nations involved in forcing the military to give way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is in a state of confusion," said another diplomat from that 
group, known as the "Four Friends of Haiti" -- the United States, Canada, 
Venezuela and France. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is there confusion among diplomats who thought of themselves as 
allies; sources say U.S. policy seems to have lost focus and purpose, an 
assessment echoed by a prominent businessman who recently met in Washington 
with Aristide and key State Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
 He reported that the situation is so bad that Aristide has cut off all direct 
contact with U.S. officials, who are reduced to asking those who have visited 
Aristide privately what the Haitian leader thinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this stage," another Haitian expert said, "the Administration seems to 
have lost all perspective" because of its anger over what U.S. officials see as 
Aristide's stubborn and unrealistic refusal to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "In one sense," said a diplomat here, "I understand the State Department's 
position. It is clear that Aristide is part of the problem, and that he either 
doesn't understand that the military (and his civilian opponents) are here to 
stay and he needs to negotiate with them, or he really doesn't want to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, I have to agree in part with Aristide; what reason has he to trust 
the Americans?" 
</P>
<P>
 The diplomat gave as an example of Washington's wavering the American refusal 
to extend the embargo in spite of a U.S.-supported U.N. Security Council 
resolution that called for an inclusive economic and commercial boycott if the 
military had not stepped down by last Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "And for high officials to publicly criticize Aristide, that surely didn't 
help," the diplomat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs of the military's confidence are plentiful. Human rights officials say 
murderous repression by the army and its allies has increased openly in spite 
of the return of international monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going on to show the country they will punish anyone who opposes them 
and that the international community can't do anything to stop them," said a 
foreign official based here. 
</P>
<P>
 The sense of victory also has ended speculation that there was a meaningful 
split within the military or that army commander Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras had 
planned to name himself as head of the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Some figures who said they spoke for Cedras' perceived rival, Port-au-Prince 
Police Chief Michel-Joseph Francois, and had begun charging that Cedras was 
planning a takeover suddenly changed their assessments Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Local radio stations reported, for instance, that Senate President Bernard 
Sansaricq, who had called for Cedras to resign and let Parliament name a new 
president, had recanted and was no longer charging the general with planning a 
new coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Several sources said there never was a split. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be differences of opinion over tactics," said one Haitian political 
expert with close ties to the military, "but they are unified on the main goal: 
Keep Aristide out." 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, observers say, that goal has been reached.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have to come up with something new," one of the diplomats said, "but with 
the army convinced we (the international community) are either supporting them 
in secret or are foolish weaklings and Aristide refusing to compromise or 
accept reality, I don't see any way out."

MEXICO VILLAGERS MOUNT VIGIL AS REMAINS ARE EXAMINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As government and rebel officials sought Friday to negotiate an agreement to 
resolve the tumult that recently erupted in this southern Mexican region, 
families in this troubled village hoped to find their own peace this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Thursday, three women -- who believe that they have been made widows by 
the army -- have kept vigil outside a health clinic, where strangers, inside, 
have been examining a hodgepodge of bones. The women contend that the bones are 
the remains of their husbands, whom they have not seen since Jan. 7, when 
soldiers allegedly tortured the men, then took them away. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the remains are to be buried, although their positive identification 
must await results of sophisticated genetic tests at distant, urban 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's disappearance, and the apparent summary executions of rebels and 
hospital patients in nearby Ocosingo, are just some of the human rights abuses 
allegedly committed by the army, when soldiers put down the rebels' Jan. 1 
uprising in the state of Chiapas. The cases are under Defense Ministry 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The government-funded National Human Rights Commission on Tuesday said that 
there were 727 allegations of misdeeds during the rebel revolt; 76 of the 
accusations were made against the army. The panel has received 56 accusations 
involving murder, 80 of torture, 42 of illegal detentions and four aerial 
military attacks; 23 people, including the missing villagers, are still 
unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, in keeping with its practices, is refraining from comment 
until the Defense Ministry publishes its investigation, Commissioner Jorge 
Madrazo said on a visit here Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mexicans are growing increasingly skeptical about the army investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 In the cases here, the Defense Ministry denied that soldiers had been in the 
village on Jan. 7, the day residents say troops came in and forced all men 
older than 12 to lie face down in the town square from 7 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. 
Severiano, Hermelindo and Sebastian Santiz -- who are unrelated, despite their 
common last name -- were taken to the church, where their heads were dunked in 
water; they were beaten and cut with knives, villagers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The soldiers wanted them to confess to being (rebels), but we are not, so 
they refused," said Humberto Santiz, 32, Sebastian's son. "Or at least we 
weren't. After what they have done to us, we are ready to take up arms now." 
</P>
<P>
 The villagers accuse the army of driving the men away in a panel truck, which 
appeared to be an ambulance because it bore a prominent red cross. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Defense Ministry has concluded that the men could not have been taken 
by soldiers because, by officials' reckoning, no troops were present that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, according to a Defense Ministry report, the bones that the villagers 
found on Feb. 10 were from four different individuals who had been dead at 
least eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 Humberto Santiz scoffed at that notion, asserting that the family had examined 
materials they believed to be his father's. The family "recognized his watch, 
his dental plate, cloth from his shirt and pants -- and we found a shoe," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Filled with distrust, villagers refused to allow another examination of the 
remains until Clyde Snow, a renowned forensic anthropologist, arrived here 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 During an earlier trip to Mexico, Snow had reviewed photographs of five 
bodies, found lined up in the Ocosingo market. 
</P>
<P>
 He concluded that the individuals probably were executed. The human rights 
commission reviewed the case with him and agreed, contradicting an earlier 
government report that had exonerated the army. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow's willingness to buck authorities in the earlier case impressed villagers 
here; they asked him to examine the bones they had rescued from vultures, five 
weeks after their neighbors had disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow was greeted with great enthusiasm and chose as his work site a two-room, 
brick health clinic that Severiano Santiz, one of the missing men, had built. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave the land for the clinic, then he organized everyone to build it," 
Carmelina Lopez said of her 60-year-old husband. "He was a brick mason and he 
loved community work." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, as Snow prepared the morgue, Lopez and the two other wives lit 
candles and followed the coffin carrying the bones from the church to the 
clinic. Snow sorted the bones; he fitted together skulls and found a dental 
plate among the remains that slipped perfectly onto one of them. That plate 
convinced Sebastian Santiz's family that one set of bones were his: A recent 
photograph of balding Santiz shows him smiling slightly, displaying a row of 
perfect, false, front teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrona Lopez has no doubts about why the army chose to torture her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the one who went to Mexico City and found out that the land next to us 
was federal land," she said. Morelia, a semi-communal farm, had fought for more 
land, and, when Sebastian learned four years ago that the area next to the 
village -- where a landowner had pastured cattle -- belonged to the government, 
he laid claim to 400 acres for Morelia. He got them. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad was a man who knew how to get things done," recalled Humberto. "He got 
us water, electricity and a road. That is why he was elected commissioner for 
two different terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Paulina Dominguez, a sweet-faced woman, was less certain about why she has 
been left to raise three children -- the youngest age 8 -- alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He liked to work in the field and to have a little drink at night," she said 
of her husband, Hermelindo, 42. "I have loved him ever since we were children. 
I can feel that he no longer exists. I just want to finally bury him."

MALAYSIA BARS BRITISH FIRMS FROM CONTRACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES P. WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an extraordinary display of official anger at foreign press coverage, 
Malaysia announced Friday that British companies will be banned from government 
contracts because of reports in Britain's media about official corruption in 
past business deals. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who announced the new policy at a press 
conference in Kuala Lumpur, said the government had canceled contracts with 
British firms in an Anglo-Japanese consortium building a $3.5-billion 
international airport in the capital. The loss of the deal is expected to cost 
British companies $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Anwar, who is also the country's finance minister, said the "final blow" was a 
report in London's Sunday Times last week alleging that Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohammed had solicited and received a $50,000 payment from a British 
construction company in return for a contract to build an aluminum smelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I am disgusted with the attack on the person of the prime 
minister, who while leading Malaysia in its current, most rapid and successful 
period of economic development has not amassed wealth for himself," Anwar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anwar said the Malaysian Cabinet had agreed to the trade ban Wednesday because 
the British press had made Malaysia "an object of derision and scorn." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp., Malaysia's international 
trade minister, Rafidah Aziz, said her government's policy toward British firms 
would not affect trade with private companies in Malaysia. Two-way trade 
between Britain and Malaysia was more than $1.8 billion in the first 10 months 
of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafidah said the trade ban will remain in force until the problem with the 
British press had been remedied, but she did not indicate what that meant. She 
scoffed when an interviewer suggested that the British press was independent of 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rafidah ruled out the possibility that Mahathir or other members of the 
government would file a lawsuit for libel; they are too busy, she said. British 
law does not prevent public figures from filing libel cases, as U.S. statutes 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahathir is notoriously sensitive to perceived slights from the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said, for example, that he has never forgiven the U.S. government 
for the fact that after he requested an audience with former President George 
Bush during a stopover in Boston, Bush met him in a locker room at Boston 
College instead of in more luxurious surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahathir refused to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit 
meeting called by President Clinton last November in Seattle.

INSPECTORS GET OK TO VISIT N. KOREA NUCLEAR FACILITIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 North Korea agreed Friday to allow U.N. inspectors to visit its nuclear 
facilities beginning Tuesday, U.S. and North Korean officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
 North Korea, which had been resisting international pressure to open sites 
suspected of building nuclear weapons, has been threatened with economic 
sanctions if it didn't comply. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Hubbard, a U.S. deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian and 
Pacific affairs, said the agreement was reached during talks late Friday with 
Ho Jong, North Korea's deputy ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Hans Blix, was to report 
Monday on whether North Korean leaders would admit agency inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Ho said that in the talks the United States agreed to call off joint military 
exercises this year with South Korea, resume high-level talks in Geneva on a 
permanent settlement to the nuclear issue and allow the resumption of North 
Korean-South Korean talks on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

UNDER FIRE, TREASURY AIDE ENDS WHITEWATER ROLE; POLITICS: DEPUTY SECRETARY

 Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman on Friday removed himself from further 
official involvement in the government's Whitewater real estate probe after he 
came under fire for privately briefing top White House aides on key aspects of 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 He becomes the third high-ranking Clinton appointee to be accused of a 
conflict of interest in connection with the Whitewater affair. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate development, Rep. Jim Leach (R-Iowa), ranking Republican on the 
House Banking Committee, released new evidence to support allegations that 
President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, lost less money than they have claimed 
-- and perhaps even profited -- by investing in the Whitewater resort 
development with the owner of a failed savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman, who also serves as acting head of the Resolution Trust Corp., was 
severely criticized by Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee Thursday, 
when he disclosed that he briefed White House officials three weeks ago on an 
aspect of the RTC's investigation into the Whitewater case. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the Treasury Department noted that Altman's interim 
appointment as RTC chief will expire on March 30 and "he will have no role with 
the RTC beyond that time." Until then, it said, he plans to recuse himself from 
all of the agency's dealings involving Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC, created to resolve hundreds of savings and loan failures in the 
1980s, is investigating whether money from the now-defunct Madison Guarantee 
Savings & Loan of Little Rock was improperly funneled to the Whitewater 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of Madison, James B. McDougal, and his wife, Susan, were partners 
with the Clintons until 1992 in the Whitewater Development Corp., which was 
established to build a resort community in the Ozarks. 
</P>
<P>
 While the RTC continues to investigate matters involving Madison, a special 
counsel, Robert B. Fiske Jr., has been appointed by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to 
conduct a wider investigation of all matters relating to the Clintons' 
Whitewater investment. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue in the Whitewater controversy is whether Clinton, who was then 
governor of Arkansas, or Mrs. Clinton benefited improperly from the investment. 
The Clintons have insisted they are innocent of any wrongdoing and say they 
lost money on the deal because the lots did not sell as well as anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 As the federal investigations have progressed, two other top-ranking White 
House officials besides Altman have been accused of conflicts in the affair. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Deputy Counsel Vincent Foster, who police say committed suicide 
last summer, was criticized for acting as the Clinton's personal attorney in 
the matter while on the government payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum has been taken to task by 
Republicans for allowing the Whitewater files to be removed from Foster's 
office before it was searched by law enforcement officials investigating the 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by Republicans, Altman acknowledged that he met with 
Nussbaum and other White House officials to discuss the options facing the RTC 
in light of the then-impending Feb. 28 expiration date for all civil suits 
related to Madison and Whitewater. That deadline has since been repealed by 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman's decision to recuse himself from Whitewater-related matters represents 
a turnaround on his part. Just recently, he told Leach that he saw no conflict 
in his dealings with the case, even though he is a Clinton appointee. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Leach, who has undertaken his own investigation, issued previously 
undisclosed portions of a Little Rock attorney's 1992 interview with James 
McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape adds new elements to McDougal's claim that the Clintons did not lose 
$68,000 on the deal, as they have said. McDougal contends they never invested 
more than about $13,500. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, conducted by Republican attorney Sheffield Nelson, McDougal 
contends that a $30,000 loan taken out by Mrs. Clinton on Dec. 16, 1980, was 
repaid entirely from Whitewater funds. The loan was taken out to pay for a 
model home to help spur sales at the resort and the home was carried as a 
corporate asset of Whitewater, McDougal said. Mrs. Clinton borrowed the money 
from the Bank of Kingston, Ark., because McDougal, who owned the bank, was 
barred by law from receiving a loan from his own institution.  
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, McDougal also disputed the Clintons' claim on their 1980 tax 
return that they made a $9,500 interest payment to him. "They didn't pay me," 
he said. "They may have paid someone else. They have never paid me a penny's 
interest. They never owed me any money." 
</P>
<P>
 If McDougal's version of these transactions proves to be accurate, according 
to an analysis by Leach's House Banking Committee staff, it is likely that the 
Clintons "lost no money in Whitewater" and may be liable for unpaid taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons already have acknowledged they improperly took tax deductions in 
1984 and 1985 on interest payments actually made by the Whitewater partnership. 
They later filed amended tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 While the tape elaborates on McDougal's story, the former thrift owner readily 
admits that he has no records to support his recollections. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on evidence previously made public, investigators believe that McDougal 
may have illegally diverted money from Madison to help pay off the loan that 
Mrs. Clinton took out to finance the model home at Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of Nelson's 1992 interview with McDougal was previously provided to 
some reporters by sources who asked not to be identified. In it, McDougal 
ridiculed the Clinton's claim that they lost $68,000 on the deal but offered no 
details. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could sink it quicker than they could lie about it if I could get in a 
position so I wouldn't have my head beaten off," McDougal told Nelson, whose 
legal help he was seeking. "And Bill (Clinton) knows that." 
</P>
<P>
 Aides to Leach said they obtained a tape of the interview that included 
comments by McDougal that had not been transcribed earlier. In an interview 
with The Times, Nelson verified the accuracy of the newly disclosed material. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal said that the $30,000 loan was paid down to $13,000 at the time he 
said the Clintons "assumed control of the corporation" in 1988. He said they 
then sold the property, used the proceeds to pay off the bank loan and kept the 
difference.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Companies and individuals hurrying to beat a one-year statute of limitations 
deadline filed lawsuits Friday seeking more than $250 million in the bombing of 
the World Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuits, filed in state Supreme Court, name the Port Authority of New 
York and New Jersey, the trade center's owner, as the chief 
defendant.Plaintiffs included Hilton Hotels International, Wausau Insurance, 
Fuji Bank, WPIX Inc. and the Century 21 department store. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., a securities broker and major tenant, filed a 
lawsuit seeking $220 million, a rent rebate and the rescinding of its lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The Feb. 26, 1993, blast was caused by a load of explosives in a van that was 
parked in an underground garage. Six people were killed and hundreds of others 
were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 James Begley, the Port Authority's New York litigation chief, said that as of 
this week his office had received 1,100 notices of claim seeking $375 million. 
Filing a notice of claim is the first step in suing a government agency.

3 SENATORS JOIN FOES OF BALANCED-BUDGET AMENDMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tide in the Senate appeared to be turning against a proposed 
balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution as three more lawmakers Friday 
joined the ranks of opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides to Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.), a leading foe of 
the plan, said they were "hopeful" of getting the 34 votes necessary to block 
approval of the measure before the scheduled vote on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), the bill's sponsor, and his allies continued to seek 
support from the ranks of eight to 10 undecided lawmakers. Backers of the 
measure need 67 votes to achieve the two-thirds majority required for a 
constitutional amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed amendment -- which also requires House passage and subsequent 
approval by 38 state legislatures to become law -- would forbid federal budget 
deficits by requiring the President to submit a balanced budget to Congress. 
Deficit spending could resume only by a vote of three-fifths of the members of 
each chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), who had been uncommitted, announced Friday that he 
would support a rival plan offered by Sen. Harry Reid (D-Nev.) that would 
exempt Social Security and capital expenses from budget-balancing requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad predicted that Simon would fall three to five votes short of the number 
needed to pass his amendment and said Reid's plan was the only balanced-budget 
proposal that could command a two-thirds vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Reid announced that he would vote against the Simon bill if his own plan 
failed, and Sen. Ted Stevens (R-Alaska), who had been leaning against Simon's 
proposal, also declared his opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens contended that the measure would force large spending cuts that would 
handcuff the nation's ability to make a rapid military buildup in case of a 
world crisis. He also said it would slash outlays for agriculture, land 
management and other programs important to Western states. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the wrong amendment at the wrong time to address the wrong problem," 
Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon responded by saying that ending deficits -- which is the purpose of the 
proposal -- would protect programs cited by the Alaska lawmaker, adding: "If we 
don't change things, defense spending is really going to get the squeeze." 
</P>
<P>
 Sentiment for a balanced-budget amendment has been increasing as record 
deficits have become a way of life. But proponents have not been able to muster 
the required two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House, despite a 
decade of trying. The House is expected to pass a version of the amendment, 
perhaps next month, no matter what the outcome is in the Senate.

WINTER-WEARY MIDWEST IS HIT BY NEW STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A snowstorm that cut visibility to one block raced across the winter-weary 
Midwest on Friday, dumping another six inches of snow in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway Airport in Chicago was shut down, and traffic was snarled at O'Hare 
International Airport, where officials put a hold on arriving flights and 
cancelled nearly half of all departures because of near-whiteout conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather further taxed dwindling salt supplies and snow-removal budgets in 
communities that are still digging out from foot-deep snow that fell across the 
region earlier in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, where more than 22 inches of snow has fallen so far during the 
month, a woman was killed Thursday when she was run over by a snowplow that had 
been clearing a supermarket parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 In Milwaukee, where the normal winter snowfall is 47 inches, nearly 70 inches 
had fallen by Friday, with more snow coming down. In February alone, the city 
has received more than 33 inches of snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said the storm was moving east and would likely spread snow across 
parts of Indiana, Michigan and Ohio and on into Pennsylvania, Maryland, 
southern New York and parts of New England by this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Thunderstorms were causing bursts of intense snow within the storm, weather 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Leavitt, a meteorologist with Weather Services Corp., said temperatures 
"much below normal are likely in the Midwest and East for the next five to 
seven days" in the wake of the latest storm.

SEN. DURENBERGER INDICTED IN EXPENSE ACCOUNT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal grand jury has re-indicted Sen. Dave Durenberger (R-Minn.) on 
charges that he abused his Senate expense account, the Justice Department 
announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Durenberger was charged with making and conspiring to make false claims to the 
Senate. The initial indictment was dismissed by a judge in December. 
</P>
<P>
 The 59-year-old senator was indicted last April on charges that he and two 
associates hid his ownership in a Minneapolis condominium so he could collect 
$3,825 in reimbursement from the Senate for staying there. 
</P>
<P>
 He could face up to 10 years in prison and a $500,000 fine if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am absolutely confident that I will be exonerated in a trial," Durenberger 
said Friday. He has denied any criminal wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Durenberger, who has announced that he will leave the Senate after this year, 
was formally denounced by colleagues in 1990 for the condominium deal and other 
alleged financial improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Warren Urbom of Nebraska, presiding over the case in 
Minneapolis, had dismissed the federal charges against Durenberger on grounds 
that prosecutors had improperly developed the case with material gathered by a 
Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Urbom said the material was not critical to the Justice Department's 
case, leaving the door open for a new indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 The two associates, attorney Michael Mahoney and businessman Paul Overgaard, 
also were charged in the April indictment. But Urbom dismissed the charges 
against them after they refused a Justice Department request to postpone their 
trial while authorities decided whether to seek a new indictment of 
Durenberger. Urbom said they could not be charged again. 
</P>
<P>
 The new indictment against Durenberger mirrors the one that was dismissed. It 
charges that the three men backdated documents to make it appear that the 
condominium was sold to Overgaard in 1987 several months before it actually 
was. 
</P>
<P>
 Durenberger also had an agreement to buy the condo back at the sale price, 
effectively allowing him to "park" the property with Overgaard "to shift the 
cost of the unit to the Senate," the indictment said.

FREIGHT TRAIN KILLS TWICE IN SAME DAY

<P>
 Two men at separate railroad crossings were killed by the same freight train 
on the same day, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Pacific train first collided with a pickup Thursday morning at a 
crossing in Pine Bluff, killing James Edward Dallari, 43. After a 90-minute 
delay, the train took off with a new engineer at the controls. Less than five 
hours later and 50 miles down the tracks, the train struck a car at another 
crossing, killing Roderick Miguel Daniels, 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a good day for that train," said Mike Furtney, a Southern Pacific 
spokesman. "The weather was clear in both cases. You'd think somebody could see 
a train coming."

 Lee Harvey Oswald's toe tag -- and a lock of his hair -- fetched $8,800 at an

 Minnesota radio personality Dave Ryan phoned in the winning bid for the hair

PACKWOOD ASKS REHNQUIST TO PUT HOLD ON DIARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.) asked Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist on Friday 
to block the transfer of his diaries to the Senate Ethics Committee while he 
appeals the panel's subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood's emergency petition said he "is being made subject to an 
unreasonable search and seizure of his private personal papers." 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge earlier this month ordered the diaries turned over to the 
committee. It is investigating allegations that the senator made unwanted 
sexual advances to more than two dozen women, used his staff to intimidate 
witnesses, solicited job offers from lobbyists for his wife and obstructed the 
investigation by altering the diaries. 
</P>
<P>
 A delay would be crucial to Packwood because the diaries have not been turned 
over to the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The audio tapes and transcripts first must be reviewed by Packwood and a 
neutral arbiter. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood's lawyer, Jacob A. Stein, said in court papers that he did not expect 
any attempt to give the diaries to the committee before Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit refused on Feb. 
18 to block the order by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, saying 
that Packwood had not met the requirements for such a delay. 
</P>
<P>
 Court papers filed by Packwood's lawyers said the subpoena violates his right 
of privacy under the Constitution's Fourth Amendment as well as his Fifth 
Amendment protection against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 If a delay is not granted, "the issues on appeal will be moot long before oral 
argument" before the appeals court, Stein wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The central issue here is whether a truly personal diary is a writing 
entitled to Fifth Amendment protection," Stein added. "There is no authority 
holding that it is not so entitled." 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood initially gave the committee his diaries, but cut off access to those 
from 1989 to the present after the panel found entries that showed lobbyists 
and a businessman offered his wife a job during their divorce proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee subpoenaed the diaries last Oct. 20. Packwood gave them to 
Jackson in December under orders from the judge.

HUFFINGTON UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT AS GOP MEETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Republicans gather this weekend for their election season state convention, 
the U.S. Senate race poses a vexing question GOP leaders face almost every 
election year: Can you have party unity and a party primary at the same time? 
</P>
<P>
 Republican candidate William E. Dannemeyer wants a fight, a good fight, 
because he believes it is the only way to prevent the party from making the 
mistake of nominating Rep. Michael Huffington, regarded as a strong favorite by 
all the political experts. Huffington, 44, is a wealthy former Texas oilman who 
plans to finance much of his own campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people believe that a cause is advanced by reducing controversy -- 
quieting the waters, so to speak," said Dannemeyer, a former Orange County 
congressman. "I think that strength comes from diversity and a primary 
challenge is healthy. It sorts things out." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) is largely unknown to California Republicans and 
his biggest job at this election-year kickoff is to introduce himself to party 
activists and persuade them that he is the best chance they have at unseating 
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein in November. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday night, in his first speech to a California Republican convention, 
the 44-year-old freshman found that may not be easy. A group of young 
conservative activists littered the convention room where the Senate candidates 
spoke with bogus dollar bills to illustrate their complaint that he is trying 
to buy the election. And his speech was interrupted several times by hecklers. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditorium was so tense before the candidates spoke, with a 
standing-room-only crowd, that Republican Party Chairman Tirso del Junco 
appealed for calm before introducing the speakers. Nonetheless, the audience 
erupted into competing chants for Huffington and Dannemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer warned the Republicans that Huffington is a liberal candidate and 
voters will find little reason to support him over Feinstein. "It does us no 
good if we have a carbon copy of the liberal Democrat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington had some surprises of his own. Before he was introduced, Huffington 
was joined on the dais by Sen. Phil Gramm, a Republican from Texas and a friend 
of Huffington's. The audience did not miss the message, even though the 
Republican Party is supposed to be neutral in GOP primaries and Gramm is the 
head of the Republican National Senatorial Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington appealed to the delegates to set aside their differences. "I want 
to hear your ideas,criticisms and suggestions," he said. "We can make this 
great Golden State of ours whole and prosperous again." 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening's most dramatic moment, Kate Squires, the only other Republican 
candidate in the primary, almost fainted during her speech. After Squires, a 
little-known Riverside businesswoman, had spoken about five minutes, she 
dropped her hands to her waist and began listing backward. The other two 
candidates caught her and laid her across a line of chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor in the audience rushed onto the stage. After about two minutes she 
resumed her speech to a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Republican convention has long been a place where social moderates 
have been cautioned to enter at their own risk. The 2,500 delegates tend to be 
dominated by the most conservative side of the party. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, hundreds of delegates walked out on a speech given by former GOP Sen. 
John Seymour. Republican Gov. Pete Wilson has had several uncomfortable visits 
with his state party's convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is scheduled to speak at a luncheon today and is expected to address 
the achievements of his first term. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever reception Huffington receives, GOP leaders are optimistic that the 
convention will succeed in uniting Republicans for the upcoming elections. 
Party leaders say the Democrats' success in 1992 -- winning two Senate races, 
the White House and a number of contested state legislative seats -- has done 
more for unity than years of internal diplomacy.

 "The strength of the Republican Party has always been our ability to come 
together despite our internal differences, and in 1992 we forgot that," said 
Dan Schnur, spokesman for the governor. "We acted like Democrats and we got our 
clocks cleaned. Nobody wants a repeat of that, so we're all working harder than 
ever to keep this party united." 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious sign of peace within the ranks is the lack of any divisive 
resolutions proposed for the convention to debate. In the past, resolutions 
opposing abortion rights and gay rights were standard topics. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington is likely to face some critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spent more than $5 million of his own money -- a national record -- 
to unseat Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) in 1992. It was a 
controversial entrance for Huffington because he had just moved to California 
from Texas and in his first run for office ended the career of a popular 
20-year House veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Huffington is appealing for calm and pledging to represent all segments of 
the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "My message is, let's come together," he said recently. Asked how he plans to 
unite his GOP support, he said: "Through force of personality, I will. I think 
the party is ready to be united." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has appealed to conservatives by highlighting his support for some 
of their key issues. He aired a recent television commercial about family 
values, he is co-chairman of the campaign for the "three strikes" anti-crime 
initiative and his speeches are peppered with anti-tax, small government 
rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the social issues that have been most contentious he moves toward the 
left within the party. He supports abortion rights, tougher gun laws, gays in 
the military and President Clinton's Family Leave Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Huffington has a real problem within the party (because) what he is 
purporting to be and what he says he has done in the past don't match," said 
Greg Hardcastle, president of the conservative California Republican Assembly. 
"The only question is, can Huffington buy California off?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of those conservatives who like Dannemeyer say, however, that the 
64-year-old champion of the religious right is not the answer. He lost to 
Seymour in the 1992 Senate primary by a margin of nearly 2 to 1.

<P>

 Another provision limits licensed handgun owners to buying 100 bullets a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day handgun violence destroys innocent lives," Friedman said. 
"Law-abiding citizens are afraid to walk neighborhood streets in fear of random 
gunfire and drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strong, bold, new steps are imperative to reduce the number of weapons pitted 
against police officers and innocent citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 The legislator estimated there are several million handguns in California, 
with 448,247 purchased in 1993.

KEY ANAHEIM PROJECTS TO PROCEED; TRANSPORTATION: OFFICIALS GAMBLE ON DISNEYLAND 
EXPANSION IN PLANNING FREEWAY RAMPS, GARAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gambling that the Walt Disney Co. will follow through on its $3-billion 
Disneyland expansion, transportation officials are moving ahead with plans for 
$50 million in ramps along the Santa Ana Freeway and the world's largest 
parking garage in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans and Orange County transportation officials have agreed to commit 
money in the belief that the ramps and garage will be needed no matter what 
happens in the tourist mecca around Disneyland. Construction would still be 
several years off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided we couldn't afford to wait for their decision any longer, because 
of the I-5 widening project," said Lisa Mills, chief deputy at the Orange 
County Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came this week when the California Transportation Commission 
staff reacted favorably to funding the garage in March. Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly 
said Friday that he has talked to some state commission members about their 
support for the project and knows of no opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision to proceed with the ramps without Westcot was made several months 
ago, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly acknowledged the state's projected $3-billion transportation funding 
shortfall over the next few years, and competing priorities such as earthquake 
retrofitting of freeways and bridges. County transportation board members are 
scheduled on Monday to be asked to approve shifting some sales tax funds to the 
freeway segment through Anaheim because of the state's shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 The county transportation association has long said that improvements to the 
freeway are the county's top transit priority. 
</P>
<P>
 But the governor's funding commitment to Disney's Westcot project has come 
under fire from some homeowners groups, who complain that the state cannot even 
afford to buy tanker planes needed to fight the kind of wildfires that recently 
destroyed parts of Laguna Beach and Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Daly said the decision to combine the freeway ramp and garage 
projects with the Santa Ana Freeway widening through Anaheim makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing I've seen or heard makes me believe anything other than that Westcot 
is going to be built," the mayor said. "But we need all the help we can get. . 
. . The project is important to Anaheim, Orange County and California." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials who are familiar with the freeway and garage projects could 
not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive, $1.6-billion project to double the width of the Santa Ana Freeway 
has been progressing steadily from Irvine through the junction of the Santa 
Ana, Garden Grove and Orange freeways and will soon reach the segment adjacent 
to Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of both the freeway ramps and the combined garage, which also 
will be a transit stop, will begin in 1996, Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding the ramps later would cost additional millions and would mean digging 
up concrete only recently poured, officials said.

LOU BUNIN; PUPPETEER AND FILMMAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lou Bunin, 89, puppeteer and filmmaker whose "Alice in Wonderland" was a 
special-effects classic.When Bunin's 1950 film was re-released in 1985, Times 
film writer Michael Wilmington noted that the film, "released the same year as 
Disney's and consequently buried, is probably the 'Alice' most faithful to 
Lewis Carroll's spirit." It involved mixing live action with animated puppets 
and stop-action filming. Throughout his career, the puppeteer invented film 
techniques to make animated puppet productions for children, television 
commercials and educational films. His work was shown at the 1939-40 World's 
Fair in New York and at the 1985 Los Angeles International Animation 
Celebration. His puppets are displayed in New York's Museum of Modern Art. On 
Feb. 17 in Englewood, N.J.

GEORGES WATIN; PLOTTED TO KILL DE GAULLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Georges Watin, 71, whose attempt to assassinate Charles de Gaulle was the 
basis for the book and film "The Day of the Jackal." Born in Algeria, Watin 
fought against independence from France and opposed President de Gaulle's 
decision in July, 1962, to grant the North African country its sovereignty.On 
Aug. 22, 1962, Watin attempted to shoot de Gaulle as he was riding through 
Paris in his limousine, but missed. The assailant was condemned to death in 
absentia in 1963, but pardoned by an amnesty law in 1968. Watin fled to 
Switzerland, then Spain and settled in Paraguay in 1965. His meticulous 
preparations and his failed attempt to kill de Gaulle became the basis for 
Frederick Forsythe's best-selling 1971 novel "The Day of the Jackal," and the 
1973 British-French film of the same title. On Feb. 19 in Asuncion, Paraguay.

CAMPUS OFFERS NEW DOCTORATE -- VIA COMPUTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The online Ph.D. program at the California Institute of Integral Studies is 
the newest thing in a very old educational tradition -- the Socratic method. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctoral students in the program pursue a course of study that Socrates 
himself would recognize -- reading, contemplating and then arguing their 
opinions in exhaustive detail. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's all done by computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at the School for Transformative Learning never meet face to face. 
Although other college programs offer degrees through the mail, or by televised 
courses, the institute's program is the only one Prof. Steve Eskow is aware of 
that does not require students to spend at least a few weeks together. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is not any back-of-the-matchbox degree. The institute was founded in 
1968 and is accredited by the Western Assn. of Schools and Colleges, the 
primary accrediting organization for institutions of higher learning in 
California, Hawaii and Guam. 
</P>
<P>
 The goals of the three-year doctoral program are to train professionals to 
help rebuild society's social institutions, Eskow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students spend up to 15 hours per week engaged in a course of study consisting 
of a traditional plan of extensive reading and discussion. Materials include a 
heavy emphasis on research methodology and ethnography, Eskow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first group of 10 students began the program last summer; another 16 are 
to begin in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The school works to create what Eskow calls "a learning community," something 
that might seem difficult when students never meet. But the heart of the 
school's community is communication, not physical proximity, Eskow said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can live next to 10 people for years and never know them, but you can 
write letters to someone you've never even met and create a serious 
intellectual relationship with them," he said.

PLEA BY MANURE-POWERED PLANT REJECTED; ENERGY: PANEL DENIES WAIVER FOR 
EXPERIMENTAL FACILITY. EDISON OFFICIALS ARE SEEKING REPAYMENT SCHEDULE THAT 
WILL KEEP FIRM OUT OF BANKRUPTCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To the chagrin of cattle owners in Imperial County, a federal energy 
commission has turned down an appeal from the world's only plant that makes 
electricity from manure. 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection could spell bankruptcy for the Imperial plant, which burned 1 
million tons of manure from 1988 to early 1993 before torrential rains caused 
it to grind to a sticky halt. The plant had offered a solution to the perennial 
problem of the cattle industry: what to do with all that dung. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very bad news for us," said Ross Jenkins, general manager of Phillips 
Cattle Co. in El Centro and chairman of the feedlot council of the California 
Cattlemen's Assn. "Sometimes I don't think there's anybody in Washington who 
understands Imperial County or the cattle business." 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous decision Wednesday by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
came without discussion at a meeting in Washington. Plant owners are studying 
whether to appeal to federal court. At issue is whether the Mesquite Lake plant 
deserves a waiver from a requirement that it use no more than 25% natural gas 
to operate its generators. 
</P>
<P>
 When last year's rains turned the cattle manure soupy, the facility was forced 
to switch almost entirely to natural gas to keep operating and sought a waiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison, which buys power from the manure plant, opposed 
the waiver and demanded that its owners repay $6 million to $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an arrangement in which utilities are required to buy power from 
independent producers who use alternative sources, Edison pays 10 cents per 
kilowatt for manure power. But it can buy natural gas-generated power for a 
third of that on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the waiver has been denied, Edison official Tom Gibbs said the 
company wants to "try to work out a repayment schedule that will keep (the 
plant) in business." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission agreed that Edison customers should not be stuck with paying 
extra for electricity produced by natural gas. The amount of any repayment, and 
the repayment schedule, will be subject to negotiations between Edison and the 
plant owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission found that the problems caused by last year's rains were not an 
anomaly but were symptomatic of technical flaws in the manure plant. 
</P>
<P>
 However, plant engineers hope to have the facility back on-line next month, 
burning manure once again. Still, they worry that if they are required to make 
the repayment in a lump sum, it would dry up investment money still needed for 
the experimental plant.

AUTOPSY FAILS TO EXPLAIN MEDICAL REASON FOR FUMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL and THOMAS H. MAUGH II, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A midnight autopsy that resembled a science fiction scene more than a medical 
examination produced no obvious explanation for the death of Gloria Ramirez and 
the illness of six medical personnel stricken by mysterious fumes while 
attending her. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the best of my knowledge, there is no clear-cut evidence that it 
(Ramirez's body) was contaminated with anything," said Dr. Jeffrey Simons of 
Riverside Community Hospital, where the pathologists and industrial hygienists 
who conducted the unusual autopsy were kept under observation for 12 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The four autopsy participants were in good health and apparently unaffected by 
the procedure, during which they wore extensive protective clothing and 
breathing apparatus. They were released from the hospital Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 An unidentified firefighter who apparently suffered an anxiety attack while 
operating air hoses outside the autopsy room remained in the hospital for 
observation, but Simons said he was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has an upset stomach and feels nauseated," Simons said. "I think it's just 
nerves." The firefighter was wearing protective clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood and tissue samples from Ramirez's body, as well as air samples from the 
aluminum case in which it was stored, were collected and shipped to 
laboratories around the country for analysis. Riverside County spokesman Tom 
DeSantis said it could be weeks before tests results are available. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials had no other comment on the autopsy findings. 
</P>
<P>
 The consensus among scientists not directly part of the investigation seems to 
be that Ramirez and the emergency room personnel were exposed to 
organophosphates, chemicals that are among the primary ingredients of nerve gas 
and many agricultural pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests on enzymes in the blood of Dr. Julie Gorchynski, who remains 
hospitalized at Loma Linda University Medical Center after passing out in the 
emergency room during the incident, and a nurse strongly suggest that they were 
exposed to a chemical in the organophosphate family. 
</P>
<P>
 Further tests failed to show the presence of the organophosphates in their 
blood, but that was not surprising because such chemicals are normally present 
only in very small concentrations and are very difficult to pinpoint, said Dr. 
Ashok Jain of the Los Angeles Poison Control Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, we don't even bother to look for it (the organophosphate) in the 
blood," Ashok said. "That's not relevant. The relevant thing is to look for its 
effects and they were there." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that the nurse responded dramatically to an antidote for 
organophosphates is very suggestive as well, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still think that there was exposure to organophosphates," said Jain, who 
is a consultant to the Riverside County coroner's office in the case, "but we 
don't know how it came about." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's family has hired Newport Beach attorney Stephan Otto to represent 
the family and to pursue possible legal action related to the treatment given 
her Saturday night. Ramirez was taken by ambulance to Riverside General 
Hospital, vomiting and complaining of difficulty breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 Otto did not return calls Friday.

OFFICIALS PLEDGE $50 MILLION FOR DISNEY RAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFFREY A. PERLMAN, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gambling that the Walt Disney Co. will follow through on its $3-billion 
Disneyland expansion, transportation officials are moving ahead with plans for 
$50 million in freeway ramps and the world's largest parking garage in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 California Department of Transportation and county transit officials have 
agreed to commit money in the belief that the ramps and garage will be needed 
no matter what happens in the tourist area around Disneyland. Construction 
still would be several years off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided we couldn't afford to wait for their decision any longer, because 
of the (Santa Ana Freeway) widening project reaching that point and having to 
make construction and design decisions now, not later," said Lisa Mills, chief 
deputy at the Orange County Transportation Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was reached this week when the staff of the California 
Transportation Commission reacted favorably to funding the garage at the 
panel's next meeting in March. Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly said Friday he already 
had talked to some state commission members about their support for the project 
and knows of no opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision to go ahead with the ramps without Westcot was made several months 
ago, officials revealed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly acknowledged that the state has a projected $3-billion transportation 
funding shortfall over the next few years and competing priorities, such as 
earthquake retrofitting. Indeed, OCTA board members on Monday will be asked to 
approve shifting some county Measure M sales-tax funds intended elsewhere to 
the Santa Ana Freeway segment through Anaheim because of the state's shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 OCTA has long declared the Santa Ana Freeway the county's top transportation 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
 But the governor's funding commitment to Disney's Westcot project has come 
under fire from some homeowners' groups, who complained that the state can't 
even afford to buy tanker planes needed to fight the kind of wildfires that 
recently destroyed parts of Laguna Beach and Malibu, among other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Daly said the decision to combine the freeway ramp and garage 
projects with the Santa Ana Freeway widening through Anaheim "makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing I've seen or heard makes me believe anything other than that Westcot 
is going to be built," Daly said. "But we need all the help we can get. . . . 
The project is important to Anaheim, Orange County and California. . . . "Does 
it put pressure on Disney? Only Disney puts pressure on Disney. But I think it 
makes their decision easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials familiar with the freeway and garage projects weren't 
available Friday, a company spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills, who also is a Santa Ana City Council member, said local and state 
transportation officials concluded last year that the new freeway ramps at 
Freedman Way and West Street would be worthwhile, even without Westcot, because 
of the potential for development in the Anaheim resort-recreation zone that 
extends from the Anaheim Arena and Anaheim Stadium to the Convention Center.  
</P>
<P>
 The large, $1.6-billion project doubling of the width of the Santa Ana Freeway 
has been progressing steadily from Irvine through the junction of the Santa 
Ana, Garden Grove and Orange freeways and soon will reach the segment next to 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 Actual construction of both the freeway ramps and the combined garage, which 
also will be a transit stop, won't begin until 1996, Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding the ramps later would cost additional millions and would mean digging 
up concrete only recently poured, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's commitment to Wescot, meanwhile, has wavered over time, depending on 
both politics and economics. At one point, company officials said it might not 
even "pencil out," or be economically viable.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Disney has been hit by staggering financial losses at Euro 
Disney near Paris. And Disney is insisting that it can't build Westcot without 
help from the state, Anaheim and OCTA. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorandum of understanding among those three, involving freeway, garage and 
transit center improvements announced last year, remains unsigned because 
Disney has not concluded a development agreement with Anaheim, OCTA officials 
said. That agreement is expected by April. 
</P>
<P>
 The $50 million for the new freeway ramps and combined garage and transit 
center comes from $60 million previously pledged by Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Mills said Friday, the $60 million has been reduced to $50 million 
through cost savings. Mills emphasized that the $30 million for the garage and 
transit center will come from cost savings on freeway projects elsewhere in 
Orange County and not increased state spending in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills said OCTA officials are working to get more money from the federal 
government for the garage-transit center. 
</P>
<P>
 The first floor is to be set aside as a bus and rail stop with park-and-ride 
spaces. The other six or so stories would provide parking for Westcot. Parking 
revenue would go to the county's future mass transit projects.  
</P>
<P>
 For the project's first year, Congress has budgeted about $15 million, which 
is part of a much larger package involving construction of direct-connect lanes 
and ramps reserved for buses and car pools between the Costa Mesa and San Diego 
freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills said an eventual full commitment to the garage project would be crucial 
to Disney but is at least a year or two from making its way through Congress.

O.C. PROTEST GETS DELETION IN STATE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two weeks before release of the first results of California's heralded new 
system of testing student academic skills, controversy has erupted over the 
dropping of passages by prize-winning author Alice Walker that some 
conservative Christians object to as being anti-religious. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Education yanked a question based on excerpts of the 
Walker story, "Roselily," from a reading portion of the test after complaints 
by the Anaheim-based-Traditional Values Coalition. Teachers and civil liberties 
groups protested that the decision to pull the story from future versions of 
the exam is censorship and a threat to academic freedom.  
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference Friday, Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont), a 
candidate for state superintendent of public instruction, said she has 
scheduled a March 16 hearing of the Assembly Education Committee, which she 
chairs, to pursue the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to determine what were the grounds for removing this item," Eastin 
said. "If they were political, that is a cause for grave concern . . . 
political correctness, whether it comes from the left or from the right, has no 
place in California public education." 
</P>
<P>
 She was joined at the Downtown Los Angeles news conference by leaders of the 
California Federation of Teachers, United Teachers-Los Angeles, National 
Writers Union -- of which the Pulitzer Prize-winning Walker is a member -- and 
People for the American Way, a liberal civil liberties organization that 
battles censorship in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 9, the state will release the long-awaited first results from the 
pioneering California Learning Assessment System, which puts California at the 
forefront of the movement to develop better ways of assessing students. State 
school officials hope that the new tests will be a key component of efforts to 
improve the education of 5.2 million public school students in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the state's previous testing system, which was based primarily on 
multiple-choice questions, the new version requires students to demonstrate 
thinking ability and show how they arrived at answers. Although this new 
system, called "performance-based" or "authentic" assessment, is considerably 
more expensive to develop and score, educators said it provides a much better 
method of determining what a student can do and can help shape reforms in 
teaching and curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Roselily" excerpt is about the thoughts of a black unmarried mother as 
she stands at the altar for her wedding to a Muslim man. The tale appeared in 
Walker's collection of short stories "In Love & Trouble: Stories of Black 
Women." 
</P>
<P>
 The excerpt was on the language arts portion of the exam given to 10th-graders 
throughout the state last spring. Students were asked to write their responses 
to the story -- a test of their reading comprehension, along with thinking and 
writing skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The test was scored, along with those given to fourth- and eighth-graders in 
reading, writing and math, over the summer by teams of teachers statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy surfaced in October, when the Riverside Press-Enterprise 
published the "Roselily" excerpt and question in a story on the new assessment 
system. Shortly after that, the state Department of Education, which had 
received complaints from the Traditional Values Coalition, decided to pull the 
item from next year's version of the test, which is to be administered 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition, headed by the Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, has achieved statewide 
recognition in recent years for its lobbying on conservative and religious 
issues, including its opposition to gay rights legislation and to certain 
elements of the state's educational curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the coalition said Friday that the group had complained about 
the Walker story, and objected to the new system of testing in general because 
the group believes it emphasizes "emotions, not intellect." The Walker story 
"could easily be construed as anti-religious and anti-clergy," said spokesman 
Steve Sheldon.  
</P>
<P>
 The issue is not censorship but discrimination against religious people, 
Sheldon said, adding that Eastin was a "demagogue" who had seized the issue to 
further her election prospects "with the ACLU types." The American Civil 
Liberties Union is among those to decry the decision to pull the test item. 
</P>
<P>
 William D. Dawson, acting state superintendent, said the decision was made in 
large part because publication of the item spoiled its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It alerted every 10th-grade English teacher in the state of California that 
it would be on the test," thus spoiling the unrehearsed nature of the response, 
Dawson said. The Walker story might be reinstated in the future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Walker's works, including the Pulitzer-winning book, "The Color 
Purple," are on the state's recommended reading lists, Dawson noted. He called 
"Roselily" a "fine, engaging, thought-provoking story that causes kids to stop 
and think hard about other people's lives and problems and how they address 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dawson acknowledged that the controversy generated by the news story also 
played a role in the decision to drop the test item. He said that after the 
story appeared, Dale Carlson, the state's testing director, recommended 
dropping the item, based on the spoiled confidentiality and the controversy. 
Dawson said he "fully backed" Carlson's recommendation. "It was our judgment 
that continued inclusion of 'Roselily' . . . would have injected a level of 
controversy that could have jeopardized the larger testing program," Dawson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker was traveling and could not be reached for comment.  
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Eric Lichtblau contributed to this report. Controversial 
Passages 
</P>
<P>
 The following excerpts from Alice Walker's short story "Roselily" -- about a 
rural Mississippi woman's private thoughts during her wedding ceremony -- were 
included on a test of language arts skills given to sophomores statewide in 
1993. Students were asked to write their feelings about the passages. 
</P>
<P>
 * ". . . She cannot always be a bride and a virgin, wearing robes and veil. 
Even now her body itches to be free of satin and voile. . . . She wonders what 
it will be like. Not to have to go to a job. Not to work in a sewing plant. . .

she has prayed for. But now she wonders. When she has rested, what will she do?

what? Babies. She is not comforted."

YOUTH'S 911 CALL EERIE PRECURSOR TO POLICE KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moments before killing a rookie police officer, 17-year-old Christopher Golly 
called 911 to say he had just killed his father and that, "I'll see you when 
you get here," according to a dispatcher's tape released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a chilling precursor of the bloody ambush to follow, Golly ignored a 
dispatcher's repeated requests to put his gun down and stay on the phone until 
police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Golly's call came immediately after a call from a woman who had been in the 
house and had taken a cellular phone outside. 
</P>
<P>
 When police arrived at Golly's Northridge house about 1:20 a.m. Tuesday, the 
troubled methamphetamine user was already hiding outside with a loaded AR-15 
assault rifle. He sprayed the three squad cars with bullets, killing rookie 
Officer Christy Lynne Hamilton, 45, with one shot that pierced her chest above 
her bullet-proof vest. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the tape reinforces statements that Golly made to a friend hours 
before the shooting: that he planned to kill his father and then ambush those 
officers responding to the crime scene and "take out" several. 
</P>
<P>
 "In hindsight, knowing what we know now. . .it appears very ominous," said 
Police Lt. John Dunkin. "Knowing now everything that went on, his conversation 
with his friend, it lends a different meaning of, 'I'll see you when you get 
here.' It's almost eerie." 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday, police had not disclosed the existence of the 911 call. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in light of indications on the tape that an armed and uncooperative 
killer may have been waiting for them, police officials said they had no idea 
of the troubled teen-ager's intentions to open fire. And they continued to 
defend the tactics of the officers responding to the scene, who inadvertently 
pulled up right in front of the Golly house on Amestoy Avenue and made Hamilton 
a vulnerable target. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tape, the 911 operator can be heard saying "use caution, victim and 
suspect are still at the scene. Suspect is still armed." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said officers were aware that someone had been shot at the house, and 
that an armed gunman could still be there. He said officers followed correct 
tactical procedure, which is to stop several houses away and assess the 
situation before acting or calling in a Special Weapons and Tactics unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they stopped a block away and walked there, maybe this wouldn't have 
happened," Dunkin said. "But that isn't the way you answer radio calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin, like other police officials, said Hamilton's slaying was the result of 
several factors that were out of the control of the responding officers. It was 
too dark to see the numbers on the houses, police said, and the Golly home was 
on a corner, despite the fact that the address led officers to expect to find 
it in the middle of the block, where they saw a woman waving to them. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a police helicopter that could have spotted Golly hiding behind a 
brick wall was grounded due to high winds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every officer wants to make it home at night. Who in their right mind would 
pull up right in front of a house where there is a guy inside with a gun?" 
Dunkin asked. "They certainly did not do that intentionally." 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," Dunkin said, "the officers did the best job they possibly could 
armed with the information they had." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Michael Albanese, a supervisor within the LAPD's SWAT unit, confirmed 
that according to LAPD policy, SWAT members would only be called after patrol 
officers responded and verified that a gunman actually was inside a house. 
</P>
<P>
 After patrol officers were deployed and after Hamilton was shot -- Albanese 
and other SWAT members were called to the scene, said Albanese. Shortly before 
6 a.m., SWAT members fired tear gas canisters into the house and entered the 
house and found the bodies of Golly, who had fatally shot himself, and his 
father, Steven. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 911 call, Golly appeared to be playing with a dispatcher as he told 
her what he had done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, yes, I'd like to report a murder," he said. What happened, she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shot my dad," he said, adding that he thought "it would be nice" to shoot 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked where the gun was he said "It's. . .on my shoulder right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispatcher asked him to put the gun down. Golly responded, "Nah." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a paramedic is patched into the call. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put the phone down, I mean put the gun down. . .we're not playing around," 
the Fire Department official said after several minutes. "Right," Golly 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
 After Golly said, "I'll see you guys," the operator asked him to stay on the 
line and to put the gun where police could see it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nah," Golly replies again, "I'll see you guys when you get here." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, no, Chris?" the operator asks. But by then, Golly had hung up. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Golly then went to the side of the house, and waited. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton stopped her squad car behind two other police vehicles on Septo 
Street, which intersected with Amestoy Avenue in front of Golly's house. 
Although it wasn't clear if Golly had fired any shots before she left the car, 
Hamilton was crouching behind her door and reaching for a Rover portable police 
radio when she was shot, her father said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Brondell, Hamilton's father, said he has talked to his slain 
daughter's partner about what transpired early that morning. Brondell, a 
30-year veteran of the LAPD, said his daughter had put herself at risk by 
responding to the call, doing what officers are trained to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if someone is lying there in wait, the officers can't stand a block away 
and wait. Someone has to move up. It just has to be done," Brondell said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What good would it do to call the police if they stayed a long way away for 
safety? He might have killed somebody else -- after all, he already killed his 
father," Brondell said. "If there are chances that have to be taken that are 
absolutely necessary, then police have to take them. They can't stand back and 
hide." Excerpts of Call

JUDGING OLYMPIANS FROM O.C. RINK 
</P>

 At the Ice Capades Chalet, where future Olympic hopefuls were practicing 
twists and turns on the ice, reaction to figure skating events Friday ranged 
from mild disappointment to pride in the accomplishments of one U.S. skater 
with whom many identify. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted Nancy (Kerrigan) to get the gold," said Tiffany Wiggins, 10, a 
resident of Laguna Niguel who has been skating since the age of 2. "She's very 
graceful on the ice and I like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany's mother, Elaine, described Kerrigan, whose second-place finish won 
her a silver medal, as very classy. "We're all for Nancy; I'm very disappointed 
that she didn't get the gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Others who also expressed disappointment said they were proud of the skater's 
accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great that she placed," said Heidi Sisto, 25, a sales 
representative from Lake Forest who felt inspired to go skating with her 
husband, Alan, after watching the Olympics on television. "A few weeks ago 
(after being injured) she was on the ground. I'd be really pleased if I were 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 Said James Meier, a journalism student at Cal State Fullerton: "I'm proud of 
her. She had to go through lots of hardships. I'm happy if she's happy; just 
getting a medal at the Olympics is an extraordinary accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 There seemed to be little sympathy for rival Tonya Harding, who was linked to 
the attack on Kerrigan and placed eighth in the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't like her that much," said Jodie Pakkala, 20, of El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar resident Amber Wynkoop, 12, speaking of Harding's Olympic 
humiliation, said: "I don't really mind. She kind of deserved it." 
</P>
<P>
 And Tania Tajalli, a 16-year-old from Huntington Beach, expressed reluctance 
to say much at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "What excuses will she come up with next?" Tajalli said, referring to 
Harding's request to the judges for a second chance because of trouble with the 
laces on her skates.

HUFFINGTON UNDER THE SPOTLIGHT AS GOP MEETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Republicans gather this weekend for their election season state convention, 
the U.S. Senate race poses a vexing question GOP leaders face almost every 
election year: Can you have party unity and a party primary at the same time? 
</P>
<P>
 Republican candidate William E. Dannemeyer wants a fight, a good fight, 
because he believes it is the only way to prevent the party from making the 
mistake of nominating Rep. Michael Huffington, regarded as a strong favorite by 
all the political experts. Huffington, 44, is a wealthy former Texas oilman who 
plans to finance much of his own campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people believe that a cause is advanced by reducing controversy -- 
quieting the waters, so to speak," said Dannemeyer, a former longtime Fullerton 
congressman. "I think that strength comes from diversity and a primary 
challenge is healthy. It sorts things out." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington (R-Santa Barbara) is largely unknown to California Republicans and 
his biggest job at this election-year kickoff is to introduce himself to party 
activists and persuade them that he is the best chance they have at unseating 
Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein in November. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday night, in his first speech to a California Republican convention, 
the 44-year-old freshman found that may not be easy. A group of young 
conservative activists littered the convention room where the Senate candidates 
spoke with bogus dollar bills to illustrate their complaint that he is trying 
to buy the election. And his speech was interrupted several times by hecklers. 
</P>
<P>
 The auditorium was so tense before the candidates spoke, with a 
standing-room-only crowd, that Republican Party Chairman Tirso del Junco 
appealed for calm before introducing the speakers. Nonetheless, the audience 
erupted into competing chants for Huffington and Dannemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Dannemeyer warned the Republicans that Huffington is a liberal candidate and 
voters will find little reason to support him over Feinstein. "It does us no 
good if we have a carbon copy of the liberal Democrat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington had some surprises of his own. Before he was introduced, Huffington 
was joined on the dais by Sen. Phil Gramm, a Republican from Texas and a friend 
of Huffington's. The audience did not miss the message, even though the 
Republican Party is supposed to be neutral in GOP primaries and Gramm is the 
head of the Republican National Senatorial Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington appealed to the delegates to set aside their differences. "I want 
to hear your ideas, criticisms and suggestions," he said. "We can make this 
great Golden State of ours whole and prosperous again." 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening's most dramatic moment, Kate Squires, the only other Republican 
candidate in the primary, almost fainted during her speech. After Squires, a 
little-known Riverside businesswoman, had spoken about five minutes, she 
dropped her hands to her waist and began listing backward. The other two 
candidates caught her and laid her across a line of chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor in the audience rushed onto the stage. After about two minutes she 
resumed her speech to a standing ovation. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Republican convention has long been a place where social moderates 
have been cautioned to enter at their own risk. The 2,500 delegates tend to be 
dominated by the most conservative side of the party. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, hundreds of delegates walked out on a speech given by former GOP Sen. 
John Seymour. Republican Gov. Pete Wilson has had several uncomfortable visits 
with his state party's convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is scheduled to speak at a luncheon today and is expected to address 
the achievements of his first term. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever reception Huffington receives, GOP leaders are optimistic that the 
convention will succeed in uniting Republicans for the upcoming elections. 
Party leaders say the Democrats' success in 1992 -- winning two Senate races, 
the White House and a number of contested state legislative seats -- has done 
more for unity than years of internal diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The strength of the Republican Party has always been our ability to come 
together despite our internal differences, and in 1992 we forgot that," said 
Dan Schnur, spokesman for the governor. "We acted like Democrats and we got our 
clocks cleaned. Nobody wants a repeat of that, so we're all working harder than 
ever to keep this party united." 
</P>
<P>
 The most obvious sign of peace within the ranks is the lack of any divisive 
resolutions proposed for the convention to debate. In the past, resolutions 
opposing abortion rights and gay rights were standard topics. 
</P>
<P>
 The convention is so low key, said Orange County Republican Chairman Thomas A. 
Fuentes, that many Orange County Republicans took a detour through Los Angeles 
Friday to be part of the "Tonight Show With Jay Leno" audience for the 
scheduled appearance of conservative radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an extremely low-key year," said Fuentes, predicting a united front. 
</P>
<P>
 But Huffington is likely to face some critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spent more than $5 million of his own money -- a national record -- 
to unseat Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) in 1992. It was a 
controversial entrance for Huffington because he had just moved to California 
from Texas and in his first run for office ended the career of a popular 
20-year House veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Huffington is appealing for calm and pledging to represent all segments of 
the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "My message is, let's come together," he said recently. Asked how he plans to 
unite his GOP support, he said: "Through force of personality, I will. I think 
the party is ready to be united." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has appealed to conservatives by highlighting his support for some 
of their key issues. He aired a recent television commercial about family 
values, he is co-chairman of the campaign for the "three strikes" anti-crime 
initiative and his speeches are peppered with anti-tax, small government 
rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the social issues that have been most contentious he moves toward the 
left within the party. He supports abortion rights, tougher gun laws, gays in 
the military and President Clinton's Family Leave Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Huffington has a real problem within the party (because) what he is 
purporting to be and what he says he has done in the past don't match," said 
Greg Hardcastle, president of the conservative California Republican Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of those conservatives say, however, that the 64-year-old champion 
of the religious right is not the answer.

WILSON CALLS FOR STREAMLINED RULES TO SPUR BASE CONVERSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flanked by two warplanes and a giant American flag, Gov. Pete Wilson on Friday 
called for streamlining environmental regulations and other government rules to 
speed the conversion of military bases to civilian use. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that California will suffer two-thirds of the nation's job losses from 
base closures, the governor proposed legislation to provide financial 
incentives for rapid conversion, including the transfer of air quality credits 
to businesses that move onto former bases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We simply can't afford to let base conversion fall victim to bureaucratic 
delay," Wilson said during a campaign-style speech at the Alameda Naval Air 
Station, one of 22 California bases slated for closure by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 During his appearance, Wilson received the report of a committee he appointed 
to study how the state can best aid in the conversion of military facilities. 
Wilson declared the report a "blueprint for action" and called on Congress and 
the Legislature to implement its recommendations.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee determined that the closure of Marine Corps air bases at El Toro 
and Tustin would cause the loss of about 24,000 jobs in Orange County, more 
than half held by civilians. The base shutterings also would result in about 
1,700 business failures and reduce annual personal income in Orange County by 
$805 million, the report estimated. As a result, the unemployment rate would 
rise from 6.6% in October, 1993, to an estimated 7.5% in 1995, according to the 
task force. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also concluded that the cleanup of toxic contamination on bases 
will be the greatest obstacle to rapid conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said he would favor reducing redundant environmental regulations 
for base conversions by allowing one environmental impact report to satisfy the 
requirements of federal law and the California Environmental Quality Act.  
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also said he would support a bill by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport 
Beach) that would encourage the resolution of environmental or land-use 
disputes by mediation rather than by lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 After his speech, the governor insisted that none of his proposals -- 
including the transfer of air quality credits to businesses that take over 
military sites -- would reduce the need for environmental protection measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Another element of Wilson's plan would allow local governments to declare 
closed bases to be redevelopment areas. This would allow cities and counties to 
raise money by issuing bonds that would be paid for by the increased tax 
revenues the converted bases produce. 
</P>
<P>
 In cases where military bases cross local boundaries, Wilson proposed that one 
city or county be chosen to take the lead in conversion, thereby avoiding 
time-consuming bureaucratic battles over how a site should be used. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest round of base closures in California -- nine, including El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station in Orange County, the Naval Training Center in San 
Diego and March Air Force Base in Riverside County -- would cost the state 
nearly 100,000 jobs, the governor's office said. All told, Defense Department 
cutbacks have resulted in 500,000 lost jobs in California -- half the jobs that 
have been lost nationwide during the recession.

SERVICES TODAY FOR LONGTIME EDUCATOR JEAN BLANKENSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Services will be held today for Jean Blankenship, a longtime special education 
teacher who died of cancer Feb. 19. She was 63. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Blankenship worked as a special education teacher for 20 years, 17 of 
them in the Fountain Valley School District, where she bettered the lives of 
those she taught, friends and family members said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This woman left an incredible legacy. . . ," said Judy Caforio, a teacher at 
Urbain H. Plavan Elementary School, where Mrs. Blankenship taught. "Everybody 
was touched almost magically by this person, by her strength and her spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody who is grieving for this woman feels that their life has really 
been changed because of her," Caforio said. "She was more than an educator, an 
artist, and a friend. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Blankenship died at her home.  
</P>
<P>
 Her daughter, Harvest Gulevich of Fountain Valley, said a scholarship that has 
been established in her mother's name is a fitting tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother felt strongly about children and children's right to have a safe 
and happy childhood," she said. "She was an artistic person, always encouraging 
people to (create) art." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Blankenship's husband, Marine Maj. Lee Blankenship, a helicopter pilot, 
was killed in 1969 during the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Blankenship went to college after her husband's death and began teaching 
disabled children at Diamond Elementary School in Santa Ana in 1973. In 1977, 
she became a speech and language specialist in the Fountain Valley School 
District, spending the last nine years at Plavan Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Blankenship is survived by a sister, Mary A. 
Ritchie of Seattle; a niece, Connie J. Ritchie, also of Seattle, and two 
grandchildren, Sierra and Cody. Her son, David, died in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service will be held today at 3 p.m. at Pacific View Memorial Park, 
3500 Pacific View Drive, Corona del Mar. Her ashes will be interred with her 
husband's remains at Ft. Rosecrans National Cemetery in Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, the family requests that contributions be made to the Jean 
Blankenship Memorial Scholarship Fund, which will be given each year to an 
outstanding art student at Plavan Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 Contributions to the scholarship may be sent to Urbain H. Plavan Elementary 
School, 9675 Warner Ave., Fountain Valley, Calif. 92708. Checks should be made 
out to Plavan Elementary PTO, Jean Blankenship Fund.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; READING AS AN ANTI-CRIME TOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To everyone for whom reading is second nature, the task would seem simple. 
Orange County Jail inmates were given a label from a medicine bottle, asked to 
read it and explain how they would give a dose of the medicine to a 4-year-old 
child. More than 80% failed the test. 
</P>
<P>
 The label reading was part of a study of 990 inmates from all five county 
jails that was completed last year. Even after subtracting those who knew no 
English, 52% of inmates tested were classified as functionally illiterate. That 
is why the pilot program known as Working for Inmate Literacy Now is important. 
The program began two months ago and is designed to teach inmates how to read. 
</P>
<P>
 County Jail inmates serve maximum sentences of one year; the average stay is 
less than 60 days. An inmate who is freed with the same minimal reading ability 
he had, or no ability at all, will find it tough to get a job outside. No job 
means no income, and the odds increase that he will be back behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department sensibly decided to determine the 
extent of literacy in the jail system after discovering that many inmates could 
not read well enough to take offered educational and vocational classes. With 
the study results in, the department instituted the pilot program at the James 
A. Musick and Theo Lacy branch jails. The courses are to be offered later in 
the other jails. 
</P>
<P>
 Working for Inmate Literacy Now is a project of READ/Orange County, a literacy 
program of the Orange County Public Library. The library has done good work in 
developing how-to-read classes in recent years to help the estimated hundreds 
of thousands of illiterates in the county. READ/Orange County is also a good 
example of the importance of volunteers in a host of programs throughout the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 The short stay of prisoners obviously leaves little time for learning to read. 
But a program official notes that small progress is better than none; she said 
the goal was "not to teach them to read and write, but to teach them that they 
can." At least one inmate has said he wanted to continue the study sessions 
after he finished his sentence. That's a hopeful sign of the program's 
potential to inspire inmates.

'WE LOST BIG TIME'; OXNARD DUNES: FOUR HOMEOWNERS ARE DENIED DAMAGES. JURY SAYS 
DEVELOPER NOT NEGLIGENT IN CASE INVOLVING OIL WASTE DUMP. 
</P>

<P>
 What was once the biggest civil case in Ventura County history ended Friday 
with a jury's decision that the developer of the Oxnard Dunes housing 
subdivision was not substantially negligent for selling property atop an 
abandoned oil waste dump. 
</P>
<P>
 After two weeks of deliberation, the jury refused to award damages to four of 
the five homeowners who had sued over the issue. A fifth plaintiff will be 
compensated for some loss of property value, to be determined later by jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict all but ends an eight-year battle between Oxnard Shores Co. and 
residents of Oxnard Dunes. Both sides agreed that the development firm came out 
the big winner in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this closes a very long and arduous chapter in the litigation history 
of this county," said an elated Christopher P. Bisgaard, the Los Angeles 
attorney who represented Oxnard Shores Co. and the numerous other defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased with the results," Bisgaard said. "We think that the evidence 
presented is consistent with the verdict." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging defeat, the plaintiffs said they still believe the 
development company deceived them about the property by failing to disclose its 
former use. They said an appeal would probably be too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought that the condition was obvious and at the very least affected 
property values," said plaintiffs' attorney Lawrence M. Schulner, who called 
the verdict "a disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 "I do believe these people are concerned about the environment," plaintiff 
Linda Paxton, 52, said of the jurors. "But they have also bought into the 
theory that the big businesses and the government are our protectors." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was filed in 1987 by 175 residents of Oxnard Dunes after the 
discovery of the toxic waste dump under the 100-home development nine years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 All but the remaining five defendants -- representing three families -- 
accepted an undisclosed out-of court settlement last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The subdivision, off Harbor Boulevard about 1 1/2 miles north of Channel 
Islands Harbor, was used as a dump for oil field waste during the 1950s. The 
developer started selling lots there in 1964, and most of the homes were built 
in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 After remnants of the dump were discovered, state health officials conducted 
tests over five years and found no dangerous levels of contaminants. They gave 
the site a clean bill of health in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents said their property had been devalued, and they worried 
about possible future illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony began in October, and the jury got the case two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As verdicts were read Friday, the plaintiffs were initially encouraged as the 
defendants were found negligent of the first two of the 192 allegations against 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But as the remaining counts were read, it quickly became clear that the jurors 
had exonerated Oxnard Shores and the numerous other defendants of the most 
serious allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the plaintiffs, who were seated together in the front row of the 
courtroom gallery, began to shed tears. A bailiff rushed over to hand Paxton a 
tissue. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as the jury left the courtroom, plaintiff Steven Blanchard asked 
attorney Schulner for his interpretation of the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost big time," Schulner said plaintively. 
</P>
<P>
 A special trial will be held for Blanchard, the lone plaintiff who the jury 
thought deserved some damages. It said his property had lost value. 
</P>
<P>
 But the jury refused to award damages to the other four plaintiffs -- Paul and 
Mary Null, Paxton, and Paxton's mother, Helen Scarlett. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Bisgaard said the jury apparently exonerated the development company 
because its agents notified the city of Oxnard of the existence of the waste 
dump before selling any land on the property. The jury found the city of Oxnard 
negligent, but the city had already settled with the five plaintiffs and was 
not a defendant in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials said they are under court order not to discuss the case until 
it is fully resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs said that even though the jury did not believe they suffered 
losses, their properties are worthless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 76 years old, and I've lost everything I've had," said Scarlett, who 
lived in the subdivision from 1981 to 1984. "I just couldn't believe anybody 
could vote against us. During this time I've even lost my husband to cancer. 
Whether it had anything to do with the Dunes, I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Blanchard, a 44-year-old project manager for the Navy, said he was 
"disappointed and surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiff Mary Null, 59, added: "I am really flabbergasted." 
</P>
<P>
 But the plaintiffs said they are also glad that they took the matter to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Bisgaard said life is returning to normal at the Dunes, where several of the 
plaintiffs' houses had been painted with signs that called attention to the 
presence of the toxic dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is, lenders are making loans in the Dunes," Bisgaard 
said. "We have witnesses who enjoy living there."

OIL CLEANUP MAY END BY NEXT WEEK; SPILL: COST OF SANTA CLARA RIVER PROJECT IS 
EXPECTED TO TOP $1 MILLION. A NINTH BREAK IN PIPELINE LEAKS 168 GALLONS BUT 
IT'S NOT NEAR THE WATERWAY.

 Cleanup of a major oil spill that blackened miles of the Santa Clara River 
after last month's earthquake is expected to be completed by early next week, 
state Department of Fish and Game officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 190,000 gallons of crude oil spilled from a pipeline rupture that 
was triggered by the Jan. 17 quake. The leak killed 693 fish, birds, amphibians 
and other wildlife and created a black gooey mess that stretched 17 miles from 
Santa Clarita to just east of Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game officials and cleanup crews hired by Atlantic Richfield Co., 
parent company of the Four-Corners Pipeline, expect to finish their cleanup 
efforts this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to have complete sign-off on the project Monday or Tuesday," said 
Arco spokesman Scott Loll. Arco has not yet determined the cost to clean up the 
spill but hoped to have preliminary figures by Monday, Loll said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Fish and Game officials estimate the cost will be well over $1 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 A ninth break in the pipeline was discovered during a test of the line 
Thursday, Fish and Game Capt. Roger Reese said. The rupture, which Reese said 
was not near the river, leaked 168 gallons of oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an old pipeline, it was constructed in 1925-26," Reese said. "It's not 
the only pipeline in the area, and it's not the only one where we've had 
breaks. The pipeline runs from production areas to refineries, whatever is in 
between is at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 With the majority of the thick black crud already vacuumed from the river, 
crews are trying to remove any remaining pockets of oil floating on the surface 
or trapped in the soil, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we're digging up sediments; there's very little free oil left," 
said Bob Schlichting, a Fish and Game spokesman. He said 193,494 gallons of oil 
were spilled as a result of the broken pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of that, we are saying we've recovered 64,638 gallons," Schlichting said. 
"The rest either evaporated or sunk into sediments or is wrapped up in trees." 
</P>
<P>
 In one section of the river that was still being cleaned, crews wearing yellow 
plastic suits stood thigh-deep in the water Friday, wiping the surface with 
rags in an attempt to capture any remaining oil. While the river appears 
normal, Fish and Game officials cautioned that oil trapped in vegetation or 
soil can still be dangerous to wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously when you have a spill like this there is damage. We will do what we 
can to be sure the area recovers," Reese said. "A lot of it depends on how well 
you can clean up the oil." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fish and Game supervisors divided the river into eight sections after the 
spill to manage the cleanup efforts. So far, four sections have been cleaned 
and officials anticipate completing the other four by early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't guarantee that all the oil is removed," Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese said the department is planning a study to assess the effects on 
wildlife in the area. He said the study will take two to three years to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they will carefully monitor an endangered bird known as the 
least Bell's vireo during the next few months. Although the migratory birds had 
not returned from their winter habitat in the south when the spill occurred, 
they are expected to arrive at their nesting grounds along the Santa Clara 
River in March. Wildlife experts fear the spill could contaminate the birds' 
food supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always have concerns about them because they're endangered," Reese said. 
"We don't expect the spill to eliminate the vireos, but that could happen." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to its assessment, the Department of Fish and Game will produce an 
investigation report that will be submitted to the Los Angeles district 
attorney's office. The pipeline broke in Santa Clarita, which is in Los Angeles 
County. Reese did not know when the report would be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schlichting said it is possible Arco could face legal charges because of the 
spill, but that could be four or five months away. Arco's Loll said the company 
has not been notified of any lawsuit and doesn't anticipate one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel the pipeline was well maintained," Loll said. "We feel this was the 
result of the earthquake. We don't subscribe to the arguments we've heard."  
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists have blamed the spill on the pipeline's age and a lack of a 
maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Loll said all eight breaks in the Four-Corners Pipeline have been repaired, 
and Arco hopes the line will be back in operation by the end of March. The 
pipeline moves oil from the San Joaquin Valley to the Los Angeles Basin, Loll 
said. It carries an estimated 50,000 barrels a day.

COUNTY'S IMMIGRANTS RACE TO BEAT NEW LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Immigrants lined up at Ventura County offices of the Department of Motor 
Vehicles this week, trying to get a California driver's license or 
identification card before a change in state law closes that door to all but 
legal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came today to try and do it as quickly as possible," said Justine, 25, an 
immigrant from Sheffield, England, waiting to process a driver's license 
application at the Thousand Oaks DMV office. "I have a lot of friends who are 
doing it as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Justine, who would not give her last name, said she came to the United States 
about a year ago on a visitor's visa, and returns to England briefly every 
three months to renew her visa before flying back to California. She said she 
hopes to gain legal residency but does not know when that will happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, anyone wishing to obtain a state driver's license or identification 
card does not need to show proof of citizenship or legal residency. They need 
only provide proof of identification, such as a birth certificate or passport 
from the United States or another country. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Tuesday, however, new applicants for a California license or ID card 
must present proof they are legally residing in the United States. The new 
requirement will not apply to people renewing their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Oxnard DMV office, Silvia Vivar Salgado, an immigrant from Oaxaca, 
Mexico, said she does not have legal permission to live in the United States. 
But she has found she needs a driver's license just to cash her paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I go to cash a check, they ask for identification, and when I don't have 
it, they charge more," said Salgado, 20, who picks strawberries in a local 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing just behind her in line, Angelica Garcia, 32, an immigrant from 
Mexico City who said she has U.S. residency papers, interrupted to say how 
infuriated she and her neighbors are over the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is discrimination," she said. "Look at all the people abusing the 
welfare system! We don't do that. And now they want to take our ID cards away 
and that's how we cash our checks, so we can eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said the news is all over local Spanish-speaking radio and television. 
"A lot of people are coming down here to get their licenses now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors at local DMV offices confirmed that applications have gone up in 
recent weeks, but said the reasons may be mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is up anywhere from 30% to 40% on average in the last week to two 
weeks," said Marc Bailey, manager of the Oxnard DMV office. Bailey said the 
cause may be both the new law and recent rains, as farm workers run errands on 
days they cannot work in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Silva, operations officer at the Thousand Oaks DMV, said his office has 
seen a slight increase in business in recent weeks. "It's mainly folks coming 
in from the Valley," he said. "There's been so many people going to the DMV in 
that area that we're getting the overflow." 
</P>
<P>
 While many immigrants and their advocates blasted the new law, supporters say 
it is long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's against the law to enter the country in the manner that you entered 
it, then you should not be given the privilege of operating a motor vehicle," 
said Tab Berg, chief of staff for Assemblyman Nao Takasugi (R-Oxnard), who 
voted for the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Berg said Takasugi also supported the idea because, though the law requires 
employers to demand two forms of identification before hiring an employee, some 
employers only ask to see a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a commonly accepted mode of identification," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some local immigrants agree, saying they know of many employers who will hire 
people without asking their legal status, as long as they have a state-issued 
driver's license or ID card. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without ID, you can't get a job and you can't cash a check," said Antonia 
Valenzuela, 37, an immigrant from Mexico who said she has legal residency and 
has lived in Oxnard for 20 years. "Lots of people are going to have to go back 
to Mexico."

COLLEGE TRUSTEES WARN OF CHANGES DUE TO CUTS; EDUCATION: THE BOARD SAYS IT 
EXPECTS $1.3 MILLION LESS IN STATE FUNDING. A TEACHERS' UNION OFFICIAL CALLS 
PREDICTION UNREALISTIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Faced with up to $1.3 million in potential state cuts for the 1994-95 school 
year, a majority of trustees of the Ventura County Community College District 
say the district may be forced to re-examine the way it delivers education. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustees Timothy Hirschberg and Pete Tafoya and board President Allan Jacobs 
said the district might have to resort to cutting classes not absolutely 
necessary to a student's ability to transfer to a university or train for a 
vocation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it means a fundamental restructuring of the way we run the district," 
Hirschberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing similar budget worries last spring, district trustees cut 300 classes 
from the 1993-94 schedule, many of which were restored when more money became 
available later in the year.  
</P>
<P>
 College faculty members have said that fewer classes contributed to a more 
than 8% enrollment drop this year, which in turn may cause the district to lose 
funding in future state allocations. Faculty and trustees agree, though, that 
much of the enrollment drop is attributed to a state-mandated rise in student 
fees.  
</P>
<P>
 Hirschberg and Jacobs criticized the district's preliminary budget report, 
released this week, as "too optimistic," and warned that the county's three 
community colleges may be facing even more severe money losses than projected.  
</P>
<P>
 The report predicts a loss of up to $1.3 million in state allocations due to a 
drop in student enrollment, in addition to a loss this spring of approximately 
$972,000 in property tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years running, state officials have slashed the district's spring 
allocation after overestimating property tax revenue projections. 
</P>
<P>
 This past year, in anticipation of more state revenue cuts, district trustees 
put $500,000 in a reserve fund. If the district's property tax revenue loss 
projections are correct, they would still have to cut $472,000 from the 1993-94 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty and student representatives, however, dismissed the district's 
projections and the trustees' concerns as melodramatically dire and ultimately 
unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the usual thing," said Barbara Hoffman, head of the teachers' union and 
a counselor at Ventura College. "They under-project income and over-project 
expenditures. They always say, 'We won't get this,' and 'We won't get that,' 
and most of the time, they get it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman recalled last year's budget process, when the district trustees cut 
300 classes and trimmed maintenance and supplies in anticipation of deep state 
budget cuts. In early August, the trustees learned the district would receive 
$2.4 million more than expected. The district's final budget for the 1993-94 
school year was $63 million -- nearly $1 million more than the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Mumper, the board's student trustee, agreed with Hoffman. "Last year the 
trustees said the same things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumper, whose vote on the board is non-binding, said when the trustees are 
faced with budget losses, they are far too willing to cut from campus expenses 
while refusing to draw from the district's reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "These last few years, we've been watching the district climb out of a 
financial hole, and you wonder, with all these budget problems, how can they do 
that?" Mumper asked, referring to the district pulling itself off the state 
chancellor's watch list by continuing to add to district reserves. "They might 
want to consider where they're cutting all that money from. They might want to 
ask, 'Whose backs are you really riding these cuts on?' "

VENTURA TO CONSIDER HOME LOANS; CITY COUNCIL: THE $1-MILLION PROGRAM WOULD HELP 
LOW- AND MODERATE-INCOME BUYERS PAY FOR DOWN PAYMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council on Monday will consider getting into the home loan 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures is proposing that the council spend about $1.08 
million for loans to low- and moderate-income prospective home buyers to help 
them with down payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures said the program would provide down-payment help to about 40 
families. If council members agree to allocate the money, they would approve 
details of the loan program at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures stressed that the loan program is "not by any stretch of the 
imagination" geared toward very low-income families. Residents who qualify for 
the program would have to be good credit risks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not willing to put the city at risk," said Measures, who worked as a 
banker for about 20 years. "These are average professional people who can make 
the monthly payments, but who don't have that nest egg for a down payment." 
</P>
<P>
 Measures heads the city's housing committee, which has endorsed the plan. But 
other council members on Friday said they have serious doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real poor judgment," Councilman Gary Tuttle said. "That's being a little 
too selective with city funds. I think we have an obligation to spread that 
money around the community a little more than to 40 homeowners." 
</P>
<P>
 The loans would be a onetime program funded by money left over after the city 
recently paid off some housing bonds. A bank or mortgage institution would 
administer the loans for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle said the $1.08 million proposed for the loan program could be spent to 
help revitalize the city's downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be used to help upgrade California or Main streets," Tuttle said. 
"There are better things to do with that money." 
</P>
<P>
 Community Development Director Everett Millais said the money must go toward 
some kind of housing program, but details are up to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford said he has not made up his mind on Measures' proposal, but 
he said the city staff report that outlines the program was not specific 
enough. He said few alternatives were presented for council members to 
consider. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main reservation has to do with the fact that I don't clearly understand 
what they're going to do with the money," Buford said. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that several affordable housing projects have recently been 
completed on the city's east end and said there may be no need for such a 
program now. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures, who has already begun interviewing banks and mortgage institutions 
to administer the program, said many traditional affordable housing programs 
restrict homeowners to buying in particular developments. 
</P>
<P>
 Her program would target low- and moderate-income families, but would not 
restrict them to buying in certain areas or with certain developers. It is also 
not limited to first-time home buyers, Measures said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very flexible," Measures said. "We should be committed to addressing a 
diversity of housing programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Measures' plan, residents would be able to receive up to $30,000 in 
loans and must be able to put down a minimum of 5% on the value of the home 
from their own funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures is proposing that no payments be required for the first five years, 
but simple interest would accrue at 3% per year. From years six to 20, the loan 
would be repaid at 5% interest. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the council, Measures hopes to have the program ready to take 
applications beginning May 1.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; BUSINESSES TO FUND AFTER-SCHOOL PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard businesses pledged Friday to help fund an after-school program aimed at 
keeping children busy when their parents aren't home. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, called "Oxnard Youth After School Program," was organized by 
residents and business owners who worry that children who are unsupervised 
after school are at risk of joining gangs and getting into other kinds of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our purpose is to wake up our community to the problems that we have with our 
young kids," said Ventura County Supervisor John K. Flynn, who heads the 
program. "It is a responsibility that we are taking as a community."  
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Elementary School District officials are set to vote March 23 on 
whether to allow the program to operate in two of the district's elementary 
schools -- Lemonwood and Driffill. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the program will begin in September and would be free to children 
ages 6 to 12. 
</P>
<P>
 It will cost approximately $44,000 a year to run the after-school program. The 
cost includes staff salary, arts and crafts materials and liability insurance.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the organizations that have committed to provide funding for the 
program include the McDonald's restaurant corporation of Oxnard and Port 
Hueneme, Honda of Oxnard, Barber Ford and Isuzu of Ventura and General 
Telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which would be administered either by the Boys & Girls Club or 
Oxnard's Recreation Department, is to be funded solely by businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The centers would be staffed by high school and college students, and by 
volunteer senior citizens of the Ventura County Area Agency on Aging. CHRISTINA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PLAY EQUIPMENT IN MANY PARKS BEING UPGRADED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Play equipment in many of Ventura's city-operated parks is being upgraded as 
part of a $500,000 improvements project, a move parents say is badly needed and 
long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden play structures will be replaced with modern equipment that meets 
current safety standards and requirements of the federally mandated Americans 
with Disabilities Act, said Greg Gilmer, the city's parks contracts and 
services administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The play equipment needs to be removed because some of it's been in there for 
10 to 15 years," Gilmer said. "It's not that the play equipment we have is 
unsafe, but . . . there's certain criteria that has become more strict." 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the city's parks, including the one near the Ventura Pier, already 
have been retrofitted, Gilmer said. But there are still 10 sites that the city 
has slated for upgrading. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmer said Chumash, Hobert and Marina parks will be among the first to have 
their equipment replaced or repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost for upgrading each Ventura park is estimated at about $35,000, Gilmer 
said. The Ventura City Council allocated $500,000 out of the city's general 
fund to finance the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The new equipment is designed with parents' and children's suggestions in 
mind, Gilmer said. "We're going to hold community meetings for each particular 
site." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents are pleased that the city is making the improvements, and some have 
opinions already. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can make a major suggestion -- a place for the parents to sit down," said 
Bambi Ruebe, 36. The Ventura resident frequently brings her 3-year-old son to 
climb on the new play equipment by the Ventura Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ruebe has found some flaws -- "the spacing is too far apart," she 
said, pointing to an arched ladder with wide rungs -- she believes the new 
equipment is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children don't have anywhere to go anymore that's free," Ruebe said. She said 
it is refreshing to see the city spending money on family oriented projects. 
"They spend too much money on other rubbish." 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Griffey, 26, of Ventura occasionally brings his year-old daughter, 
Kaylee, to Hobert Park to play. Griffey said the wooden equipment doesn't 
appear unsafe. "The only thing I worry about is her getting splinters." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Breitner, 43, a former Ventura resident, said the city's improvements 
are "way overdue." 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't see hardly anybody here before," Breitner said of the pier site. 
"They're well-built and I don't see anybody getting hurt on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Breitner's 4-year-old daughter, Hannah, said she likes the new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "My favorite thing to do is go across the bars," she said, swinging from the 
bright blue metal structure. 
</P>
<P>
 The improvements project is expected to be completed by July, 1996. Equipment 
Repair 
</P>
<P>
 Children's play equipment is still scheduled to be repaired or replaced in the 
following 10 parks: 
</P>
<P>
 * Marina Park 
</P>
<P>
 * Blanche Reynolds Park 
</P>
<P>
 * Chumash Park 
</P>
<P>
 * Ocean Avenue Park 
</P>
<P>
 * Strathmore Linear Park 
</P>
<P>
 * Hobert Park 
</P>
<P>
 * Plaza Park 
</P>
<P>
 * Marion Cannon Park 
</P>
<P>
 * Promenade Park 
</P>
<P>
 * Arroyo Verde Park 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors will be notified by letter before community meetings held by the 
city to discuss design suggestions. The first meeting, which will focus on 
Chumash Park, will be held at 7 p.m. March 9 in the Parks Division offices, 336 
Sanjon Road. Information: 652-4556. TRACY WILSON

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 2 MEN CHARGED IN MURDER CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Ventura men have been charged with killing a 36-year-old man who died a 
day after being beaten and robbed of $15, prosecutors said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Everado Mondragon, 35, who at first gave police the name Carlos Tapia Garcia, 
and Jose Sanchez, 24, were arrested last Sunday on suspicion of mugging Thomas 
Edward Shoop of Ventura near the corner of Harrison and Olive streets in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoop identified the men and told police the attack occurred after the pair 
offered to sell him cocaine. At the time of their arrests, officers found $10 
in Sanchez's pocket and $5 in Mondragon's, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Terence M. 
Kilbride. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondragon and Sanchez appeared Friday in Ventura County Municipal Court for an 
arraignment, but the proceeding was postponed until March 9. Judge Bruce A. 
Clarke set bail at $250,000 each. They are believed to be illegal immigrants 
and are under investigation by the U.S. Border Patrol, Kilbride said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office on Friday charged both men with murder and 
robbery. Mondragon has also been charged with selling cocaine and failing to 
appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondragon was arrested in November for allegedly selling cocaine to an 
undercover officer. He failed to appear in court in January for that case, and 
a warrant was issued for his arrest, Kilbride said. 
</P>
<P>
 A man selling newspaper subscriptions discovered Shoop's body Monday. The man 
had knocked on the front door of Shoop's home and -- through a window -- saw a 
body on the floor inside. When he pounded harder on the door, it opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went in and found the guy wasn't breathing, so he ran out and called 911," 
Kilbride said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoop died of a ruptured spleen, although there were no external signs of the 
fatal blow, coroner's officials said. He had refused medical treatment after 
the beating. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 Two Oxnard teen-agers have been arrested on suspicion of participating in a 
drive-by shooting witnessed by a patrol officer on a stakeout, authorities said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gasper Ortiz, 19, was booked into County Jail on suspicion of shooting at an 
inhabited dwelling, carrying a concealed weapon and participating in a criminal 
street gang.A 17-year-old male, whose name was not released because of his age, 
was booked into Juvenile Hall on the same charges as well as driving under the 
influence of drugs or alcohol, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred about 11:15 p.m. Thursday near the corner of San Marino 
and East Poplar streets in south Oxnard. Officer Terry Burr was conducting a 
surveillance of the area when he saw a pickup truck drive by slowly, circle the 
block and return. The passenger leaned out the window and fired a shot toward 
an occupied house. No one was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 The pickup sped away and Burr broadcast the vehicle's description. Officer 
Bill Crisostomo stopped the truck a few seconds later. Both suspects were taken 
into custody, and a gun was found inside the vehicle, police said. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 The Moorpark branch of the Environmental Coalition and the city of Moorpark 
are looking for volunteers to help restore a stretch of the Arroyo Simi 
flood-control channel today and on March 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are needed to help replant native vegetation in the channel between 
8:30 a.m. and 3 p.m. both days, coalition officials said in a prepared release. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 19, 40 people helped plant more than 550 cuttings, and 10 of the 
volunteers won commemorative T-shirts while others were awarded prizes donated 
by local merchants. Coalition officials hope to plant more than 1,000 cuttings 
on each of the two remaining Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who wants to participate should show up at the Teledyne Laars parking 
lot at 6000 Condor Drive in Moorpark. Those wishing to help are asked to bring 
hand clippers or pruning shears, and sharp pocket knives or heavy-duty loppers. 
Hand-held sledgehammers also are needed, and volunteers should wear long pants, 
work gloves, sunscreen, sunglasses and sturdy shoes that probably will get wet. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information or to volunteer, call Roseann Mikos at 529-4828 or Karen 
Rosenblum at 529-8904. JAMES MAIELLA JR.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The U. S. Forest Service has a new phone number for reserving spaces at 
campgrounds, including two in Ventura County's backcountry, officials announced 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals and groups can reserve camping sites by calling (800) 280-CAMP or 
(800) 879-4496 for the hearing-impaired.  
</P>
<P>
 The numbers replace reservation phone lines, officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Operators will take reservation requests for Wheeler Gorge and McGill 
campgrounds in Los Padres National Forest north of Ojai, as well as at 154 
other camping sites across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The reservation center will tell callers which campgrounds are available for 
advance reservations, officials said. KAY SAILLANT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; DISTRICT MAY CHANGE LOTTERY FUND POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moorpark Unified School District will consider changing the way it awards 
its share of state lottery funds to various groups and programs in an attempt 
to more fairly allocate the resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we need to do is get some process in place so that all the groups in the 
district have equal access to that lottery money," board member Clint Harper 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The push for a new policy, first suggested by board member Greg Barker, is 
already finding favor with district officials and could be enacted next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something needs to be done," said board member Tom Baldwin. "The way we're 
doing it right now is in a first-come, first-served basis, so some deserving 
person might come forward and wind up being too late." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's chaotic," Harper said. "It's whoever gets to the school board first and 
gets the ear of one of the board members, which is not easily defended as an 
equitable way of distributing funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Board members this week approved distribution of lottery funds to support 
construction of an asphalt practice track at Moorpark High School and to 
resurface practice mats used by the high school wrestling team. Lottery monies 
have also supported the acquisition of computers and other technological 
teaching aids. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than waiting for individual groups to approach them in search of 
funding, Harper said the board should formally accept applications for 
financial support each quarter so it can judge the uses against each other and 
in light of the available funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The process, Harper said, would not be unlike the one used by cities when 
awarding federal Community Development Block Grants to groups or projects 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The available funds vary from year to year, but usually number in the hundreds 
of thousands of dollars, Harper said. JAMES MAIELLA JR.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COMMISSION PLANS YOUTH ARTS FESTIVAL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As professional performers gear up for the splashy fall opening of the Civic 
Arts Plaza, the Arts Commission has drafted a plan to showcase the talents of 
some enthusiastic amateurs -- Thousand Oaks schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission is organizing a daylong event, dubbed the Conejo Valley Young 
People's Performing Arts Celebration, to take place this spring.Up to 1,000 
students from public and private schools will get a chance to sing, dance or 
act in an outdoor festival, tentatively scheduled for May 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a tremendous response to this," Arts Commissioner Patricia Grant 
told the Thousand Oaks City Council, which unanimously endorsed the idea. 
"We're very excited and the schools are very excited. It looks like an 
excellent opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners expect to raise the estimated $2,000 cost of staging the event 
through sales of food and drink at the festival. Cheered that the city would 
not be asked to put up cash, Councilwoman Judy Lazar complimented the 
commissioners for "finding a way to make it work." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council also approved another Arts Commission event, a proposed 
International Arts Fair that would feature crafts, folk dancing and food from 
various cultures represented in the Conejo Valley. The fair will probably be 
held during the city's annual Arts Festival in June. STEPHANIE SIMON

SIMI TO CONSIDER GROUPS TO RUN CENTER; GOVERNMENT: A COMMISSION, FOUNDATION AND 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CULTURAL ARTS COMPLEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the transformation of a 70-year-old church into a 300-seat cultural arts 
center begins, the Simi Valley City Council on Monday will consider forming a 
commission, foundation and board of directors to run the center. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the plan proposed by city staff members, a five-member cultural 
arts center commission would be appointed to meet monthly and manage the center 
and its finances. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation also would promote the center and directly handle its funds, 
while the five-member board of directors would oversee the operation of the 
center, scheduled to open early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Planning Commission on Wednesday approved construction of the 
center, clearing the way for more in-depth planning. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council approves the plan to form a commission, the city's Ad Hoc 
Cultural Center Committee will begin seeking volunteers to serve four- and 
five-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Mikels, who serves on the committee, said she was eager for 
the commission to start planning activities for the center at 3050 Los Angeles 
Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though the center itself is a ways away from completion, it takes a lot 
of hard work to put a season together," Mikels said. "It's not just one grand 
opening and it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the commission's first tasks, Mikels said, will be to hire a theater 
manager to oversee day-to-day operations of the center, which was purchased by 
the city in 1991 for $821,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Renovation is expected to cost the city $2.8 million. When completed, the 
center will include a theater, a banquet hall and a 78-space parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Silbert, who serves on the board of the Simi Valley Cultural Assn., said 
she hopes to be involved in plans for the new center. The association runs a 
temporary 90-seat theater next to the city's Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an exciting time for all of us," Silbert said. "A center like this is 
long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
 Initial approval to design and plan the center was granted by the City Council 
last August, despite the objections of council members Sandi Webb and Barbara 
Williamson, who did not want to spend city money on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 A consultant's study showed that in a worst-case scenario, the center could 
run up a $95,000 annual operating deficit by its fifth year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the majority of the council agreed to go ahead with the project, saying it 
is badly needed and is supported by most residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Planning Commission meeting on Wednesday, neighbors of the center said 
they were concerned that the planned 78-space parking lot would not be adequate 
for the 300-seat theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission urged the city to make an agreement with a nearby school that 
would allow an additional 60 spaces.

CITY TO DECIDE 2 KEY ISSUES ON PLANNED AMGEN DEVELOPMENT; THOUSAND OAKS: THE 
COUNCIL MUST RULE ON DESIGN AUTONOMY AND HOW TO CALCULATE BUILDING HEIGHT FOR 
THE 100-ACRE CAMPUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks City Council members will spend the weekend studying two sticky 
issues in preparation for a public hearing Tuesday night on Amgen Inc.'s 
development plans. 
</P>
<P>
 First, council members must decide how to calculate building height. 
</P>
<P>
 Amgen officials are pressing for a formula that would average each face of a 
given structure. This system would allow one wing to exceed the stipulated 
height limit, as long as another portion of the building came in shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city's Planning Commission recommended a different standard, urging 
the council to set an absolute cap on building height and allow no wall to poke 
up above that limit. 
</P>
<P>
 The biotechnology company has proposed creating three zones on its campus. 
Buildings on the perimeter would be limited in height to 35 feet, while 
structures deep within the property could reach 55 feet, or in some cases, 70 
feet. If the averaging formula is approved, some parapets could reach even 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
 After settling the height issue, council members must resolve an equally 
knotty problem: how much autonomy Amgen should have in designing and building 
the interior of its 100-acre campus. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a major expansion expected to add 1,500 jobs in five years, Amgen 
officials have proposed doubling the company's office space and adding fresh, 
state-of-the-art laboratory space. 
</P>
<P>
 To speed development, Amgen has requested permission to build structures on 
the interior of the campus without going through the lengthy -- and costly -- 
public review process. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of coming before the Planning Commission for each building, Amgen 
executives have promised to design their buildings to blend with the 
surrounding industrial park and with Thousand Oaks' overall aesthetics. Their 
architects would be bound by a detailed development plan, which the council 
will consider during Tuesday's hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents would not have to worry that the biotechnology firm might, on a 
whim, construct a sprawling pink lab with gargoyles, Amgen executive Ed 
Bjurstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not going to happen. We're building our home here, and we want it to 
conform," Bjurstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that reassurance, the Planning Commission unanimously rejected Amgen's 
proposal to streamline the permit process. Fearful of trampling citizen rights, 
the commissioners insisted that Amgen follow standard procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bjurstrom said he feels confident the City Council will grant exceptions 
for Amgen, the world's largest independent biotechnology company. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, most council members have said publicly that they believe Amgen 
deserves special treatment because the company pumps money, jobs and prestige 
into the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Mayor Elois Zeanah, who repeatedly fights to uphold city standards, 
called Amgen's expansion plan "a unique project because of their specific needs 
for laboratories and research facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such comments please Bjurstrom. He said that after working with city officials 
for two years, he believes Amgen has drafted a plan to match the council's 
standards and policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're confident it will be approved," Bjurstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bjurstrom's only concern: that he might have to sit through another grueling 
hearing. The Planning Commission took 14 hours over two nights to review the 
Amgen expansion plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm praying every night that (the council meeting) won't be as long," 
Bjurstrom said. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally eager to avoid a marathon meeting, Mayor Zeanah promised to direct 
debate toward the main issues of building height and the permitting process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to frame those issues up front and focus on them," Zeanah said. 
"The Planning Commission exhausted other issues, and there's no need for us to 
rehash them."

 I find it interesting, and sweet justice, that Mike Downey (Feb. 19) lost the 
chance to see Dan Jansen win the gold medal while covering the Tonya Harding 
story. It appears a journalist is finally the victim to his -- and the 
industry's -- own journalistic hype.

 Don't blame Tonya for your misplaced values. It was your choice, not Tonya's,

GREED RESPONSIBLE FOR PREP BLOWOUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eric Shepard (Feb. 22) should put the blame for the blowout basketball games 
on the greedy Southern Section playoff system.He should investigate why teams 
with 7-15 and 6-10 records are vying for the section and state championships. 
</P>
<P>
 His statements that coaches should "anticipate a rout" and "bring junior 
varsity players," and that players coming off the bench should play patty-cake 
are ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think that the Southern Section would cut the number of playoff teams 
to make the games more competitive. Nope, too many lost ticket sales. 
Unfortunately, Eric, that is what high school basketball is about.

 The UCLA basketball team seems to be at its best in December, when superior

could easily beat early in the season. The other teams seem to have improved 
over time, but the Bruins are still in early season form. I wonder why that is.

MELROSE GETS STUCK IN FAN'S DOGHOUSE

 Tomas Sandstrom, Jimmy Carson, Shawn McEachern, Bob Kudelski. . . . How do you 
get into Barry Melrose's doghouse? Easy, score a lot of goals.Want ice time? 
Play like Gary Shuchuk, who despite his enthusiasm couldn't put the puck in a 
soccer net. 
</P>
<P>
 When Melrose joined the Kings, he was heralded as a minor league wizard and I 
can see why. With his doghouse tactics, constant line juggling and his 
tolerance of cheap penalties and lazy, undisciplined play, he has transformed a 
Stanley Cup finalist into a minor league team.

 Rafael Ruelas had to be knocked down twice to lift himself higher. 
</P>
<P>
 How low was he? Last Saturday at the Forum, in Ruelas' first world 
championship fight, Freddie Pendleton seemed ready to back up every one of his 
taunts in the first 90 seconds of the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 An overhand right from Pendleton sent Ruelas down early in the first round. A 
harder left uppercut sent Ruelas down again, almost ending it. 
</P>
<P>
 Has there ever been a challenger in a world title fight who won after 
suffering two knockdowns? 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton, who had peppered Ruelas and his handlers for months with taunts and 
insults, was beaming, Ruelas was reeling and the heavily pro-Ruelas crowd was 
groaning. 
</P>
<P>
 It would not last. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually when there's an early knockdown, the person who gets knocked down 
gets scared and starts just trying to survive," Ruelas said this week from his 
Sylmar home. "He stops trying to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got knocked down, and I kept trying to win. I've been pursuing this goal 
for so long -- really, 10 years -- that I wasn't going to quit it for anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes things may not start out the way you want, but that shouldn't stop 
you from going after what you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas weathered the terrible start -- two of the three judges gave Pendleton 
the first round, 10-7 -- and took over the fight with single-minded 
relentlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of the second round, I saw despair on Pendleton's face," said 
Ruelas' trainer, Joe Goossen. "He knew he was in for a long night. I suspect 
that when Rafael got up from those two knockdowns and came on strong in the 
second, Pendleton knew in his mind, 'Wow, I'm in for a long one.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton stuck his tongue out at Ruelas throughout the fight, and Ruelas said 
he got inspiration from that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a sign that he had gotten hit hard," Ruelas said. "He was getting 
tired, getting frustrated, and I told myself to step it up each time he did 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 About 45 minutes after suffering his second knockdown, Ruelas had exactly what 
he wanted: a unanimous decision, giving him the International Boxing Federation 
lightweight title. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 11-plus rounds of stalking the veteran Pendleton, 11-plus rounds of 
wading through Pendleton's sharp punches to deliver scores of heavy body shots, 
11-plus rounds of refusing to drop and accept defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure he probably thought I'd be staying away from him after the 
knockdowns," Ruelas said, "backing away, using my reach. He wasn't expecting it 
when I went back at him." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, Ruelas was a champion -- only the second current L.A.-area 
world champion, along with Genaro Hernandez, the World Boxing Assn. 
junior-lightweight champion -- and a rising star in a sport that needs more of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "This fight came at the right time," Goossen said. "He's 22 years old, it's 
the exact right time for him." 
</P>
<P>
 How high has Ruelas climbed with that down-and-not-out victory? 
</P>
<P>
 "My next fight, my next defense, people will remember how I won the 
championship, and how I came back from being down and how it was won against a 
guy who kept talking," Ruelas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great especially coming back from adversity, in front of the hometown 
fans, and because of all the things he had been saying, which were offensive to 
a lot of the Hispanic people in the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this fight will get people to take notice," Goossen said. "He's a 
star. But now he just needs that dream matchup to really get going." 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael's older brother, Gabriel, a top contender as a junior-lightweight, also 
figures into Goossen's mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas talks of defending his title as long as he feels comfortable at 135, 
then going after the 140-pound title, then through the welterweight division 
and finally ending up as a middleweight. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal was to win a championship," Ruelas said. "But I still have other 
goals, and I will get them one by one." 
</P>
<P>
 Next up for Ruelas is probably a title defense in May at Las Vegas, possibly 
on the same card as a Oscar De La Hoya-Jorge Paez fight.

TENNIS / WOMEN AT INDIAN WELLS; SECOND-SEEDED FERNANDEZ IS UPSET BY COETZER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY CROWE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a day when top-seeded Steffi Graf's greatest lament was a lack of focus, 
defending champion Mary Joe Fernandez had more pressing concerns in the 
quarterfinals of the Evert Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rematch of last year's final, the second-seeded Fernandez squandered a 
3-0 lead in the third set and was upset by sixth-seeded Amanda Coetzer, 6-2, 
2-6, 7-6 (7-4), at Hyatt Grand Champions on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not really supposed to have the past coming into your mind when you're 
playing, but last year's match kept coming back to me," said Coetzer, who 
squandered two match points in last year's final. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very much the same match. I won the first set pretty easily and she 
came back, and I was behind in the third again." 
</P>
<P>
 Graf never trailed in defeating Ginger Helgeson, 6-1, 6-3, in 79 minutes, but 
still found fault with her play. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's obviously a better player than my first two opponents," said Graf, who 
dispatched Gigi Fernandez and Tracy Austin in less than an hour apiece. "On the 
other hand, I don't think I played a very good match. . . . "I'm upset right 
now. Even though the score is 6-1, 6-3, it doesn't matter. I'm just not happy 
with the way I performed." 
</P>
<P>
 What concerned her? 
</P>
<P>
 "Concentration," Graf said. "I played some good points when it was needed and 
some very loose points in between. So, it was very up and down. I just didn't 
focus very well. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always difficult to play at the highest standard, and to always be ready 
on the court, always do the right thing and do the right shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Her opponents should have such problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In one semifinal today, Graf will play Iva Majoli, a 16-year-old from Croatia 
who has lost three times to the German in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you play Steffi, sometimes it's hard to look your best," said Majoli, 
who upset fourth-seeded Natalia Zvereva, 6-3, 7-6 (7-2). "If you play less than 
great, you're going to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Majoli's formula against Zvereva was simple: "I tried to put my serve in and 
not make stupid plays. That's all, really." 
</P>
<P>
 In today's other semifinal, Coetzer will meet third-seeded Lindsay Davenport, 
a 17-year-old senior from Murrieta Valley High who defeated eighth-seeded 
Judith Wiesner of Austria, 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Coetzer, a South African, rallied after Fernandez held serve in the third game 
of the third set, continuing a strong comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, I was upset with the way I was playing," Coetzer said. "I was 
making many errors. I really didn't think I had a chance to even get back into 
the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was playing the ball pretty well, but then she just started spraying the 
ball all over, making unforced errors. I started getting into the points a 
little bit, and before I knew it, it was 3-all." 
</P>
<P>
 Coetzer served for the match at 5-4, but won only one point, losing the last 
on a double fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really disappointed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tiebreaker, Coetzer took a 5-2 lead before Fernandez rallied. She 
appeared to pull even on an overhand smash, but the chair umpire called the 
shot long, giving Coetzer match point. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez argued, gave in after being issued a warning for delaying play and 
hit a forehand into the net, ending the match.

 Kevin Dunne scored a career-high 18 points Friday night as Santa Clara broke a 
three-game losing streak by routing Loyola Marymount, 98-58, in a West Coast 
Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Broncos (13-12 and 6-7), it was the biggest margin of victory in a WCC 
game since they beat Portland, 103-59, in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the poorest performance of the season for Loyola, which committed 20 
turnovers in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara cruised to a 40-19 first-half lead as the Lions shot only 25% from 
the field. The Broncos stole the ball 11 times.  
</P>
<P>
 Loyola (6-19, 4-9) scored only one field goal over the final 10 minutes of the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 For the game, Santa Clara shot 51% and had a 50-31 rebounding edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyking Jones and Bill Mazurie had 14 points for Loyola.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; A GREAT ONE FOR CANADIANS; HOCKEY: EMOTIONAL 
TEAM DEFEATS FINLAND, 5-3, AND SETS UP GOLD-MEDAL DUEL AGAINST SWEDEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Defenseman Brad Werenka, the last addition to the Canadian Olympic team, 
arrived too late on Feb. 12 to attend the opening ceremony. But on Friday, he 
made sure he will be in the event that closes the competition -- the gold-medal 
hockey game. 
</P>
<P>
 Werenka's wrist shot, set up on a perfectly timed pass from the right-wing 
corner by Greg Johnson, broke a 2-2 tie and propelled Canada to a 5-3 semifinal 
victory over Finland and its second consecutive try at Olympic gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutting diagonally toward the net from the right point, Werenka took the puck 
from Johnson and flicked it over the shoulder of Finnish goaltender Jukka Tammi 
at 4 minutes 27 seconds of the third period, giving Canada (5-1-1) its first 
lead of the game and dealing Finland (6-1) an emotional blow it couldn't 
absorb. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I hadn't scored, I would have been in big trouble," said Werenka, who was 
so deep in the offensive zone that he would have been trapped if Canada had 
lost the puck. "But that's the nature of the game. You've got to put your neck 
on the line sometimes. No guts, no glory." 
</P>
<P>
 No problem for Canada, which pulled out to a 5-2 lead before 5,237 at the 
Gjovik Cavern Hall before Finland stirred again. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the third goal we scored, there was only one team playing on the ice," 
Canadian center Petr Nedved said. 
</P>
<P>
 So now Canada will play Sweden for the gold Sunday. The Swedes fended off a 
late Russian rally in the other semifinal game, at Lillehammer, for a 4-3 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei Berezine scored with 1:11 to play and Ravil Gusmanov scored with 1:01 
to go, but Sweden (5-1-1) avenged its loss to Russia in last year's World 
Championships and advanced to the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden has never won an Olympic gold medal. Canada last won the gold in 1952 
at Oslo. Canada lost the 1992 Olympic final to the Unified Team, successor to 
the Soviet Union's powerhouse teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be in this position is just incredible," said Johnson, who is on leave 
from the Detroit Red Wings and is forfeiting about $40,000 of his salary to 
play here. "We're just a bunch of 20-year-old kids having fun. We're not 
(Wayne) Gretzkys or (Mario) Lemieuxes. We're a bunch of no-names, proud to be 
Canadians and playing hockey with a lot of emotion and desire to win." 
</P>
<P>
 That emotion enabled them to beat a Finnish team that probably has more skill 
and certainly has more speed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Finns, who had not trailed in their previous six games -- and had not 
given up more than two goals in any game -- appeared ready for another rout 
when they scored two quick goals early in the second period. 
</P>
<P>
 Sako Koivu scored first, when his slap shot bounced off the skate of Canadian 
defenseman Brad Schlegel and past goalie Corey Hirsch at 2:08, during a power 
play. Esa Keskinen extended the lead to 2-0 on a hard shot through Hirsch's 
pads at 3:48. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of building on that lead, the Finns sat back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got those two goals and we started to play an easy game, take the easy way 
out," wing Mikko Makela said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nedved: "We knew it was going to be a tough game, but we didn't quit. 
They had always gotten the early lead and after the first period in their other 
games, the game was over for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Not this time. Canada broke through at 15:59 of the second period, when Todd 
Hlushko sliced a backhander past Tammi for a goal. The Finns complained about 
offside on the play, although no infraction was obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Nedved tied the score with 36 seconds left in the period on a play set up 
when 5-foot-11, 165-pound Paul Kariya shook off two defenders and floated a 
pass to Chris Kontos in the slot. Kontos' shot bounced off Raimo Helminen's 
foot and over to Nedved, who whipped it past a helpless Tammi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately we felt we were in a position to win when it was 2-2," Canadian 
Coach Tom Renney said. "We felt we had to be close to Finland, and if we'd go 
into the third even or down a goal, we had a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 They made the most of it when Werenka, who had been playing only sparingly 
this season for the Edmonton Oilers, lifted his 30-foot shot over Tammi. Kariya 
initiated that play, too, looking over his shoulder in the left-wing corner, 
finding Johnson and sliding a pass behind the net. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw two guys coming to me, so I knew Greg would be open," Kariya said. 
"Greg made a great play to Werenka . . . . This was probably the best passing 
game I've played. I was really seeing the ice well. It's funny, because today 
it was just situations where I had to pass because I didn't have a good shot." 
</P>
<P>
 And because of that goal, and Jean Yves Roy's power-play slap shot at 7:30 and 
Greg Parks' shot5 that beat Tammi on the glove side, Canada has a shot at the 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the people had expected that Team Finland should win this game," said 
Curt Lindstrom, Finland's coach. "We came to the tournament and were not 
favorites, but after we won in the quarterfinals (a 6-1 victory over the United 
States), everybody talked too much about Finland being the favorite team. It 
was very even and the two teams played very good defense.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure it was the nerves today (that hurt the Finns). It was the 
tactics from Team Canada. The result is fair. It was Canada's day today." 
</P>
<P>
 It will bring about the day Werenka has long dreamed of. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. winning the gold medal in 1980 had the biggest impact an Olympic 
moment has had on me," Werenka said. "That's really been an inspiration to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kariya: "I've been dreaming of this for ages. Facing Sweden is what I've 
been thinking about for some reason. I always imagined myself playing in the 
(final of) the Olympic Games against Sweden. This is just unbelievable for me."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; HOME TEAM'S SKIERS HAVE A DREAMY DAY; 
COMBINED: NORWEGIANS SWEEP MEDALS, WITH KJUS WINNING THE GOLD. MOE IS A STRONG 
FIFTH. 
</P>

<P>
 Children in black wool sweaters danced with grandfathers in gray wool 
stockings, atop the white glistening snow, beneath brilliant blue sky, swept 
along in a red sea of Norwegian flags. 
</P>
<P>
 The movable feast slowly made its way out of the Hajfell Alpine Center here 
Friday, choruses of "Seieren Er Vaar" ("Victory is Ours") echoing off the 
mountainside. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasse Kjus had come home to win the gold in men's Alpine combined, Kjetil 
Andre Aamodt the silver, Harald Christian Strand-Nilsen the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 The Norwegian block party peripherally included American Tommy Moe, the 
champion with Oslo roots. Moe did not win his third medal, but left nothing at 
the gate in pursuit, finishing fifth while missing bronze by 0.27 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle Rasmussen, second in the downhill segment on Feb. 14, had to re-track a 
gate on his first run and ended up 31st.  
</P>
<P>
 "I had a great time in Norway," said Moe, the downhill champion and super-G 
silver medalist. "It was the perfect Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 Took the words right out of the host country's mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway's feat marked only the third time in Olympic history that a nation had 
swept an Alpine event. Austria, which swept the women's downhill at the 1964 
Innsbruck Games, had been the only previous country to sweep on home snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Never, though, had heroes looked more in need of a nap. Norwegians call their 
Alpine skiers the Dream Team, although it is less a description of praise than 
a reminder of their varying states of consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some concern Friday what might become of the medals, once they were 
in the boys' hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Kjus, a charter Dream Teamer, has been known to forget to bring his racing 
suit to events. He was able to recall -- it was nearly a fortnight ago -- that 
he won the downhill combined and stood poised to take the gold so long as he 
could remain standing through the two slalom races. 
</P>
<P>
 Kjus -- it's pronounced shoose, which sounds like schuss -- retained his lead 
after his first slalom run and skied last among the top contenders in the 
afternoon, setting up an emotional run for the gold, since he knew that two 
teammates already had secured medals. 
</P>
<P>
 Aamodt the Great, who skied before Kjus, raced into first with his run, no 
surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise was Strand-Nilsen, 21st after the downhill, who moved into sixth 
place with the ninth-fastest first run. On his second, he seized the lead and 
held it until Aamodt bumped him to second. Then Kjus bounced him to the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 Kjus maintained a 1.06-second advantage over Aamodt as he stood in the gate 
and basically needed only to stay on course to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Seieren Er Vaar.  
</P>
<P>
 "It felt great standing up there on the second run," Kjus said. "Because I 
already knew we had first and second place." 
</P>
<P>
 Kjus did not hold back, surrendering only .04 to Aamodt on his second run and 
winning the combined by 1.02 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 After the post-race celebration, the questioned loomed: Would the Norwegians 
find their way to the press conference? 
</P>
<P>
 Aamodt, who at 22 has won three medals in four Alpine events here and has five 
Olympic medals in all, has a basic look of sleepy-eyed contentment. 
</P>
<P>
 He claims tales of his absent-mindedness are exaggerated, although last year, 
after bragging about his alertness, he stepped into his car and drove off, 
leaving his goggles and gloves on the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Strand-Nilsen, a rookie Dream Teamer, says the stories of Kjus and Aamodt are 
accurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This morning, I had to wait because Lasse and Kjetil forgot their 
accreditation (Olympic identification)," Strand-Nilsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Aamodt? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I forgot my accreditation. We were in the car and had to go back. Harald 
is not a member of the Dream Team, so he just sat in the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Aamodt does not reveal the strain of one asked to live up to enormous 
expectations. The world's best all-around skier was touted as having a chance 
to win five gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
 He has had to "settle" for a silver in downhill and combined, and a bronze in 
the super-G. He has a last chance for gold in Sunday's slalom, an event in 
which he is defending world champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were maybe a little ambitious for me," Aamodt said. "This year, I have 
only won two (World Cup) races and one combined in 30 races. I would have to 
win five races in a row in the Olympics. It is not realistic to think like 
that. Three medals in four events -- that's more than I could have hoped for." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Moe, he came to the Olympics a relative unknown and departs a star, 
having posted the best performance by an American male skier in any Olympics, 
two medals and fifth in combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe, not a slalom specialist, said he would have had to "ski my brains out" to 
win a medal. 
</P>
<P>
 He almost did. He had a faster first-run slalom time than Luxembourg's 
legendary Marc Girardelli. In the second, Moe finished five-hundredths slower 
than Aamodt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tommy made a heck of a statement today," said Paul Major, the U.S. Alpine 
director. "He's one of the best skiers in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Major was so thrilled, he said Moe could develop into an all-event skier 
within a year and challenge Aamodt. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Major would have choked on those words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone would have laughed at us," he conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moe made believers of many. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew the guy could ski," Major said. "He's a lot like Aamodt. He can be a 
four-event skier." 
</P>
<P>
 Moe will ski the giant slalom for the first time this season next week, when 
the World Cup circuit resumes at Aspen, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 A different Moe returns home today, to a different America. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been receiving as many as 100 fan letters a day at the Olympic village. 
An electronics company has already made overtures to his agent about creating a 
"Tommy Moe Downhill" video computer game. 
</P>
<P>
 And back home, Alaska cities are fighting over territorial rights. Is he the 
downhill champion from Palmer, where he once lived? 
</P>
<P>
 There, T-shirts are already on sale, proclaiming Palmer "Moe-Town USA." 
</P>
<P>
 Or, is Moe the pride of Girdwood, where he now resides? 
</P>
<P>
 Or, is it Montana, where Moe lived as a child? 
</P>
<P>
 Moe says he'll always be the same old Tommy, except: "I wouldn't mind going on 
Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
 Producers for David Letterman's show had in fact tried to book Moe for a March 
1 taping, but Moe had to cancel because of a schedule conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Something having to do with a ski race. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Moe is busting out all over. 
</P>
<P>
 He raced Friday in a generic black and white race suit because the slalom 
uniform given him before the Games didn't fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's grown in stature since he's been here," Major said. "He was a medium. 
Now he's larger."

WORST IS OVER; ANGEL PROSPECT KEVIN FLORA SAYS HE FINALLY HAS RECOVERED FROM 
DEATH OF HIS WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Flora glanced down at his body lying in bed, and could feel his soul 
leaving him. It was so peaceful, so gentle, he began searching for his MaryAnn. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no doubt at all what was happening to him. He was shutting down 
life. He actually could feel himself dying. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't sleeping and couldn't eat. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unbearable to live like this, to be in total control and to have no 
control at all. He finally realized that he needed a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 He needed a reason to keep living. 
</P>
<P>
 He needed an excuse to keep playing baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 He needed MaryAnn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost all desire in life," said Flora, whom the 
</P>
<P>
 Angels are hoping will be their starting second baseman. "I had always wanted 
to make the big leagues for myself, but my drive was for us . . . for us to 
have a good life. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the accident happened, I just said, 'What's the use?' Without her, 
baseball didn't mean anything. Nothing did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything I ever wanted in life was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Flora stared vacantly ahead, caressing the jewelry dangling from his necklace. 
</P>
<P>
 It was MaryAnn's wedding ring. The diamond was never found in the accident, 
but Flora made sure the ring stayed with him, vowing to wear it forever. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just been so hard," Flora, 24, said. "There's not an hour in a day when 
I don't think about her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just kept telling myself, 'She's gone. My God, she's 22 years old, and 
she's missing out on her own life.' I just couldn't handle that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what finally got me through this is the realization that she's in a 
better place. She's watching me right now, and one day I'll be seeing her 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I want to do this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to do it for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Flora blinked away the tears from his reddened eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flora stood in the shower on the evening of April 22, 1993, allowing the hot 
water to sooth his aching muscles. Most of his teammates had already left the 
visiting clubhouse in Calgary, but Flora was in no hurry, still savoring 
Vancouver's 15-9 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Life couldn't be better. He was batting .359 with five stolen bases in the 
first 10 games of the season, and it would be only a matter of time before the 
Angels would call him up to the big leagues to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 He actually was feeling exhilarated, come to think of it, but he knew the real 
reason was because of MaryAnn, his wife of 17 months. MaryAnn had left two 
weeks ago to see her family in Midland, Tex., but now she was driving 12 hours 
to their home in Chandler, Ariz., and would be rejoining Kevin in Vancouver by 
the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't wait. He constantly was being teased by his teammates for being so 
in love with MaryAnn, but he couldn't care less. He called her each night on 
the road before going to bed, talking for two hours sometimes, and earlier this 
afternoon, he had bought her a card expressing his love. 
</P>
<P>
 It's funny, he thought, how madly they had fallen in love. He'd met her three 
years ago at a restaurant in Midland. It was love at first sight. Kevin told 
her he played baseball, and she confessed that she'd never seen a baseball 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 He used to wrinkle his nose and tease her for saying, "It makes me so nervous 
when you get off those little white things." They are called bases, he kept 
reminding her. 
</P>
<P>
 These three years together had been the greatest time of his life. They went 
to Hawaii on their honeymoon, Venezuela on vacation, and bought their first 
home in Chandler, 10 minutes from the Angels' spring training complex. He was 
even starting to teach MaryAnn how to play golf. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were so in love," Angel pitcher Mike Butcher said. "It was like they 
were in their own world. Nothing else really mattered." 
</P>
<P>
 Flora's daydreaming was suddenly interrupted when he was summoned by Vancouver 
Manager Max Oliveras. It was Flora's father calling from California. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately, Flora thought the worst. Something had happened to Mom. Maybe his 
brother. This could not be good. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you know something," Flora said the other day, "the thought that 
something happened to MaryAnn never even crossed my mind. I knew MaryAnn was 
traveling, but I never imagined . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Oliveras handed the telephone to Flora, and moments later he heard a ghastly 
scream. Flora threw the phone against the wall and collapsed in shock. 
</P>
<P>
 MaryAnn and their 4-year-old nephew, Alec, had been killed in a car accident. 
Her mother, Alice McCombs, was in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even today, I'm not sure just what happened," Flora said, "and I really don't 
want to know. I can't even think about it. I just get sick to my stomach." 
</P>
<P>
 MaryAnn had been on the road for 2 1/2 hours, driving on a lonely stretch of 
Interstate 10 outside Van Horn, Tex., when it happened. She had passed a car 
and moved back into the right lane when the wheels touched the dirt median. She 
lost control. The vehicle veered to the left, back to the right, and over to 
the left. It flipped into the air, and MaryAnn and Alec were dead upon impact. 
</P>
<P>
 MaryAnn's mother was the only passenger wearing a seat belt. She suffered a 
broken hip, broken collarbone, separated shoulder and multiple fractures of her 
right leg. She remains in a wheelchair, unable to care for her husband, Don, 
who recently underwent brain surgery for the second time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the scene of the accident a couple of days later," said Randy 
Crook, MaryAnn's brother-in-law, "just to see what caused it. We were looking 
for anything to blame it on, but there was nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Vancouver pitcher Mark Holzemer, who accompanied Crook: "I think that's 
what made this so difficult to accept. It wasn't like you could blame the 
accident on a drunk driver or anyone else. We knew she was driving. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just made no sense, no sense at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Had the Angels not urged Holzemer to fly with him to the funeral, Flora 
wonders if he would be alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a godsend," said Bobbie Flora, Kevin's mother. "I don't know what 
Kevin would have done without Mark. I don't know what we all would have done." 
</P>
<P>
 Holzemer accompanied Flora on the flight from Calgary to Ontario. There they 
met Flora's parents and the Angels' Bill Bavasi, but still had a two-hour 
layover. 
</P>
<P>
 They stood uncomfortably in the airport, no one saying a word. Finally, Bavasi 
suggested that they get away for a while and rented a car. Holzemer drove, 
going no place in particular, as everyone sat in virtual silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst moment came when a light turned green and we weren't moving," 
Holzemer said. "There was a long line of cars coming and we couldn't move. 
Well, it was a funeral procession. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that just hit everyone at once." 
</P>
<P>
 They boarded the plane to Texas, and once again, sat in silence. Nobody knew 
what to say, so no one tried. 
</P>
<P>
 "My God, I can't begin to tell you how hard it was for all of us," Bobbie 
Flora said. "MaryAnn was like a daughter to us. She was absolutely perfect for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, to see this happen, to see how it affected Kevin, to be 23 years old 
and be a widower . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Randy Crook: "That's what everybody was worrying about. We lost MaryAnn, 
would we lose Kevin, too?" 
</P>
<P>
 Flora, who was comforted by seeing Tim Salmon, Damion Easley, Butcher and 
nearly a dozen members of the Angel organization at the funeral, decided to 
stay in Midland after the services. He wasn't sure what he was going to do with 
the rest of his life, but he knew right now that he needed to be with MaryAnn's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed to be around somebody who was suffering like I was," Flora said, 
"people who knew what I was going through." 
</P>
<P>
 Flora continued to grieve long after his friends and teammates left, and 
showed no signs of recovering. There was no malice, or any other emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "For weeks, it was like talking to a zombie," Bobbie Flora said. "There was no 
inflection in his voice, nothing. We'd call him every night, and then just cry 
when we got off the phone." 
</P>
<P>
 It took three weeks before Flora dared even to venture outside again, and that 
was only when Valerie Crook, MaryAnn's sister, purposely forgot to bring home 
the newspaper. It was two months before he picked up another baseball. It was 
three months before he left Midland, and even then, it was too early. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had spiritually died," Bavasi said. "He looked like a guy who was telling 
himself, 'I'm going to go right down to the ashes, and then I'll rise again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Flora returned to Vancouver on July 18 to resume his baseball career, but it 
was useless. He didn't feel like playing and he remained angry at the world. He 
became frightened the way he so easily lost his composure, whether sitting in 
traffic or watching TV. 
</P>
<P>
 He would have these intense mood swings in which he would be smashing his 
locker in anger one minute, and be sobbing in the middle of the clubhouse the 
next. The only constant was that he didn't feel like playing baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadians twice traveled to Phoenix after Flora's return, but he couldn't 
bring himself to go near his home. He wasn't ready to be reminded of the way 
life used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The season ended with a final trip to Calgary, site of that fateful phone 
call. Flora begged off, and one week before the Canadians' season ended, Flora 
was on his way home. He had played in only 20 games since his return, mostly as 
a designated hitter, and the Angels were wondering if they would ever see him 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, Flora said, couldn't have been more supportive and generous to 
him. They provided first-class airline tickets for him and his family, even 
paying the way for those Angels who attended MaryAnn's funeral. Owner Jackie 
Autry told Bavasi to spare no expense, and Flora and his family remain deeply 
moved by those gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there were some in the organization who were growing impatient. They 
asked Flora to play winter ball, but he came back from the Arizona Fall League 
after one week. He told them he couldn't play in any of the Latin countries, 
either, because it would stimulate memories of their time together in 
Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, Flora wouldn't have felt like playing if they set up a league in his 
back yard. He was not ready. Instead, he went to Riverside to live with Larry 
Gonzalez, a high school buddy who played four years in the Dodger farm system. 
Gonzalez's best friend drowned when he was 19, and he helped Flora in trying to 
cope with such a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty worried about him," Gonzalez, said, "because this is the 
kindest, gentlest guy I've ever met in my life. If something like this was 
going to happen to one guy, it would crush Kevin the most." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez, whose brother-in-law is Angel scout Darrell Miller, knew the club 
was worried about Flora's future. It had been nearly seven months since the 
accident, and still, Flora remained traumatized. He didn't feel like going to 
the batting cage, he got bored after 15 minutes of their workouts and he was 
dreading life without MaryAnn. 
</P>
<P>
 The break finally came in November when his agent, Bill Moore, and Moore's 
wife Pam, convinced him to sell his Chandler home. Flora knew he could never 
live there again, but now it was time for him to return there and collect his 
belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bracing himself for the moment he had long dreaded, and accompanied by Moore 
and Butcher, Flora finally stepped into the house. He was immediately engulfed 
in emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the second toughest day in my life," Flora said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flora excused himself several times while inside the house, unable to hold 
back the tears while thinking of MaryAnn, but he was able to get through it. He 
wound up keeping only a small pile of pictures and love letters. MaryAnn's 
clothes were sent to her four sisters, and the rest of the household items were 
sold or given away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the best thing that he could have done," Gonzalez said. "When he came 
back from that trip, I knew he was going to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went from not being able to listen to certain songs without crying, to 
singing those same songs by the time he left. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that really got him after coming back was at my wedding 
rehearsal dinner. We played, 'Unforgettable.' It turned out that was the first 
song at their wedding, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started crying, and before you knew it, the whole place was bawling right 
along with him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flora returned to the Angels' clubhouse this week for the first time since 
last spring. He knows it won't be easy this spring. It is his first major 
league camp without MaryAnn, and the Angels will do everything to ease his 
discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
 Flora, who moved to Tempe last month and has been working out every day, said 
he has never been more prepared in his life. This is where he has wanted to be 
ever since his father, Jerry, began coaching him in Little League. This is 
where he belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the guy we want to win the job," Bavasi said. "It's not to take away 
anything from the other guys, but when you look at a kid his age, and being the 
fastest guy in camp, he'd fit in perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
 Flora, who attended Bonita High in La Verne, realizes that he has the talent. 
He believes he has the will. The rest, he says, is up to the grace of God. 
</P>
<P>
 It was MaryAnn who inspired his religious beliefs, and Flora became a devout 
Christian, was baptized in front of her family. It's this strong belief that 
convinces him things will again be all right. His life will never be the same, 
of course, but he will survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've worked harder than anything in my life preparing for this day," Flora 
said. "I don't know how to say this, but it's just so different now. It's 
almost like I wish I was a football player so I could just go out there and 
sacrifice my body. They could break my bones, whatever, I couldn't care less. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't have anything more to lose. I've already lost everything in 
life. Now, I want to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is for MaryAnn."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; HARDING STILL HAS SOME LOOSE ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY and MIKE DOWNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling herself a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown, Tonya Harding 
placed a distant eighth in the Winter Olympic women's figure skating 
competition here Friday night, with one last flair for the dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Her shoelace came untied. 
</P>
<P>
 Frantically trying to repair or replace it, Harding reported tardy to the ice, 
missing her introduction. She then began skating to music from the film 
"Jurassic Park" but stopped, 45 seconds into her four-minute freestyle program, 
bursting into tears and skating off. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding was permitted to begin anew 32 minutes later. She skated 
satisfactorily for the most part, but brushed a wall at one point and did not 
do her trademark triple axel. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Harding said: "I think I did quite well under all the 
circumstances, because I think I was ready to have a nervous breakdown before I 
went out the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 After a shoelace snapped during her warm-up, Harding said, a replacement lace 
was too small. She said: "I tried to go out and skate anyway. I didn't have all 
the holes laced up. I skipped three on the outside and two on the inside, then 
laced it toward my ankle on one side and on the top of the other, just trying 
to tighten it. I only had two minutes to get out there before I would be 
disqualified." 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing she would break her ankle, Harding attempted her opening moves and 
then quit. She has a history of similar equipment mishaps, interrupting two 
competitions in 1993 with problems with a loose skate blade and an unfastened 
costume snap. 
</P>
<P>
 Such occurrences are uncommon but not unprecedented. A skater in the men's 
competition here last week repeated his routine after difficulty with a blade. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding ultimately rose from 10th place after Wednesday night's technical 
program to eighth in the standings and was upbeat afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked, though, whether she would skate competitively again, Harding said, "I 
don't know. I haven't decided." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Nancy Kerrigan, who placed second, Harding was complimentary after being 
reminded that in January she had expressed a desire to "kick her butt." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding said, "A lot of people misconceived what I said. What I mean by that . 
. . that's my competitive spirit. It's not in a mean way. I'm really glad Nancy 
skated great. I hope she did it not only for herself but for the country and 
for our team." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeered at the outset for being late but generally cheered upon conclusion of 
her second try, Harding waved to the audience and pronounced herself pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "I react best under pressure, but it all depends on the kind of pressure you 
put yourself under or what other people put you under. But the Lord works in 
mysterious ways and everything is done for a reason. So He must have His 
reasons for this. Maybe He wants me to come back later." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding's hearing before the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. regarding possible 
disciplinary action against her is scheduled to begin March 10. A grand jury in 
Oregon also is weighing whether to indict Harding in the case concerning a Jan. 
6 assault on Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if pressure from the investigations had any effect on her outcome here, 
Harding replied: "I'm not going to talk to you about that."

RIZZUTO, DUROCHER JOIN HALL; BASEBALL: ONE EX-YANKEE SHORTSTOP OVERJOYED, BUT 
MYSTERY SURROUNDS WHETHER 'THE LIP' WILL BE REPRESENTED AT INDUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two shortstops, one who wanted in so badly that the entire borough of the 
Bronx campaigned for him and the other so bitter about his exclusion that he 
said he didn't want the honor, were elected to baseball's Hall of Fame by the 
Veterans' Committee Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Phil Rizzuto and Leo Durocher will be inducted on July 31 in Cooperstown, 
N.Y., along with pitcher Steve Carlton, who was elected in January by the 
Baseball Writers Assn. of America. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether anyone will represent Durocher, who died in 1991 in Palm Springs at 
86, is uncertain. "If they don't think I belong there, so be it," he said in 
1986. 
</P>
<P>
 His bitterness grew with each mention of his name in connection with the Hall, 
and shortly before his death, he said he was going to put in his will that no 
one should pick up his award, should the voters have a change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no problem getting Rizzuto, 76, to Cooperstown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holy cow!" he said when teammate Yogi Berra, a member of the committee, 
telephoned with the news. Berra then handed the phone to Pee Wee Reese, 
Rizzuto's former Dodger rival, and former Yankee announcing partner, Bill 
White, now president of the National League. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese and White are also members of the 16-member committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost fell to the floor," Rizzuto said from his home in Hillside, N.J. 
"Way back, I told you huckleberries I never expected to get in. . . . I never 
really felt like I belonged and that's not a nice feeling. I played all those 
years, and then as a broadcaster I felt I was on the outside looking in." 
</P>
<P>
 Others thought he belonged, including most of the Bronx, which was incensed 
when Reese was elected by the committee in 1984, his first year of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Yankee officials, players and fans campaigned for Rizzuto through 15 years of 
eligibility in the writers' voting and 11 years of consideration by the 
Veterans' Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Reese and Rizzuto, slightly built with similar offensive characteristics, 
ruled New York infields in the 1940s and into the '50s, with a seemingly annual 
rivalry in the World Series. Rizzuto, who had a career batting average of .273, 
usually won, a fact often mentioned when Reese, who batted .269, was elected to 
the Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought maybe he should have gotten in sooner," Reese said. "A lot of young 
bucks will just look at his (statistics), but you have to look at his overall 
value to his team. He was a great shortstop." 
</P>
<P>
 Durocher did not carry Hall of Fame credentials as a player. He was a 
good-field, no-hit shortstop who broke in with the Yankees, playing for a while 
with Babe Ruth before moving on to the Cincinnati Reds, St. Louis Cardinals and 
Brooklyn Dodgers. He batted .247. 
</P>
<P>
 The stature of Leo "the Lip" was built as a manager in 24 seasons with the 
Dodgers, New York Giants, Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros, with whom he won 
2,008 games. He made countless enemies with his abrasive nature and fiery 
approach to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 His last job in uniform was as a coach with the Dodgers under then-manager 
Walter Alston. Durocher was fired when he mentioned to a reporter that he would 
have managed things differently after a Dodger loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Durocher is perhaps best known for a misquote that ended up in Bartlett's 
Quotations: "Nice guys finish last." 
</P>
<P>
 It came from an interview in New York while he managed the Dodgers and was 
asked about Mel Ott's Giants. "Nice guy," Durocher said of Ott. "He'll finish 
last." 
</P>
<P>
 His approach to baseball was perhaps best illustrated in a 1951 story. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I'm playing third base," Durocher said. "My mother's on second. The 
ball's hit out to short center. As my mother goes by me on the way to third, 
I'll accidentally trip her up. I'll help her up, brush her off and tell her I'm 
sorry, but she doesn't get to third. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to win all the time. If we're spitting at a crack in the wall in my 
office for pennies, I want to beat you at it. Anybody can finish second. I want 
to finish first if I can. After that, I've done my job. Otherwise I haven't." 
</P>
<P>
 He did his job three times in those 24 managerial seasons, winning pennants 
with the 1941 Brooklyn Dodgers and with the 1951 and '54 New York Giants. The 
'51 club overcame a 13 1/2-game deficit in the last two months of the season 
and won a three-game playoff series from the Dodgers on Bobby Thomson's "shot 
heard 'round the world" home run in the Polo Grounds with Durocher coaching at 
third base. 
</P>
<P>
 Durocher won his only World Series in 1954 with the Giants, sweeping the 
Cleveland Indians in four games.  
</P>
<P>
 Durocher, who married actress Laraine Day, was Hollywood's darling, with a 
circle of friends ranging from Frank Sinatra to Bugsy Siegel. His association 
with gangsters and gamblers got him suspended from baseball for a season by 
then-commissioner A.B. (Happy) Chandler, whom Durocher blamed for his exclusion 
from the Hall of Fame.

MIKE DOWNEY: '94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; BAIUL WINS ON A SPLIT DECISION; 
NOW KERRIGAN SHOULD BE ASKING, 'WHY ME?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 First she got mugged, now she has been robbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Life, fate and figure skating took one last unfair twist for Nancy Kerrigan. 
She was sparkling. She was spectacular. She was virtual perfection. Ladies and 
gentlemen of the jury, she was the best one out there. Yet from the necklace 
she was modeling here Friday night dangled a silver charm, when the jewelry 
damn well should have been golden. And she skated away from these Winter 
Olympics wearing the stiffest of upper lips, still a good sport, still with a 
winning smile, still Nancy with the laughing face. 
</P>
<P>
 Second best? 
</P>
<P>
 No way, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 No justice in this frontier this day. Second place was one place too low for 
America's skater. Kerrigan was in first place and her performance was anything 
but second-rate. Consider this no reflection whatsoever on the mastery and 
maturity shown by tiny Oksana Baiul, the Ukrainian in the furry pink bunny 
suit, the kid with the sweet tooth for Snickers bars and just about the 
sweetest 16-year-old you ever did see. Baiul skated her heart out, and in as 
much pain as Kerrigan was in last month. But she's the one who should have been 
second. Sorry. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they're singin' in Ukraine, just singin' in Ukraine, what a glorious 
feeling, they're happy again. And about all Americans can do is roll out a red 
carpet and stand waiting for Kerrigan to return home, so, first chance they 
get, they can say to her face pretty much what she said on her own behalf at 
the Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre at the anticlimax of this wild adventure: 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I was great." 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Nancy: 
</P>
<P>
 You aren't the only one. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Noriko Shirota of Japan scored it Kerrigan first, Baiul second. Judge 
Margaret Wier of the United States scored it Kerrigan first, Baiul second. 
Judge Wendy Utley of Great Britain scored it Kerrigan first, Baiul third . 
Judge Audrey Williams of Canada scored it Kerrigan first, Baiul third . And 
just for the record, Judge Jan Hoffman of Germany -- 1980 silver medalist 
himself at Lake Placid -- had the two skaters tied on his scorecard, an 
artistic edge being the tiebreaker in a point system Albert Einstein could not 
have cogently explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone else? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, me, volunteered Josee Chouinard, who skated for Canada and placed ninth, 
right behind Katarina Witt and Tonya Harding. While saying she was glad not to 
be a judge, Chouinard lined up on Kerrigan's side, saying: "Technically, for 
sure, Nancy deserved it. . . . She did more difficult things, I know that. In 
my mind, Nancy won." 
</P>
<P>
 Far more adamant was Paul Wylie, men's silver medalist in 1992 and admittedly 
biased as Kerrigan's longtime friend. Wylie said: "Give me a break! It seems 
obvious to me Nancy was the winner. To me, it was cut and dried." 
</P>
<P>
 As it was to Christopher Howarth, expert skating analyst for EuroSport 
television, who concluded his broadcast with: "For me, I would definitely have 
had Kerrigan on the top. I would still have given her the gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, sir. 
</P>
<P>
 Majority rules, though. Which is, if nothing else, democratic. And in a split 
decision, judges Jarmila Portova of the Czech Republic, Jiasheng Yang of China, 
Jan Olesinski of Poland and Alfred Korytek of Ukraine -- who was as true to his 
country's skater as an American judge was to hers -- cast their lots with the 
German judge to give the gold medal to Baiul. Which only goes to prove that 
life is not always a cabaret, old chum, even if that was the snappy show tune 
to which the Ukrainian skated. 
</P>
<P>
 With a wistful, what-else-can-I-do expression on her face, Kerrigan said, 
"Hey, I was smiling, I was happy, I was enjoying myself and I did all my 
elements. How can I complain?" 
</P>
<P>
 No need. 
</P>
<P>
 Permit us to do it for her. 
</P>
<P>
 It could be Baiul got a sympathy vote, not unlike an Oscar winner who has 
recently been through a harrowing ordeal. But that would be absurd logic 
indeed, considering that every skater in this competition feared that it was 
Kerrigan herself with whom judges' sympathies would lie. And it could even be 
our own xenophobia rearing its own ugly head, foreigner-bashing on behalf of 
America's sweetheart, subconsciously or otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us reiterate, then, that Baiul was quite wonderful. Damaged in a 
two-skater smashup the previous day, she took painkillers, she wept with 
anguish, she competed, she wept again with delight, she clutched a stuffed 
animal and she practically swooned at discovering she had won. Sixteen years 
young and at 99 pounds now heavyweight skating champion of the world, Oksana 
was asked what she wanted and all she could think of was something even 
sweeter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sneekers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sneakers?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No. Sneekers ," clarified her interpreter, Viktor Syzomenko. "Sneekers. The 
candy bar." 
</P>
<P>
 What reward Nancy Kerrigan wanted most was not immediately clear. Money, fame, 
those were along the way. Privacy seemed more precious to her at the moment. 
From the day someone had battered her and turned she and compatriot Tonya 
Harding into rancorous rivals, Kerrigan had felt more hounded than threatened, 
more claustrophobic than adored. She said the 1992 Olympics had been more 
enjoyable. Back home in New England and here in Scandinavia, she said, "I've 
felt like a prisoner." 
</P>
<P>
 She shouldn't be feeling that way, not today. 
</P>
<P>
 She should feel like a champion. 
</P>
<P>
 On a winter's night in Norway, when nine judges sentenced her to second-best, 
Nancy Kerrigan was not a prisoner. But what happened to her, for the second 
time, was a crime. The Scoring

CLIPPERS DON'T NEED MANNING; PRO BASKETBALL: THEY BEAT KINGS, 121-111. WILKINS, 
WHO IS EXPECTED TO PLAY SUNDAY, SAYS HE IS BITTER ABOUT TRADE.

 Danny Manning, who cleaned out his locker Thursday night after being traded to 
the Atlanta Hawks for Dominique Wilkins and a conditional draft pick in 1994 or 
1995, left a sign on his empty stall: "Peace My Brothers -- D" 
</P>
<P>
 And peace seems to have returned to the Clippers in the post-Manning era. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody here loved Danny, he was well liked by all the players and coaches, 
but it was just a rough situation and it needed to be resolved," Clipper Coach 
Bob Weiss said. "It was just something I couldn't overcome as a coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing their first game after the trade, the Clippers took a 19-point 
first-half lead and held on to beat the Sacramento Kings, 121-111, Friday night 
before an announced crowd of 8,083 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper rookie forward Harold Ellis, who received a bottle of cologne and 
tennis shoes from Manning after he cleaned out his locker, also got another 
gift -- more time. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, who had played 10 minutes in six games since the All-Star break, had 26 
points and a season-high seven rebounds in 26 minutes. Ellis, who had 20 
first-half points, including 16 in the second quarter, made his first seven 
shots as the Clippers ended a five-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Elmore Spencer scored a career-high 28 points and grabbed a season-high 
13 rebounds to lead the Clippers (18-34). 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Richmond made a team-record eight three-pointers and scored 37 points to 
lead the Kings (19-35). 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins is due to arrive here today and Weiss moved practice back to 5:30 p.m. 
so that Wilkins can work out with the team after taking his physical exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins is expected to make his Clipper debut in Sunday's game against Seattle 
at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, who idolized Wilkins while growing up in Atlanta, looks forward to 
meeting him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it sounds strange, but I'll actually get a chance to meet Dominique," 
Ellis said. "I watched Dominique playing and my best friend is crazy about 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wilkins, 34, is seven years older than Manning, who was having the 
best season of his six-year NBA career, and is shooting a career-low 43.2% this 
season, the Clippers insist that they made a good trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We exchanged a superstar for a superstar," forward Loy Vaught said. "Now we 
just have to learn how Dominique plays and learn how to support him." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Wilkins thinks the Hawks mishandled the trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm bitter, and a little mad, too," Wilkins said Friday at a news conference 
outside his Atlanta-area home. "I felt I helped get this team to this point and 
then they disrespected me. The bottom line is that we were winning here. I was 
playing and I was having a good season." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins was angry that the Hawks didn't personally notify him. Wilkins wasn't 
home when team executives Pete Babcock and Stan Kasten came to his house. They 
talked to his wife, who was unable to reach Wilkins on his cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Manning received a standing ovation before the Hawks' game against the 
Milwaukee Bucks Friday night at Atlanta. He passed his physical but wasn't in 
uniform. "I'm excited about coming to the Atlanta Hawks," he said. "Dominique 
was a player here for a long time. He was a legend for the city. I'm not going 
to try to replace him. I'm just going to go out and play the best I can." . . . 
The Clippers will receive Atlanta's first-round pick in 1994 if the Hawks 
finish 20th or higher. However, if they finisher lower than 20th and don't sign 
Manning, the Clippers would have to compensate the Hawks with a future 
first-round pick if they opted to take the Hawks' 1994 first-round pick. The 
Clippers can elect to take the Hawks' 1995 first-round pick if Atlanta signs 
Manning. However, the Clippers won't get the pick if the Hawks don't sign 
Manning. . . . The Clippers signed rookie forward Charles Outlaw to a second 
10-day contract before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper guard Ron Harper, whose vocabulary has consisted of "whatever" since 
he was suspended for making negative statements about the team, maintained his 
silence after the trade of Manning, his closest friend on the team. Harper had 
T-shirts printed up for the team with "Say What!" on the front and "Whatever" 
on the back.

THE LAKERS GET CAUGHT OFF GUARD; PRO BASKETBALL: THE SPURS ROLL TO A 126-110 
VICTORY AS TONY SMITH WATCHES FROM THE BENCH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He is the shooting guard who is shooting only 39.2%, apparently destined to be 
the caretaker for the spot in the opening lineup between Anthony Peeler's 
injury and, perhaps, Doug Christie's recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 But, suddenly, Tony Smith is noticeably absent from the Lakers. What was 
curious Thursday at Sacramento as he went from a starter the previous 14 games 
to not even getting in the game became downright eyebrow-raising Friday night 
at the Forum, where the best backcourt defender on the team stayed on the bench 
again as the San Antonio guards scored 69 points in a 126-110 victory for the 
Spurs before 13,783. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Anderson had 33 points, making 14 of 18 shots. Vinny Del Negro had 24 
while going 10 of 14. Negele Knight had 12 points off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith had few answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes and no," he said after the Lakers lost for the fourth time in five games. 
"Ask the guy up there. He knows everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was motioning toward Coach Randy Pfund. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pretty much know what's going on," Smith said. "But there's nothing I can 
do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 So what is going on? 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say," Smith said. "But it is going on." 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing going on, Pfund said, is that the Lakers figure it would be a 
good idea to have some scoring in their offense. Even if that means starting a 
small backcourt of 6-foot-2 Threatt and 6-1 Nick Van Exel and leaving Smith to 
watch and wonder as the Spurs shot 60.5% and won for the 14th time in the last 
15 games. Even if it means that, yes, Pfund might understand Smith feeling 
unsure about his role. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe," Pfund said. "The main reason I took Tony out of the starting lineup 
was not because of defense. He had, I think, 10 consecutive games where he 
didn't shoot 50%. He was not shooting the ball at all. It became a real 
struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have to try some other things. Tony had a good 10-game run, but he 
hadn't been going well lately. Tonight, I thought rather than go with James 
Worthy or Tony that I would give a look at Reggie Jordan and see if he could 
give us a shot in the arm." 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off a double-overtime loss Wednesday at Utah that ended their 13-game 
winning streak, the longest in franchise history, the Spurs quickly found their 
stride again. So quick that they needed only 7:10 to take a 23-12 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 About a minute later, the lead reached 27-12, before dipping to 33-22 at the 
end of the first quarter. No wonder. The Spurs shot 61.5%, got 13 points from 
Willie Anderson and had this comfort zone in rebounding: 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Rodman 9, Lakers 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers slowed Rodman in the second period, but not the Spurs. Finding a 
soft spot in the interior defense, San Antonio continued to shoot well and 
stretched the lead to 65-45 at halftime, Anderson accounting for 27 of the 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked a lot like the start the last time the teams met at the Forum, with 
one exception. The Lakers scored more than 25 points in the first half this 
time. The Spurs were in control and the home team got booed. 
</P>
<P>
 At least on that Jan. 9 night, the Lakers made a second-half comeback for a 
respectable 95-89 loss. That possibility disappeared this time when the Spurs, 
and Del Negro in particular, broke into a quarter-long layup drill after 
intermission, hindered only occasionally by having to weave through another 
team en route to the basket.

MORNING BRIEFING: THEIR GOAL: FIRST TRIPLE TRIPLE-DOUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Basketball fans in the community of Galva, Ill., aren't seeing double, they 
are seeing triple. 
</P>
<P>
 Galva High is on a fast break. Kraig Gale passes to Kyle Gale, who shoots. 
There for the rebound is Kevin Gale. Or was that Kraig on the rebound? 
</P>
<P>
 Even their father, Bob Gale, has a hard time keeping track as the triplets run 
down the court. 
</P>
<P>
 The three 6-foot juniors have led Galva's basketball team to a 20-4 record and 
the Lincoln Trail Conference championship. All three have been starters the 
past two seasons and they also compete in football and track. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not the whole athletic department, but they do contribute," their 
father says. "When they were little, I never could tell them apart. Even now I 
sometimes have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Brad Hulick claims that he has no trouble. "I've had them in classes for 
four years," he says, "and their style of play is different. I put the style 
with the face. 
</P>
<P>
 "They bring a special competitiveness to our team. As triplets, they have had 
to compete all their lives. They play tough defense, and on the break they 
always know where the other two are." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: What university has the most golfers on the PGA Tour? 
</P>
<P>
 First choice: Which O'Bannon will be drafted first? It won't be either Ed or 
Charles, who play basketball for UCLA. It will be their older brother, Turhon, 
a wide receiver at New Mexico, who is expected to be chosen in the NFL draft 
April 24-25. 
</P>
<P>
 Merely wondering: Times veteran Mal Florence says that until recently he 
thought the luge was something your car had along with an oil change. 
</P>
<P>
 Basket cases: A late, late basketball result the other night: 
</P>
<P>
 The Carthage (Ill.) High Blueboys 108, Dallas City 103 -- in eight overtimes. 
The game lasted 3 hours 10 minutes. There were 77 fouls and 92 free-throw 
attempts. Ten players fouled out. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't such a disappointing loss for us," Dallas City Coach Lee 
Purchatze said, "you'd have to say it was an amazing basketball game." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Oklahoma State with 11, followed by USC with eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead-footed crybabies: Picabo Street didn't read Sports Illustrated before 
skiing the women's downhill at Lillehammer to earn an Olympic silver medal. 
</P>
<P>
 It's probably a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 In its Olympic preview, the magazine derided the U.S. Alpine team as a bunch 
of lead-footed crybabies who would need a miracle to win a medal in the Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's response? So far: two golds and two silvers. 
</P>
<P>
 Street said she heard about the article, but decided not to read it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want any of that extra negative energy around," said the 22-year-old 
from Sun Valley, Ida. "I had a job to do. I was nervous enough."

LOPEZ'S 27 LEAD WAVES TO NO. 2 SPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Damin Lopez made six-of-six three-pointers in the first half Friday night and 
led all scorers with 27 points to pace Pepperdine to an 88-65 victory over St. 
Mary's in Moraga, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine improved to 15-10 overall and 7-6 in the West Coast Conference, 
moving into a second-place tie with San Francisco. St. Mary's fell to 12-13, 
4-9. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am pleased with our defensive intensity and the team is really sharing the 
ball," Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury said. "And that opens up the offense." 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves started the game with a 20-9 run over the first 8:30, including four 
of Lopez's three-pointers. Accurate shooting and forward Dana Jones' 10 
first-half rebounds helped expand the Wave lead to 46-26 by the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Gaels were only outscored 42-39 in the second half, they could 
get no closer than a 15-point deficit the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Mary's was outshot 59% to 32% from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones finished with 19 points and 16 rebounds.

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; NORWEGIANS CLEAN UP IN SKI JUMPING; SKI 
JUMPING: COUNTRYMEN BREDESEN AND OTTESEN WIN GOLD AND SILVER MEDALS IN DREAM 
DOMINATION OF THE EVENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER, TIMES ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Espen Bredesen got it almost exactly right the first time. Then the best ski 
jumper in Norway improved on that, helping make Friday a day for the ages in 
Norwegian skiing history. 
</P>
<P>
 Bredesen's two stylish jumps off the normal hill gave him the gold medal, at 
the expense of teammate Lasse Ottesen, who wound up with the silver. 
</P>
<P>
 And those medals, thrown in with the three won by Norwegians in the men's 
Alpine combined earlier in the day, had the crowd at the jumping hill singing 
the Norwegian victory song long into the afternoon, probably into evening and 
maybe into this morning.  
</P>
<P>
 Bredesen had jumps of 329 feet 8 inches and 341-2, a hill record, for 282 
points. Ottesen jumped 336-3 and 321, totaling 268 points. German Dieter Thoma 
was third, totaling 260 1/2 points on jumps of 323-1 and 336-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Bredesen had finished second to Thoma's teammate, Jens Weissflog, in the 
big-hill competition Sunday, but Norway was shut out of the medals Tuesday in 
the team event, so the 1-2 finish of Bredesen and Ottesen was probably even 
more than most Norwegians had hoped for. Not so Bredesen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I needed any inspiration but with the Norwegians doing so good 
in Alpine, I said to Lasse, 'Now we have to do something.' " he said. "I've 
known for a long time that Lasse is a very good skier and I hoped he could pull 
it off today." 
</P>
<P>
 Ottesen not only pulled it off, he came close to relegating Bredesen to 
second. Jumping midway through the first round, he launched himself into the 
longest jump to that point, then sat back and waited, watching the other top 
guns -- Thoma, Andreas Goldberger of Austria, Weissflog, even Bredesen -- all 
fail to beat it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ottesen, however, had been antsy in the air and when Bredesen jumped, the 
difference was obvious to observers and judges. Although his jump was shorter, 
Bredesen kept his body still in the air and moved into the lead on style 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't happy, though, to have been outdistanced. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first jump was good but not perfect," Bredesen said. "I was a little late 
on the takeoff and figured I could do better." 
</P>
<P>
 And so he did. Jumping last in the second round, right behind Ottesen, he 
needed near perfection, knew it and got it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was much more aggressive," he said. "I got more height." 
</P>
<P>
 He also got the distance he was looking for, even forcing himself to cut the 
jump a bit short for fear of overshooting the landing area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have had a few more meters but I was afraid I was too high," he said. 
"I felt when I jumped that it was going to be a good one. When you hit a good 
jump, you know it. The feeling is just incredible. Everything is just perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Weissflog, who had outjumped a leading Bredesen in the second round for the 
gold medal on the big hill Sunday, had two good jumps but made an untidy 
landing the first time around, then failed to get high enough on his second 
jump and finished fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up on the hill before the last jump, I was saying to myself, 'Don't do the 
same thing again (as on Sunday),' " Bredesen said. 
</P>
<P>
 And when he nailed the second jump, Norway had finished first and second in 
Olympic jumping competition for the first time since the '52 Games at Oslo.

 "That's great," Bredesen said. "Lasse pulled off a very good jump and I did, 
too, and everything is terrific."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; DATELINE / LILLEHAMMER; AT THIS BAR, MONEY 
GOES DOWN THE DRAIN

<P>
 Got a tiny thirst? 
</P>
<P>
 Drop into Cafe Rorlegger'n, pull up a toilet seat and have a beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Careful, don't knock that pipe wrench onto somebody's head. And try not to 
mess up that nice faucet display. This place isn't going to be a bar forever, 
you know. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Cafe Rorlegger'n has been a bar for only a little over a month. And 
come April 1, it will go back to being a plumbing-supplies shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Roger Rud is one of several local businessmen who saw money to be made on 
the Olympics and jumped at the chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I wanted to open a bar during the Olympics but a friend told me to do 
it here, in the shop," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Rud's plumbing shop became a bar -- Cafe Rorlegger'n loosely translates to 
Plumber's Bar -- on Jan. 15 and has been doing a booming business ever since, 
serving beer, soda, coffee and sandwiches from early morning till long into the 
night. You can recognize it by the water heater in the snowbank outside. 
</P>
<P>
 The place was full at 10:30 in the morning the other day. Tourists and locals 
were mingling there, chatting over beer and sandwiches, watching the women's 
biathlon on TV. A lot of them were cheering, too. Never see that in the States. 
</P>
<P>
 If you decide to visit, though, you won't really be able to park yourself on a 
convenient toilet seat, since regular bar stools are in use. But if you look up 
from the bar, there is a lovely selection of commode covers hanging there. And 
on the walls are tasteful displays incorporating faucets, shower assemblies, 
sinks, pumps, towel racks, TP holders and other plumbing needs. An old-timey 
looking bathroom is set behind glass and galvanized buckets serve as 
lampshades. Lengths of PVC pipe in various sizes rest on ceiling racks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rud has help -- a manager and several bartenders -- but is beginning to look 
forward to the day everything gets back to normal. He is running the plumbing 
business out of the basement and garage -- he lives over the store -- and 
taking his daily shift behind the bar as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he has been working so hard, he doesn't even know for sure if he's 
making money. But he has a pretty good idea that he is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is going very good," he said. "I am glad I did it." 
</P>
<P>
 So are his thirsty customers. MIKE KUPPER

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; BAIUL'S COACH WANTS TO BRING HER TO U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 When the women's figure skating competition at the Winter Olympics was over 
Friday night, and her precocious pupil had won the gold medal, Galina 
Zmievskaya sighed with relief and spoke of the difficulty in molding an ice 
princess in a rink not even fit for commoners. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have no idea how the Olympic champion prepared for this," she said of 
16-year-old Oksana Baiul's training in Odessa, Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to hose down the ice. We had no Zamboni. Never before has the Olympic 
champion had such bad conditions to prepare in." 
</P>
<P>
 With the collapse of the former Soviet Union, federations in the newly 
independent republics had to find their own financing. Among the destitute was 
the Ukraine skating federation. 
</P>
<P>
 The upkeep of the rink in Odessa was primarily provided by 1988 Olympic men's 
gold medalist Viktor Petrenko, who also is coached by Zmievskaya and trains 
with Baiul. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Petrenko probably returning to Las Vegas and resuming his touring, 
Zmievskaya is seeking independent financing. Fortunately for her, she was 
sought after as a coach, even before Baiul won the gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 Zmievskaya is scheduled to leave today for Moscow, where she will meet with 
U.S. embassy officials early next week to conclude arrangements for acquiring a 
green card that will allow her to work in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Michael Rosenberg of Palm Desert, the agent for Petrenko and 
Baiul, Zmievskaya has offers from Lake Arrowhead's Ice Castle International 
Training Center and a rink in Newark, Del. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've both made her generous offers that were on the table even before 
tonight," Rosenberg said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherever she goes, Rosenberg said, she will take Baiul. Zmievskaya might be 
training her for a professional career, including ice shows, instead of for 
serious competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not obvious that she's going to compete after this," he said. "There's a 
question about whether she should turn professional for three years and then 
try to reinstate before the next Olympics. She could set herself up for life, 
as well as her children and grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "But part of her wants to keep going with this. That's the bigger part of her 
inclination."

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; NOTEBOOK; GERMAN WINS GOLD IN WOMEN'S 5,000, 
BUT NOT NIEMANN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 German speedskater Gunda Niemann isn't going home empty-handed from her last 
Olympics, but there won't be any gold in her satchel. 
</P>
<P>
 The skater who was expected to dominate the women's distance events here 
missed again Friday, tiring badly in the 5,000-meter event and finishing second 
to teammate Claudia Pechstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "Close, but I didn't make it," Niemann said. "Claudia was better today." 
</P>
<P>
 Niemann finished the Games with the silver, a bronze in the 1,500 and a DNF in 
the 3,000, the race that started her problems here. She fell in that one, the 
first of the women's five races. 
</P>
<P>
 Niemann won gold in the 3,000 and 5,000, and silver in the 1,500, in the 
Albertville Games two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In winning her first gold medal, Pechstein cut nearly 20 seconds off her 
personal best and finished in 7 minutes 14.37 seconds. Hiromi Yamamoto of Japan 
was third. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Russia won its third biathlon gold medal in the women's 30-kilometer relay, 
taking advantage of two lapses on the rifle range by Simone 
Greiner-Petter-Memm, favored Germany's third skier. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians -- Nadejda Talanova, Natalia Snytina, Louiza Noskova and Anfisa 
Reztsova -- won in 1 hour 47 minutes 19.5 seconds, all four shooting perfect 
scores, which meant no penalty loops to ski. Biathlon combines target shooting 
with cross-country skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 Greiner-Petter-Memm missed three times shooting prone, then missed three more 
times from the standing position and had to ski a 150-meter penalty loop for 
each miss. Her team finished nearly four minutes behind the Russians in second 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 France, the defending Olympic champion, took the bronze and host Norway was 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team was a surprising eighth in the 17-team field, the best any 
American team or individual has done in Nordic events here. Competing for the 
U.S. were Beth Coats of Breckenridge, Colo.; Joan Smith of Honeoye Falls, N.Y.; 
Laura Tavares of Lake Placid, N.Y., and Joan Guetschow of Minnetonka, Minn. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Espen the Eagle? Norwegian ski jumper Espen Bredesen didn't take kindly to 
that nickname at Albertville two years ago, when he was struggling with a 
change in jumping styles, and he still doesn't like it as an Olympic gold- and 
silver-medal winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was meant a little different when they said it in Albertville," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And indeed it was. It was a none-too-flattering comparison of Bredesen to 
England's Michael (Eddie the Eagle) Edwards, the semi-blind Englishman who as a 
ski jumper at Calgary in 1988 was a pretty good house painter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it any better now," Bredesen said after winning the 90-meter 
hill championship. "I don't think I should be compared to Eddie the Eagle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speedskater Dan Jansen, who ended years of Olympic frustration when he won the 
men's 1,000 meters Feb. 18, will carry the flag for the U.S. team Sunday at the 
closing ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an honor because it seems very appropriate to end my Olympic career with 
something like this," Jansen said. "It's a different honor than winning a 
medal, because it's something that's been voted on by my teammates. I've 
enjoyed these Games more than any of the others and this is a fitting way to 
end it." 
</P>

 Norway's medal outburst Friday -- three in Alpine combined skiing and two in 
ski jumping, moved the host country into the overall lead, where it figures to 
remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Norway has 25 medals, Russia 22. Norway, however, has medal prospects in 
Sunday's men's slalom and today's 50k men's cross-country ski race. Russia has 
medal prospects in hockey and the men's biathlon relay. MIKE KUPPER

'94 WINTER OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER; BACK HOME, THEY CAN ONLY LISTEN AND WAIT; 
REACTION: SUPPORTERS OF KERRIGAN AND HARDING TAKE THE NEWS FROM NORWAY WITH 
CHINS UP.

 In Portland, Ore., the Olympic figure skating competition competed on radio 
talk shows with listeners seemingly more angered over the Trail Blazers' 
inability to trade for Danny Manning than over the failure of Tonya Harding to 
live up to her Olympic boast of a gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Clackamas Town Center in Portland, where a Tonya Harding sign hangs 
over her home rink, the noontime crowd of skaters -- most of them youngsters -- 
appeared largely oblivious to the fact that Harding was performing at that very 
moment thousands of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 There were few radios among the shoppers who gathered around the ice rink to 
watch the skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few people monitoring the figure skating results was Judi Galusha, 
38, of nearby Milaukie, Ore., who spun around the ice with her two children 
while listening to her radio with headphones. 
</P>
<P>
 When she heard that Oksana Baiul of Ukraine had won the competition, she 
smiled. "I was hoping that somebody else would win, and not Nancy (Kerrigan) or 
Tonya," she said. "I thought there was too much attention placed on them, so I 
wasn't rooting for either one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara McKeever, 40, of Sandy, Ore., had rushed to the rink to hear the 
results and was pleased when she learned that the Ukrainian had won the gold 
although she said she had been hoping for a Kerrigan victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought there was too much controversy made over Kerrigan and Harding at 
the Olympics. It would have been nice for Nancy to win, but I think the outcome 
was great," McKeever said. 
</P>
<P>
 But 11-year-old Nicole Green wore a pink button on her T-shirt saying "We 
believe in Tonya" as she skated at the Clackamas rink. When she learned that 
her hometown favorite had failed to win a medal, she was clearly downcast and 
said she and her friends had watched Harding practice for the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think she's wonderful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who did not seem outwardly concerned about the goings-on in 
Lillehammer was a vendor whose cart featured small "Tonya Going for Gold" 
prints -- at $6 and $12 each -- near the ice rink. 
</P>
<P>
 Who was she rooting for in the final program? "I don't want to say," she said. 
"I don't want to offend any customers." VICTOR MERINA

 USA Hockey, the sport's national governing body, is reserving judgment on the 
Dream Team idea for the 1998 Nagano Winter Games in Japan. Dave Ogrean, the 
organization's executive director, said the format might discourage youngsters 
in USA Hockey's developmental programs, some of whom have earned berths on the 
Olympic team in previous years. They would lose that incentive if NHL players 
took those spots, Ogrean said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the biggest philosophical dilemmas to deal with," he added. "We 
don't have a formal position on this. A lot of people, and it's not entirely 
inappropriate, cling to the experience of 1980 (when college players dominated 
the roster of the gold-medal U.S. team). The truth is, though, the sports world 
and the hockey world have changed since then, like it or not. Our mind is open, 
but we're also very interested in being an integral part of the decision-making 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal would have to be approved by the end of 1994 for scheduling to be 
completed by organizers in Nagano. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman favors the idea, but the NHL Players Assn. is 
not enthusiastic -- especially since it wasn't invited to talks between Bettman 
and International Ice Hockey Federation officials here last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I don't like it at all," said former NHL defenseman Doug Wilson, 
who now works for the NHLPA. "There are a lot of questions to be answered as it 
stands now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. goaltender Garth Snow backs the Dream Team idea and hopes he will be 
chosen for a second Olympic team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd do it again next year if there was another Olympics," he said. "I just 
have to bust my butt in the NHL to get back here." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Games, Snow is expected to rejoin the Quebec Nordiques. Fellow 
goalie Mike Dunham is awaiting word on whether he will report to the New Jersey 
Devils or their farm club in Albany, N.Y. HELENE ELLIOTT

 Norway's Harald Christian Strand-Nilsen may have the longest name of any 
Olympic medal winner. 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't end there for the bronze-medal winner in Alpine combined 
skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family calls me Christian," he says. "At school they call me Harald. The 
team calls me Harry or Boris. New friends call me Brother, because that's what 
my sister calls me. Choose from that what you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Anything else? 
</P>
<P>
 "My family calls me Harald Christian when they're mad at me."

 After Norway had received the Olympic bid in 1988, the government underwrote 
$100 million to the country's sports program, hoping to increase its medal 
chances. The plan afforded Norway the chance to hire former Austrian coach 
Dieter Bartsch to run the Alpine program. 
</P>
<P>
 It paid off. Norway won its third, fourth and fifth Alpine medals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there is talk that the Alpine budget will be cut after the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the training will not be so good anymore," Strand-Nilsen said. "There 
are not so many people (Alpine) skiing in Norway. We need the racers we have." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You won't hear any complaints from the Norwegians about the new rules in 
scoring the combined, weighing the slalom more heavily than the downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it easier for the public to understand what's going on," Lasse Kjus, 
the combined gold-medal winner, said. "And to make it exciting to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After posting the second-fastest time in the combined downhill, Kyle Rasmussen 
gave it his best shot in the slalom, but missed a gate on the first run, hiked 
back up to re-ski it and finished in 1 minute 8.24 seconds, 17 seconds off the 
pace. He finished 31st. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't be conservative to win a medal," said Rasmussen, from Angels Camp, 
Calif. "In the Olympics, the only thing that counts is the top three. That's 
what I was going for." 
</P>
<P>
 Rasmussen, who had not raced a slalom this season, admitted he was ready to 
return to downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 "After five days on slalom skis, I'm ready to go straight again," he said.

 Kerrigan's family and friends in Stoneham, Mass., took in her silver-medal 
performance with a mixture of pride and disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I was hoping a little too hard that this would be the time.It's 
disappointing. I really thought this was her turn," said June Scarpa, manager 
of Stoneham Ice Arena, where Kerrigan learned to skate. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members listened to live radio broadcasts of Kerrigan's performance at 
a relative's home in North Reading, two towns away. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen relatives and friends gathered around a radio and visualized the 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was announced that Kerrigan would take the silver, they erupted in 
cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take the silver," said her aunt, Joanne Tarason. "We'd still love her 
even if she came back without a medal."

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; CURTIS WANTS TO SIGN AND PLAY BALL

 The Angels are trying to sign center fielder Chad Curtis to a three-year 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis, who had stolen 91 bases in his first two major league seasons, is 
hoping to reach an agreement by Thursday that will give him in excess of $5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be appreciated," Curtis said Friday at Tempe, Ariz., "but I 
would like to get this whole business over with and just play ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis would be sacrificing two years of arbitration eligibility by signing 
the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels signed third baseman Damion Easley to a one-year contract earlier 
in the day, and exchanged contract proposals with right fielder Tim Salmon on a 
four-year contract. They continue to negotiate one-year contracts with 
shortstop Gary DiSarcina and reliever Mike Butcher. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It was one of the most awkward experiences of veteran reliever Lee 
Guetterman's career, but Friday morning, there was is reward -- an empty locker 
awaiting his arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 Guetterman, 35, who couldn't find a general manager to return his calls, much 
less offer him a job, decided to go about business the old-fashioned way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get a yes on the phone," Guetterman said, "so I decided to make some 
personal appearances." 
</P>
<P>
 Guetterman spent his own money for a flight from his Knoxville, Tenn., home to 
Phoenix. He gave the Angels a call Wednesday, worked out for 20 minutes 
Thursday and was spending his first day on the job Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I had never done before," Guetterman said, "It was like going 
out and finding a job. Believe me, it's an experience I'll always remember." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Buck Rodgers said that barring the unexpected, Bo Jackson will 
make the opening-day roster. The final outfield job, he said, likely will be up 
for grabs between Dwight Smith and rookie Jim Edmonds.....Easly, who missed the 
final two months of last season because of surgery on his right leg to correct 
tibial stress syndrome, said he is feeling no ill effects while playing third 
base....If Kevin Flora wins the starting job at second base, Rodgers said he 
will decide between Torey Lovullo, Rod Correla and Mike Brumley for the final 
utility infield position. Spike Owen already is assured of at least one of the 
utility jobs....The Angels are planning to open the season with 10 pitchers, 
allowing Rodgers to retain a third catcher, either Mark Dalesandro or 
Edmonds....Designated hitter Chili Davis is scheduled to arrive in camp today.

NHL ROUNDUP; HEXTALL GETS MAD, THEN GETS EVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ron Hextall served notice before the opening faceoff that he was taking 
nothing from anybody, jawing with Philadelphia Flyer forward Claude Boivin at 
center ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia's Dave Brown came over. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's Mick Vukota followed, and suddenly all 40 players were against the 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 That done, Hextall took the rest of the evening personally. 
</P>
<P>
 He stopped 23 shots in his third consecutive shutout at Uniondale, N.Y., where 
the Islanders beat Philadelphia, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 With a streak of exactly 207 minutes, the Islanders broke their home shutout 
streak of 138:18, set in February of 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Hexy was involved in something like that in warm-ups before with the 
Flyers," Vukota said. "The players are subject to a $25,000 fine, and since 
I've already had my quota for the year, I was glad to get out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 Vukota was suspended earlier this season and fined $10,000 for coming off the 
bench during a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Lachance scored in the first period for New York and Pierre Turgeon in 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give Hextall credit," Philadelphia defenseman Gary Galley said. "He made some 
big stops. Every now and then, you hit a goalie playing like that. It was a big 
game, and he came up big." 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 3, Buffalo 1 -- Rich Sutter scored his ninth and 10th goals of the 
season in a three-minute stretch of the second period to lift the Blackhawks at 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Roenick extended his goal-scoring streak to four games for Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 7, Winnipeg 6 -- Bryan Smolinski and Cam Neely each scored twice at 
Winnipeg, as the Bruins handed the Jets their club-record tying 10th 
consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss extended Winnipeg's winless streak to 18 games (0-16-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Boston is 4-1-1 on its current seven-game trip.

NBA ROUNDUP; MIGHTY HAVE FALLEN: CELTICS LOSE NO. 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Boston Celtics set a franchise record in 1949 with 10 consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they got Red Auerbach to coach, a lineage from Bob Cousy and Bill Russell 
to Larry Bird. The team won 16 NBA championships. 
</P>
<P>
 But they're all gone, Auerbach and the players, and what's left broke the 1949 
record Friday, losing their 11th in a row, 115-102, to the Seattle SuperSonics, 
who got 25 points from Kendall Gill. 
</P>
<P>
 Next in view for the Celtics: the Lakers, Sunday at the Forum in a matchup of 
old tormentors on hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys are working as hard as they can," Boston Coach Chris Ford said. "We 
just don't have the talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Kemp had 23 points and 13 rebounds and Detlef Schrempf scored a 
season-high 23 points for the SuperSonics. 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier McDaniel scored 21 points and Rick Fox 17 for the Celtics, who scored 
100 points for the first time in the losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team is very aware of the streak," said Robert Parish, the last holdover 
from the good old days. "But it's something we shouldn't dwell on. We've just 
got to go out and play hard. Otherwise, we'll get a loss for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Denver 102, New York 94 -- Mahmound Abdul-Rauf scored 28 points and the 
Nuggets overcame Patrick Ewing's 35-point performance at Denver. The victory 
was the fifth in six games for Denver, while the Knicks suffered their third 
consecutive defeat and their fifth loss in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 107, Phoenix 87 -- Jay Humphries, starting in place of the traded Jeff 
Malone, scored 23 points at Salt Lake City and the Jazz beat Phoenix for the 
first time in three tries this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 110, Detroit 90 -- Rik Smits had 25 points and 10 rebounds at 
Indianapolis for his third consecutive double-double in leading the Pacers, who 
have won seven in a row at home, 11 of their last 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit lost its third in four outings and 26th in its last 32. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 114, New Jersey 102 -- Nick Anderson scored 28 points and Dennis Scott 
23 at Orlando in the Magic's franchise-record sixth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Anderson had 33 points and 12 assists and Derrick Coleman, who signed a 
five-year, $37.5-million contract earlier in the day, added 23 points and nine 
rebounds for the Nets. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 111, Milwaukee 100 -- With newest acquisition Danny Manning in street 
clothes on the bench, Duane Ferrell, starting in place of the traded Dominique 
Wilkins, scored 20 points and Kevin Willis scored 17 of his 21 points in the 
fourth quarter at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Willis, who also grabbed 13 rebounds, made eight of nine shots in the final 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 107, Golden State 97 -- Bobby Phills scored a career-high 26 points 
and Tyrone Hill, filling in for the injured Larry Nance, had 21 points and 17 
rebounds for the Cavaliers at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors lost Billy Owens when he aggravated his sprained right shoulder 
early in the third quarter. They have lost two in a row since their six-game 
winning streak and a report in the San Jose Mercury News said Friday that the 
relationship between Chris Webber and Coach Don Nelson has gotten so bad that 
Webber may try to leave the team after this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 116, Washington 94 -- Horace Grant had 26 points and 13 rebounds for 
the Bulls at Landover, Md., in dealing the Bullets their fifth loss in a row, 
12th in their last 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 115, Philadelphia 84 -- Glen Rice scored 25 points and Steve Smith 21 at 
Philadelphia as the Heat handed the 76ers their eighth consecutive loss, 
longest losing streak for the team since it dropped 13 in a row during the 
1972-73 season.

GOLF / PGA AT SAN DIEGO; SECOND 65 PUTS TOMS IN CHARGE BY THREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Toms had his second seven-under-par round at Torrey Pines to take a 
three-shot lead at the halfway point of the Buick Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing seemed to faze the 27-year-old player from Bossier City, La., who shot 
a 65 on the tougher South Course Thursday and followed with another 65 on the 
North Course Friday for a 130 total. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronnie Black, one of the leaders after the first round, played the courses in 
reverse order and followed his 65 with a 68, slipping into a tie for second 
with Mark Wurtz. 
</P>
<P>
 Toms was 14 under par for the tournament after his 13th hole of the day, but 
settled for pars down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed five-foot birdie putts on two of the last three holes," he said. 
"And I thought I hit a perfect approach shot on my 17th hole (the eighth), but 
it went a little long. That was probably adrenaline. I'll need to control 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 He hesitated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been nice to sneak those putts in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Barr, the veteran who played the first two rounds with Toms, said: "I 
think that last putt was the only one he missed in two days. A couple of times 
today, he got in trouble and missed greens, but he got up and down for his 
pars." 
</P>
<P>
 If Toms felt badly about missing two five-foot putts, imagine how Kirk 
Triplett felt. He shot a 63 on the North Course to move into a tie for fourth 
place at 134 with Craig Stadler, Brad Faxon and Tom Byrum -- in spite of 
missing two 18-inch putts. 
</P>
<P>
 Toms, who tied Bob Eastwood's four-year-old 36-hole tournament record, is 
looking for his first victory in three-plus years on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I've been 14 under after two rounds on the tour (before)," he 
said. "My overall performance hasn't been that great, but I think I'm a better 
player than I've shown. Maybe this will be the week that I break out." 
</P>
<P>
 Toms played the first four holes in par Friday and then had seven birdies over 
the middle nine holes of his round. He put himself into position and made his 
putts when he had the opportunity, most of them from 10 to 15 feet, but one 
from 30. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the pivotal holes of the first two days for Toms was the 14th on the 
South Course Thursday. His drive nestled against a root, leaving him a blind 
and almost impossible shot to the green. He got his par. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what was going to happen when I swung," Toms said, "and I 
couldn't even see where it went after I hit it. It rolled up on the green and I 
got the par." 
</P>
<P>
 The North Course figured to be easier. And, in a sense, it was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't hit the ball as well today as I did yesterday," Toms said. "I just 
made some putts." 
</P>
<P>
 Stadler, 40, of San Diego, who has played hundreds of rounds at Torrey Pines, 
did the same thing Toms did. He went from the South to the North and matched 
his score, in Stadler's case two 67s. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played a lot better yesterday than I did today," Stadler said. "If you keep 
the ball reasonably in play on the North, you should shoot three or four or 
five under. I scraped around and made a couple of birdies and ended up with a 
67 that felt like a 72 or 73."

 Southern California College's Ila Borders, the first woman to pitch in a 
college baseball game, got into her first collegiate jam Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders, struggling with her control in the third inning of Vanguards' home 
game against Concordia, threw three consecutive balls to T.J. Wilcoxson with 
the bases loaded.Each errant pitch intensified the volume of the razzing from 
the Concordia dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Borders ran the count to 3 and 2, Wilcoxson hit a soft liner up the 
middle that SCC shortstop Jason Brissey fielded on one hop and threw to first 
for the out. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders got into trouble in several other innings, but was good enough to help 
the Vanguards to a 10-1 victory in a round-robin game of the SCC tournament.

THOROUGHBRED RACING; SHE BECAME FIRST WOMAN TO REACH WINNER'S CIRCLE

 There are 82 good reasons why men and women should not ride against each 
other. They are the 82 jockeys who were killed in racing accidents since 1940.  
</P>
<P>
 -- NICK JEMAS, national managing director, Jockeys' Guild, 1969 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years ago this week, teen-aged Barbara Jo Rubin won a race with a 
6-year-old gelding at a leaky-roof track in Charles Town, W. Va., and became 
the first female jockey to win a thoroughbred race at a recognized track in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked the other day about how she felt hitting the wire first with Cohesion, a 
half-length winner over a stablemate, Rubin said: "It felt good just to be able 
to ride. That's all we ever wanted to do, to get the chance to compete like the 
men did." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin, 44, goes by B.J. Warman now, using the initials from her name and the 
last name of her second husband. They run a horse-drawn carriage business and 
teach riding near West Palm Beach, Fla. When B.J. was 12, growing up in 
Florida, her future husband used to give her mounts in match races at bush 
tracks. "Dick made a lot of money off me then," she said. "Nobody wanted to bet 
on the horse ridden by the girl, and I won a lot of races for him." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years of the female riding movement, some female jockeys would go 
by initials instead of given names, hoping trainers might hire them without 
knowing their sex. Patti Cooksey became P.J. Cooksey, and went on to win more 
than 1,200 races. One day, an unsuspecting trainer, meeting Cooksey in the 
paddock before a race, blurted: "Hey, you're a woman!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Cooksey said. "I've been one for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Bryan Webb, whose current stable is at Golden Gate Fields, held 
Barbara Jo Rubin's first riding contract. On Jan. 15, 1969, Rubin was to ride a 
horse at Tropical Park in Florida, but the male jockeys refused to ride. The 
Florida Racing Commission fined 13 of them $100 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a tough spot," Webb said the other day. "Saul Silberman owned 
Tropical Park, and I trained some of his horses. He called me and said he 
didn't want the girl riding, stirring up things." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin cried when she was removed from her first mount. She and Webb remember 
bricks being thrown at the trailer that Rubin used as a dressing room. One of 
them shattered a window. 
</P>
<P>
 Stymied in Florida, Rubin went to ride at a track on Nassau, in the Bahamas, 
and won a race there that Jan. 29. On Feb. 7, at Hialeah, Diane Crump finally 
broke ground, becoming the first woman to ride in a parimutuel race in the U.S. 
She finished 10th in a 12-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 In early February, Webb shipped his horses to Pimlico, hoping to run at the 
Baltimore track in the daytime and at nearby Charles Town at night. Although he 
had raced at Pimlico before, the track wouldn't give him stalls unless he 
signed an affidavit swearing that he wouldn't use Rubin as a jockey. 
</P>
<P>
 At Hialeah, Crump had managed to get only two additional mounts since her 
debut. One day at Charles Town, Webb was sitting with Irv Kovens, who owned the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I've got a girl jockey who could ride here and put Charles Town on 
the map," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kovens, who hadn't heard about the brick-throwing incident at Tropical Park, 
didn't seem interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a nice Jewish girl who can ride," Webb went on. "I thought you people 
took care of your own." 
</P>
<P>
 Kovens was noncommittal, but by the time Webb reached his hotel room in 
Baltimore later that day, the track owner was on the phone, clearing the way 
for Rubin. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 6 1/2-furlong ninth race on Feb. 22, Webb entered two horses, with 
Rubin to ride Cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reporters were all over the place," Warman recalled. "There were a lot of 
them when I was about to ride in Florida, but nothing like what we had in 
Baltimore and Charles Town. I used to exercise horses in the morning, and then 
take a nap, but this day I missed my nap." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd at Charles Town was more than 9,300, the biggest Friday-night 
turnout in track history. Webb's entry went off at 2-5, and stablemate Reely 
Beeg led all the way before Rubin found room on the inside with Cohesion and 
passed her at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 There were suggestions that Larry Kunitake let up on Reely Beeg, allowing 
Rubin's horse to win. "The age of chivalry is not yet dead," one of the Charles 
Town stewards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb denied that. "Cohesion was a good $25,000 horse," he said. "He had the 
speed that always made him dangerous on those bullring tracks. There was 
nothing funny about the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin was quickly hauled off to New York, in Kovens' chauffeur-driven car, to 
appear on the "Ed Sullivan Show" and to be interviewed by Walter Cronkite and 
by Joe Garagiola. She remembers more about Janis Joplin's outrageous backstage 
behavior than anything she said to Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in 1969, Rubin suffered torn cartilage in both knees and a broken pelvis 
in spills. She gained weight and got too heavy to ride. Her career ended with 
28 winners, including a couple of more on Cohesion. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was also the first woman jockey to win a race in New York," Webb said. 
"We went up to Aqueduct with a horse called Brave Galaxy, and Buddy Jacobson 
saddled him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was taking Barbara Jo to the airport after the race when we heard sirens 
and lights behind us. They pulled us over and told us that somebody at the 
track wanted her to ride there one more day. I'd bet our horse pretty good. The 
first thing I thought (upon seeing the police car) was that they were going to 
take the money away."

STOCKS CLOSE LOWER; YIELDS ON LONG-TERM BONDS FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * Blue chip issues closed slightly lower Friday, although 
bargain hunters helped the overall market regain some lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-term bonds yields retreated, but fears of higher interest rates 
continued to batter shorter-term maturities. Stocks 
</P>
<P>
 Buying seemed highly selective and investors tended to shun blue chip issues, 
pushing the Dow Jones industrial average down 1.12 points to 3,838.78. For the 
week, the average was down 48.68 points. On Thursday, the Dow lost more than 50 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the broader market indexes, the New York Stock Exchange composite index 
and the Standard & Poor's 500 index closed higher. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Nasdaq Stock Market of mostly smaller issues, the composite index 
rebounded 4.34 to 783.78. 
</P>
<P>
 On the NYSE, advances outnumbered declines by a small margin, and trading was 
moderate: 273.68 million shares changed hands, compared to Thursday's 342.94 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Market watchers said Thursday's steep selloff gave investors an opportunity to 
buy stocks at lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cable television stocks recovered after being pounded Thursday by the news 
of the collapse of the Bell Atlantic/Tele-Communications Inc. merger. TCI rose 
1 5/8 to 24. Liberty Media, its merger with TCI still on track despite the 
demise of the Bell Atlantic deal, rose 1 1/4 to 23 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * US West jumped 1 1/8 to 40 1/2 in brisk NYSE trading as buyers bet that the 
regional telephone company's stake in Time Warner's entertainment division will 
put it in a good position to compete with cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
 * DSC Communications rose 1 1/2 to 54 1/4; Tellabs gained 1 1/2 to 53 1/4, and 
General Instrument, which fell 6 1/8 on Thursday, ended up 1 1/8 at 45 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Citicorp rose 3/4 to 41 1/8 and First USA gained 1 1/2 to 30 1/2.  
</P>
<P>
 * Woolworth fell 3/8 to 22 1/2 on weak fourth-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-share average closed 37.90 points higher at 19,803.38. In 
Frankfurt, the DAX-30 average ended down 15.37 points at 2,074.92, and London's 
Financial Times 100-share average gained 13.7 points to finish at 3,281.2. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico City's Bolsa index ended up 4.06 points at 2,596.39. Other Markets 
</P>
<P>
 Market analysts said the modest price gains in long-term securities by no 
means signaled an end to the powerful selloff this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, analysts traced Friday's gains to overnight buying by overseas 
investors seeking to pick up bonds at bargain prices. But even the modest 
advance eroded as the day wore on, chipped away by further market worries that 
the Federal Reserve Board is eager to raise interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield retreated to 6.71% from 6.73% on 
Thursday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 5/16 point, or 
$3.13 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of shorter-term securities ranged from unchanged to slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices of short-term Treasury securities were unchanged to up 1/16 point, and 
intermediate maturities rose 3/32 point to 1/8 point, the Telerate Inc. 
financial information service reported. In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar declined against most major currencies following recent weakness 
against the German mark and the possibility of further yen strength after this 
weekend's Group of Seven meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the New York Comex, gold spot closed at $378.60 an ounce, up $2.10 from 
Thursday, while silver closed at $5.226 an ounce, up 5.4 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Light, sweet crude for April delivery fell 20 cents to $14.57 a barrel on 
the New York Merc. Selected Interest Rates

EARTHQUAKE SAFETY; DIARY OF A SHAKEN-UP HOMEOWNER, PART I: SURVEYING THE SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although I've written a number of articles about the value of 
earthquake-proofing a home, I've always had a casual attitude about doing my 
own place. After all, I've rationalized, our 68-year-old house withstood the 
Long Beach quake of 1933, the Northridge shaker of 1994 and every temblor in 
between. 
</P>
<P>
 But my wife is besieged each time the ground rumbles by the nagging worry that 
next time will be our turn. 
</P>
<P>
 And, truth be told, last month's quake did shake some sense into me. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many people in Southern California, most of what we have is invested in 
our home and its contents. 
</P>
<P>
 To lose the house or its furnishings would be financially crushing. To lose 
the irreplaceable objects that we have gathered around us in 22 years together 
-- our daughter's first oil painting, our family photographs, the glass and 
ceramics we collect -- would be emotionally devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 There's one other consideration as well. A survey of hospital emergency rooms 
after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake that rocked the Bay Area showed that most 
of the 1,200 quake-related injuries treated were caused when people were hit by 
books, mirrors, pictures, tall cabinets and other items in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 If anyone in my family was injured by falling objects that easily could have 
been secured, I'd never forgive myself. 
</P>
<P>
 So we're going ahead with our "earthquaking" project. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll be keeping a log of material costs, time spent, problems and surprises 
encountered and (we hope) overcome: All are things I'll pass along in this and 
subsequent installments in hopes that what we learn will help you with your 
earthquake-safety projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The first task in any earthquake-proofing project, and the subject of this 
report, is to walk through the house and garage and around the lot, inspecting 
the place to determine where the problems are and what has to be done. You 
can't get down to the nuts-and-bolts business of securing your home and the 
things in it until you know what must be done. 
</P>
<P>
 We made our inspection after discussing the process with Tom Carroll, 
president of AmeriSpec. The Orange-based company is the parent of a nationwide 
network of independently owned home-inspection businesses. Carroll has seen, or 
heard of, just about every twist and wrinkle there is. 
</P>
<P>
 I was happily thinking that I only had to figure out how to tie down a water 
heater and keep a few heavy items from falling off shelves. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what most people think when they consider making their house quake 
safe: that everything they need to do is inside the main structure. 
</P>
<P>
 But it isn't so, said Carroll, who pointed out that I should also: 
</P>
<P>
 * Look in my yard to see if there are power or telephone lines that could be 
knocked down by a falling tree or whipping branches. 
</P>
<P>
 * Examine my garage to see what is stuffed into the overhead rafters that 
would fall on my head if I were inside when a big quake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consolidate all the flammables in the house, garage and workshop into one or 
two areas away from doorways that might be used as escape routes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check the drainage around the foundation of the house to avoid post-quake 
leakage and water damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * Check my fences to make sure they are stable and wouldn't fall and injure 
anyone who happened to be in the back yard during a quake. 
</P>
<P>
 After thanking Carroll for making the job a lot more involved than I'd thought 
it would be, I drove home, stood at the front curb, surveyed my domain -- and 
immediately spotted Job One. 
</P>
<P>
 We have two telephone lines into the house, and both pass over the front yard 
and through the middle of a shade tree that has grown up around them since I 
planted it five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In a big quake, the tree wouldn't even have to fall to break the lines -- 
whipping branches would probably do the job. The tree will have to be pruned to 
make way for the phone lines. That will make it more likely that we'll have 
phone service after a quake. 
</P>
<P>
 I got good marks from Carroll for my one piece of pre-Northridge 
quake-proofing: I not only know where my gas and electric meters are, I have 
attached a shut-off wrench to the gas meter and showed my wife and daughter how 
to use it to turn off the gas supply if that becomes necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 But as part of the current quake safety effort, I am also going to make sure 
they know that the thick wire crossing over the driveway in front of the garage 
is the 240-volt service line for the house and that they should stay clear of 
it if it were to break and fall to the ground in a quake. (A 240-volt jolt 
isn't terribly dangerous, but why take chances? I'll also make sure our 
daughter knows that there are high-voltage wires across the street; they're the 
ones that are in the top row on most utility poles. Don't mess with them if 
they fall, because they do carry enough juice to fry a person.) 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not worried about the location of our service line, but if it passed over 
a doorway or a main route out of the house, I'd probably call the electric 
company and ask that it be rerouted. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Southern California Edison said the utility will respond to 
such requests and will attach the service line at a new location on the house 
or garage. The homeowner, however, is responsible for getting the power line 
from that new attachment point to the electric meter, a process that would 
probably involve hiring an electrician and getting a city electrical permit and 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 My other important outside chore will be to strap down the water heater. We 
had it put in its own little room at the back of the house when we added on, so 
we're not worried about it falling over and spilling water inside the house in 
an earthquake; the concern is that a falling water heater can rip loose the gas 
line that feeds it and ignite a fire. Fires from broken gas lines can cause 
nearly as much damage as a quake itself -- more if firefighters can't get 
around to knock down the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one major earthquake-proofing task I'm not sure I'll pursue: bolting 
my house to its foundation. Because our house was built before the building 
codes were changed in the aftermath of the Long Beach earthquake, our house is 
not fastened to its foundation -- except in back, where we added on when we 
bought it in 1987. Instead of bolting the frame to the foundation, as has been 
the practice for 60 years, builders of pre-1933 residences in Southern 
California typically laid the mud sill directly on top of the foundation, 
worked up from there and trusted that the weight of the structure would keep it 
from sliding around. 
</P>
<P>
 I'll check out what needs to be done and how much it will cost to do it before 
making a decision on that project. 
</P>
<P>
 We're lucky so far as other outside inspection points go: We don't have a 
heavy block wall that could fall over and injure people; our lot slopes nicely 
away from the foundation of the house, so we wouldn't have a drainage problem, 
and while our stucco-coated brick chimney could tumble in a big quake, it is 
built entirely on the outside of the house. That means it is unlikely that 
falling brick would crash through the living room ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've got a masonry chimney that goes up into your attic and then through 
the roof to the outside, Carroll and several builders suggest nailing plywood 
sheets to the beams in the attic to make a solid floor all around the chimney. 
That way, if it did crumble, the bricks would be stopped by the plywood and 
wouldn't crash through the plaster or drywall ceiling and brain someone in the 
room below. 
</P>
<P>
 The fix for a block wall isn't quite so easy: If you've got a masonry wall, 
test it by grabbing the top at one end and shaking. If the wall doesn't wobble, 
it's probably OK. If it does, you have three choices: ignore it and hope for 
the best; tear it down and have a new one built, or have a contractor install 
pilasters -- masonry buttresses -- all along its length to strengthen it 
against toppling in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you do, however, don't fill a hollow block wall with concrete or 
earth to strengthen it; it will just make it heavier and more likely to cause 
damage or injury if it falls. And don't try to install reinforcing rod -- rebar 
-- in an unreinforced wall. The rebar doesn't do any good unless sunk well into 
the foundation, so it has to be put in when the wall is built. Retrofitting 
doesn't help much, Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 After walking our lot and discovering that there isn't too much I have to do 
outside the house to get ready for the Big One, I moved my attention inside and 
discovered that at least a full weekend's work awaits. 
</P>
<P>
 Chores on the list: 
</P>
<P>
 * Fixing latches on the kitchen cabinets so they don't fly open and dump our 
dishes and dry goods on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Securing the refrigerator so it doesn't roll out of its alcove and spew its 
contents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fastening down the collectibles in our glass-shelved display cases and the 
electronic gear in the entertainment cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clearing flammables from our escape routes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fastening the entertainment center to reduce the chances of it toppling and 
dumping our TV and stereo equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Figuring out a way to cushion our china, which isn't on display, and our 
antique cranberry glass stemware, which is. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ensuring that bedrooms and bathrooms are quake-safe. 
</P>
<P>
 That last should be an easy chore for us. Our decorating scheme avoids the use 
of such things as heavy mirrors and pictures that could fall on sleepers. And 
in a late-blooming mania for orderliness, I recently organized our closets with 
built-in shelving that moved all the heavy items to floor level and left the 
upper part of the closets for lightweight things such as sweater boxes and 
sleeping bags. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife doesn't think I'll get halfway through it all in a weekend, but I've 
assured her that with some advance planning and a weeknight trip to the home 
improvement store to gather material in advance, it'll be no sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 On subsequent weekends I'll be attending to more onerous but less pressing 
quake-safety tasks that include securing the storage boxes that line the back 
of the garage; doing something to keep the tools adorning the walls of my shop 
from falling on my head if I happen to be working there when the San Andreas 
opens up and finding a place to set up an emergency food and water supply 
center that we can get to even if the walls fall down. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll keep you posted.

GARDENING; ANNUALS HONORS GO TO PLANTS WITH A HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two centuries-old favorites -- snapdragons and watermel ons -- are the 
National Garden Bureau's plants of the year for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcement of the "Year of the Watermelon" and "Year of the Snapdragon" was 
made in advance of National Garden Week, April 10-16. 
</P>
<P>
 Hieroglyphics on ancient Egyptian tombs show watermelons in cultivation there 
thousands of years ago. Snapdragons, native to the Mediterranean region, were 
described by Dioscorides, an ancient Greek physician and botanist. 
</P>
<P>
 A little planning can forestall a lot of problems in growing both, suggests 
the bureau, which was founded in 1920 and describes itself as a nonprofit 
service providing information on gardening.  
</P>
<P>
 Both watermelon and snapdragons are grown as annuals in much of the United 
States, although snapdragons (Antirrhinum majus) can be perennials here and in 
other areas where summer temperatures are not too intense and winters stay over 
10 degrees. Watermelons (Citrullus lanatus) are annuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Watermelon seeds need both warm soil and warm air to germinate. Soil should 
have reached 70 to 75 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best soil for growing watermelons is a light, fertile, sandy one with a 
pH of 5.5 to 6.5," the bureau says. "If the soil tends to be heavy or has a 
high clay content, add a few shovels of coarse sand to improve drainage. Till 
the soil to a depth of six to eight inches and add well-rotted manure or 
compost." 
</P>
<P>
 Snapdragons prefer soil with a neutral pH, numerically equal to seven, and 
"amend heavy soil with aged compost or sphagnum peat moss" to keep roots from 
becoming constricted or damaged. A sunny location is suggested for all but the 
hottest areas, where some shade is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snapdragons are relatively disease and pest-free," says the bureau, and it 
suggests keeping the garden clean as the first line of defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The original snapdragons were white and purple. Today they come in every color 
except blue, as well as bicolor, and are good cut flowers. They need moderate 
amounts of fertilizer and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Watermelon varieties range from small bush types with vines three- to 
five-feet long through those sprawling six to 12 feet. There are six major 
classes: Ice Box, weighing from five to 15 pounds; Sugar Baby, eight to 12 
pounds; Charleston Grey, 20 to 30 pounds; Allsweet, 20 to 35 pounds, and 
Seedless, weighing 10 to 20 pounds. Four of the classes also refer to a variety 
of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapes are round like a basketball, oval like a football or stretch into an 
oblong, cylindrical form. 
</P>
<P>
 Flesh color also varies. Most are red, but yellow and orange also are popular. 
They taste about the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Some seeds are possible in seedless types, but they are edible. The bureau 
says there seems to be an increasing trend toward seedless. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the age-old question -- how do you tell when a melon is ripe? -- the 
bureau says there are a number of clues to judge maturity, none of which is 
100% reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a melon thumped during the growing season gives a light ring, but 
the sound at maturity is resonant, solid and dull.

CRAFTS; SHOWCASE NEEDLEWORK IN A CUSTOMIZED FRAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cross-stitch mistakes aren't always made with a needle and floss. Poor framing 
choices and finishing shortcuts often turn a well-stitched design into a so-so 
sampler.  
</P>
<P>
 Some suggestions to help your work look its best: 
</P>
<P>
 Before stitching, wash the floss by holding each skein under cool running 
water until the water runs clear. Let the floss air dry completely. This will 
prevent the colors from running later. 
</P>
<P>
 Hand-wash your completed stitchery in cool water and gentle soap, rinsing it 
well and taking care not to wring the fabric or rub the design against itself. 
This washing prevents hidden dirt and body oils from surfacing later or 
breaking down fibers. 
</P>
<P>
 Blot the stitchery dry with towels, then sandwich it between two clean, dry 
towels. Roll the needlework and towels together jelly-roll fashion, making sure 
that the needlework does not wrinkle. Let it dry for days until completely dry. 
If the floss has been pre-washed, skip the washing and drying steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightly steam your work, taking care not to flatten the stitches. If you are 
mounting and framing the stitchery yourself, be sure to keep grain lines 
perfectly straight. Pad the frame backing lightly with polyester batting. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrap the stitchery over the backing, keeping all grain lines straight. Lightly 
tape the edges to the back, then glue them in place with fabric adhesive. 
</P>
<P>
 Choose mat colors that complement both the stitchery and your decor and that 
tie the two together. Top-notch framers will have samples of many colors, so 
you can try different combinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Many framers can custom-cut angles, openings and designs, but be careful -- 
these special touches may overpower your sampler. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether to frame with glass is a matter of personal preference. When using 
glass, be sure to hold it away from the stitchery with mats or spacers. 
Otherwise, moisture trapped inside may later damage the fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Choose a frame that's in sync with the needlework and your home. For example, 
simple samplers and contemporary cross-stitches do well with unassuming frames. 
</P>
<P>
 More elaborate Victorian stitcheries are most at home in wider, fancier 
frames.

ASK THE HANDYMAN / JOHN MORELL: CLEAR THE AIR ON PEELING BATHROOM WALLPAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Question: Last year, we had one of our bathrooms wallpapered, and now we're 
having a problem with water and moisture collecting on the walls. We don't have 
a glass enclosure around the tub/shower. Would that help? 
</P>
<P>
 R.G. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "Problems like mold and peeling paper usually occur because of 
ventilation," says Rich Haagsma of Faucets 'n Fixtures in Orange. "If the 
bathroom has a window, it's important to keep that open while the hot water is 
running to allow the steam to escape. Most bathrooms without windows are 
equipped with a fan. It should be on while you're in the shower. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people forget to do this, and they'll run the fan after they come out of 
the shower to get rid of the steam. By that time, the moisture is already 
collecting on the walls. A bathroom fan should also be working properly. 
Ideally, you want a fan that will exchange the air in the room within five 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We're updating our 30-year-old home, and we've started by replacing the 
interior doors with new six-panel Colonist doors. Our plan is to replace the 
sliding mirrored closet doors in the bedrooms with pullout Colonist doors. Our 
problem is in the master bedroom. The closet is larger than average, 7 feet, 10 
inches.  
</P>
<P>
 S.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Rossmoor 
</P>
<P>
 A: "It's not impossible to get paneled doors for that space, but it may take 
some doing," says Lance Young of Classic Concepts Company in Santa Ana. 
"They'll have to be custom ordered, and they'll probably cost more than doors 
for your standard-sized closets.  
</P>
<P>
 "The problem isn't that it's too large; it's actually a little undersized. 
When an opening is a little larger than 8 feet, you can usually use bumpers to 
fill in the space, but when it's under, it's harder to find. You could get a 
mirrored folding door or a flush, flat wood folding door that will fit the 
space fairly easily, but plan on spending more and waiting longer for your 
order if you want the paneled doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: We have an old oval dining-room table that has lost its luster. I've been 
told I should use paint thinner to clean it, but will that bring back the 
finish? 
</P>
<P>
 A.B. 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa Island 
</P>
<P>
 A: "I would start out on an inconspicuous spot with a little paint thinner and 
some 4/0 steel wool," says Bob Espeland of Espeland Antique and Furniture 
Repair in Orange. "Go over the finish lightly with the wool and paint thinner, 
not pushing down too hard. This will remove the wax buildup that's occurred 
over the years. To bring back the luster after it's dry, you can try using a 
common spray wax. Lightly spray the surface, and you should see an improvement 
after rubbing it out with the grain. If that doesn't help, it may be time for a 
refinishing job." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I've selected a paint color for the walls by one manufacturer and a color 
for the trim by another. Is there a problem in mixing brands like that? 
</P>
<P>
 E.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 A: "As long you've got the right type of paint for the job, such as flat for 
walls and semi-gloss for trim, it doesn't matter if you're mixing brands," says 
Joe Ragsdale of Color Center in La Mirada. "That's why it's a good idea to look 
at a wide variety of paint swatches before making a decision. Don't feel you 
have to stick with one manufacturer to get a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I'll be installing new bathroom hardware soon, and I was wondering about 
towel bars. Should they be screwed into wall studs? 
</P>
<P>
 R.O. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea 
</P>
<P>
 A: "I wouldn't worry about that unless you have kids who are constantly 
pulling on the towels," says contractor Roger Davis of Santa Ana. "In most 
cases, you can screw them right into the drywall, but if you like you can 
install them using toggle bolts or, if the bar fits, into the studs."

WHEN TO PRUNE TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE BAWDEN DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Winter is a good time to prune most landscape trees. You can do it at other 
times, but just make sure not to prune trees in the spring during their growth 
period -- from the time the buds start to swell until the young leaves have 
reached their full size -- say tree specialists. Trees' budding and bloom times 
vary. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, avoid pruning landscape trees in mid- to late summer (July, August 
and September), unless it's very light, because you can induce an off-season 
growth spurt, which can leave some species, such as ficus, vulnerable to freeze 
damage. Hot-weather pruning can also delay or shorten dormancy for deciduous 
trees and is especially damaging to eucalyptus and pines. 
</P>
<P>
 Fruit trees require different pruning techniques than landscape trees. Each 
type has its own special requirements that should be investigated beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some guidelines for pruning landscape trees common in Orange County: 
CONIFERS 
</P>
<P>
 Conifers and certain other trees should be pruned in November, December, 
January or February. Such trees include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cedars 
</P>
<P>
 * Cypress 
</P>
<P>
 * Pines 
</P>
<P>
 * Redwoods 
</P>
<P>
 * Eucalyptus DECIDUOUS 
</P>
<P>
 Most deciduous trees should be pruned during their dormant period after leaves 
have fallen, which is usually November, December or January. Such trees 
include:  
</P>
<P>
 * Ash (Fraxinus species)  
</P>
<P>
 * Birch (Betula species)  
</P>
<P>
 * Cape chestnut (Calodendrum capense)  
</P>
<P>
 * Chinese elm (Ulmus parvifolia)  
</P>
<P>
 * Chinese pistache (Pistacia chinensis)  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Maple  
</P>
<P>
 * Sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua)  
</P>
<P>
 * Sycamore FLOWERING TREES 
</P>
<P>
 Prune flowering trees when they are dormant, if they are deciduous, or 
immediately after flowering is completed, if they are evergreen. For those 
trees that bloom when they are leafless, in most cases wait until after they 
finish flowering. Flowering trees include:  
</P>
<P>
 * Acacias (various species) 
</P>
<P>
 * Bradford pear (Pyrus calleryana, several cultivars), which blooms while 
leafless 
</P>
<P>
 * Camellia Japonica 
</P>
<P>
 * Cape chestnut (Calodendrum capense)  
</P>
<P>
 * Cassia  
</P>
<P>
 * Chinese flame tree (Koelreuteria bipinnata)  
</P>
<P>
 * Coral trees (Erythrina caffra and other species), which bloom while leafless 
 
</P>
<P>
 * Crape myrtle  
</P>
<P>
 * Empress tree (Paulownia tomentosa), which blooms while leafless  
</P>
<P>
 * Firewheel trees (Stenocarpus sinuatus)  
</P>
<P>
 * Jacaranda 
</P>
<P>
 * Lemon bottlebrush (Callistemon citrinus)  
</P>
<P>
 * New Zealand Christmas tree  
</P>
<P>
 * Purple orchid tree (Bauhinia variegata)  
</P>
<P>
 * Saucer magnolia (Magnolia soulangiana), which blooms while leafless  
</P>
<P>
 * Silk tree/mimosa ( Albizia julibrissin)  
</P>
<P>
 * Southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora)  
</P>
<P>
 * Tipu tree (Tipuana tipu) BROADLEAF EVERGREENS 
</P>
<P>
 Broadleaf evergreens should be pruned October through March or May or June. 
Such trees include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bronze loquat (Eriobotrya deflexa)  
</P>
<P>
 * Camphor tree (Cinnamomum camphora)  
</P>
<P>
 * Carrot wood (Cupaniopsis anacardioides)  
</P>
<P>
 * Eucalyptus species  
</P>
<P>
 * Kaffir plum (Harpephyllum caffrum)  
</P>
<P>
 * Oaks, including coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) and holly oak (Quercus 
ilex)  
</P>
<P>
 * Olive (Olea europaea)  
</P>
<P>
 * Ornamental figs (ficus species) 
</P>
<P>
 * Peppermint tree (Agonis flexuosa)  
</P>
<P>
 * Pittosporum species, such as Victorian box (Pittosporum undulatum)  
</P>

EARTHQUAKE / THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; VALLEY GETS A WAKE-UP CALL; AFTERSHOCKS: 
JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE TO LIVE HERE, A TRIO OF TEMBLORS HIT IN THE 
EARLY MORNING. 
</P>

<P>
 Oh, what a week we'd been having. The skies were sunny, the smog so thin you 
could almost make out the shape of the mountains. And, if only for a 
nanosecond, conversation turned away from the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For a blessed 171 hours and 46 minutes (but who's counting?) the ground under 
our feet didn't buckle. It didn't heave. It hardly even quivered. The demons of 
the dirt were on holiday, it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday morning they were back, rattling our floors and ceilings and all 
the stuff in between. 
</P>
<P>
 And just when you thought it was safe to live in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Did the three aftershocks early Friday come as a surprise to Valleyites who 
briefly had entertained thoughts about returning framed art to walls or putting 
away the pile of clothing on the floor -- insurance that they wouldn't have to 
run outside in the altogether? Hardly. These are not your average rubes. 
</P>
<P>
 "All my kids came out: 'Daddy! Daddy! We're having an earthquake!' " said Jack 
Moore of Lake View Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 "No kidding," Moore replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to my wife a couple of days ago, 'We haven't had an aftershock in 
about a week,' " said Moore, 46. "I know we're going to have more. We're going 
to have plenty of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The first shaker, measuring 4.0, hit at 4:59 a.m. It was centered four miles 
east-southeast of Newhall, according to Caltech seismologists. The second 
temblor, at 5:11 a.m., measured 3.2 and was centered two miles west-northwest 
of Granada Hills. The third, at 5:56 a.m., measured 3.6 and was located three 
miles north-northeast of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Fernando Valley hadn't felt an aftershock of magnitude 3.7 or greater 
since 1:13 a.m. Friday, Feb. 18, according to Caltech. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like it was calming us down, which is very comforting," said Coral 
Haase, 45, of Canoga Park. "But it's like waiting for the other shoe to drop." 
</P>
<P>
 It had been so long since a tremor, in fact, that Thursday night one Granada 
Hills woman had actually considered sleeping in her upstairs bedroom for the 
first time since Jan. 17. But at the last minute, she changed her mind and 
bedded down with her husband once again on the couch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good thing I did," she said. "You can't calm down. You're always 
expecting an aftershock but they still rattle you." 
</P>
<P>
 Her name?  
</P>
<P>
 "Just say a Granada Hills resident," she said. "I don't want people to think 
I'm a baby." 
</P>
<P>
 While some still jump up and head for doorways at the first sign of shaking, 
others are more circumspect -- tired of bolting for cover just to return to 
their beds within seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rolled over and went back to bed," said Dan Karlson, 31, a clerk at 
Oshman's sporting goods in Northridge. "I live in Chatsworth so I'm getting 
used to all this." 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to sit up for two hours chain-smoking cigarettes" after temblors, said 
Justin Crane of Granada Hills. "But by now I'm used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Though some folks slept through the shaking, others thought they'd just 
dreamed up an aftershock or figured their bodies woke them for more mundane but 
necessary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reaction, the most recent aftershocks were the talk of the town. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all experts now," Northridge jeweler Sherry Kaplan said of the Valley's 
amateur seismologists, who can pinpoint the strength of aftershocks if not with 
accuracy, at least with conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 At Postal Preference, a mail and card shop in Northridge, the facts were being 
laid on the counter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say it's only coincidence that most of them happen between 4 and 6 in 
the morning. I don't buy that," Alesha Haase said from behind the counter . 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hot. I knew it would happen," a customer contributed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know it never happens when it rains," Haase said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens when the moon is in the right place and the stars are in the right 
place," added Coral Haase, Alesha's mother and owner of the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all anybody ever talks about," said Alesha. "If it's not Tonya and 
Nancy, it's the earthquake." Friday's Aftershocks Newhall: 4.0, 4:59 a.m. San 
Fernando: 3.6, 5:56 a.m. Granada Hills: 3.2, 5:11 a.m.

WARDEN TOLD TO RETIRE OR BE DEMOTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprise move, officials have told the warden at the state prison in 
Lancaster either to retire or accept a demotion -- likely the result of a 
series of problems that have plagued the year-old prison, including the escapes 
of a convicted murderer and three other inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief statement issued Friday, state prison officials said, "The 
California Department of Corrections has made a decision to restructure the 
management team (at the Lancaster prison) . . . Otis Thurman, warden, has yet 
to determine which options available to him would be in his best interest and 
has decided to take some time off." 
</P>
<P>
 No other details were released, but several members of the prison's citizens 
advisory committee said they were told that Thurman's options were to retire -- 
after more than three decades as a corrections department employee -- or accept 
a demotion and be transferred elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was notified Thursday the warden was being asked to take a demotion and/or 
retire," said Jake Maeders, a committee member. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden shake-up also includes the demotion and transfer of Thurman's 
second in command at the 4,000-inmate prison. Beginning Monday, Chief Deputy 
Warden Alex Marmolejo, has a new assignment as an associate warden at the state 
prison in Tehachapi. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison officials declined comment beyond the brief statement. Lancaster prison 
spokesman KennI. Hicks, the only prison administration employee who answers 
media queries, said, "The only information I'm providing is just what's in that 
statement. This is all we're issuing at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to James H. Gomez, the Department of Corrections director in Sacramento, 
were referred to the agency's media office. That office said all calls on the 
matter had to be directed to the Lancaster prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Advisory committee members said they, too, were given little information and 
that they were surprised Thurman was being replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 But committee member George Root, a Lancaster councilman, said he thought 
something like this would happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think his (Thurman's) problem was he was too laid back," Root said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really happy the Department of Corrections saw fit to remove the warden 
and his deputy as a first step to reorganization of the management staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Most advisory committee members said the shake-up is the result of the four 
escapes, including that of two maximum-security inmates, and other problems 
that have occurred at the prison.  
</P>
<P>
 The first escapes occurred just five months after the prison opened Feb. 1, 
1993. On July 2, two minimum-security inmates, one serving time for burglary 
the other for robbery, walked away from their barracks. Both were captured -- 
one two days later, the other four days after his escape. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 5, convicted murderer Eric Rene Johnson escaped from the 
maximum-security unit. Johnson, serving a life sentence without the possibility 
of parole, was spotted about five hours later at a Lancaster convenience store, 
a few miles from the prison.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's escape, the first by a maximum security inmate, triggered an uproar 
in the community. Prison officials waited more than two hours to notify the 
local sheriff's station. The Lancaster City Council was not told for more than 
12 hours, after Johnson was captured. 
</P>
<P>
 The escape and the handling of it led community leaders to abandon plans to 
support construction of a second state prison in Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 13, maximum-security inmate Steven Charles Brigida hid in a garbage 
bin to escape. He was dumped with the trash into a truck, then discarded at a 
Lancaster landfill. Brigida, serving a sentence of life plus eight years for 
attempted murder, auto theft and burglary, suffered broken ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 Guards have shot and wounded inmates at least three times, including twice 
this month. Four inmates were hospitalized in early February after being 
injured when refusing to comply with cell and body searches that were being 
conducted because of information that an inmate had a weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison has been heavily criticized for failing to keep the community 
informed, as has Thurman for making no public statements about the escapes. 
Reports on the results of investigations into the escapes have yet to be 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the community to be safe, we want the prison more media friendly, we 
want better community relations," said James Lott, chairman of the 15-member 
advisory committee. "We need to have openness. We cannot have a perception 
they're hiding things at the prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lott wouldn't speculate on reasons behind the management restructure, 
he said if it was a result of the escapes, "I think it sends a strong signal 
that the community is not going to tolerate escapes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope that any change is going to be for improvement of the facility 
and that would include reducing escapes," said Dennis Davenport, another 
committee member. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Banks, a correctional officer at the prison, said that since word of 
Thurman's departure spread, morale has been low among employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I know he was well liked," said Banks, president of the local 
chapter of the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Gov. Pete Wilson appoints a new warden, the prison will be run by an 
interim warden. Joann Gordon, southern regional administrator, began serving 
Thursday in that post. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few days, Warden John Ratelle from the R.J. Donovan Correctional 
Facility in San Diego, will arrive in Lancaster and fill the interim post. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison officials did not know when a replacement for the chief deputy warden 
would be named.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; SPIRITUAL WARFARE SPARKS A WARNING; PUBLISHING: AUTHOR 
JOHN DAWSON WARNS THAT FIGHTING DEMONS HAS RUN AMOK. BUT SOME SAY GOD HAS GIVEN 
THEM TECHNOLOGY TO HELP WITH THE TASK.

<P>
 One of the hottest trends in the conservative Christian camp today is 
so-called spiritual warfare -- fighting demons. But one of the movement's 
founders, warning that the preoccupation with the devil has run amok, is now 
trying to redirect the troops toward more earthly problems of racial and 
cultural division. 
</P>
<P>
 Bristling with military metaphors and bravado, dozens of spiritual warfare 
books have appeared since 1990 outlining prayer strategies to break supposed 
satanic strongholds at home and abroad where evangelists make little headway. 
In addition, databases and information networks are aimed at analyzing and 
pinpointing the bastions of the powers of darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 At a national conference on spiritual warfare in Anaheim this week, about 
1,200 ministers and lay leaders attended workshops on topics such as "How to 
Fight Evil Forces and Win." They heartily cheered tales by speakers of winning 
converts by defeating demonic forces.  
</P>
<P>
 Conference organizer C. Peter Wagner of Pasadena's Fuller Theological Seminary 
predicted in an interview that he believes "God has given us a new spiritual 
technology to complete the task" of reaching everyone in the world with the 
gospel by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Dawson of Lake View Terrace, an acknowledged pioneer in spiritual 
warfare whose 1989 book, "Taking Our Cities for God," introduced Wagner and 
others to notions of high-level combat with evil spirits, is clearly disturbed 
that he may have helped create a monster. 
</P>
<P>
 The term "territorial spirits" comes from a chapter in Dawson's book that 
discusses satanic forces thought by some Christians to prevail over certain 
cities and regions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The paradox was," Dawson said in an interview, "that half of that chapter was 
a warning about becoming too focused on demons." Dawson closed the chapter by 
saying Jesus gave his disciples authority over enemy spirits but that He also 
urged: "Do not rejoice at this, that the spirits submit to you, but rejoice 
that your names are written in heaven" (Luke 10:20). 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson, international director of urban missions for Youth With a Mission, 
wrote that it was wrong for the evangelical world either to deny satanic 
activity altogether or to become preoccupied with it. 
</P>
<P>
 A potentially dangerous tendency in the movement, he now contends, would be an 
automatic association of a non-Anglo culture with the demonic. For instance, 
Dawson said ancient religious practices of Native Americans should not be 
presumed to be idolatrous or demonic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are enormous amounts of redemptive truth within every culture that 
approach the core revelation of God's nature and personality," said Dawson, a 
New Zealand-born U.S. citizen who argues for reconciliation among races and 
cultures in "Healing America's Wounds," a book to be published in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson founded the International Reconciliation Coalition, a group that has 
brought together Native Americans, missionaries and government officials for 
prayers of reconciliation at the site of a massacre of natives by whites, as 
well as whites and blacks praying together at places where slave auctions were 
once held. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tremendous amount of unresolved white guilt in America," he said, 
a change in emphasis that may sit better with many Protestants and Catholics 
who are concerned with healing racial divisions but uncomfortable with 
Christians who talk in confident detail about confronting demons. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson also said he believes that some spiritual warfare recruits are setting 
themselves up for a fall, especially charismatic and Pentecostal believers who 
tend to see supernatural manifestations as everyday events and place undue 
confidence in their new spiritual weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now thousands of charismatic and Pentecostal believers are baffled when they 
rebuke the devil and nothing happens," Dawson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get somebody who prays a big, macho prayer in New York City like, 'We 
come against the spirit of Mammon in Jesus' name!' " Dawson said. "They know 
they didn't remove the powers of darkness from New York because they often 
experience a continuation of evil. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm saying is that God's word never gave that much authority in the 
first place," he said. "What they are calling the spirit of Mammon isn't some 
kind of great big demon . . . but a systemic problem of dynamics within a 
culture, such as our preoccupation with materialism and the injustice that is a 
byproduct of that idolatry (of wealth)." 
</P>
<P>
 The spiritual warfare movement has drawn fire from other conservative 
Christian leaders who contend that Scripture does not give clear marching 
orders despite the much-quoted 6th chapter of Ephesians that advises believers 
to "put on the whole armor of God" to struggle against cosmic "principalities 
and powers." 
</P>
<P>
 Author-Pastor John MacArthur of the large Grace Community Church in Sun Valley 
argues that biblically approved weapons against Satan are resistance to 
temptation as well as understanding and application of biblical teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the influential Calvary Chapel, pastored by the Rev. Chuck Smith, 
and its affiliated congregations "are not looking for wars to fight with 
Satan," said the Rev. Oden Fong, an associate pastor on Smith's staff. "Our 
emphasis is on a personal relationship with Jesus Christ and giving the gospel 
to the world." 
</P>
<P>
 There is little doubt, however, that the spiritual warfare concept has pumped 
excitement into some church groups and conventional prayer organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The movement is not for the weak-kneed, said Sandra Varner, a Christian 
bookstore worker in Thornville, Ohio, who attended this week's spiritual 
warfare conference at Anaheim's Melodyland Christian Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, everybody gets R&R," said Varner, using the military jargon for 
furloughs, "but this is vital for the survival of Christianity in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Varner suggested that any frivolous fascination with demons would have been 
wiped out by the talk on Tuesday by former San Fernando Valley resident George 
Otis Jr. of Lynnwood, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Otis, who said 15 Bible translators have disappeared in recent years, 
described his research interviews in the last four years with Hindu leaders, 
Buddhists in Nepal and "the brain trust of the New Age movement" -- among other 
non-Christians he considers to be under satanic influence -- amounted to 
"camping out in the heart of darkness." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Eastman, who moved his international Every Home for Christ headquarters 
from Chatsworth to Colorado Springs in 1991, told the conference of growing 
success by his door-to-door, literature-distributing organization. It collected 
206,000 decision cards expressing interest in Christianity five years ago but 
received 665,292 cards during 1993, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Eastman used some of the militant slogans of spiritual warfare in 
addressing the conference, he emphasized the more traditional Christian goal of 
intimacy with God in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid being "casualties" in spiritual warfare, advised Eastman, "the 
further we move into the spirit dimension the closer we need to be to God." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson, who also spoke at the conference, said that for some figures in the 
movement it is "a change of metaphor without a change of theology." 
</P>
<P>
 Dawson has some allies in the movement for his reconciliation quest -- nearly 
70 Native Americans registered for the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can rebuke the devil until you turn blue, but God will allow the 
continuing infestation of the demonic (in the culture) until there is order, 
justice and reconciliation," he said.

PANAH PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN GIRL'S DEATH; CRIME: HE HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH 
MURDER, KIDNAP AND SEXUAL ASSAULT OF NICOLE PARKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Woodland Hills man charged by a grand jury with murdering, kidnaping and 
sexually molesting an 8-year-old neighbor pleaded not guilty Friday in Los 
Angeles Superior Court, and his lawyer said he expects to use an insanity 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not guilty," said Hooman Ashkan Panah, a pale, slightly built 22-year-old who 
wore his dark hair pulled back in a ponytail. As he spoke, Lori Parker, the 
mother of slain Nicole Parker, began to weep in the courtroom's front row and 
dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want him to die," Parker later said. "She was so little. What went through 
his head? What was he thinking? If they just gave me a reason why he did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Panah also denied an allegation that he had killed Nicole while kidnaping, 
molesting and sodomizing her, special circumstances that carry the death 
penalty or life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, attorney Robert Sheahen offered the first hint of 
Panah's possible insanity defense. The lawyer said Panah previously has been 
hospitalized for a mental condition and may suffer from brain damage as a 
result of physical and sexual abuse by "a relative" while growing up in Tehran, 
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 Panah had attempted suicide at least twice prior to his arrest for Nicole's 
slaying, the defense attorney said. Sheahen declined to elaborate further on 
any mental condition or his client's background, saying he was awaiting 
court-ordered psychiatric reports. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nicole's parents said Panah's mental state made no difference to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them, 'Good luck,' because the kid wasn't unstable," Lori Parker said. 
"He went to work right after he killed her. . . . It's no excuse. He still 
killed my daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Her estranged husband, Ed Parker, agreed. He said he'd spoken to Panah several 
times in the courtyard of the Woodland Hills apartment complex where he and 
Panah lived, and Panah did not seem to be disturbed. "He was just your average 
kid," Parker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole's nude body was found on Nov. 21 stuffed in a suitcase hidden in 
Panah's bedroom closet. Her body was found the day after she disappeared from 
the courtyard of the Ventura Boulevard apartment complex where both her father 
and Panah lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Police searched Panah's apartment after he allegedly made incriminating 
statements to officers, according to court records. A friend told police he had 
mentioned being "involved in something real bad" in connection with Nicole's 
disappearance and that there was a videotape that "made him look real bad." 
</P>
<P>
 In the bedroom, police found camera equipment and tapes showing Panah having 
sex with adult women. They found Nicole's body in the closet. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole had been choked, but a coroner's autopsy determined that she died from 
"traumatic injuries."  
</P>
<P>
 Panah's mother, Mehry Monfared, waved as deputies led him from the courtroom. 
She and Lori Parker avoided each other. At an earlier hearing, Parker had 
become upset when Monfared approached her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tried to tell her as a mother to accept my sympathy," Monfared said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Parker said she doesn't want to hear from the mother of the man accused of 
killing Nicole. "I just don't feel I need that from her," Parker said. "We have 
nothing to discuss unless she can tell me why he did what he did. We have 
nothing to talk about."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; CHILDREN GET CHANCE TO BUILD FOR THE FUTURE

 Out of the minds of babes. . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Fair Avenue Elementary School auditorium in North Hollywood became a 
bobbing sea of white hard hats Thursday as 50 students bent over their piles of 
plastic building blocks, string and aluminum foil with architectural musings 
swimming through their 11-year-old brains. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanyika Bryant carefully attached aluminum foil to a space station hospital. 
Edgar Alvarez constructed white Corinthian plastic columns that would mark the 
entrance to his museum. Tam Pham worked on the steps leading to a green and 
blue sphinx. 
</P>
<P>
 The sixth-graders' construction projects were part of a contest sponsored by 
the National Assn. of Women in Construction's Valley chapter and local 
construction companies. The contest was an attempt to interest grade schoolers 
in the construction industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the year 2000 there's going to be a shortage of skilled construction 
workers," said Cheryl Johnson, Valley chapter president. 
</P>
<P>
 When the contest was first held, many students built churches. This, the third 
year, showed a more topical theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Christina Hinojosa chose to build a bridge, complete with plastic boats with 
foil sails, because she remembered the images of the freeway bridges collapsed 
in the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard a little people got hurt in the bridge and I felt sorry for them," 
said the second-place winner. "So I wanted to make a bridge that wouldn't 
damage in an earthquake or hurricane." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the children built hospitals, clinics, and fire and police stations 
because, they said, those were the buildings most needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought of it because of the fires we've been having. So I thought 
we'd need a fire department," said Adrianna Prado, as she showed her two-story 
fire station. 
</P>
<P>
 Her neighbor, Nancy Pothidang built a hospital "for the people in the house 
when the earthquake comes and the house collapses. So they'll have a place to 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Janine Mejia's earthquake-proof police station won first place with its 
satellite dish, emergency staircase and removable roof showing the different 
departments and floors. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the plastic and foil condominiums, playgrounds, pyramids and stores 
stood a rock-strewn apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Cunningham, though she didn't personally know anyone who lost a home 
during the earthquake, nevertheless wanted to remember those who did. 
</P>
<P>
 She built the collapsed housing complex "because of what happened to a lot of 
people. I felt really sorry for them." REBECCA BRYANT

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; EVENT STAGED TO LURE MORE RAIL RIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a bid to spur lagging ridership, local officials staged a second "grand 
opening" of the new Sylmar Metrolink commuter rail station Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to what is fast becoming a series of grand openings at this 
particular site," joked San Fernando Mayor Dan Acuna as he stood at the station 
at 12219 1st St. on the San Fernando-Sylmar border. 
</P>
<P>
 The stop, a series of open-air porticos, was first dedicated Jan. 26. Friday 
marked the first time riders could park on the new paved lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Constructed at an accelerated pace following last month's earthquake, the 
$2-million station is funded by the cities of Los Angeles and San Fernando. The 
stop is part of Metrolink's Santa Clarita line, which connects Union Station in 
Los Angeles with Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The station was jointly developed by the cities of Los Angeles and San 
Fernando, the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority and the 
Southern California Rail Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the initial opening ceremony in January, the site has been mainly used 
by southbound commuters coming to work in the San Fernando Valley and catching 
shuttles, said James M. Okazaki, transit chief for the Los Angeles Department 
of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a daily basis, we've been having about 100 people getting off here on 
round trips and about 50 people catching the train here on round trips," said 
Okazaki. 
</P>
<P>
 Okazaki said Metrolink officials hope to lure commuters with a $750,000 
child-care center, to be built within the next year, Okazaki said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Jacobs, president of the Sylmar Chamber of Commerce, said many would 
ride the train if they knew of the Sylmar stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of senior citizens that would take this," Jacobs said. "We also 
have a lower-income type of people that will be able to take the service. 
There's just a lack of information." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon proposed working with the Los 
Angeles Unified School District to send students from one school per week to 
City Hall on the rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before they purchase cars, I want to teach them how to use mass transit," 
Alarcon said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; CAFE ACCUSED OF IGNORING CITY ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city attorney's office filed criminal charges Friday against 
the owner and operators of a Sherman Oaks cafe for ignoring a City Council 
order to cut back late-night hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Third Life Inc., which operates the Insomnia Cafe, John Pulwer, the company's 
president, and coffeehouse manager John Dunn were charged with two counts of 
disobeying a City Council order. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our business provides a nonalcoholic atmosphere for our patrons," Dunn said 
in a telephone interview Friday from the cafe on Ventura Boulevard. "If that is 
our crime and we're going to be punished for it, I want a judge to tell us." 
</P>
<P>
 Pulwer and Dunn are scheduled to be arraigned April 13 in Van Nuys Municipal 
Court. If convicted, each man faces a maximum sentence of six months in jail 
and/or a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 A city zoning administrator deemed the cafe, at 13718 Ventura Blvd., a public 
nuisance last March after neighbors complained that it generated late-night 
noise and parking congestion and attracted unruly customers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Board of Zoning Appeals upheld the ruling in July and ordered the 
cafe's owners to limit their business hours, which the owners appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council subsequently upheld the decision requiring the 
cafe to close at 11 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays and by 1 a.m. on Fridays and 
Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The cafe operators violated the council order on at least two occasions since 
the Dec. 1 deadline, according to Assistant City Atty. Donald Cocek. 
Investigators from the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety found the 
cafe open past 2 a.m. on Dec. 5 and past 11 p.m. on Feb. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the easiest solution would be for them to abide by the City 
Council request to close at certain hours," Cocek said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not our intent to close the Insomnia Cafe down." 
</P>
<P>
 News of the charges pleased some weary Sherman Oaks residents who hope that an 
end to their sleepless nights is near. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, the neighbors will be able to sleep either because the owner 
complies with the City Council order or because he goes to jail," said Richard 
Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn. JULIE TAMAKI

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SOME QUAKE VICTIMS GET UTILITY BILL BREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to ease the burden for some quake victims, the Los Angeles City Council 
voted Friday to offer relief on water, power and sewage bills for homes and 
businesses ravaged by the Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is about encouraging people to stay and rebuild," said San Fernando 
Valley Councilwoman Laura Chick, who recommended the relief proposals.The 
relief only applies to the billing period that includes Jan. 17, the day of the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the owners of businesses and residences that were "red 
tagged," or declared unsafe, can get up to $200 off their water and power bill 
while the owners of businesses and homes that were "yellow tagged," or 
restricted to limited entry, can get up to $100 off the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the city is offering to waive about 45%, or up to $200, off the sewer 
service charge for residences and businesses that were "red tagged."  
</P>
<P>
 Combined, the quake relief is expected to cost the city about $1.1 million, 
according to a senior city analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 The council delayed a decision on whether to waive a one-time sewer hookup fee 
for quake-damaged businesses that are rebuilt at new locations within the city 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the council gave a five-year, 25% utility discount to businesses 
that start rebuilding within 12 months of the quake and within 10 blocks of 
their original sites. HUGO MARTIN

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: CHAMBER, FIREWORKS FIRM SETTLE SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After taking a Utah pyrotechnics firm to court for a fizzled Fourth of July 
fireworks show in 1992, the Crescenta Valley Chamber of Commerce has agreed to 
an undisclosed settlement, chamber officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a cash settlement," said Warren Boehm, a Crescenta Valley chamber 
board member. "We're happy with it. We've got this behind us now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a mutually satisfactory settlement for everyone," said Linda 
T. Barney, an attorney who represented the fireworks firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will go toward chamber operations and for attorneys' fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Boehm, who served as chamber president in 1992, declined to elaborate further, 
citing a confidentiality clause in the out-of-court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 In its lawsuit filed April 7, 1993, the chamber had sought more than $25,000 
in actual and punitive damages from Utah-based Lantis Productions Inc. and 
William A. Lovick, a pyrotechnician with the firm.  
</P>
<P>
 Lovick was eventually dismissed from the case by a judge, attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lantis was hired in March, 1992, to stage a fireworks show for the Fourth of 
July Family Festival of Fun & Fireworks at Crescenta Valley High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm sent Lovick to set up the pyrotechnics in the afternoon, but he 
abruptly went home saying he felt ill and needed some rest, the chamber's 
attorney, Robert P. Kragulack, had said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he never returned, organizers had to cancel the event and offer 
refunds to a disappointed crowd of more than 5,000.  
</P>
<P>
 It was later learned that Lovick was also setting up a show for the same day 
at Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber blamed Lantis for the loss of $14,571 in expenses and $7,444 in 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although court documents show that both sides are expected to appear for an 
arbitration hearing March 23, attorneys say the case is primarily resolved and 
should be formally dismissed in Glendale Superior Court by August. TOMMY LI

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; A PUBLISHER'S DREAM BECOMES ISSUE OF REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Between the idea and the Reality, 23-year-old magazine publisher Brian Solis 
spends bleary-eyed hours at his personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
 From his Canoga Park apartment, Solis produces a free, black-and-white fashion 
publication, called Reality Magazine, the first 30,000 copies of which were 
distributed to restaurants and shopping centers in the Valley and other parts 
of Los Angeles in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps me stressed," Solis said. "But I love to watch people picking it up 
to read." 
</P>
<P>
 During time not spent working at a Malibu advertising agency or attending 
classes at Pierce College, Solis is both publisher and contributing editor for 
the magazine, which he describes as "maybe a cross between Cosmopolitan and 
Newsweek." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a problem with all the magazines I see on the newsstand," Solis said. 
"Most of the stuff in them is like reading a script you've read before. I 
wanted to do something that will get people stirred up emotionally and make 
them think." 
</P>
<P>
 The first monthly issue includes fashion spreads from Ventura Boulevard and 
Westside salons and apparel shops, an article on Barbra Streisand, advice about 
love and relationships and editorials about pop star Michael Jackson and the 
media's coverage of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine has also provided a forum to showcase the talents of local high 
school students. Students from Pierce and Taft High School have made editorial 
contributions and helped sell ads for Reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially at the beginning, I've had to do almost everything myself," Solis 
said. "I can't remember the last time I had a good night's sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Solis said he was inspired to start publishing in 1989 by the main character 
in the movie "Pump Up the Volume," a high school student who operates an 
unlicensed radio station from his basement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Yeah, that's what I want to do,' " Solis said. "But I didn't have 
radio equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Solis started writing and distributing short essays on flyers for rock bands, 
and eventually put out a leaflet-style magazine called Reality Report. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to secure a small business loan, Solis started Reality Magazine with 
about $2,000 saved since his graduation from Reseda High School in 1988. So 
far, the advertising is paying the costs, and he said he hopes to expand to 
60,000 copies in March. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still want to get a loan, to go to a glossy format," Solis said. "It's just 
an uphill battle to get anyone behind you until you've proved yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Proving himself has been especially important as a Latino, Solis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had the same types of obstacles and stereotypes as other people who are 
Hispanic: that we are only going to work in factories or jump in your car to 
work in your garden," he said. "This is something to put in the face of people 
who have joked about that all my life." KURT PITZER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; RULES EASED TO REPAIR DAMAGED STRUCTURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of 14 buildings in Burbank that remain uninhabitable after the 
Northridge earthquake will not need to meet zoning code requirements or get 
approval by the city's planning board because of action the city took this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Reconstruction of the buildings, which had damage to 50% or more of their 
structures, will be approved by administrative review instead of through a 
public process. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to make it easier for owners of older buildings to rebuild when 
they do not meet existing zoning code requirements such as those for parking or 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
 However, reconstruction work would have to meet current building and safety 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkler systems would be necessary to meet fire codes and disabled access 
would have to be ensured. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want these buildings just patched back together," said Bob Tague, 
the city's redevelopment director.  
</P>
<P>
 Having the administrative review ensures that the buildings are rebuilt 
properly, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, any building that has to be rebuilt by 50% or more would also have to 
follow zoning requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, the city of Burbank had declared 22 
buildings uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 160 were classified as having limited access.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the list of uninhabitable buildings has dropped, with some taken 
off the list as further inspections showed the buildings were safe and others 
were repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14 buildings on the list now include three apartment buildings, four 
office buildings, six homes and an animal hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council also extended for six months a waiver of building permit fees 
for all earthquake-damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 That amount is typically about 1% of the total construction cost, said Bruce 
Feng, city building inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 By eliminating the public review process to rebuild the uninhabitable 
buildings, the owners can potentially save several thousand dollars, Tague 
said. ED BOND

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; NEIGHBORLINESS TOPIC AT TODAY'S WORKSHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the Northridge quake, neighbors reached out to help each 
other -- some for the very first time. 
</P>
<P>
 In Calabasas, community volunteers want to keep that spirit alive, even when 
there is no disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting sponsored by the Health and Wellness Committee of Calabasas 
today, a panel will discuss disaster preparedness with an emphasis on how to be 
better neighbors, even when there is no emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main part is creating more cohesive neighborhoods," said Addie Winter, 
co-chair of the committee and organizer of the event. "You can't just live in 
your own little shell." 
</P>
<P>
 Winter, who started a community watch in her neighborhood two years ago to 
combat crime, compiled a list of all the names, phone numbers and car license 
plates of her neighbors. She hopes to encourage other residents to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe how many people said they weren't prepared," said Winter. 
"There are people who live alone. One woman who is disabled was locked in her 
bedroom with no phone for a couple of hours. With a Neighborhood Watch, you can 
check on people in an emergency." 
</P>
<P>
 Panelists at the workshop will also discuss issues such as earthquake 
assistance, property damage and physical preparedness. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop is the second in a series entitled "Creating a Community." At the 
first seminar, a panel of therapists addressed emotional concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's seminar will be held at 10 a.m. at Calabasas City Hall, 26135 Mureau 
Road. SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; SCHOOL BUSES STILL LACKING SAFETY DEVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial type of safety restraint has not been installed on Las 
Virgenes school buses as promised, despite an intense lobbying effort by 
parents that helped win support for the devices last September. 
</P>
<P>
 Micho Industries, the manufacturer of the pull-down safety bar, has been 
unable to renew its patent license to market, build and install the R-Bar 
restraints, said Michael Dunn, vice president of marketing at the Lompoc-based 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, Dunn said he "would like to thank . . . the concerned 
parents and school board members in the Las Virgenes district for (their) 
cooperation, patience and support for this revolutionary safety product." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn said the company is still attempting to renew its license to install 
R-Bars. 
</P>
<P>
 That hardly mollified parents who believe the seat restraints, similar to 
those used on roller coasters, could reduce the risk of injury to their 
children on their way to school or on field trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty upset," said Patty Beth, who helped organize support for 
installing R-Bars on two buses for a trial period. "This was a year's worth of 
work that hopefully won't go down the drain. We're hoping some other 
manufacturer will come along who wants to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Zimring, assistant superintendent of the Las Virgenes Unified School 
District, said school officials are still committed to trying the seat 
restraints. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still hopeful that this will come through somehow," Zimring said. "We 
did a fair amount of work sorting out the insurance issues and things. Maybe 
we'll be able to find another company interested in picking it up." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no move has been made to find another manufacturer, Zimring said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, the school board agreed to allow Micho Industries to install 
R-Bars on one or two buses, free, for a three-month trial period. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came after a group of parents lobbied for the installation of 
R-Bars, despite a lack of evidence supporting claims that the restraints 
actually increase children's safety on buses.  
</P>
<P>
 Some legislators, including Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), chairman of 
the House Transportation Committee, even raised concerns that the bars could 
trap children in their seats in case of a fire. KURT PITZER

QUESTIONS OF RIGHTS RAISED IN DEAF MAN'S MURDER CASE; COURTS: THREE 
SIGN-LANGUAGE INTERPRETERS ARE WORKING AS HEARING FOCUSES ON WHETHER WHAT 
DEFENDANT TOLD POLICE WAS PROPERLY TRANSLATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The deaf murder suspect watched intently as a sign-language interpreter 
translated the questioning of a witness in a pretrial hearing at Van Nuys 
Superior Court Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the defendant stopped the interpreter -- and the court 
proceedings -- and turned to another interpreter to his left. The second 
interpreter, who is also deaf, explained in simplified sign language what the 
first interpreter had just said. 
</P>
<P>
 Satisfied, the defendant nodded, and the proceedings resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, several members of the audience were engaged in lively 
conversation. But the judge did not have to reprimand them for disrupting the 
goings-on because they, too, were speaking in the silent language of sign. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the setting for a typical murder case that is atypical in that most of 
the key players are deaf, including the defendant and the victim, and many of 
them are not proficient in standard American Sign Language. Even the judge 
hearing the case is hearing-impaired, although he has no trouble speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the lack of ASL proficiency on the part of the defendant and some 
of the witnesses, a deaf interpreter who can translate in simplified terms is 
needed. A third interpreter is also involved because the formal ASL 
interpreters need frequent relief from the strain. Each works about 30 minutes 
before being relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial's aim is to determine whether Val Lamar Smith, 23, of South-Central 
Los Angeles, murdered James E. Powell Jr., 27, of Long Beach, who was also 
deaf, on Jan. 10, 1992, in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Smith and two deaf friends went to a Van Nuys apartment 
building to visit a friend when they encountered Powell, who was staying with a 
friend of his, Yvonne Lane, who is also deaf. Police said an argument in sign 
language ensued among the men, allegedly over rival gang affiliations, and 
Smith drew a gun and shot Powell, killing him. Smith was arrested and held 
without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the other men, Howard Love, 27, pleaded guilty to voluntary 
manslaughter in exchange for a three-year prison term and a promise to testify 
against Smith, part of a bargain with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane is also expected to testify in sign language that she saw Smith shoot 
Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his requiring a third interpreter, Smith's lack of proficiency 
in formal American Sign Language has raised questions as to whether Smith was 
denied his Miranda rights to remain silent or have an attorney present when 
questioned by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's daylong hearing focused on whether what Smith said to the officers 
was properly translated by a private sign-language interpreter hired by police. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked by police whether he wished to give up his right to remain silent, 
the interpreter translated Smith's response as saying he did not want to talk 
and "I prefer to go to court, and I want a lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking that to mean that Smith wanted a lawyer only in court and not during 
the interrogation, police proceeded to question him. Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie 
Samuels refused to say whether Smith confessed during that questioning, saying 
only that Smith made statements that she would like to present in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Tony Bryan argued that Smith's statement should not be 
admitted into evidence, contending that Smith did not waive his right to remain 
silent and that police ignored his request for an attorney to be present. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels argued that Smith created the ambiguity by not clearly saying what he 
meant. She said that the fact that police videotaped the interrogation proved 
that no misconduct was intended. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Michael J. Farrell, who has less than 50% hearing capacity in both ears 
in the conversational range as a result of damage he suffered in an Army tank, 
said reaching a decision was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many things can be ambiguous, so much so in sign language," he said. "But 
I would still find that he did not waive his rights and he wanted a lawyer 
then." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Farrell made a ruling tentatively allowing Smith's statement to be 
used because he found that the interrogating officer was honestly confused by 
what Smith had said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suppression (of evidence) is to punish police who may have forced a 
confession," Farrell said, adding that he did not believe that was the case in 
this incident. "The police did everything to make it fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell said he will give defense attorney Bryan one more opportunity Monday 
morning to change his opinion. Opening statements to the jury are scheduled for 
Monday afternoon.

announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein said that while the publications are in temporary quarters, the new 
system can serve students who work on the Daily Sundial newspaper, reporters 
for public radio station KCSN-FM, and writers for CSUN's weekly cable news 
program, Valley View. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment -- including a Macintosh Quadra 605 and 650 fileserver and an 
Apple 360 Laserprinter -- can then be integrated into a larger system when the 
publications move back into their permanent building, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to CSUN President Blenda J. Wilson that accompanied the check, 
Klein noted that no institution experienced more financial loss than CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
 "We remain committed to the community, to CSUN (the alma mater of many Times 
employees) and especially to supporting quality journalism programs and 
university newspapers like the Daily Sundial," Klein wrote.

BRADLEY'S POWER PLAY; PLAN WOULD GIVE MAYOR MORE AUTHORITY, MAKE COUNCIL JOBS 
FULL-TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his first seven months as mayor of Compton, Omar Bradley has embraced the 
spotlight time and again.  
</P>
<P>
 He aggressively pressed for a card club, risking the wrath of ministers in a 
town where churches have traditionally been the base of political power. 
</P>
<P>
 He's taken on rap artists for derogatory lyrics and, in the same breath, 
triggered heated protests by accusing Jews of promoting a negative stereotype 
of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Bradley touched off a new debate when he proposed a major overhaul 
of city government that would give the mayor more power and make the mayor and 
council positions full-time, with hefty pay increases. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which eventually would have to be approved by voters, would give the 
mayor authority to set agendas for council meetings and to veto council 
decisions. The mayor's position would become separate from the council, and his 
salary would increase from $32,000 to $70,000 a year. Council salaries would 
jump to $40,000 from $22,000, and a fifth council seat would be created. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The sweeping proposal, both opponents and supporters say, is illustrative of 
Bradley and his leadership style. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's bodacious, he's brilliant, he's young," said Amen Rahh, a college 
professor and member of the Compton Unified school board. "That's what we 
need." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a dictator," said Patricia A. Moore, a former councilwoman who lost her 
mayoral bid to Bradley last June. "It's almost criminal against the citizens. 
The city doesn't hardly generate enough money to support current salaries, much 
less a pay raise like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley still has to get council approval before his proposal can go to the 
June 7 ballot, but a majority of council members have indicated they favor a 
public vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley, 35, who was born and raised in Compton, teaches English at Lynwood 
High School. He first was elected to the council in 1991, and has long 
complained of the demands of holding elected office and another job. He is 
married and has two children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether you know it or not, this is already a full-time job," the mayor said 
when he introduced his reorganization plan at a council meeting. "We all do a 
lot of work for this city, and a lot more needs to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time Bradley has angled for a salary raise. In December, 
he proposed that a Gaming Commission, composed of the mayor and four other 
council members, be created to oversee nightly bingo games at the city-owned 
Ramada Hotel and the planned card casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley suggested that the council be paid another $11,000 a year for serving 
as gaming commissioners. After public protests, the commission was created, but 
as an unpaid body. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor admits that he tends to charge ahead on proposals that he feels 
strongly about, even if they generate heat. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the most vocal of three council members who approved a hotly debated 
card club for the city in December, 1992. Bradley said at the time that his 
vote for the casino might cost him votes in last year's mayoral race, but that 
he believed a casino would provide much-needed revenues for the struggling 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The club is scheduled to open in the spring of 1995, and officials estimate 
that it will generate $10 million in revenue for Compton. Bradley said he wants 
to use the money to hire more police and clean up decrepit business districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the flap over rap music. While lecturing rap star Eazy-E about 
his depictions of black life, Bradley also insinuated that Jews were behind a 
conspiracy to promote negative rap. He apologized in the wake of heated 
criticism, but continued to repeat the allegation on radio talk shows in the 
following days. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Bradley claims that he triggered the public debate over rap lyrics that 
resulted in major radio stations across the country banning songs with negative 
depictions of blacks and women. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of Bradley's political opponents will admit he's instituted some 
popular programs. He draws praise for establishing 100 Strong Men of Compton, a 
volunteer organization that has embarked on a citywide cleanup project.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's not unsophisticated," said Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton), a 
former mayor of Compton. "I've seen some good come out of projects like 100 
Strong Men. But I'm also hearing a lot of distrust out there right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics, for example, question Bradley's recent trip to China, in which 
he flew first-class at city expense. An ardent supporter of the business 
community, he also plans a trip to Africa to promote international business 
relations for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Some veteran politicians say the young mayor is simply pushing too far, too 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's a nice young man," said attorney Maxcy D. Filer, who spent 14 
years on the council. "But I can't agree with some of the issues he's pushing. 
We have enough potholes and trees to trim to keep him busy."

CONTROL OF FEDERAL JOB FUNDS SHIFTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VICKI TORRES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prompted in part by an ongoing investigation into alleged misspent funds at an 
El Monte social service agency, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on 
Tuesday temporarily took away control of $50 million in job-training funds from 
a county executive and requested a report on which department should 
permanently oversee allocation of the employment-training money. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors have stopped Stephanie Klopfleisch, chief deputy director of 
the Department of Community and Senior Citizen Services, from handling 
administration of the federal funds.Instead, disbursement of the government 
money will be overseen by Jose Martinez, a county employee who is executive 
director of the nonprofit Private Industry Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly, the two shared administrative duties, because, under federal rules, 
the council serves as an advisory partner to the county in disbursing the 
federal job-training funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's chief administrative officer will advise the board in 30 days on 
whether another county department, such as Community Development, should handle 
the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the board Tuesday was a compromise reached at the last minute 
to avoid more wrangling between the department and the Private Industry 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council initially requested an audit of the county agency after it was 
alleged that the Mid-Valley Manpower Training Consortium in El Monte showed 
illegal expenditures and that $600,000 was missing. Mid-Valley's director, 
Douglas Shaw, was fired and is under criminal investigation by federal Labor 
Department agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mid-Valley investigation came at a time when the Department of Community 
and Senior Citizen Services was also reporting a 160% increase in 
administrative costs without a corresponding increase in the number of people 
receiving job training.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PALMDALE HIRES ITS FIRST CITY ATTORNEY; CITY 
COUNCIL: ANGIL PATRICIA JONES WILL GET WAGE AND BENEFITS PACKAGE OF NEARLY 
$140,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the city of Palmdale, it's like coming of age. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than three decades of contracting with outside firms for legal 
services, the Palmdale City Council has hired an in-house attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're maturing as a city," said Councilman Jim Root. "A large firm has been 
our security blanket." 
</P>
<P>
 In a unanimous vote Thursday, the council approved a three-year contract with 
Angil Patricia Jones to serve as Palmdale's city attorney, beginning April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal provides Jones with a first-year salary and benefits package of 
nearly $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' salary and benefits are dwarfed by the legal fees Palmdale has been 
paying to Richards, Watson & Gershon, a Los Angeles-based law firm it has been 
contracting with for legal services. 
</P>
<P>
 Between July 1 and Nov. 30, 1993, the first five months of the 1993-94 fiscal 
year, Palmdale paid $252,134 for legal services provided by the Los Angeles 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 At that rate, the city would pay in excess of $600,000 this year to the 
company, about the same it paid the previous fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1991-92 fiscal year, Palmdale paid Richards, Watson & Gershon $1 
million, according to city records. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the high attorneys' fees of the past and Jones' comparatively smaller 
salary and benefits package, Palmdale does not expect to save much money -- at 
least not in the short term -- just because it has hired a staff attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, city attorney for Turlock since 1989, will need her own staff and the 
city will still contract with outside attorneys for some work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Angil is not going to be out litigating cases," said Councilman David Myers, 
who added that contract attorneys also will be used for redevelopment and other 
specialized matters. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first three months, Jones expects to hire an office assistant and a 
legal secretary and set up a law library. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll probably break even," Root said. "But we'll have somebody 
available to the staff 40 to 60 hours a week, available to the community, 
available to do seminars for staff." 
</P>
<P>
 There also will be more efficiency, council members said. Department heads 
will be able to talk to Jones at virtually any time without incurring 
additional fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Myers believes, the in-house attorney will save the city money.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council had been considering for two years the possibility of hiring 
a staff attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, a formal search was begun, mainly to give the council an 
opportunity to see who might be interested. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the reasons Jones was selected, Myers said, is that she set up the 
first city attorney's office in Turlock. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a person of incredibly high energy," he said of Jones. "She truly has 
a 'take no prisoners' approach to the law . . . The law's very black and white 
with her." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides her $98,500 annual salary, Jones will receive $400 per month to 
compensate for the use of her own car and reimbursement for job-related 
mileage; 15 vacation days; 12 days of sick leave and 10 days of administrative 
leave.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; RESTAURANT OWNERS ARE SUING LANDLORD FOR 
FRAUD; PALMDALE: THE COUPLE SAYS COMPANY KNEW BUT DIDN'T DISCLOSE THAT BURGER 
STAND WAS IN HIGH-CRIME AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Palmdale couple who last month opened a burger stand say the location of 
their restaurant is just killing them. Granted, they named the place "Murder 
Burger," but say they were never told the restaurant was in a crime-plagued 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are suing their landlord, alleging fraud. Ron and Sherry Howell filed 
suit in Los Angeles Superior Court Thursday against The Fairfield Homes Title 
Holding Co., which owns the restaurant building at 1824 E. Palmdale Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The Howells, who signed a seven-year lease on the restaurant last June, are 
suing the company for $300,000, claiming company officials knew, but did not 
disclose, that the restaurant was in a high-crime area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Howells' claim is that the landlord knew about gang activities and 
tagging in the area, but did not disclose that information," said Fred Fenster, 
their attorney. "If my clients had known, they never would have signed the 
lease." 
</P>
<P>
 He said "Murder Burger" is so named because the hamburgers served there are 
"killers." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a positive reference to the food," he said, adding that the Howells had 
successfully run a restaurant by the same name in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to reach representatives of the title holding company and the Howells 
were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Fenster said the Howells spent more than $250,000 and six months refurbishing 
and furnishing the site, which formerly housed a Naugle's and Del Taco. 
</P>
<P>
 In the complaint, the Howells allege that shortly after they moved in last 
month: 
</P>
<P>
 * The improvements were subjected to relentless, periodic graffiti tagging by 
rival gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 * Slogans of the rival gangs were etched and carved on the windows, mirrors, 
walls and furnishing of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Patrons and employees of the restaurant were terrorized when it was taken 
over by gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an incredible shame when decent people invest their life savings in a 
location and risk everything because they weren't informed of the true facts," 
Fenster said. "Hopefully, a jury will decide that they deserve a return of 
their investment."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MOBILE HOME RENT LAW GETS TENTATIVE OK FROM 
COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members tentatively approved a new mobile home rent-control law 
Thursday, but the provisions do not completely satisfy local park owners or 
park residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law, a park owner who uses a lease prepared by the city will be 
allowed to raise space rents each year by an amount equivalent to the annual 
Social Security increase. The park owner also will be allowed to boost a space 
rent by 25% after a tenant sells his or her coach. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thursday's meeting, some residents complained that these increases were too 
steep, while representatives of park owners argued that they were too small. 
City Council members will take a final vote on the measure in April.  
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is going to make everybody happy," said Councilman Joe Davies, who 
proposed the Social Security provision to replace a city staff suggestion that 
the annual rent hike be tied to the Los Angeles area's Consumer Price Index. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we all gain; we all give up a little," Mayor Jim Ledford said. "I 
think it sets the stage for more cooperation between ownership and residents." 
</P>
<P>
 The vote came after more than a year of heated debate concerning the need to 
overhaul the city's mobile home rent-control ordinance adopted in 1985. The 
talks began after some residents complained about being locked into long-term 
leases that called for annual rent increases of up to 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law, park owners who switch to the city's lease will be eligible 
for financial incentives. These include the annual rate increase for residents 
without long-term leases and the 25% rent hike after a tenant sells his or her 
home. The city's lease will cover periods of more than 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Park owners who do not use the city's document would not be allowed to impose 
annual rent increases on tenants who do not have long-term leases. They could 
raise the rent only 10% after a home is sold. Either restriction could be 
appealed to the city's mobile home rent review board, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents said the prospect of a 25% rent increase will make it difficult 
to sell a mobile home.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DEVELOPER SEEKS STUDY OF QUAKE'S IMPACT ON

 Officials from the Newhall Land & Farming Co. have asked the city Planning 
Commission to study for two months possible impacts of the Northridge 
earthquake on the site of its proposed North Hills housing development. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,418-unit project was to be considered for final approval at the 
commission's meeting Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But company officials have asked that a public hearing and commission decision 
be postponed until May 3 so they can more carefully study signs of ground 
movement caused by the quake, Newhall Land Vice President Mark Subbotin said in 
a letter to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the topography of the site near the intersection of Valencia Boulevard 
and McBean Parkway has apparently changed, officials are required to do a 
re-evaluation, said Carole Maglione, a spokeswoman for Newhall Land. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just a part of responsible and proper planning," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Associate city planner Fred Folstadd said the staff would recommend that the 
hearing and the commission's decision be postponed. SCOTT GLOVER

CLOCK RUNS OUT ON UCLA RALLY; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CAL HANGS ON FOR 92-88 
VICTORY THAT PUTS PAC-10 RACE IN A VIRTUAL THREE-WAY TIE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Another game, another defeat for the UCLA Bruins, who followed up a 24-point 
loss at Arizona by getting nudged Thursday night at Pauley Pavilion by 
California, which looked like a team going somewhere fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Bruins, also looked like a team going somewhere swiftly, only 
not in the right direction. As soon as UCLA fell, 92-88, the Pacific 10 
Conference race fell into a virtual three-way tie between the fading Bruins and 
surging Arizona and Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 But UCLA didn't go easily. Down 86-71 and with Ed O'Bannon having fouled out, 
the Bruins outscored Cal, 15-1, and got to within 87-86 with 1:04 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins had a chance to go ahead, but turned the ball over when the shot 
clock ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 Five free throws in the last 18 seconds -- four by Jason Kidd, ended it for 
Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, 18-4, is 11-3 in the Pac-10, the same as Arizona, while the Bears are a 
half-game back at 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
 After back-to-back losses and four defeats in eight games, it's not a pretty 
picture at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Who's to blame? This time, it was easy. Lamond Murray, a shooting star if 
there ever was one, scored 36 points and Kidd inspired the Bears to a sweep of 
their series against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly had the chance to win," Coach Jim Harrick said. "We just didn't 
play well enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Shon Tarver's career-high 30 points, 21 in the second half, nearly rescued the 
game for UCLA, but the shot-clock violation was a critical error. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball wound up in Tyus Edney's hands, but he was double-teamed, so he 
passed to Charles O'Bannon and the shot clock ran to zero. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tyus probably wishes he got the ball to Shon Tarver," said Harrick, who said 
he did not call a time out because he did not want to stop UCLA's momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe we should have called a timeout there," he said. "What happened there 
was not a good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd was not a good thing for UCLA. He had 23 points, sank two free throws for 
a 89-86 lead with 19 seconds left and Edney's three-pointer missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd completed his night's work with 11 assists, only four fewer than the UCLA 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bruins needed any extra incentive Thursday, all they needed to do was 
think about last season's 104-82 wipeout at the hands of Kidd and Murray, their 
worst loss ever at Pauley. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there was the matter of the timely critique, becoming almost 
routine around Westwood these day. This one was slightly different, though, 
because it came from Bill Walton. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing on ESPN's "Up Close," Walton delivered a withering blast that seemed 
sure to bruise Bruin psyches, since it came from one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, this Bruin team does not know how to play big games," Walton 
said. "Like a number of UCLA teams with Jim Harrick, they start to go downhill 
as the season goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 Counting last year's blowout, Cal had been 2-32 at UCLA since the 1959-60 
season coming into Thursday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of that was before the Kidd Era at Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, the Bruins probably are going to close their eyes until its 
over. The first half was a Kidd production, almost in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
 At the half, Kidd had 12 points, eight assists, three steals and California 
owned a 53-41 lead. It took only 10 minutes for UCLA to fall behind by 10 
points at 26-16. Murray was a main culprit with 15 of his 20 first-half points 
as well as four dunks of the highlight variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Edney scored on a breakaway to get UCLA within 31-24, but then Kidd took over. 
</P>
<P>
 He started it on defense when he stole the ball from Cameron Dollar and scored 
on layup. Then Murray rejected Charles O'Bannon. At the other end, Kidd batted 
a mid-air rebound to Akili Jones and he knocked in a short jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time down, Kidd finished another fast break with another layup. At 
37-24, the rout was on, or so it seemed. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the tipoff, game faces were already being worn, even by 
non-combatants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was ever a must game on the schedule for UCLA, it's this one," 
ESPN's Dick Vitale said. "They really need it psychologically, to beat somebody 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 They almost did.

SANTA BARBARA SQUEAKS PAST CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Following each Santa Barbara goal with one of its own, Capistrano Valley 
finally ran out of answers when the Dons scored in the last minute to give them 
a 3-2 victory in a Division II boys' soccer quarterfinal game Friday at 
Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Santa Barbara (26-2-1) advanced to the semifinals, where it will 
play host to defending Southern Section champion Esperanza on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams appeared to be heading for overtime, but Santa Barbara's Hugo 
Alcaraz quieted the crowd of 300 when he kicked a pass out of midair and into 
the corner of the net shortly before the final whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley (15-6-5) had come back from one-goal deficits twice, the 
second coming with 15 minutes left to play when Chris Tullar lined a shot that 
kissed off the crossbar and into the net tying the score, 2-2. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a big boost for the Cougars, who had seen the Dons take a 2-1 lead 
earlier in the second half when a shot glanced off the head of Capistrano 
Valley fullback Gabe Payne into the Cougar net. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going up for the header, but (goalkeeper Jason) Felix yelled 'keeper.' 
" Payne said. "So I ducked, but the ball glanced off the top of my head." 
</P>
<P>
 The prettiest goal of the game came late in the first half when Santa Barbara 
was awarded a free kick just outside the penalty box and five yards from the 
endline. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeper Alfredo Moreno took a chance with the tough angle and hooked it past 
Felix and off the far post for a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anyone score from that much of an angle," Felix said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars tied the score with two minutes left in the half on a nice pass 
from Ryan Hawkins to Marc Springer, who chipped it in the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara, which played without leading scorer Carlos Trujillo, who had a 
concussion, lost Moreno for its next game when he received a red card for 
kicking a player just before the game ended.

 Santa Margarita, with a 24-7 first-quarter run, defeated Savanna, 82-59, in 
the semifinals of the Southern Section Division III-AA boys' basketball

<P>
 The Eagles (23-6) will make their first championship appearance, facing 
Servite next Saturday at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>

12-2 lead. Santa Margarita hit eight of 14 from the field in the first quarter, 
building a 24-7 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Jerry DeBusk pointed out that this was only the fourth game for Santa

 "We played as a unit tonight and I was very pleased with our performance," 
DeBusk said.

 La Puente Bassett earned a chance at its first Southern Section boys' 
basketball championship with a 67-64 victory over Corona del Mar in a Division 
IV-AA semifinal game Friday night at Wilson High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmory Thompson led the Olympians with 22 points, and sealed the victory by 
sinking two free throws with four seconds remaining in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar was led by Ramin Bastani with 24 points, but scored only four 
after halftime, as Bassett Coach Marcus Hilliard made a defensive adjustment 
two minutes into the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was too much penetration to the basket in the first half, and there 
were several breakdowns in fundamentals," Hilliard said. "I asked my team at 
halftime if they were ready to play a man-to-man defense, and they said yes. 
But after Corona del Mar scored two quick baskets, we had to go a zone 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Arex Eisman connected on a layup with 27 seconds remaining in the game to give 
the Olympians (15-12) a 65-63 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Schroeder hit one of two free throws with five seconds left for the Sea 
Kings (15-14), before Thompson was fouled one second later. DALE RUHE

SOUTHERN SECTION BOYS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; DIVISION II-AA; INGLEWOOD TOPS 
HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tony Gonzalez's spectacular high school athletic career ended in resounding 
fashion Friday night at Marina High. Gonzalez did what he could, scoring 23 
points and grabbing 11 rebounds, but his Huntington Beach team never had a 
chance against second-seeded Inglewood and lost, 60-47, in the Southern Section 
Division II-AA quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, there was no bitterness and no tears from Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played hard," he said. "I'm not mad. We played as hard as we could; they 
were just a better team. We would have had to play a perfect game to beat 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 And even that might not have been good enough to beat an Inglewood team that 
had two terrific players, forward Paul Pierce and guard Sam Turks (14 points, 
two three-pointers), and enough quickness to keep up with many college teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce, a 6-4 junior, scored 22 points, grabbed 10 rebounds and had four 
thunderous dunks. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one dunk, I don't know where he took off from," Huntington Beach Coach 
Roy Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gonzalez: "He's really good. He's the best player I've played against." 
</P>
<P>
 Inglewood was equally impressed with Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to stop Gonzalez all night," Inglewood Coach Patrick Roy said. "But 
he's too strong for us down low. We knew we couldn't let him run wild." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Roy's team did most of the running. They came out and ran 
off the game's first 12 points and took a 16-6 lead after the first quarter. 
Huntington Beach stayed within range, 26-16, at the half, thanks to a 2-3 zone 
and 10 second-quarter points from Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers made Roy sweat as they scored the first six points of the third 
quarter on three-pointers from Vasili Hatziris and Matt Malmquist. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the first time I took my jacket off all year," Roy said. "I was a 
nervous wreck." 
</P>
<P>
 But Roy needn't worry. His team turned up the heat defensively and went on a 
10-1 run over the next two minutes to take a 36-23 lead. The Oilers never got 
closer than nine after that. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Gonzalez did finish with a bang. He came down the lane with 30 
seconds left and threw down a vicious, albeit meaningless, dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to go out with a dunk," he said. "And I wanted to make my last 
shot." 
</P>
<P>
 He did that too, hitting a baseline shot in the waning seconds.

SOUTHERN SECTION BOYS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; DIVISION II-A; TUSTIN GIVES ENCORE 
IN BEATING MUIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the third time in four seasons, Tustin eliminated Pasadena Muir from the 
Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth-seeded Tillers used some hot shooting from the field and free 
throws down the stretch to halt the Mustangs, 69-65, in the quarterfinals of 
the Division II-A boys' basketball playoffs Friday night at Foothill High. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Tustin's 11th consecutive victory and second this season over Muir and 
advances the Tillers to the semifinals Tuesday against top-seeded Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin guard Jeff Aguilar, an unlikely hero, emerged to score a career-high 21 
points, drilling five three-pointers. Aguilar, who scored 10 in the fourth 
quarter, hit six of his nine shots and converted all four of his free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought after I hit two in the first quarter they'd (wise) up," the senior 
said. "But they just left me open and I just kept hitting them. This is by far 
my best game." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin (22-7) couldn't have shot much better. The Tillers converted 25 of 42 
(59.5%) from the field compared to Muir's 24 of 53 (45.3%). 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they had trouble shaking the pesky Mustangs (19-12), the defending 
division champs and winners of the Pacific League. But Aguilar, Doug Gottlieb 
and Aaron Kraus hit crucial free throws late to give Tustin the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought Aguilar shot the ball well and we got some guys to come through 
with some big free throws," Tustin Coach Andy Ground said. "But (Muir) shot the 
ball well too near the end. It got pretty scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin appeared to have the victory clinched after taking a 63-54 lead on two 
free throws by Aguilar with 1:31 left. But forward Duane Curtis, who finished 
with a game-high 23 points, converted five free throws after being fouled on 
consecutive three-point attempts, the last two coming with 1:05 left to pull 
Muir to within 65-59. 
</P>
<P>
 After Kraus hit two free throws, Curtis nailed a three-pointer to pull Muir to 
within 67-62 with 49 seconds left. But the Mustangs, who had chances to get 
closer, folded by missing three-point shots as Tustin sealed it at the line.

SOUTHERN SECTION BOYS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; DIVISION III-AA; SERVITE'S COOL, 
CALM VALLAS COLLECTS A VICTORY OVER SONORA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kristian Vallas was confident. With his team trailing by one with 30 seconds 
to play, the Servite point guard wanted the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Vallas made two free throws with three seconds to play to put the 
Friars in the Division III-AA final with a 47-46 victory over Sonora at Villa 
Park High. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite (20-8), which will face Santa Margarita for the championship next 
Saturday at Anaheim Arena, survived a hectic fourth quarter during which the 
lead changed hands five times in the last four minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Josh Lien gave Sonora (23-4) a 46-45 lead with 58 seconds left with a free 
throw and then got the rebound after he missed his second attempt, but Sonora 
later was called for a backcourt violation, giving Servite the chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
 After a timeout, the Friars got the ball to Vallas, who was fouled under the 
basket with three seconds left. He calmly hit the first shot to tie the score 
and after a Sonora timeout, made the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted the opportunity to win it," Vallas, a 6-3 senior, said. "I was real 
calm up there." Vallas led all scorers with 19 points. He made six of eight 
free-throw attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora, the top-seeded team in Division III-AA, rebounded from a sluggish 
start that saw them fall behind 12-0. It did not make a basket until there was 
2:05 left in the first quarter. The Raiders chipped away at the lead in the 
second quarter behind center Craig Clark (10 points) and Sergio Hernandez (17 
points). Although they trailed 21-20 at halftime, Sonora came out strong in the 
second half, building an eight-point lead 33-25 with 1:48 left in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Seaton, Servite's 6-9 center, kept Clark in check, limiting him to one 
basket in the second half. The pair dueled in the low post most of the game, 
before Clark fouled out with 5:26 to play.

 Edison rallied from a 16-point deficit for a 65-63 victory over Palmdale 
Friday night in the Southern Section Division I-A semifinals in front of about 
1,200 at Antelope Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Baird hit an 18-footer from the left with two seconds left to put the 
Chargers (19-9) in the division final against Mater Dei next Saturday.The 
defeat stopped a 16-game winning streak for Palmdale (24-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale's 16-point lead came with three minutes left in the second quarter, 
and the Falcons were ahead, 56-46, after three. 
</P>
<P>
 But Edison bombed its way back from the outside, opening with an 11-2 run, and 
when Micah Kroeger hit a five-foot jumper with 2:18 to play, the score was 
tied, 61-61. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale's Al Lairson hit a 15-foot jumper with 1:53 remaining to give the 
Falcons a 63-61 edge. Then Edison's Ali Tofighi sank two free throws to tie the 
score with just over a minute left. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale tried to run the clock out on its next possession but Lairson, who 
scored 22 points, was called for traveling with 30 seconds left, setting the 
stage for Baird. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger scored 20 points for Edison and Darrell Adams had 13. IRENE GARCIA

SOUTHERN SECTION BOYS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; DIVISION V-AA; NORTH HOLLYWOOD 
CAMPBELL HALL SIDETRACKS ST. MARGARET'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 St. Margaret's ran into a roadblock on its way to the school's first Southern 
Section basketball championship: a 6-foot-10 roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of a standing-room-only crowd, North Hollywood Campbell Hall 
eliminated St. Margaret's, 66-52, in a Southern Section Division V-AA boys' 
basketball quarterfinal game Friday at Campbell Hall.Viking center Alex Lopez 
led the way with 30 points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who has signed a letter of intent with Washington, scored 20 points in 
the second half and blocked three shots. He helped the Vikings (19-8) advance 
to the semifinals. Fourth-seeded St. Margaret's ended the season at 20-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were out of sync all night," St. Margaret's Coach Rick Bauer said. "Call 
it nerves, inexperience, whatever. Give Campbell Hall the credit, their 
pressure defense forced us to play that way." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Margaret's top scorer, Damian Raibon, scored 17 points on eight-of-15 
shooting but never seemed to find his rhythm. Teammate Lupe Rodriguez added 14 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Raibon averaged 24 points and 12 rebounds during the regular season, but was 
hampered by a twisted ankle he suffered late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Raibon wasn't the only one hurting. Starting forward Bobby Masters also hurt 
his ankle 17 seconds into the fourth quarter and his absence further hindered 
any Tartan comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 Unseeded Campbell Hall didn't give St. Margaret's many opportunities, but the 
Tartans did come as close as 12 twice in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Tartans tried to get within range, they fired blanks. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Margaret's shot 33% (13 of 39) in the second half and Campbell Hall's 
defense held them to 37% (23 of 63) for the game. The Viking defense also 
forced 14 St. Margaret's turnovers in the first three quarters helping Campbell 
Hall build a 46-31 lead.

SOUTHERN SECTION BOYS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; DIVISION I-A; MONARCHS' SIMON, 
COTTON RULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mater Dei's basketball team went to its marquee names, stars present and 
future, Friday night. They shined in the spotlight at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles Simon and Schea Cotton, the Monarchs' lightning and thunder, led top- 
seeded Mater Dei to a 78-60 victory over fourth-seeded Los Angeles Loyola in 
front of about 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The two made the second half their own highlight show, sending the Cubs (22-5) 
reeling and sending the Monarchs into the Southern Section I-A championship 
game -- their 10th in 12 seasons -- a week from today. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei (30-0), ranked second in the nation by USA Today, will play Edison 
at Anaheim Arena. To get there, the Monarchs needed to outlast a stubborn 
Loyola team. And to do that, they needed Simon and Cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon, a 6-foot-4 senior guard, scored 32 points and displayed the skills that 
earned him a scholarship to Arizona. He sank three-pointers and blew past 
defenders for layups. He scored the first six points of the fourth quarter, 
sparking a 9-0 run that game Mater Dei a 62-46 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fourth quarter was all about heart," Simon said. "We showed who had the 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the fourth quarter, Simon spun around UCLA-bound Toby Bailey for a 
scoop shot. A moment later he eased in on a breakaway layup, looking over his 
shoulder mockingly as he went. He was going to enjoy the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 It also brought Gary McKnight, the Monarchs' robust coach, off his chair and 
into the air, pumping his fist. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola never challenged again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Miles has been on the varsity three years," McKnight said, "and this will be 
his third championship game. He's very proud of that." 
</P>
<P>
 This will be Cotton's first, and the 6-5 freshman was determined to get there. 
Cotton scored 21 points, making nine of 12 shots -- five of them dunks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton, who suffered a broken nose in the first quarter, also scored the 
Monarchs' first 10 points of the third as they extended a 36-34 lead to 53-46 
going into the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want that ring," Cotton said. "I wanted to be in that championship game." 
</P>
<P>
 While the stars shined, the Monarchs' supporting cast did its bit. The 
rough-and-tumble chorus line of Darren Hite, Josh Porter and Mike Karich 
hounded Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey came into the game averaging more than 22 points. He scored 16 and made 
only seven of 16 shots. Eight of his points came in the final quarter, when the 
issue had been decided. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys put a saddle on Bailey and rode him around," McKnight said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Bailey, Toby's younger brother, helped keep the Cubs close. He scored 18 
points but couldn't match the Monarchs' duo.

SOUTHERN SECTION BOYS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; DIVISION III-A; VLASIC TRIGGERS A 
FOURTH-QUARTER SURGE TO LIFT PACIFICA OVER LA CANADA 
</P>

 Pacifica's Chris Vlasic led a fourth-quarter surge that carried the Mariners 
to a 59-54 victory over La Canada in the Southern Section Division III-A 
semifinals in front of more than 2,000 Friday night at Rancho Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlasic scored 11 of his game-high 20 points in the fourth quarter to put the 
Mariners (26-1) into the title game against San Dimas next Saturday at the 
Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 La Canada (26-3) was the state's top-rated Division III team and promptly took 
a 9-0 first-quarter lead before the Mariners could get untracked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their kids have been here before, and they were a little more comfortable 
than we were at the start," Pacifica Coach Bob Becker said. "It was a first for 
us to be here so it took us a little while to get a grip." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacifica regrouped and led, 39-38, going into the fourth quarter when Vlasic 
hit a three-pointer and two more baskets to give the Mariners a 46-38 lead with 
5:35 remaining. La Canada closed the gap to 46-43 on Tim Ballard's three-point 
basket with 4:03 left. Pacifica's Ramon Alliman countered with a three-pointer 
at 3:36 remaining for a 49-43 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 La Canada suffered a major blow when leading scorer Eric Sanchez (18 points) 
fouled out with 1:41 remaining and his team trailing, 53-49. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the stretch, Vlasic hit two free throws, Dean Vargara scored with 22 
seconds remaining and Alliman scored on a slam with 13 seconds left for a 59-51 
lead. Alliman hit on all five of his field-goal attempts to contribute 13 
points. Pacifica shot 56% from the field. TOM BIRSCHBACH

SOUTHERN SECTION MASTERS WRESTLING MEET; FIFTY-NINE FROM COUNTY WILL SEEK STATE 
BERTHS TODAY 
</P>

<P>
 From league championships to Southern Section individual and team 
championships, to section dual team titles, to this. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the road leading to the State wrestling championships has been 
covered. But today's stop, the Masters meet, is the most critical part of the 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
 Masters competition, where the top eight finishers from each weight class 
advance to next week's State finals in Stockton, begins at 9:30 a.m. today at 
Fountain Valley High. Fifty-nine Orange County wrestlers will vie for State 
berths in this double-elimination tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The county qualified the most athletes in Division I (29). Recently crowned 
section team and section dual-team champion El Modena placed Juan Alvarez, Brad 
Carlson, Chris Jaime, Teak Sato and David Wells and two alternates in today's 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana, which finished third in the team competition, advanced Ronald 
Hernandez, Roger Santiago and Miguel Valencia and fourth-place San Clemente 
advanced Kevin Burgess, Aaron Greco and John Witting. Two wrestlers from 
Capistrano Valley, Edison, Mission Viejo, Savanna and Villa Park also earned 
berths. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight local wrestlers compete in Division II, including El Dorado twins Rob 
and Rich Harvey and Tom Noel. Los Alamitos qualified Marc Albert and Steve 
Trammel and Katella qualified Chris Marquez and Eric Schirmacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvary Chapel, with eight representatives in Division III, qualified more 
than any other team in any division. Only Division II Moreno Valley Canyon 
Springs and Hemet, which each had five wrestlers qualify, came close to the 
Eagles' output. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the other 22 Division III competitors from the county, Buena Park (Vince 
Virgin, Wali Sibrie), Irvine (Justin Meier, Steve Ruiz) and Woodbridge (Tim 
Lee, Jesse Ghotbi) advanced two wrestlers to Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 The county appears strongest in the 171-pound weight class, in which nine 
wrestlers will compete. There are six heavyweights participating and five each 
at 130, 135, 145 and 189 pounds. 
</P>
<P>

COLLEGE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; WAGNER RESCUES FULLERTON, DEFEATS SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Matt Wagner pitched 8 2/3 innings of one-hit relief, and Jeff Ferguson hit a 
two-run home run as Cal State Fullerton defeated San Diego, 6-4, in the first 
game of the Anaheim Hilton and Towers Baseball Classic Friday at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner (2-0) entered the game with one out in the first inning after Titan 
starter Dan Ricabal walked four batters and yielded three runs, two earned. 
</P>
<P>
 Wagner allowed only three batters to reach base and struck out six. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante Powell's seventh-inning single drove in Bret Hemphill with the winning 
run. The Titans (13-2) added an insurance run in the eighth when Jim Betzsold's 
bunt single drove in Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego led, 4-1, in the fourth inning, but Ferguson's two-run shot to left 
made the score 4-3. 
</P>
<P>

sacrificed to third by Craig Skyberg, and scored on shortstop Jack Jones' 
sacrifice fly.

SCC'S BORDERS GAINS VICTORY NO. 2; BASEBALL: FRESHMAN GETS INTO A COUPLE JAMS, 
BUT SHE GOES 6 2/3 INNINGS IN 10-1 VICTORY OVER CONCORDIA.

<P>
 Southern California College's Ila Borders, the first woman to pitch in a 
college baseball game, got into her first collegiate jam Friday at SCC. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders, struggling with her control in the third inning against Concordia, 
threw three consecutive balls to T.J. Wilcoxson with the bases loaded in a 
scoreless game. Each errant pitch intensified the volume of the razzing from 
the Concordia dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 Time for Borders to fold? 
</P>
<P>
 Not this time. After Borders ran the count to 3 and 2, Wilcoxson hit a soft 
liner up the middle that shortstop Jason Brissey fielded on one hop and threw 
to first for the out. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders got into trouble in several other innings and afterward she admitted 
her stuff was sub-par, but it was good enough to help the Vanguards win, 10-1, 
in a round-robin game of the SCC tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia (2-6) never was able to solve the SCC left-hander. Borders gave up 
three hits and an unearned run in 6 2/3 innings. She walked five, had a wild 
pitch and struck out one. 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia loaded the bases again in the fourth, this time with one out. But 
Borders got Chris Kindreich to ground to second -- SCC almost turned a double 
play -- scoring Concordia's run, and Alex Vicario grounded to Borders to end 
the half inning. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC (4-6), which beat Claremont-Mudd, 12-1, in Borders' first start Feb. 15, 
again gave the freshman from Whittier Christian High plenty of support. The 
Vanguards scored two in the third and two in the fourth, giving Borders a 5-1 
lead. They added two in the seventh and three in the eighth after Borders had 
been replaced by Brissey in the top of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 Augie Pena had three hits, including a two-run homer, and four runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more than 200 on hand for the game Friday was a camera crew from a 
Japanese television station.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE MEN'S BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; NATOYA HELPS FULLERTON ADVANCE

 Fullerton's Bobby Natoya had been expected to be one of the elite guards in 
Southern California this season. But because of injuries, he hasn't been in 
peak condition. 
</P>
<P>
 But Natoya, although slowed by a sore ankle, came off the bench to score a 
team-high 19 points and help Fullerton to a 92-81 victory over Bakersfield in 
the first round of the Southern California men's basketball playoffs Friday at 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Natoya, a sophomore, also was bothered early in the season by a sore back. 
</P>
<P>
 "His season seems like it has been on hold for most of the time," Fullerton 
Coach Roger See said before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Natoya made a trio of three-pointers in the first half to help Fullerton to a 
48-40 lead. But he and his teammates were more dangerous from the free-throw 
line late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield moved the ball inside to take advantage of Fullerton's foul 
trouble and pulled within three, 73-70, with five minutes 10 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Hornets made 16 of 20 free throws in the final four minutes 38 seconds 
to stay ahead. The Hornets (24-10) advanced to play at Los Angeles City 
Wednesday in the second round. L.A. City beat Oxnard, 102-77, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Natoya made five of six free throws, Eddie Cochran and Tamar Ross each made 
four of four in the late going for Fullerton. Cochran finished with 19 points 
and Ross 15. Tyrone Merriweather also had 18 for Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked tired (most of the game)," See said. "But in the last five or six 
minutes we seemed to find something extra." 
</P>
<P>
 The final five minutes of the first half and the early part of the second half 
saw the game get increasingly physical. Finally, with 12:12 left, a minor 
shoving match started and the officials took a timeout to let things calm down. 
</P>
<P>
 The game continued from there with no further incident. 
</P>
<P>
 In other playoff games: 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback 85, MiraCosta 65 -- Derrick Walsh scored 13 points in the first 
half and Eric Ambrozich and Antoine Jefferson added 12 each as the host Gauchos 
opened a 52-30 lead. Walsh finished with 19, Jefferson 18 and Ambrozich had 14. 
Tes Whitlock had 17 for Saddleback (22-8), which advanced to play host to Rio 
Hondo Wednesday in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Hondo (18-15) upset Cuesta, 68-64, Friday. Cuesta ended 22-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback has eliminated Rio Hondo from the playoffs the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Southwestern 99, Irvine Valley 81 -- The loss marked the second 
consecutive season Irvine Valley (18-15) has lost in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Southwestern (21-7) advanced to play at Long Beach in the second round 
Wednesday. Long Beach beat Mt. San Jacinto, 87-76, Friday.

 Coach: Bim Barry (fifth year). 
</P>
<P>
 1992-93: Third in Sea View League, 5-2 league dual-meet record. 
</P>
<P>
 Key returners: Ryan Adams, Jr., 800; Jay Berg-Hansen, Sr., SP-DT; Trent 
Bryson, Sr., 3200; Shahram Dezahd, Jr., 1600; Chris Edwards, Sr., 110 HH, 300

</P>
<P>
 Key newcomer: John Benzinger, Jr., HJ. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: A perennial throwing powerhouse, the Sailors will not disappoint this 
season. Throwing coach Tony Ciarelli's troops are led by Tift, a fourth-place 
finisher in last year's State meet and third in the National Scholastic meet 
(59-1 1/2). Gonzales, third in the shotput in league finals a year ago, has 
some impressive discus credentials with a seventh-place finish in last year's 
Orange County meet. Distance aces Bryson and Dezahd give the Sailors some power 
in the long races, and Ward and Adams will handle the middle distances. Edwards 
has run 15.5 in the high hurdles, and Berg-Hansen will provide backup in the 
throws. Obeji and Benzinger lead the Sailors' vertical jumpers.

 Outlook: The Aztecs have built a dynasty in the Empire League and are looking 
forward to winning their eighth consecutive title. A junior-dominated team, 
Britt said, "This could be a strong team as the season progresses." The Aztecs 
are led by Hector, who ran 38.0 seconds in the intermediate hurdles at the 
Masters Meet. The Aztecs' 400-relay team returns intact after running a 
county-best 42.51 last spring. But Tape is suffering from a hamstring and isn't 
expected back until the middle of March.

 1992-93: Sea View League champion, 7-0 league dual-meet record, third at the 
Orange County Championships.

 Outlook: The Warriors have one of the county's most experienced teams with a 
wealth of seniors leading the way. Young, who won titles at 100 (10.82) and 200 
(21.5 hand-timed) meters at the Orange County championships but missed the last 
part of the season because of injuries, is the county's leading returning 
sprinter. Muniz, who was the county's finest all-around jumper, is the 
defending Sea View League champion in the triple jump. Venook and Sherman are 
coming off stellar cross-country seasons to lead the 1600- and 3200-meter 
runners, and Rommalfanger assumes the 800-meter reins with a best of 1:58.

 Outlook: The comeback story of the track season last year took place at 
Mission Viejo. Gerule's squad finished the dual-meet season a disappointing 
2-3, but stormed back less than two weeks later to edge Capistrano Valley and 
Mater Dei to win the South Coast League finals. Morgan, a Times Orange County 
second-team selection in cross-country, finished second in the 1600 at the 
league finals a year ago. Galaviz is the league's leading returner in the 100- 
and 200-meter races. Spani won the frosh/soph league title in the throwing 
events a year ago, and Wolf will give the Diablos a legitimate 400-meter 
runner.

 1992-93: Empire League runner-up.

</P>
<P>
 Key newcomers: Wes Bunn Jr., Fr., LJ; Adolfo Cruz, Fr., 1,600-3,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlook: "This will be my biggest challenge ever," Turnbull said after taking 
over a Centurion program that has edged closer to Esperanza in the Empire 
League race. Turnbull will look to sprinters Hutsell and Cleave to handle track 
duties. Hutsell, one of the West Coast's fastest 400-meter runners, won the 
Empire League quarter mile (49.29) and was fourth (49.06) in the Southern 
Section Division II finals. Cleave finished as the league champion at 200 
meters (22.22) and was second at 100 meters. Becker is an all-around jumper 
(45-11 in the triple jump and 21-4 1/2 in the long jump) who might dabble in 
the high hurdles. Cruz, a miler in the low 4:30s as an eighth grader, will 
split time with the Cypress baseball team, and Bunn has enough athletic talent 
to start on the varsity basketball team as a freshman.

 Outlook: The Knights will try to make Whitaker's final season a memorable one, 
with the veteran coach retiring after a tour of duty that began at the school 
in 1969. Taub, one of the state's finest 400-meter runners, will also take on 
the 800 this season. Whitaker said Taub is ahead of Tad Heath, who ran a 
1:53.54 at 800 meters a year ago, at this point of the season. Bain was a 
section finalist in the pole vault with a best of 14-6, and Garcia was a Times 
Orange County first-team selection in the 110-meter high hurdles last year. 
Oliver is an all-around talent who will help the Knights in the relays, hurdles 
and jumps.

NEWPORT BEACH DEVELOPER GETS 29-TO-LIFE TERM; COURTS: IN SECOND TRIAL, 
PROSECUTORS CONVINCE JURY THAT JIM HOOD KILLED THE MAN HE HAD HIRED TO MURDER 
HIS WIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once a fixture in Orange County social circles, millionaire Newport Beach 
developer Jim Hood was denounced Friday as a threat to society and ordered to 
spend 29 years to life in prison for shooting a man authorities believe Hood 
hired to kill his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 In a case that involved greed, illicit sex and murder, Hood was convicted in 
December of first-degree murder for the March 22, 1992, shooting of Bruce E. 
Beauchamp, a former construction worker employed by Hood. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a jail jumpsuit, Hood, 50, sat silently during the hearing. His 
attorney said Hood was extremely remorseful. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor disagreed, describing the developer as a "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. 
Hyde." 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason he wishes this never happened is that he's now sitting here 
in orange," Deputy Dist. Atty. David Whitney told the judge. "He should get 
everything coming to him."  
</P>
<P>
 Throughout two trials, Hood protested his innocence and said he shot Beauchamp 
seven times in self defense. Beauchamp was the key suspect in the 
still-unsolved slaying of Hood's wife, Bonnie, who was shot to death in her 
Sierra Nevada lodge in Tulare County in August, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors believe Hood hired Beauchamp to kill his wife so he could collect 
on a $900,000 insurance policy, and then decided to silence the gunman. Bonnie 
Hood's lover, who was with her at the time of the fatal attack, also was shot, 
but survived, and later testified that Beauchamp was the gunman. A jury, 
however, acquitted Beauchamp. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are investigating Hood's possible role in his wife's slaying.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Hood's attorney, Philip C. Bourdette, asked that his client be 
allowed to remain free while appealing the conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Tempers flared during a bail hearing that followed sentencing, as the 
prosecutor strongly argued against releasing Hood from custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole motive in this case is to silence a witness," said Whitney, who 
also said witnesses in the case have already expressed fears that Hood would 
kill them if he is ever released. "He is a danger to society." 
</P>
<P>
 A first jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict last year and a new trial was 
ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the second trial proved more difficult for the prosecution 
because the judge barred Whitney from discussing Bonnie Hood's murder. As a 
result, the prosecution was forced to rely solely on evidence at the shooting 
scene, including blood splatters and palm prints. 
</P>
<P>
 Hood testified that Beauchamp was harassing and threatening him. He said he 
shot Beauchamp when the former employee stormed into his office and reached 
behind his back, as if for a weapon. Fearing for his life, he fired, Hood 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 But a key piece of evidence that swayed the jury was the discovery of a gun in 
Beauchamp's right hand -- seemingly supporting Hood's claim.  
</P>
<P>
 But Beauchamp was left-handed. The prosecutor accused Hood of planting the 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitney also found his job made easier during the second trial when Hood again 
took the stand and contradicted statements he made the first time around. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual move, jurors from the first trial were called to testify to the 
contradictions for the second jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The second jury deliberated four days before finding Hood guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 But even then, a last-minute tangle was needed before this drama could play 
itself out. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Bourdette earlier this year surprised the court by alleging 
that jury misconduct may have led to a wrongful conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 A private investigator hired by the defense team said she found jurors had 
improperly discussed the case during breaks and over lunch. The jurors even 
made less-than-polite comparisons between the two defense attorneys' legal 
styles and talked about how attractive Hood's 19-year-old daughter appeared 
when she testified.  
</P>
<P>
 Bourdette alleged that jurors improperly re-enacted the murder during 
deliberations and made up their minds about Hood's guilt before deliberating 
the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 But a juror who testified during a brief hearing Friday morning said the 
private investigator exaggerated his comments and said there was little 
substantive discussion about the evidence in the case prior to deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Michael A. Smith agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is misconduct, it is at best inadvertent and trifling," Smith said, 
rejecting Bourdette's request for a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Hood hung his head as he was led from the courtroom wearing a 
jail-issued uniform, his wrists and ankles shackled as he shuffled down the 
hallway on his way to a state penitentiary.

A THRONG BIDS FAREWELL; CRIME: SLAIN CAL STATE FULLERTON HONOR STUDENT CATHY 
TORREZ IS EULOGIZED AS 1,200 MOURNERS CROWD INTO HER FUNERAL RITES AT ST. 
JOSEPH CATHOLIC CHURCH IN PLACENTIA. 
</P>

<P>
 Slain Cal State Fullerton honor student Cathy Torrez was eulogized by her 
priest Friday as a "bright example of someone learning to be the human being 
she was created to be." 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,200 mourners crowded into St. Joseph Catholic Church to remember 
Torrez, 20, whose body was found stabbed and stuffed in the trunk of her car 
last weekend after she had been missing a week. The funeral was followed by a 
mile-long procession to Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in Orange, where Torrez was 
buried. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her disappearance and death has touched something in our hearts," Father 
Fergus Clarke told the mourners during the funeral mass. Many were students and 
teachers from Cal State Fullerton and Valencia High School, across the street 
from the church, where Torrez graduated in 1991 and had recently worked as a 
bilingual aide. She also worked as a checker at Sav-On Drug Store, the job she 
was coming home from when she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Placentia waited with you," Clarke said to Torrez's family. "We 
worried with you, prayed with you and prayed for you. . . . Her disappearance 
and death has brought us together as a city in a way we may have forgotten was 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The family wept quietly in the front row of the church, near Torrez's closed 
coffin, which was draped with a white cloth. At the head of coffin was a lit 
candle and a wooden cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez recently had been honored as one of Cal State Fullerton's top sociology 
students. A Placentia native, she had been attending the university's various 
workshops for promising women and Latino scholars since the eighth grade. She 
planned to be a social worker or a juvenile probation officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had a love for knowledge and excelled as a student," said the Rev. 
Nicholas Saucedo of the Placentia Nazarene Church, where some members of 
Torrez's family attend. "She loved her Mexican heritage and wanted to help her 
people. . . . God gave us a good person in Cathy Torrez." 
</P>
<P>
 Father David Baumann of the Episcopal Church of the Blessed Sacrament, who was 
a regular customer of Torrez's at Sav-On, read an open letter to Torrez's 
still-unknown killer, and pleaded with the attacker to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have robbed the world of a precious and gifted person and you denied her 
the possibility of serving the world in her chosen profession, of marriage and 
having children," Baumann said. "You shall live in fear, looking over your 
shoulder to see if you have been found out. . . . You should take courage and 
admit what you have done and submit to earthly judgment and heavenly 
forgiveness. By your act of violence you have destroyed only yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia police spokeswoman Corrine Loomis said Friday that six detectives 
continue to work full time on Torrez's killing and are investigating several 
leads. Because it is unlikely she would have stopped her car for a stranger, 
Police Chief Manuel Ortega has speculated her killer was likely an 
acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
 Torrez disappeared at 8 p.m. Feb. 12 after leaving from Sav-On, at Bradford 
Avenue and Yorba Linda Boulevard. Torrez, who had telephoned her mother minutes 
before and said she was coming straight home, was last seen turning south on 
Bradford Avenue in her burgundy Toyota Corolla. She lived one mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Her body was found inside the car last Saturday in the parking lot of 
Placentia Linda Community Hospital. The car had been parked there since at 
least Feb. 14, witnesses told police. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to speak to anyone who saw the vehicle or Cathy between Feb. 12 and" 
last Saturday, Loomis said. "Anyone who saw anything is urged to come forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Rewards now total $25,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction 
of her killer. Detectives can be reached at (714) 993-8164 or (714) 993-8146.

FIRE SWEEPS THROUGH BUSINESSES; DAMAGE: TWO STORES ARE DESTROYED IN BLAZE AT 
FULLERTON COMPLEX.

<P>
 A fire that began with an explosion in a commercial complex Friday destroyed 
two businesses and several vintage cars, caused about $500,000 in damage, and 
sent up black smoke that was visible for miles, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire began about 1:30 p.m. Friday after employees in the complex on Fender 
Avenue heard a loud bang. 
</P>
<P>
 Don O'Roark, who worked at Modular Display of California, said he heard "a 
percussion sound," and moments later the phone lines and electrical power shut 
down. Soon, bright orange flames and thick black smoke were everywhere, he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 About 50 firefighters from Fullerton, Orange County and Anaheim controlled the 
blaze in about an hour, said Fullerton spokeswoman Sylvia Palmer Mudrick. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured, but the fire destroyed two of the five businesses in the 
complex, an engraving shop and a car restorer. 
</P>
<P>
 Vic Kitchens, owner of Vic's Place, managed to rescue a 1940 Ford coupe worth 
about $50,000 by driving it out of the shop just after the fire began. But his 
Porsche, valued at approximately $25,000, and three other cars, including a 
1948 Willy's Delivery valued at $25,000 and another car he had been working on 
for three years, were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchens, who started the business 13 years ago, said he was in shock Friday 
afternoon. Nancy Collins of Flaherty Properties, another business in the long 
rectangular building, said firefighters helped her save her belongings in the 
early stages of the fire.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were terrific," she said. "The firemen came in and asked me what I 
needed" to save from the office, and they removed file cabinets and other 
possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 An insurance adjuster estimated that the fire caused about $500,000 in damage 
to the structure and contents. Fire officials are investigating its cause, 
Mudrick said.

AWARDS WILL HONOR EFFORTS BY AND FOR GAYS

<P>
 Lu King and Cov Davis have been affectionately called the "grandmas" of the 
gay community in Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 Both women are in their 60s, both have been married, and between them they 
have seven children and eight grandchildren. They also have been domestic 
partners for the last 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We break the stereotype of who typical homosexual people are," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 King and Davis are a team. They consider themselves activists and are 
dedicated to spending countless hours raising public awareness about gay 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The women are among the recipients of the first Take Pride Awards that will be 
given Sunday to individuals and organizations who made noteworthy contributions 
to the gay community last year, said Richard C. Grauman, chair of the Take 
Pride Awards committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony will begin at 2:30 p.m. at the Costa Mesa Neighborhood Community 
Center, 1845 Park Ave. A $7 donation is suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole point is to recognize people behind the scenes -- people not 
recognized before who may not be in the spotlight but who really do get the job 
done," Grauman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is sponsored by the Orange County Federation of Gay, Lesbian and HIV 
Organizations, comprising 39 gay support groups. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 12 award categories, including salutes to individuals as well as 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Grauman said the need to pay tribute to these unsung people who should "take 
pride" for their accomplishments was envisioned by Dennis Cabaret, a respected 
leader in the gay community who died in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dennis' idea was a good one because there was such an overall response that 
it was needed in the community," Grauman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cabaret, who died before he could see his idea come to fruition, will be 
remembered by having the Visionary Award named in his honor, Grauman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The award will be given to Grauman not only for his contributions as a 
volunteer but also for his vision for the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Grauman has organized a team of 80 Orange County athletes who will participate 
this summer in the Gay Games IV in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Another award recipient, Marti Schrank, who is heterosexual, is working to 
secure support for gays from members of her church, the Congregational Church 
of Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad that churches are supposed to be Christian and loving, but there are 
a lot of churches that if you're gay and lesbian, they don't want you there," 
said Schrank, 56, of Fullerton. "They'll shun you, and to me, that's despicable 
and it's very unchristian." 
</P>
<P>
 Schrank will receive the Bridge Builder Award for her efforts at closing the 
gap between the gay and heterosexual communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really humbled to receive this award," said the political and civil 
rights activist. 
</P>
<P>
 King and Davis, who live in Tustin, are among the five recipients of the 
Outstanding Volunteers of the Year awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Both said they are surprised but pleased at the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're grateful and we know there are a lot of people in the community who 
have done a lot more than we have," said King, 65, who is retired. 
</P>
<P>
 The two have volunteered much of their spare time, marching in gay parades and 
walking precincts for legislators who are supportive of gay issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel it's our God-given duty to work for what we feel is a human right 
that has been denied to a class of people through no fault of their own," said 
Davis, 63, a Superior Court clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 King added: "We are proud to be lesbians and we want to do everything (we can) 
to let people know." 
</P>
<P>
 Both are also longtime members of the Eleanor Roosevelt Democratic Club and 
founders of a gay ministry, the St. Aelred and Hildegard Society, at the Church 
of the Messiah in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel fully accepted within the church," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other honorees will be the Fountain Valley High School Student Alliance, 
the first gay student support group to meet on a high school campus in the 
county. The students will be given the Non-Federation Contribution Award. 
</P>
<P>
 The formation of the Student Alliance last fall resulted in controversy and 
protest from fellow students, parents and others opposed to the group meeting 
at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "What (the students) did is they broke down a lot of the stereotypes people 
had about the gay and lesbian community," Grauman said. "I think they brought a 
lot of important issues about gay youth to the forefront. . . . They have 
overwhelmingly educated the community at large." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Poff, a Fountain Valley High School teacher and the Student Alliance 
adviser, said the group, which has about 50 gay and heterosexual students, 
deserves the accolade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a wonderful award for the work they've put in and the growth 
they've experienced in the process of putting this all together," he said. 
"They are fine people, and it's nice they're getting recognition for it." Award

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; STEP CLOSER TO FULFILLING HIS DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With his feet covered in a pair of white socks boasting an American flag, 
Miguel Angel Chuc Ortiz eagerly hobbled inside a hospital room recently while 
waiting to undergo a magnetic resonance image scan. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-year-old Guatemalan was born with his right foot turned inward and back 
underneath his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel arrived in Orange County last week from his home in Samayac, 
Suchitepequez, about four hours from Guatemala City, for reconstructive surgery 
on his clubfoot. 
</P>
<P>
 To undergo the 45-minute MRI scan at the Irvine Medical Center, Miguel had to 
take off his black high-top sneakers, the only pair of shoes he can wear. 
</P>
<P>
 The imposing, high-tech, tube-shaped machine -- which produces photographic 
images of his foot to prepare him for surgery -- did not scare Miguel. 
</P>
<P>
 It would fulfill a dream, he said, to correct his foot so he can walk 
barefoot, run and play soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he wants his foot to be "pretty" -- to be normal, like his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking through a hospital translator, Miguel said: "I want my (foot) to be 
perfect. . . . I can't do what my friends do . . . run around and play soccer." 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel said he is grateful to be able to come here for surgery because "this 
country has the best doctors and technology." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Victor V. Cachia, a podiatric surgeon who spearheaded the youth's 
treatment here and will perform the three-hour reconstructive surgery Monday, 
said: "The goal is to make (Miguel's foot) straight, with the bottom of the 
foot flat on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Cachia and two other doctors, anesthesiologist Dr. Jay J. Rindenau and 
pediatrician Dr. Annu Sharma, are donating their services. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Medical Center is offering the use of the facility at no charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Nicholas C. Salvati, a San Clemente dentist, is also donating dental care. 
</P>
<P>
 Cachia said Miguel, who may need a second operation and will stay here for 
about three months, is unable to get the treatment he needs in his own country. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no access to health care," the doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna H. Groh, Irvine Medical Center vice president and chief operating 
officer, said it is not unusual for the hospital to support doctors who perform 
charitable work by donating the costs of treatment and care. 
</P>
<P>
 En El Inc., a charitable organization established by the bishop of the Roman 
Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, N.Y., paid Miguel's air fare, executive director 
Mary McNif said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, the organization sponsored a medical mission to treat the needy 
and poor in Solola, Guatemala. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors, which included Cachia and Rindenau, performed foot surgery on 
children and cataract surgery on adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a cowboy and a homemaker, Miguel, who is the youngest of seven 
children, was among the 90 children examined. He was found to have a minor 
infection in his foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't enough time to do the operation because of the infection," 
Cachia said. "The kid was devastated because he thought it was the only 
opportunity to have this deformity corrected." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cachia and Rindenau did not forget Miguel, who said he hopes to learn 
English while he is here and plans to go to college to make a better life for 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realized that if we don't operate now, the kid will never have a shot to 
walk normal," Rindenau said. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors believe the surgery will change Miguel's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "This young man has everything going for him, except he has an untreated 
deformity in his foot," Cachia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By fixing this, it will allow him to enter into adulthood as a normal young 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Miguel: "I don't know how to say thank you for what everybody is doing 
for me . . . for (making) my dream." DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; ANTI-GANG PROGRAM GEARED FOR PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A program to get parents involved in dissuading youths from joining gangs will 
start next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've found in our research that a gang prevention program or any kind of 
delinquency program is doomed unless we involve our parents," said Barbara 
Baiz, the city's gang prevention adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Baiz teaches a gang education program called Positive Avenues for Youth to 
fifth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is being expanded to give parents of "at-risk youths" support and 
information about preventing gang involvement, Baiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's critical that we provide parents with the information that empowers them 
to take control over their children," said Police Chief Richard M. Tefank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many parents who are dealing with at-risk kids or involved in dysfunctional 
families do not understand their rights and responsibilities. Through this type 
of program and support they would gain from other parents in similar 
situations, impacting the involvement of their children in gang or criminal 
activity." 
</P>
<P>
 Tefank said getting parents involved is only a part of the strategy to combat 
gang activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my experience, a lot of parents don't realize their children are 
involved in gang and criminal activity; they don't know how to control their 
children," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this a solution to the overall gang problem? No. Is it part of the 
solution? Absolutely. Not one thing is the solution to this problem. There are 
a variety of strategies to be undertaken. But this to me is a very important 
part of the strategy." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council this week voted to award a contract to Soledad Enrichment 
Action of Los Angeles to operate the program in Buena Park. It will consist of 
two-hour sessions each week for 20 weeks, beginning in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Soledad Enrichment Action will receive $6,000 for each 20-week session. Baiz 
said up to four of the series may be held this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the parent program will be paid with some of the money from a 
$90,000 grant the city received from the state Office of Criminal Justice 
Planning for gang prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents selected to participate will be identified and referred through school 
officials, law enforcement agencies and probation departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Baiz said topics to be covered include: understanding the judicial system; how 
to manage anger, conflict and confrontation; styles of parenting; and a 
parent's role in intervention as it relates to alcohol, drugs and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "To win back our streets, it's important to reconstruct those families, and it 
will provide long-term benefits for the community," Baiz said. DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 'RAINBOW MAN' GETS ANOTHER 5-YEAR TERM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rollen Frederick Stewart, who amused sports fans nationwide with his 
rainbow-hued wig and religious placards at televised sports events, was 
sentenced Friday to five years in state prison for setting off four stink bombs 
around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge John J. Ryan gave Stewart the maximum 
sentence possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart already is serving a life sentence for taking hostages at a Los 
Angeles hotel in September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 He will not be eligible for parole until at least 2002, Deputy Dist. Atty. M. 
Marc Kelly said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facts indicate that this man would not let any crime get in the way of 
getting his message out," Kelly said. "The reason we brought this to trial is 
that we felt he deserved to be punished and the public of Orange County 
deserved to have him put away for as long as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, 46, was found guilty on Jan. 26 of setting off homemade acid bombs on 
Easter weekend, 1991, at the Crystal Cathedral, the Orange County Register, the 
Trinity Broadcasting Network and a religious bookstore in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 He testified that his actions were intended to focus attention on the second 
coming of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 During a jail interview, Stewart told a county probation officer that he 
believed Orange County had "backslidden" on religious issues. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the Lord had spoken to him in 1991 through the Bible, telling him 
he would have a negative experience and that the world was at the "end of an 
age," according to a pre-sentencing report. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the late 1970s, the rainbow-wigged Washington native had popped up on 
television time and again at sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he created the "Rainbow Man" character as a way of getting into the 
Screen Actors Guild. 
</P>
<P>
 When that dream fizzled, he was baptized a born-again Christian in Israel in 
1980 and continued to make sports events appearances, this time carrying signs 
with religious messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart, who has been married four times, put together stink bombs using a 
timing device, a knife and an acid-filled balloon. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart left one of the acid bombs inside the Crystal Cathedral in Garden 
Grove during a packed Good Friday service on March 29, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 He also placed one in the Santa Ana lobby of the Orange County Register 
newspaper on April 2, 1991, and another in a studio audience at the Trinity 
Broadcasting Network in Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen audience members had to be taken to the hospital for nausea and 
difficult breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart told a probation officer he has begun a religious ministry for his 
fellow prisoners. LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; FIRE SERVICE MERGER ANALYSIS DUE IN MAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An analysis of the proposed merger of the city Fire Department with the county 
Fire Department may be completed by May 1, city officials learned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council, looking for potential cost savings, voted 5 to 0 last month 
to seek the report from the Orange County Fire Department, which serves 16 
cities, including much of South County.The city is paying $15,000 for the 
study. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's worth some money to find out if you can save a lot of money," Interim 
Fire Chief Gene Begnell said. "I don't believe there is a lot of money to save 
here, but the analysis will tell." 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-member city department, which includes animal control and emergency 
planning, has an annual operating budget of about $3.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed merger has not raised the public outcry that accompanied talks 
last year ultimately resulting in a merger between the city Police Department 
and Orange County Sheriff's Department. But Mayor Scott Diehl said he's sure 
members of the Fire Department are somewhat nervous about this process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they understand the council has made a lot of tough decisions," Diehl 
said. "But there certainly wasn't any rancor there." 
</P>
<P>
 The merging of police services is expected to save about $2.1 million this 
fiscal year.ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; FIRE SAFETY STRESSED IN REVISED CODES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to change city building codes so new homes will be more fire 
resistant will be presented to the City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft ordinance, crafted by a task force formed after the October fire, 
has been revised to assuage the fears of Canyon Acres residents who worried 
that their community would lose its rustic ambience as homes were rebuilt, 
building official John Gustafson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in Canyon Acres were really emotional about keeping wood fencing 
and wood decking," he said. "I think we've written this proposal now in such a 
way that you can do basically anything as long as you're willing to pay the 
additional price for these fire-retardant treatments." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is proposing that wood shake and shingle roofs, previously banned in 
fire hazard areas, be permitted if they are properly treated. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Jay Grant, who lost four Canyon Acres houses and two studios in the 
blaze, said he objects to the restrictions because they would "dramatically 
increase" the cost of rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I am being penalized for a fire I had nothing to do with," Grant said 
Friday, adding that he and other property owners will protest the measure at 
Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 If they are unable to afford the permitted materials, Grant said property 
owners would be forced to choose the less expensive option, altering the 
community's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to rebuild little concrete boxes or stucco boxes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed changes were scrutinized by the Laguna Beach Planning Commission 
on Wednesday. While the commission made no changes, members also expressed 
concerns about whether the required materials would be too expensive or 
unnatural looking. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners were scheduled to meet today with members of the city's Design 
Review Board to discuss the proposed changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Also as part of the proposal, the city would be divided into two fire-hazard 
zones, with the tightest restrictions targeting homes that abut the wild-land 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant also objected to that idea. He said it would affect his ability to get 
insurance if Canyon Acres is classified as a "high-risk" area. 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier proposal would have prohibited wood framing in the most hazardous 
zones, while the reworked version allows it, provided the builder follows 
strict guidelines regarding the types of materials that can be used, Gustafson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the wood would have to meet minimum size requirements as well as 
being specially treated and tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could probably have almost anything you want if you're willing to pay for 
that (fire-retardant) process," Gustafson said. "It can be expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are being proposed in the form of an urgency ordinance, which 
means they would become effective immediately. The new laws will apply to 
construction throughout the city, excluding structures west of Coast 
Highway.LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; SENIORS CELEBRATE CHINESE NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On most Fridays, noontime visitors to the Irvine Senior Center dine on roasted 
chicken or turkey sandwiches and take part in activities ranging from exercise 
classes to health lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 But this Friday was different. 
</P>
<P>
 The air of the center was scented with peanut oil and the menu included spring 
rolls, fried rice and crispy noodles. Chinese art decorated the walls and folk 
music played softly in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all part of the seventh annual Chinese New Year Celebration, one of the 
most anticipated events at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 seniors from around Irvine were treated to an afternoon of food, 
entertainment and cultural understanding provided by the Irvine Evergreen 
Chinese Senior Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone looks forward to it," said Rose Margarita of Irvine, one of the 
guests. "This is such a nice change. It's very generous of them to do this." 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which commemorated the Year of the Dog, included dancing, live 
Chinese folk music and a New Year's cake. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with a "Good Luck Money" ceremony in which each guest was presented 
with a colorful envelope containing a silver dollar and a note wishing everyone 
good health. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Evergreen Chinese Senior Assn. has more than 300 members who meet 
regularly at the senior center. 
</P>
<P>
 Throwing the celebration is a way for club members to interact with 
non-Chinese seniors and share their culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to cross cultural barriers," said Susie Chu, president of the 
association. "Most of our (members) don't speak English. So they communicate 
through food, song and dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Evergreen members moved to California from Taiwan and other parts of Asia 
over the last few years to be closer to their children who work in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Year's celebration gives them a chance to assimilate with their new 
neighbors, Chu said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't have to talk. They can smile, and laugh and hug," she said. "All 
the seniors have a common bond." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the luncheon guests agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They make us feel so comfortable," said senior citizen Mae DelGiazo of 
Irvine. "I love to be here." SHELBY GRAD

 In her native Pampanga in the Philippines, a tostada is a crunchy piece of 
bread intentionally left in the oven long enough to be slightly burned. 
</P>
<P>
 So 13-year-old Josielyn Salenga was surprised when the Mexican tostada at her 
seventh-grade booth came with beans, shredded lettuce, cheese, tomatoes and 
salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 But her joy of finding something new and different was exactly the idea behind 
the international fair Friday at A.G. Currie Middle School that featured a 
variety of exotic foods from many nations. 
</P>
<P>
 While rap music and Latin dance tunes blared on a portable stereo system, 
students sampled pizza, Danish and German pastries, Mexican tacos and tostadas, 
American and French cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-grade classmates Hsing Liang, Tony Artiega and Fabian Lopez loved the 
Chinese fried rice prepared by the mother of Esther Kim, who is of Korean 
descent. Laura Pena said the pizza was great and True Tran felt bad she got 
only a couple of tacos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good way to get away from your food at home," said Berdine Figueras, 
who is from the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1,010 students, A.G. Currie is one of the most ethnically diverse schools 
in the Tustin school district, according to Principal Dan Brooks. Forty percent 
of the student population is white, 35% Latino, 10% Asian, 9% African American 
and 4% Filipino. The rest are from different ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cultural diversity is stressed in all subjects," Brooks said. "Even in home 
economics, we teach students what people have to do to work together and live 
harmoniously." 
</P>
<P>
 The international fair was started as an annual event four years ago and has 
grown bigger over the years, said Patricia Lee, who coordinates the events. 
</P>
<P>
 Each class and each campus organization has either a food booth or a game 
booth that allows them to raise money for field trips and classroom materials, 
Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great way to have fun and meet new friends," said Alison Moody, an 
eighth-grade cheerleader. "You meet people different from you. In the real 
world, it's going to be like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Funie Hsu, president of the Language Club, said that the fair somehow helps 
students understand the culture of other people. 
</P>
<P>
 "People make fun of us sometimes," said Funie, who came from Taiwan when she 
was 2 years old. But through the Language Club, which has about 60 members, "we 
try to teach them what we are about," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Chinese New Year celebration this month, Funie said that students 
complimented her when she and her friends performed a dragon dance at a school 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Josielyn said she has not had a chance to show off her mother's Filipino 
cooking just yet, but she's comfortable at school already. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel OK. It's nice here," she said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; SCHOOLS SET UP FUND FOR AIR CONDITIONING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents made some progress this week in their effort to buy air-conditioning 
units for their children's elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton School District board on Tuesday tentatively agreed to establish 
a foundation that will accept donations for the units. 
</P>
<P>
 The board agreed to revise an earlier decision prohibiting parents from 
raising money for air conditioning after more than 70 angry parents, some with 
their children in their arms, protested at Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Feb. 8 school board meeting, board members Robert C. Fisler, Elena 
Reyes-Jones and Rosamaria Gomez-Amaro said they were concerned that donations 
for air conditioners for particular schools would create an unequal situation. 
</P>
<P>
 They said some students would enjoy cool temperatures while others, in poorer 
areas, would continue to wilt in classrooms that can reach 102 degrees during 
the warm months. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents at three schools, Acacia Elementary, Laguna Road Elementary and 
Pacific Drive Elementary have been trying to raise money for air conditioning 
for the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to parents, the board told Superintendent Duncan Johnson to 
develop a plan for a foundation that will accept donations for air conditioners 
intended for particular schools, as well as unrestricted donations that can be 
used for any school. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation is a way to ensure that some effort is made to provide air 
conditioning to all of the district's approximately 11,000 schoolchildren, 
Reyes-Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has traditionally accepted gifts such as computers, science kits, 
speaker systems and books intended for particular schools. However, officials 
say the district needs to clarify its policy on other gifts that alter a 
building, such as air conditioners, windows, carpets and roof repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes-Jones said that the board will probably be ready to take a vote on its 
policy within a month.

 The streets of Fashion Island will be crowded with 5,000 runners and walkers 
Sunday in support of local schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday is the 11th annual Spirit Run to raise money for Andersen, Harbor View 
and Lincoln elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "This started out as just a little race among the three elementary schools 
over there," said Deborah Karl, a race volunteer and organizer. "It has grown 
to where we are attracting big-name racers." 
</P>
<P>
 Karl said participants run or walk, some with babies in strollers or with 
dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's race raised $75,000 for the three elementary schools. Karl said 
the money is used throughout the school year to help pay for various projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-kilometer race is scheduled to start at 7:30 a.m. in front of the 
Edwards Theater in Fashion Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants can pay $16 to register for the race on Sunday morning before it 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
 After the event is over, there will be a Spirit Day festival with clowns, 
musicians and food.BOB ELSTON

<P>
 A Costa Mesa man was killed early Friday morning when the truck he was driving 
slammed into a tree, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Alan Carter, 39, was headed south in a pickup truck on Harbor 
Boulevard about 1 a.m., traveling at more than 60 miles an hour, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Harbor Boulevard and South Coast Drive, his car straddled a center divider 
for about 200 feet before hitting a 30-foot-tall pine tree head-on, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter died instantly from blunt force trauma to the upper torso, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter was not wearing a seat belt, and according to a police report, it 
appeared that alcohol was present in the car. An autopsy will determine whether 
he was driving under the influence of alcohol, police said.ELAINE TASSY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; HOUSE FIRE SETS OFF STORED AMMUNITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire that engulfed a home Friday set off an unknown amount of ammunition 
that was stored somewhere in the house, firefighters said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ammunition began going off shortly after firefighters arrived at the home 
of Tom and Maxine Long in the 2400 block of East Clifpark Way, Fire Division 
Chief Rudy Weyland said. By then, the entire house was ablaze, so pinpointing 
where the ammunition was stored was impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters also were hampered by a lack of information about the type of 
ammunition and how much of it was kept in the house. Tom Long is a gun 
collector, fire officials said, but he is in the hospital for an unrelated 
matter and Maxine Long "didn't know how much or what kind" of ammunition was in 
the house or where it was stored, Weyland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of live ammunition forced firefighters to move cautiously. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to wait until one area cools down before going in," Weyland said. 
"You only go tentatively into areas that you feel sure of." 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers at the scene warned residents and onlookers of the danger from 
flying bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although one neighbor reported finding a brass bullet casing several houses 
down the street from the fire, there were no injuries or damage reported from 
the ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Henderson, who saw the flames from a nearby street and drove over to 
check on a friend's house, said he heard what sounded like hundreds of 
firecrackers shortly after he pulled up to the house. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a minute or so after I got here when I heard about 100 rounds go 
off," Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson had just grabbed a hose to water down the roof of the house closest 
to the fiery garage when the explosions began. 
</P>
<P>
 "I jumped around the corner," Henderson said. "You could hear the bullets 
ricochet off the walls" inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire began in the garage, but the cause is not yet known. DANIELLE A.

SUPERVISORIAL HOPEFULS FOCUS ON IMMIGRATION; POLITICS: FIRST DEBATE ALSO 
STRESSES CRIME, WELFARE, JAIL CROWDING. TWO OF THE THREE CANDIDATES SUPPORT 
AIRPORT AT EL TORO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFF BOUCHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In their first debate, the three candidates vying for Supervisor Harriett M. 
Wieder's seat on Friday agreed on priorities -- each listed crime, illegal 
immigration and welfare reform. But they split on political hot potatoes such 
as jail construction and the conversion of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station to 
civilian use. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates -- Huntington Beach City Council members Linda 
Moulton-Patterson and Jim Silva and businesswoman Haydee V. Tillotson -- spoke 
before about 120 people gathered at an Orange County Public Affairs Assn. 
luncheon at the Irvine Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillotson called El Toro "a godsend opportunity to the economy of Orange 
County," and said an airport on the site would provide jobs and commerce that 
would benefit the whole county. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva echoed that sentiment, saying an airport is necessary now that Orange 
County is "no longer a little brother to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton-Patterson, the mayor of Huntington Beach, said it is too early to take 
a stand on El Toro. Instead, she said, her goal as supervisor would be to lead 
a strong exploration of all options. "The most important thing is the county 
have a leadership role," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton-Patterson drew some groans from the audience when she also took an 
unclear stance on the issue of building a satellite jail in the 2nd District, 
which includes Huntington Beach, Garden Grove and Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to hedge, but we don't really have the money to do it anyway." 
She said only that she would review any jail proposal, including contracting 
service with jails in other counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, a teacher and businessman, said he would support a jail in the district 
if a proper site could be found. Tillotson endorsed expanding the county's 
existing jails to handle more inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The three Huntington Beach residents cited cracking down on illegal 
immigration as a priority, citing what they called a drain on social services 
and government budgets. Each mentioned deporting illegal immigrants and curbing 
their access to government programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton-Patterson also said she would push for a two-year limit on welfare 
benefits to all able-bodied residents, and try to create a tamper-proof 
identification card that would be required to register for welfare programs. 
</P>
<P>
 On the crime issue, Tillotson, who was recruited by Wieder, said she would 
make a priority of getting longer jail sentences for "hard-core criminals," and 
try to find ways to have police officers spend less time doing paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva noted that the board has no authority over law enforcement or court 
sentences, but he said his record in Huntington Beach politics shows his 
support of a hard stance on crime. He said he would work to ease inmate 
crowding by deporting illegal immigrants in county jails. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder, who will retire after her current term, watched from the audience and 
said afterward that the candidates dwelled on issues -- such as immigration and 
welfare -- that are beyond the direct control of the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can take a leadership role on those issues, but I think it may also show 
that some of them have a lack of knowledge about the job," Wieder said. She 
added that she was surprised there was not more attention to the future of the 
fragile Bolsa Chica wetlands or health care issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they might not recognize what the issues are that people think are 
significant," the 16-year veteran of the board said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven E. Malone, a fourth candidate who entered the race last week, attended 
but did not participate in the debate. Malone was chief of staff to longtime 
Supervisor Don R. Roth until Roth resigned last year after pleading guilty to 
state ethics violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told that the program had been set and time limitations prevented me 
from joining the panel," Malone said. "I'm not satisfied, and I hope there will 
be another chance for me to debate these issues with (the other candidates) 
sometime soon."

MAN GETS LIFE WITHOUT PAROLE FOR GIRLFRIEND'S BEATING DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A kick boxer from Orange who tied up his girlfriend with duct tape, repeatedly 
sexually assaulted her and then bludgeoned her to death with a hammer was 
sentenced Friday to life in prison with no possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to tearful testimony from the victim's family and friends, 
Orange County Superior Court Judge David O. Carter upheld a jury's 
recommendation that Shaleke S. Nasir spend the rest of his life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, jurors found Nasir guilty of first-degree murder, robbery and 
attempted rape in the August, 1991, death of Lena M. Forbes, 21, of Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury's decision to recommend a life sentence, instead of the death 
penalty, surprised many, including the defense team. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have credited Nasir's mother, Fowzia, for saving her son's 
life with compelling testimony last month in which she told jurors that no 
matter what their decision, they could not break the bond between mother and 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the victim's mother, Linda Forbes, had her turn to speak. Sobbing 
and shaking before the judge, she said, "Words alone can't even describe the 
devastating trauma of losing a child. To hear the words, 'Your daughter has 
been murdered,' destroyed our world." 
</P>
<P>
 "My nightmare doesn't stop," Forbes said, "My thoughts go on to visualize how 
this parasite bound her hands and mouth with duct tape. Beat her, raped her 
violently. . . . My God, this is not a person from the human race." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Chuck Middleton told the judge that he sought the death penalty 
because of the vicious nature of Nasir's crime. "The day Mr. Nasir dies in 
jail, society will benefit," Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter told Nasir that "the violence in this case is absolutely beyond 
comprehension" and that he would have imposed the death penalty had the jury 
recommended it. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point before sentencing, defense attorney Milton Grimes appealed to the 
judge to leave open the possibility of parole, but Carter rejected the motion. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Grimes said he believes Nasir is remorseful for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has not demonstrated a callous, unrehabilitative character. He's 
religious. I believe he can be rehabilitated and become a productive member of 
society," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, Linda Forbes, surrounded by her two daughters and a group 
of friends, said she will try to rebuild her life.

2 GET 264-DAY TERMS FOR LA HABRA DEATH; COURT: THE WOMEN ARE SET FREE BECAUSE 
THEY HAD BEEN JAILED SINCE SEPTEMBER. WIDOWER CALLS SENTENCES FOR PARKING LOT 
ALTERCATION LENIENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A Whittier woman and a La Habra teen-ager were sentenced on Friday in Orange 
County Superior Court to 264 days in jail for their roles in the death of a 
woman who suffered a heart attack during a fistfight stemming from a traffic 
dispute at a La Habra shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the two defendants -- Rebecca Luker, 22, and Sara Ward, 18 -- have 
been in county jail since their arrest in September and have already served 
more than two-thirds of their sentences, both were set free. 
</P>
<P>
 Luker and Ward pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter last month in the 
death of Tina Roxanne Rodriguez, 26, who died after the September altercation. 
</P>
<P>
 They faced a maximum of three years in prison. But Superior Court Judge Robert 
F. Fitzgerald, saying he believed both women were remorseful, sentenced each to 
three years' probation, 264 days in jail and $500 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 2, Luker and Ward were passengers in a car driven by John Richard 
Collins, 25, of El Monte that nearly collided with another car pulling out of a 
parking place at a shopping center near the intersection of La Habra and Beach 
boulevards, according to La Habra police. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, a passenger in the other car, got out and began yelling at Collins. 
Ward and Luker stepped out to confront Rodriguez. After more shouting, Luker 
and Ward began punching Rodriguez, a mother of four, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez fell to the ground unconscious and died from a heart attack. Luker 
and Ward returned to Collins' car and fled the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the coroner's office, Rodriguez suffered from a thyroid condition 
called Graves' disease, was susceptible to heart failure and went into cardiac 
arrest caused by the stress of the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, investigators believed the incident was racially motivated because 
some witnesses said Luker and Ward, who are white, shouted racist remarks at 
Rodriguez, who was black. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing lack of evidence, prosecutor Lewis R. Rosenblum dropped charges that 
they committed a hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Luker's defense attorney was pleased with the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the sentencing was appropriate, given what actually happened," said 
attorney Robert M. Hartmann. "It is clear that Ms. Rodriguez precipitated the 
fight. . . . It's clear that she passed away because of her medical condition." 
</P>
<P>
 Sara Ward's father, Darrel Ward, said, "I think it's an unfortunate incident 
that basically should never have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Before sentencing, the victim's husband, George Rodriguez, told the judge that 
his wife "was taking her medication and getting better. She was never violent 
or anything like that. I'm going through really hard times right now with our 
four kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Rosenblum told the judge that he was troubled by the defendants' 
courtroom behavior throughout the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've noticed these defendants were many times laughing and joking, and even 
flirting. . . . I sincerely wonder if their motivation in pleading guilty was 
to get the best deal," Rosenblum said. 
</P>
<P>
 After sentencing, George Rodriguez complained the sentence was too lenient. "I 
don't think it's right because they killed my wife. Even if she was sick, if 
they didn't beat her up, she wouldn't be dead." 
</P>
<P>
 At a previous court hearing, Collins pleaded guilty to being an accessory to a 
felony and receiving stolen property. The car he was driving at the time was 
stolen. Collins was sentenced to 16 months in state prison.

NAACP, SANTA ANA RECOGNIZE BLACK LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NAACP and the city of Santa Ana honored nine members of Orange County's 
African American community Friday night for their contributions in education, 
sports and other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The African-American Citizen of Distinction Awards, now in their fourth year, 
are designed to recognize community contributions that organizers say are often 
overlooked in the mainstream media. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiving awards Friday were the Rev. Samuel Craig Jr., a former Marine who 
helped found the original Black History parade in Santa Ana and an assistant 
pastor at the Second Baptist Church in Santa Ana; Thomas Harmon, a student at 
Century High School in Santa Ana who was honored for his work both in the 
classroom and in athletics; and Aaron L. Lovejoy, a Santa Ana businessman who 
has been active in minority economic development issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Also honored were Judy Sampson, an outreach consultant at McFadden 
Intermediate School; Johnny L. Williams, an assistant principal at Santa Ana 
Valley High School; and Tiger Woods, a Western High School senior who golfs on 
the national circuit and was recognized at the awards ceremony as a "future 
leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Honored posthumously was Josephine E. Lewis, a mother of four who died last 
August at the age of 48 after serving in many leadership positions with the 
NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 Two organizations that also received awards were Interested Citizens Group of

DECISION DELAYED ON RETURNING CHILD TO FOSTER HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Juvenile Court referee on Friday postponed a decision on 
where to place 4-year-old Taj Jayyusi, who police say was abducted from his 
foster home by his biological parents Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Following a one-hour hearing to consider whether Jayyusi should remain in 
protective custody at Orangewood Children's Home or be returned to his foster 
mother, Juvenile Court Referee Gary L. Vincent ordered attorneys to return to 
court Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Taj's foster mother, Susan White, would not comment on the proceedings other 
than to say, "I'm holding up pretty well, but I'm running out of court 
clothes." The hearing, originally scheduled for Thursday, was postponed until 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 White had begun proceedings to adopt the boy at the time that his biological 
parents, Yaser and Deborah Ann Jayyusi, allegedly snatched him from White's 
Rancho Santa Margarita home. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were arrested in Cerritos Feb. 18 as Yaser Jayyusi tried to pick up 
his paycheck. The boy was with them at the time of their arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parents are now being held at County Jail on suspicion of child 
abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Child Protective Services officials have said that Taj is being kept at 
Orangewood to prevent any future abduction attempts that might occur if other 
people involved in the original abduction are still at large. Officials would 
not comment Friday on Taj's whereabouts.

PARENTS OF SLAIN WOMAN SUE HER LOVER; COURTS: BUSINESSMAN SHOULD HAVE 
ANTICIPATED HIS WIFE'S POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST HIS MISTRESS AND THE 
BABY, THEY ASSERT.

<P>
 The parents of a 25-year-old Chinese woman who was slain along with her baby 
son in Mission Viejo last summer have filed suit against her married lover, 
claiming he should have known their relationship would lead to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhuo Chuan Ji and Xiang Lan Liu of Qindao, China, filed a wrongful death 
lawsuit in federal court Feb. 16 seeking $2 million in punitive damages from 
Tseng Jyi (Jim) Peng, 51, a wealthy Taiwanese businessman who was having an 
extramarital affair with their daughter when she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Peng's wife, Li Yuan (Lisa) Peng, who was also named in the lawsuit, has been 
charged with the grisly Aug. 17 slayings of Ranbing (Jennifer) Ji and 
5-month-old Kevin Ji at their apartment near Lake Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Peng pleaded innocent to the slayings and is being held without bail in 
County Jail. On Friday, a preliminary hearing was set for April 15 in Municipal 
Court in Laguna Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 The slayings ended an affair that lasted more than two years between Jim Peng 
and Jennifer Ji, his former executive secretary. It began in China, and 
continued when she moved to Mission Viejo in August, 1992. Kevin Ji was born 
last March at Saddleback Memorial Medical Center in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed in U. S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleges that Jim 
Peng should have known of the potential for violence "created by his infidelity 
to his spouse and family." Jim and Lisa Peng have been married for 21 years and 
have two sons, aged 16 and 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also alleges that Peng knew his wife had learned of the affair and 
that she had threatened Ji. Peng was negligent in financing Ji's lifestyle, 
putting her up in an apartment close to his Rancho Santa Margarita home and not 
providing her with adequate security, said Shin P. Yang, a San Gabriel-based 
attorney for the Ji family. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a number of encounters" between Ji and Lisa Peng, Yang said. "It's 
not confirmed how many. We know they met at least once." 
</P>
<P>
 In court for a hearing on his wife's criminal case Friday, Peng declined to 
comment other than to say he considered the lawsuit without merit and a 
publicity stunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Peng is chief executive officer of Ranger Communications, one of the 
world's largest manufacturers of citizens-band radios. He discovered the bodies 
of Jennifer and Kevin Ji Aug. 18, when he returned from a business trip to 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Ji was slumped over a living room couch and had been stabbed at least 
18 times. The baby had been suffocated in his crib in a bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no weapon has been found, Sheriff's Department investigators arrested 
Lisa Peng five months later based on what they consider a crucial piece of 
evidence -- a DNA sample from a bite mark on Jennifer Ji's left arm -- that 
directly links her to the slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also said two buttons apparently belonging to Lisa Peng were found 
in the apartment.

WOMEN SING BLUE-COLLAR BLUES; MALES STILL DOMINATE IN THE CRAFT AND INDUSTRIAL 
RANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Patricia Doler left a job as a fitness center manager in 1986 to become a 
firefighter, attracted by the pay, benefits and opportunity "to make a 
difference" in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 And although she was a pioneer -- only the second female firefighter in the 
Santa Clara County Fire Department -- she figured that plenty of other women 
would follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need people of all shapes and sizes to go into places like attics, 
collapsed tunnels and other confined spaces, and that's one of the things that 
women bring," Doler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, women remain a rarity among the ranks of on-the-line 
firefighters and in many other bastions of high-paying blue-collar employment. 
Even as women make substantial advances in professions such as accounting, law 
and medicine, their inroads have been limited in the production, construction 
and public safety jobs traditionally dominated by men. 
</P>
<P>
 "College-educated women have really broken through in a number of fields that 
had been male preserves just a generation ago. But the non-traditional jobs 
that haven't budged are those blue-collar craft and industrial jobs," said 
Karen Nussbaum, director of the Labor Department's women's bureau and former 
executive director of 9 to 5, the National Assn. of Working Women. 
</P>
<P>
 Nussbaum cited estimates that while roughly half of law school students and a 
quarter of medical school students are women, fewer than 9% of the jobs in the 
skilled trades are held by women. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, women's advocates have begun paying more attention to the 
blue-collar workplace. The entry of women into "non-traditional jobs" has been 
one focus of the California AFL-CIO's three-day "Women in the Work Force" 
conference in Los Angeles, which ends today.  
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the Labor Department's Glass Ceiling Commission has expanded from 
its initial focus on workplace barriers faced by women and minorities in 
management. The commission is now exploring the plight of women and minorities 
"whose feet are stuck in the mud" because they can't find good blue-collar 
jobs, said the panel's executive director, Joyce D. Miller. The study group is 
due to deliver its recommendations on breaking down employment barriers to 
Congress next January.  
</P>
<P>
 The reasons why women have garnered so few high-paying blue-collar jobs go far 
beyond overt discrimination. High-paying blue-collar employment in general has 
suffered in recent years as manufacturers, local governments and other 
employers have slashed their payrolls to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 Women also may be deterred by hostile working environments in traditionally 
male industries. A 1992 survey of women working in the skilled trades in 
Chicago found that 83% encountered unwelcome sexual remarks on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 And not all women are as upbeat as Doler about the prospects for women 
breaking into the ranks of firefighters and other physically demanding jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a lot of women who can pass the agility tests and not that many 
who are even interested," said Cindy Fralick, who became the first woman 
firefighter in the Los Angeles County Fire Department 11 years ago and was one 
of the speakers at the California AFL-CIO conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Doler, 36, who once was a nationally ranked women's weightlifter, found 
she had to adapt her own techniques to perform such physically demanding tasks 
as setting up tall ladders, opening fire hydrants and pulling out fire hoses. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet a key point, Doler says, is that there are alternate techniques for 
performing physically demanding jobs. The problem, she says, is that training 
programs too often are aimed only at big men -- everyone else is left to his or 
her own devices to figure out a proper technique. 
</P>
<P>
 Doler, union officials and others attending the conference are calling for 
improved training and more aggressive recruiting to overcome deep-seated 
cultural attitudes that keep women out of traditionally male jobs. Otherwise, 
they say, women will continue to be locked into low-paying jobs in retailing 
and other service fields. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a matter of basic fairness and of being able to earn a better living, 
Nussbaum said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be a million new jobs created in construction over the next 10 
years, and women should have a fair share of them," she said. Discrimination's 
Many Forms 
</P>
<P>
 Overt discrimination, more subtle forms of resistance and concerns about 
sexual harassment have played major roles in keeping women from moving into 
high-paying blue-collar fields. Chicago Women in Trades, an advocacy and 
support group for women in blue-collar jobs, polled its members in 1992 about 
their problems on the job. The percentages below reflect replies from the 182 
members of the group who responded. 
</P>
<P>
 * 88% reported pictures of naked or partially dressed women in the workplace 
</P>
<P>
 * 83%: unwelcome sexual remarks 
</P>
<P>
 * 57%: being touched or asked for sex 
</P>
<P>
 * 36%: remarks about being a lesbian 
</P>
<P>
 * 80%: no toilets or dirty toilets 
</P>
<P>
 * 60%: being given the heaviest or dirtiest assignments 
</P>
<P>
 * 54%: not being given proper training 
</P>
<P>
 * 49%: remarks about race or ethnicity 
</P>
<P>
 * 44%: unfair layoff practices 
</P>
<P>
 * 38%: losing out on the job because they were female

JAPAN VOWS MARKET-OPENING PLAN BY END OF MARCH; TRADE: STRATEGY COULD INCLUDE 
DEREGULATION, ALONG WITH PROMOTION OF IMPORTS AND INVESTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

From Reuters

<P>
 Japan, hoping to avert a trade war with the United States, said Friday that it 
will draft a package of market-opening measures by the end of March. Convincing 
Washington, however, looks to be a tough job. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are waiting to hear from your government what steps they propose to do," 
U.S. Ambassador Walter Mondale said in a speech hours after Cabinet ministers 
met to discuss the package. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stand ready, our government stands ready, to work with Japan if proposals 
are made that will make a difference," Mondale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and nine of his ministers in charge of 
economic, trade and foreign policies agreed at the special Cabinet meeting to 
work out a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they hope to present it by the end of March to the United States, 
which is poised to back up its trade demands with possible economic sanctions 
unless the two countries reach agreements in their so-called economic framework 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese officials say the market-opening strategy is likely to include 
deregulation, import and investment promotion and improvement of government 
procurement procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington is waiting to see whether Tokyo follows through with actions that 
produce results. "I'm more concerned about whether they come up with things 
that will really make a difference," Mondale said. "I'm a little skeptical." 
</P>
<P>
 Mondale also said he was unimpressed by suggestions that Japan might set a 
non-binding goal to cut its current-account surplus to 2.8% of its gross 
domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that such a voluntary target would be nothing more than a restatement 
of Japan's existing official forecast for the fiscal year beginning April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 He also echoed recent U.S. dissatisfaction with Japan's latest $143-billion 
stimulus package, which he said would do little to boost its economy or cut its 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's global current-account surplus rose to a record $131.35 billion in 
calendar 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the Japanese government's effort to appease Washington, the Japan 
External Trade Organization, or Jetro, once the key body behind the country's 
export drive, said it has turned its campaign focus to promoting imports. 
</P>
<P>
 About 70% of Jetro's efforts now focus on import promotion over exports, 
Chairman Toru Toyoshima said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Jetro said its "big push" to encourage imports has included holding foreign 
product fairs focusing on leisure and recreation or health care and featuring 
goods from foreign makers. California rice, only recently allowed to be 
imported in restricted quantities, has been displayed in department store 
basements.

<P>
 A leading Scottish bank is to allow transvestites to use two of its new 
high-security check cashing cards -- one with a photo of them dressed as a man 
and the other as a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "If any cross-dressing customers are confident enough to go shopping dressed 
as a woman, it's possible for them to have a second card so that they can avoid 
embarrassment or difficulties when paying by check," a Royal Bank of Scotland 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokesman could not say how many transvestite cards had been issued. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal Bank claims its pioneering introduction of cards carrying a 
photograph of the account holder has cut check fraud dramatically.

FUEL CELLS COMING TO LIFE; BACKERS CALL THEM NEXT NON-POLLUTING ENERGY SOURCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The once-exotic fuel cell may soon become a commonplace energy source in a 
surprising range of practical items, from batteries in video cameras and radios 
to smoke detectors that could last for 20 years -- even powering the family 
lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
 They may also be put into service as a non-polluting source of electricity to 
run cars, buses, trucks and trains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We intend to bring fuel cells down to earth," Henry W. Wedaa, chairman of the 
South Coast Air Quality Management District, said Friday at the end of a 
three-day conference in Long Beach for fuel cell marketers, researchers and 
environmental regulatory officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Entrepreneurs and scientists from the United States and Canada compared notes 
at the conference, where Wedaa's goal seemed even closer than many participants 
had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Wedaa and Moe Sihota, British Columbia's minister of the 
environment, proposed a North American Clean Air Alliance to support 
development of low- and zero-polluting vehicles -- one of the most challenging 
applications of the fuel cell. 
</P>
<P>
 The results of ongoing research, including work by a team at Caltech's Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory, suggest that the fuel cell-powered car is closer to 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can do it, we've got it made in the shade," said Catherine Anderson, 
a project engineer at AeroVironment Inc., the Monrovia-based research firm that 
developed much of General Motors Corp.'s upcoming Impact electric car. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuel cells, which have intrigued scientists since the 1800s, convert fuel -- 
most often hydrogen -- directly to electricity without combustion. Internally, 
they operate something like batteries to which fuel and oxygen are constantly 
being added. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists long have supported fuel cell research, because most working 
fuel cells emit only benign wastes -- pure water and heat, both of which can be 
put to good use in a variety of ways. 
</P>
<P>
 But several technological hurdles have kept fuel cells on theorists' lists of 
long-term, rather than short-term, energy sources. 
</P>
<P>
 One is cost, which for most uses is significantly higher than competing 
systems -- except in remote locations, including in space or beneath the ocean. 
Liquid hydrogen is an expensive fuel, currently produced in relatively small 
amounts, mainly for use by food processors and in space shuttle rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Another drawback has been the bulk of the cells themselves, as well as the 
heavy, voluminous tanks needed to safely store hydrogen on a vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every auto maker in the world is looking into fuel cells, if only as 
insurance against a rival breakthrough. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet fuel cell buses are practically here, said Paul Howard, vice president of 
Vancouver, Canada-based Ballard Power Systems, as he pointed to the "engine" of 
a small prototype bus parked in front of the conference site. 
</P>
<P>
 Very small fuel cell systems may reach the market first, according to Joseph 
P. Maceda, vice president of development for H Power Corp., a small firm based 
in Belleville, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the highly competitive transportation industry, the world of 
battery-driven appliances is ripe for a new energy source, he said. Using 
existing fuel cell technology, for instance, laptop computers could run 12 
hours at a stretch before recharging and still be eight ounces lighter than 
today's, Maceda said. The Fuel Cells in Our Future 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists and entrepreneurs are finding a surprising range of appliances and 
devices that could eventually use fuel cells, which can create electricity 
directly from fuels such as natural gas without pollution-causing combustion.

AMERICA WEST SELECTS INVESTORS TO HELP IT OUT OF BANKRUPTCY; AIRLINES: THE 
CARRIER AND CONTINENTAL MIGHT COORDINATE OPERATIONS UNDER THE DEAL. 
</P>

<P>
 America West Airlines said Friday that it has selected an investment group 
that includes Continental Airlines to help it emerge from bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix-based America West and Houston-based Continental would remain separate 
carriers but would probably coordinate flight schedules, frequent flier 
programs and other operations under a tentative deal forged by Ft. Worth, 
Tex.-based investor David Bonderman. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonderman and fellow investor David Coulter teamed up with Air Canada last 
year to lead Continental out of Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Court protection in 
return for 28% of the fifth-largest U.S. carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance between the two carriers would help ensure America West's 
long-term viability and give Continental greater access to the western United 
States.  
</P>
<P>
 Continental and America West "are both low-cost providers, and (their 
alliance) could give the big guys fits," airline industry analyst Ernest Arvai 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Bonderman investment group, AmWest Partners -- which includes 
Continental, Fidelity Investments and regional carrier Mesa Airlines -- would 
pump $220 million into America West, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection nearly 2 1/2 years ago. In return, the group would receive a 37.5% 
stake in a reorganized America West. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the remaining stock, 45% would go to unsecured creditors, 7.5% to one 
secured creditor and 10% to current stockholders, if all claims are paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under this proposal, America West will emerge from bankruptcy with a strong 
balance sheet and healthy cash reserves," Chairman Bill Franke said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal must still be approved by America West's creditors and the U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the offer faces opposition from the airline's unsecured creditors, 
who said Friday that they back a plan that would give them control of the 
airline. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur B. Newman, an investment banker with the Blackstone Group, a financial 
adviser to the unsecured creditors committee, said the committee would back a 
plan led by New York money manager Michael Steinhardt. The Steinhardt group had 
initially offered $250 million for 80% of the airline. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman said Friday that the group has since revised its offer to $200 million 
for 49%, with unsecured creditors getting the remaining 51%. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said America West and Continental stand to benefit from the 
deal. For example, Continental could conceivably shift its troubled Denver 
operations -- where it faces high costs and intense competition from United 
Airlines -- to America West's Phoenix hub. 
</P>
<P>
 "It allows Continental to concentrate on the easy pickings in the eastern 
United States," where Continental has a large advantage over higher-cost 
carriers such as USAir, said David Hoppin, and airline industry analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Mesa Air could also play a larger role in feeding traffic to both carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal would give investor Bonderman a substantial foothold in the highly 
competitive airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonderman, who in the 1980s was a top adviser to Texas billionaire and 
takeover artist Robert M. Bass, "is now involved with some of the key low-cost 
providers of service in the industry," airline consultant David Banmiller said. 
"It's a situation where low costs have become the key to survival and success 
in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 America West stock rose 62.5 cents Friday to close at $2.875 in Nasdaq 
trading. Continental's Class A shares fell $1 to $24.375 on the New York Stock 
Exchange, while its Class B shares dropped 37.5 cents to $21.75.

 Drexel Leftovers Sold to Atlanta Group: The remains of Drexel Burnham Lambert 
Inc., one of the most powerful Wall Street firms during the 1980s merger mania, 
were sold to an Atlanta-based partnership for $209 million.Drexel, home to junk 
bond king Michael Milken, changed the way corporate America looked at debt with 
its pioneering use of high-yield, high-risk securities to raise billions of 
dollars to finance takeovers. The collapse of the $200-billion junk bond market 
drove the firm into bankruptcy in 1990 and resulted in its eventual demise. 
Drexel's surviving company, New Street Capital Corp., a merchant banker, was 
sold to Green Capital Investors for $174 million in cash and $35 million in 
secured short-term notes.

 United States Makes Tariff Offer: The government submitted a 1,000-page 
schedule of cuts in import duties as part of a world trade deal to be signed in 
April. Andrew Stoler, deputy head of the U.S. mission at the General Agreement 
on Tariffs and Trade, said reductions in import tariffs on some Japanese 
electronics items would be smaller than offered at the end of the 
GATT-sponsored talks in December.He said the U.S. would cut overall duties on 
wood products by about 50% rather than abolishing them, because Japan and the 
European Union had failed to make comparable concessions. The Canadians and 
Europeans submitted their offers previously, but both have warned they might 
scale back concessions on U.S. exports if Washington's offers fell below 
expectations.

 Franchisee Wins Riot Judgment: Jurors awarded more than $7 million to the 
owner of a Domino's pizza franchise that was burned during the riots, deciding 
that an insurer and insurance agency had breached an oral contract to repay his 
loss. Insurance Co. of North America and the Gold Cities Insurance Agency were 
ordered to pay the money to Dennis Stephan, whose pizza business in a county 
area between Los Angeles and Compton was burned on April 30, 1992. The 
judgments came this week in a trial overseen by Los Angeles County Superior 
Court Judge Ray Bennett.

 No More Eo at Epcot: Capt. Eo's days of saving the world with song and dance 
are numbered at Walt Disney World's Epcot Center. Walt Disney Co. is dropping 
Michael Jackson's 3-D spectacular at the Florida park.Officials said the 
decision had nothing to do with allegations that the performer sexually 
molested a teen-age boy. "We have to keep offering something new," said David 
Herbst, a Disney spokesman. The attraction is sponsored by Eastman Kodak Co. 
The show will continue to play at Disneyland and at the Disney park in Tokyo. 
Capt. Eo will be replaced this fall at Epcot by "Honey, I Shrunk the Audience." 
Separately, Walt Disney World plans to lay off 360 of 36,000 employees at its 
Florida entertainment resort in the near future, a company spokeswoman said. 
The 1% cut in the work force is part of a larger restructuring intended to 
boost financial growth.

 Seagram Increases Stake in Time Warner: The distiller said it purchased an 
additional 5 million shares in February for about $193 million, bringing its 
total stake to 13.1% of Time Warner's outstanding shares. Seagram previously 
said it might acquire up to 15% of the entertainment and media giant. Time 
Warner last month adopted a tough "poison pill" provision designed to thwart 
the accumulation of more than 15% of its stock unless the buyer bids for the 
entire company.

<P>
 Market Overview * Stocks gained modest ground Friday, stabilizing after 
Thursday's tumble. But investors remained tentative because of mounting worries 
about the market's health. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long-term bond yields eased from Thursday's eight-month highs, as sellers 
took a breather. Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 Bargain hunters came out in enough force to lift most broad market averages 
modestly, but slowed trading volume illustrated investors' underlying concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials, which had slumped 51.78 points Thursday as interest rates 
shot up, eased 1.12 points to 3,838.78 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 For the week, the Dow lost 48.68 points. It now is 3.5% below its Jan. 31 
record high of 3,978.36. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, winners topped losers 12 to 9 on the Big Board, as 
trading volume slid to 274 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 A calm bond market helped the stock market find its feet. But analysts were 
reluctant to suggest stocks are ready to resurge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a little recovery, but when you consider how much we were down 
(Thursday), it's pretty weak," said Harry Laubscher, analyst at Tucker Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors are "on their heels" waiting and wondering if the Federal Reserve 
Board will move again soon to tighten credit, said Ron Doran, trader at CL King 
& Associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Telecommunications stocks tried to recover after plunging Thursday in the 
wake of the canceled merger between Bell Atlantic and Tele-Communications Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI gained 1 1/2 to 23 7/8, and other cable stocks also inched up. Cablevision 
Systems added 5/8 to 62 7/8, Comcast was up 1/8 to 19 1/4 and Falcon Cable 
gained 1/8 to 11 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Among phone stocks, Bell Atlantic eased 3/8 to 54 1/8, but US West jumped 1 
1/8 to 40 1/2 and BellSouth gained 1 3/8 to 55 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial issues, the market's recent leaders, were mixed. Nucor gained 1 
1/8 to 57 3/4, Dow Chemical rose 1 1/4 to 63 3/8 and Boeing added 1/2 to 47 
3/8, but Ford slid 1 to 61 1/2 and Rockwell lost 1 1/2 to 41. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug stocks rose as takeover rumors dogged downtrodden Syntex again. Syntex 
jumped 7/8 to 14 5/8, Pfizer added 3/4 to 57 3/8 and Bristol-Myers rose 1/2 to 
55 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bank stocks attracted buyers on talk that Congress will pass a law in 1994 
allowing banks to expand nationwide. Citicorp rose 3/4 to 41 1/8, First Chicago 
leaped 2 3/4 to 49 7/8, First Interstate gained 2 1/2 to 69 and Banc One was up 
5/8 to 33 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, stocks were mixed after slumping Thursday on worries about Russia. 
London's FTSE-100 index added 13.7 points to 3,281.2, but Frankfurt's DAX index 
fell 15.37 points to 2,074.92. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei index added 37.90 points to 19,803.38. After a rough 
week, Mexico City's Bolsa index rose 4.06 points to 2,596.39. Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields showed little change after Thursday's surge. The 30-year Treasury 
bond yield closed at 6.71%, down slightly from Thursday's eight-month high of 
6.73%. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Fed raised short-term interest rates Feb. 4 to restrain the economy, 
the 30-year bond yield has jumped more than a third of a point. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders say many investors are selling bonds not because of inflation worries 
related to the strong economy, but simply because the Fed's action was viewed 
as a clear signal that the long downtrend in rates is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds could face more pressure next week: A survey of Midwest purchasing 
managers is due Monday, followed by a national purchasing managers survey 
Tuesday. If the reports confirm a robust economy, the Fed could boost rates 
again, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold gained on the Comex, with the near-term futures contract up $2.20 an 
ounce to $378.60. Silver added 5.4 cents to $5.23. 
</P>
<P>
 * Light, sweet crude oil for April delivery fell 20 cents to $14.57 a barrel.

LEVER SOAP PLANT MAY CLOSE; LABOR: THE UNION FOR MOST OF THE 285 WORKERS AT THE

CLOSURE.

 Lever Bros. said Friday that it may close its soap and detergent plant in 
Commerce, potentially affecting 285 jobs at the landmark facility just south of 
Interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations to determine the fate of the plant and its workers will be held 
Monday with the International Chemical Workers Union, which represents more 
than two-thirds of the plant's employees, said John Gould, director of 
corporate affairs at Lever Bros. in New York.The plant could close as early as 
May 1, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement is part of the company's effort to cut costs to remain 
competitive, Gould said. The closure is in keeping with a plan announced 
earlier this week by Unilever, Lever Bros.' European-based parent, to 
restructure its worldwide operations -- a move that includes cutting 7,500 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan to close the Commerce plant reflects increased competition in the 
consumer products industry. Procter & Gamble, Philip Morris and others have 
also consolidated as generic brands have gained market share. 
</P>
<P>
 Products made at the Commerce facility, which began operations in 1951, 
include Dove, Wisk, Caress, Surf and All. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles County Economic Development 
Corp., noted that numerous manufacturers -- blaming high workers' compensation 
costs, delays in obtaining permits and relatively high taxes and labor costs -- 
have moved their operations out of California. He said representatives of his 
office will contact Lever to discuss options to keep the plant here.

bond of the Federal Home Loan Bank System.In turn, the Federal Home Loan Bank 
of San Francisco will lend the proceeds of the bond sale to local financial 
institutions to promote mortgage and commercial lending that benefits low- and 
moderate-income households and neighborhoods affected by the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. The $145 million in funds earmarked for home loans and economic 
development projects will be made available through five lenders: American 
Savings Bank in Stockton, Coast Federal Bank in Los Angeles, First Republic 
Thrift & Loan in San Francisco, Glendale Federal Bank and Home Savings of

RICK DU BROW: AN ECLECTIC FESTIVAL OF QUIRKY, CLASSIC TV; BROADCASTING: A 
SALUTE TO SID CAESAR WEDNESDAY WILL OPEN THE MUSEUM OF TELEVISION & RADIO'S 
11TH ANNUAL EVENT, WHICH MIXES CLASSICS WITH CURIOSITIES.

<P>
 Ten years ago this spring, a New York museum came West with a collection of 
classic TV programs and gave Los Angeles what soon became an annual festival of 
note for couch potatoes and students of the medium. 
</P>
<P>
 At the beginning, the Manhattan-based Museum of Broadcasting -- now called the 
Museum of Television & Radio -- was on somewhat uncertain ground with its Los 
Angeles expedition. Its first venture, in 1984, set up shop at the ABC 
Entertainment Center. Its second, in 1985, welcomed intrigued fans in a studio 
on the Universal lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, however, the museum forged a key link with the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art -- an easily accessible and prestigious institution that, ever 
since, has been home for the screenings and public seminars of shows and 
individuals that have helped make television the cultural force that it is. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 11th Television Festival gets under way on Wednesday with a salute to 
Sid Caesar, it will reflect the pattern that the Museum of Television & Radio 
has established in recent years -- a mix of the classic, the grand, the 
experimental and the simply popular, with a few curios thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
 With the past success of screenings and seminars that celebrated such new and 
promising series as "Moonlighting," "thirtysomething," "The Simpsons" and "Twin 
Peaks," the museum this year is, for instance, devoting its March 16 
presentation to Steven Bochco's "NYPD Blue," a cop show that has survived fire 
for its violence and sexual material. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is also turning over next Saturday night to another freshman entry, 
"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman," which likewise has received 
critical praise although struggling in the ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the inclusion of several other relatively new series -- "Mad About 
You" on Friday and "Love & War" on March 11 -- the most compelling attractions 
invariably are the shows and individuals that, over the years, have had the 
time to become part of our pop history and our frames of reference. 
</P>
<P>
 Caesar, for instance, has been honored before by the museum -- starting with 
that very first festival -- yet he is an endless source of wonder as a comic 
genius, and his importance to American entertainment of any kind cannot be 
overstated. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are several series of the past that rank with the finest TV 
programs ever made -- the newspaper drama "Lou Grant," which is saluted on 
Thursday, and the ensemble cop comedy "Barney Miller," which gets its tribute 
on March 9. 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming festival is nothing if not eclectic. 
</P>
<P>
 Example: Two of television's top-rated series, "Roseanne" and "Home 
Improvement," will be showcased. "Roseanne," which has won increasing respect 
as a series, has its night March 12, with star Roseanne Arnold scheduled to 
head the program's contingent. "Home Improvement," with star Tim Allen and 
other performers and creators of the hit, is set for March 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Example: "Dallas," which is light-years from "NYPD Blue" as drama, is on the 
bill for next Saturday. The most dominant prime-time soap opera in TV history, 
it ran from 1978-91 and, along with "Dynasty," was perhaps the medium's most 
flamboyant reflection of the greedy '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Example: "An Evening With Norman Lear," who has previously appeared in the 
museum's TV festival, will have the veteran producer and co-creator of "All in 
the Family" doing a solo presentation March 19, the final night of the 2 
1/2-week event. 
</P>
<P>
 Example: "Special Bulletin," a compelling one-shot drama about a group of 
anti-nuclear terrorists -- which ingeniously used a TV newscast to report its 
developments, thus adding a prescient and dark humor about media coverage -- is 
set for March 10. The executive producer, Don Ohlmeyer, now heads NBC's West 
Coast operations. The creators, Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, later 
brought forth "thirtysomething." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid this potpourri of television endeavors are several curios, the most 
notable of which is "77 Sunset Strip," scheduled for a March 11 session. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly to be confused with the "Hallmark Hall of Fame," this lighthearted 
detective show that ran from the late '50s to the early '60s was one of the 
counter-programming weapons that the then-fledgling ABC network -- unable to 
sign the veteran stars bound to CBS and NBC -- used to gain a foothold in the 
network ratings wars. 
</P>
<P>
 With TV shows part of the mind food of the last several generations -- as 
witness the film remakes of such series as "The Beverly Hillbillies" and "The 
Addams Family" -- the museum has offered a wide range of shows from Fred 
Astaire's home screen efforts to "Route 66" to "China Beach" to "Gunsmoke." 
</P>
<P>
 At their best, past evenings devoted to such achievers as Caesar, Ernie 
Kovacs, Edward R. Murrow, Carol Burnett, Lucille Ball and Mary Tyler Moore 
remind us of TV's capability for grandness. Nowadays, particularly, this 
grandness seems more and more remote as prime time is increasingly populated 
with tabloid-style reality shows. In its own way, "Special Bulletin" was a 
warning of what was ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that is why the best of what audiences see at the annual festivals 
become standards against which we can judge the rapid decline of network 
quality. When you have seen an evening with Jack Paar or Steve Allen at the 
festival, you sense the magic that true broadcasters -- not just stars, but 
real broadcasters -- can bring into our homes. 
</P>
<P>
 You can bet that the museum would give its right arm to get Johnny Carson or 
David Letterman for an evening each at the festival. And why not Jay Leno? How 
about Vin Scully on TV sports? How about an evening with Walter Cronkite? Or 
David Brinkley? Or Ted Koppel? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that's a start for next year. And then there's "Frasier," of course. And 
"Grace Under Fire." And an evening with Barry Diller talking about QVC and the 
new electronic world would take the festival into a new dimension, the 
now-unfolding twilight zone where viewers will be living in the future.

MORPHIN MANIA: HOW -- AND WHY?; TELEVISION: EVEN THE SUPER-HEROES' CREATORS ARE 
SURPRISED AT THE POPULARITY OF THE KARATE-CHOPPING POWER RANGERS. THAT SUCCESS 
RAISES SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE CHARACTERS' MESSAGE. 
</P>

 For those under five feet, they're bigger than Kerrigan and Harding, more 
popular than Madonna or Seinfeld. If kids ran newspapers, they'd get more ink 
than President Clinton, Michael Jackson and Lorena Bobbitt put together.  
</P>
<P>
 They're the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers -- TV super-heroes whose appearance 
last Monday at Universal Studios created an 8-mile traffic jam on the Hollywood 
Freeway. Some 35,000 preteens and their parents turned out to watch a 
performance by the karate-chopping band of high schoolers in brightly colored 
spandex suits.  
</P>
<P>
 Millions more tune in each day to watch episodes of Fox's "The Mighty Morphin 
Power Rangers" (airing locally on KTTV-TV Channel 11 weekdays at 5 p.m. and 
Saturdays at 7:30 a.m.), making it the highest-rated children's show in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no questioning their popularity. But there are questions about why a 
primitive-looking, live-action show that is considered unwatchable by many 
adults has become the latest kid craze. Questions too about whether the 
popularity of these super-heroes can be sustained. And more questions still 
from some children's television advocates who contend that despite the show's 
pro-social preachiness, the fighting at the heart of each episode is likely to 
encourage similarly aggressive behavior in its rabid fans. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least for now, nothing can stop the Power Rangers, who, like the Ninja 
Turtles before them, have become an entire industry unto themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Power Rangers merchandise -- robots, monsters and figurines of the 
super-heroes -- created a buying frenzy that resulted in pushing and shoving in 
toy store aisles last Christmas. Saban Entertainment, which owns the franchise, 
reportedly has offers from nearly every major movie studio for a film deal, and 
it is pursuing plans for a theme park attraction, video games and a chain of 
martial arts schools. Previously aired episodes of the TV show, which only 
debuted last September, are already available on home video. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be lying if I said we expected it to be like this, this big. It's 
incredible. It's crazy," said Shuki Levy, who serves as executive producer of 
the show along with Haim Saban, head of Saban Entertainment. "But we always 
knew it had appeal for children, and that's because we have created this whole 
fantasy world with a somewhat primitive approach." Margaret Loesch, president 
of the Fox Children's Network, said she thought the show would catch on because 
it is different than cartoons and the average kid fare. The series features the 
teen-age karate experts -- three boys and two girls -- battling monsters 
dressed in cheesy alien costumes that have been sent to Earth by Rita Repulsa, 
Empress of Evil, whose segments are made in Japan and then dubbed into English 
like the old "Godzilla" movies. 
</P>
<P>
 But not even Loesch anticipated that "Power Rangers" would become as big as 
He-Man, the Smurfs or the Ninja Turtles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids are desperately in need of positive role models and, whether or not they 
like the show, people agree that our teen-age stars are delightful to both boys 
and girls," Loesch said. "And it is extremely rare that an action-adventure 
show appeals to girls as well as boys." 
</P>
<P>
 Many adults, however, take one look at this show -- with the ridiculous robot 
fight sequences and simple live-action sitcom plots -- and cringe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't stand it. It's so stupid," said Dorothy G. Singer, professor of 
psychology and co-director of the Yale University Family Television Research 
and Consultation Center. "But kids like super-heroes. They like to identify 
with someone who is powerful. Kids are small and not in control of their own 
destiny, so when they identify with someone powerful, they feel strong and 
powerful." 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Montgomery, president of the Center for Media Education, a nonprofit 
organization in Washington that monitors children's television and tries to 
encourage educational shows, said that the avid marketing of the "Power 
Rangers" merchandise fuels the popularity of the series. 
</P>
<P>
 The series itself may also increase the popularity of violence, Singer and 
Montgomery agreed. The longest sequences in each episode tend to be fight 
sequences filled with karate, robotics and magic swords. The message, Singer 
said, "is you fight with your enemies. There's no trying to negotiate. You just 
get rid of them." 
</P>
<P>
 These critics of the program pointed to studies indicating that children who 
view a lot of action-adventure shows tend to behave more aggressively. "They 
become more restless and they imitate what they see," Singer said. "They don't 
always understand that it's fictional and done with special effects and that 
they can't do a karate chop or hit someone with a stick in a real-life 
situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Levy defended the show by saying that all the fight elements are clearly 
marked as fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all relative. You can go back to the Bible stories and say maybe 
children shouldn't hear about David slaying Goliath," he said. "But here, we 
have only imaginary monsters and you see them making it out of clay in a 
machine. So you never feel like they have killed a real person or an animal. 
And in the other side of the story, you never see the Rangers fighting other 
people, and I think it's easy for kids to see the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Levy added that each episode features a positive message about self-esteem or 
getting along with those who are different. Usually, this message is proclaimed 
in dialogue among the teen-age heroes at the end of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery called that a mixed message. "On the one hand you have the 
pro-social messages -- be good citizens and get along -- and yet it resolves 
all conflict with a fight," she said. "It's very conflicted, and it's almost as 
if these so-called action shows have incorporated pro-social moments to justify 
the violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Loesch said she was concerned about that problem before the series debuted and 
insisted on creating public-service announcements for the end of every episode 
that bluntly explain to children that the show is fantasy and not to be 
imitated. Future spots will deal with peaceful methods of conflict resolution, 
anger management and the difference between fantasy and reality, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may be getting subtle messages from the show, but these spots are not 
subtle and not confusing," Loesch said. "They explain that the show is 
entertainment and what the kids should be learning are the values of the heroes 
and that they absolutely should not try to imitate the action." 
</P>
<P>
 Can the craze -- for better or worse -- last? 
</P>
<P>
 Singer said that such fads come around every couple of years and then 
disappear. She expects the same for the Power Rangers. Montgomery agreed, 
noting that it's in the interest of toy manufacturers to come up with something 
new. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a younger brother is crazy about the same show his older brother once 
liked, then he simply inherits all the old toys and you don't have to buy new 
products," Montgomery said. "So there always is going to be some new thing. 
It's the nature of the beast." 
</P>
<P>
 But Loesch predicts the Power Rangers will be different. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't think that this is going to be a flash in the pan," she said. 
"Children seem to like the kids in the show so much and they like the fantasy 
of teen-agers being endowed with special powers, that I'm really hoping it will 
last five or even 10 years. I think it has that potential."

CSLB ART MUSEUM OPENS ITS NEW SITE TUESDAY; REMODELING: THREE INSTALLATIONS 
KICK OFF THE 8,000-SQUARE-FOOT PERMANENT FACILITY IN THE NORTH CAMPUS LIBRARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Since 1984, the top-ranked art museum in the Cal State system has been hidden 
away in temporary galleries on the fifth floor of the main university library, 
but it finally has a permanent, more easily accessible new home. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8,000-square-foot University Art Museum facility in the west wing of the 
North Campus Library at Cal State Long Beach opens Tuesday with three shows: a 
photographic installation by Belgian artist Marie-Jo Lafontaine; photographs of 
homeless people by Howard Schatz; and "Wall Works" -- participatory 
installations devised by such well-known conceptual artists as Sol LeWitt, Imi 
Knoebel and Daniel Buren. 
</P>
<P>
 The new museum -- one wing of a 3-year-old brick and stucco building designed 
by campus master planners Killingsworth, Stricker, Lindgren, Wilson & 
Associates -- had been built specifically for library uses, not to display art. 
But museum director Constance W. Glenn was anxious to find a new home for her 
institution, which closed in December, 1992, to accommodate remodeling of the 
main library. 
</P>
<P>
 The closing was the latest blow to an institution that has weathered major 
funding losses along with much of the rest of the Cal State system. The 
museum's 1994 operating budget is currently slightly under $1 million, down 
from a 1989 high of $1.5 million. With cutbacks in the full-time staff from 14 
to four, Glenn now doubles as chief curator. 
</P>
<P>
 Her concerns about the building found a sympathetic ear in Long Beach resident 
Robert Gumbiner, chairman of the board of FHP International Corp, who pledged 
$30,000 to transform the west wing into a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Gumbiner gift was the largest single private donation to the 
remodeling project, the job also required university construction funds -- 
lobbied for by several high-placed officials -- for such initially unforeseen 
expenses as fire exits and handicapped access. (University officials are mum 
about the total cost, which Glenn says even she doesn't know.) 
</P>
<P>
 While the museum hasn't gained additional exhibition space in its new 
location, it is now distinguished as an entity in its own right by virtue of a 
prominent ground-floor location and a separate entrance. "We didn't want any 
sense of being an aspect of another building," Glenn says. 
</P>
<P>
 The Center Court Gallery, a ceremonial, 1,260-square-foot space demarcated by 
four plump columns and capped by a skylight, is surrounded by five other 
galleries with 12-foot ceilings and varying sizes. A windowed, 80-foot-long 
expanse can be divided into two or three smaller areas (one of which is named 
for Gumbiner). Only one small "black box" gallery escapes the ubiquitous wash 
of natural light. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoehorned into the remaining space are a museum shop, designed by Los Angeles 
artist Eugenia P. Butler, and a handful of tiny offices. (Storage and workroom 
space have been carved out of an area at the east end of the library.) 
</P>
<P>
 A few vestiges of the original library design remain, including patterned gray 
carpeting in the central gallery -- Glenn prevailed on the architects to allow 
bare concrete floors elsewhere -- and a massive central planter buried too 
deeply in the ground to allow for easy removal. Glenn says it may someday serve 
as the base for a Nancy Graves sculpture owned by the museum. (The rest of the 
UAM collection consists of contemporary works of art on paper and outdoor 
sculptures installed at various sites on campus.) 
</P>
<P>
 Butler was one of three artists commissioned to make pieces for the museum 
garden, her fancifully ornamental bench, "Lover's Bench for a New Millennium," 
is based on William Blake's drawings for Milton's "Paradise Lost." Frederick 
Fisher planted delicate Italian cypress and black plum trees that delineate the 
footprint of an outdoor "Room." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1973, the UAM was accredited in 1984 by the American Assn. of 
Museums. Two years later, the California Arts Council ranked the museum among 
the top six arts institutions in the state, calling it "a model for university 
museums." 
</P>
<P>
 In accordance with Gumbiner's proviso that the museum stay open evenings to 
accommodate working people, the UAM's new hours will be noon to 8 p.m., Tuesday 
through Thursday; and noon to 5 p.m., Friday through Sunday. Information: (310) 
985-5761.

 Christo Takes on Reichstag: Following a sharp, 90-minute debate, the German 
Parliament voted Friday to allow the artist Christo, who in 1991 dotted 
California's hills with giant blue and yellow umbrellas, to wrap the Reichstag, 
the once and future seat of German Parliament, in silvery cloth. Christo, who 
previously wrapped Paris' Pont Neuf, has been trying for 23 years to get 
permission for a "Wrapped Reichstag." The 100-year-old building, which sat on 
the border between West and East Berlin before unification in 1990, was the 
home of Germany's first democratic parliament in 1919. Christo plans a two-week 
Reichstag spectacle for spring, 1995, just before workers begin refurbishing 
the building for Parliament to move back into it in 1998.

 * La La La Reschedules, Again: Hoping that the third time is a charm, La La La 
Human Steps, the acclaimed Montreal-based dance company that has twice 
postponed scheduled performances here because of a chiropractic injury 
sustained by principal dancer Louise Lecavalier in October, is now set to 
appear March 24 and 25 at the Wiltern Theatre. The company's first L.A. 
appearance in six years will feature the American premiere of "Infante-C'est 
Destroy," a work combining dance, live rock music and film. 
</P>
<P>
 * Playhouse Season Set: A drama about the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, Robert 
McElwaine's "The Titans," will join two familiar titles on the fall season at 
the Pasadena Playhouse. The season opens July 17 with Amanda McBroom's musical 
revue "Heartbeats," which was seen at the Matrix Theatre in 1986 and the Old 
Globe in 1990. "The Titans" rolls in on Sept. 18, to be followed by a revival 
of "The Lion in Winter" Nov. 13. RADIO & TV

 Indecency Case Settled: The Federal Communications Commission will issue 
guidelines explaining its ban on indecency in broadcasts as part of a 
settlement with Evergreen Media Corp., the owner of Chicago radio station WMVP 
(formerly known as WLUP-AM). As part of the settlement, the FCC will drop its 
claims of indecency and $39,750 in fines against the station. Evergreen, 
meanwhile, will pay $10,000 to the government without admitting any wrongdoing, 
and dismiss its counterclaim challenging the constitutionality of the FCC's 
enforcement of indecency standards. The case has been closely watched in the 
industry because WLUP-AM was the first station to take its protest over the 
indecency standards to court. 
</P>
<P>
 * Audience Member Sues: A woman who claims she was pushed off a stage riser at 
a taping of Arsenio Hall's talk show when singer Prince was the featured guest 
has sued both entertainers and the show's producers. Elizabeth Diamante states 
that she was among several audience members who accepted Prince's invitation to 
join him onstage at the end of the Feb. 25, 1993, taping. Her L.A. Superior 
Court lawsuit alleges that she was severely injured when two "security bouncer 
types" knocked her onto her back. POP/ROCK

 Blind Melon Singer Charged: Richard Shannon Hoon, the 26-year-old lead singer 
of the rock group Blind Melon, will be arraigned Monday on charges of battery, 
assaulting a police officer, resisting arrest, disturbing the peace and 
destroying telephone equipment. The charges, filed in Los Angeles Thursday, 
stemmed from a Feb. 7 incident at the American Music Awards show, in which Hoon 
allegedly punched a security guard at the Shrine Auditorium, tried to kick out 
the window of a police car, tore a telephone off a wall and spat twice on a 
detective. On that show, Blind Melon lost out on the best new artist award to 
the Stone Temple Pilots. On Tuesday's Grammy Awards, Blind Melon is up for the 
same award; Stone Temple Pilots is not. BENEFITS

 'Achey Quakey' Aid: Helen Hunt, Tyne Daly, Mesach Taylor, Gregory Harrison, 
Carol Channing, Bruce Davison, Debby Boone, Stephanie Zimbalist and Stephanie 
Powers are among the headliners set for "The Achey Quakey Benefit: An Evening 
of Music, Merriment and Shakey Stories," planned for 8 p.m. tonight on the 
Paramount Pictures lot at 5555 Melrose Ave., Hollywood. Proceeds will go to the 
nonprofit Dreams to Reality Foundation, which is establishing a grant program 
for small businesses affected by the Jan. 17 earthquake. Tickets are $37.50, 
$75 and $150, and must be purchased through Theatix at (213) 466-1767. QUICK

 Because of the large crowds attending the exhibition, the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art has extended its hours for the exhibition "Picasso and the 
Weeping Women: The Years of Marie-Therese Walter and Dora Maar." For that 
exhibition only, the museum will be open on Tuesdays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., 
and will be open on Saturdays and Sundays from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. . . . A Los 
Angeles Superior Court judge has thrown out a claim by Roseanne Arnold's 
sister, Geraldine Barr, that she was entitled to half of Arnold's professional 
income. . . . Actor Jim Nabors, who underwent a liver transplant Feb. 7 and was 
expected to be hospitalized for a month, was released ahead of schedule from 
UCLA Medical Center in good condition and is now recuperating at home. SHAUNA

POP BEAT: MATERIAL: A MUSICAL MEETING GROUND; 'HALLUCINATION ENGINE,' THE 
SEVENTH ALBUM FROM THE BILL LASWELL GROUP, EXPLORES AN UNUSUAL RANGE OF GENRES 
WITH ARTISTS FROM AROUND THE GLOBE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Adventurous musical genre buster or cultural homogenizer? 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Laswell has been praised as the former and criticized as the latter. 
"Hallucination Engine," the seventh album from Material, the variable-cast 
group that he masterminds, makes a strong case for his unique blend of jazz, 
funk, reggae, rock, hip-hop and Indian and Islamic styles in varying 
combinations that defies easy description.  
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit native first made his mark with Herbie Hancock's ground-breaking 
"Rockit" in 1983 and subsequently worked with rockers Mick Jagger, Public Image 
Limited, Motorhead and Iggy Pop among his more than 200 production credits. All 
of these, to some degree, bear Laswell's distinctive stamp, realized by his 
employment of a revolving cast of players drawn literally from around the 
globe. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm much more excited about the unknown, creating the music that hasn't been 
heard yet," says Laswell, 39. "When you start to respect the responsibility of 
organizing, whether it's a band or tour or recording, you get obsessed with the 
idea of being a catalyst, a person who can put things together and make them 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the criticism that he's reduced distinctive styles into a seamless, 
gleaming whole, Laswell counters that he is creating a common meeting ground 
for master musicians, free from commercial pressures.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've had really good relationships with people coming from different 
territories and cultures," Laswell says. "They want to play their music with 
everybody -- with Michael Jackson one day and some master who lives in the 
mountains the next. That's coming from them -- that's not me putting that trip 
on anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hallucination Engine" is a typically unpredictable example of Laswell's 
mix-and-match approach. There's a stronger jazz component infused with Islamic 
and Indian music elements, all given an atmospheric, dub-influenced production. 
A spoken word piece with William S. Burroughs sounds like a mid-voyage stop at 
some intergalactic jazz lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no beginning concept for 'Hallucination Engine,' " he explains. "I 
worked on it periodically over time and kept adding pieces from different 
recordings to the idea of this broader project. That's customary (of how I 
work) but it's a real extreme example." 
</P>
<P>
 Laswell grew up in Detroit, influenced by that city's twin musical poles: the 
funk of Parliament-Funkadelic and the proto-punk of Iggy & the Stooges and the 
MC5. His first live playing experience was in soul-funk cover bands throughout 
the Midwest, but he also began blurring genres by absorbing the work of 
experimenters in the jazz and rock realms. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear people like Coltrane being influenced by Asian music and 
aesthetics or Miles Davis experimenting with instruments from different 
cultures, you want to know where that comes from," says Laswell. "It's no 
different than kids buying a Led Zeppelin record and through that discovering 
Muddy Waters or Howlin' Wolf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ginger Baker was in Cream, but what was really interesting to me was his 
experiences in Nigeria (after that). Jimmy Page, what I connected with was 
things he tried like the recordings with the Bombay Symphony, incredible ideas 
that just never got resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Laswell moved to New York in 1977 and quickly established himself as a player 
in the experimental rock and jazz communities. The initial version of Material 
was formed as a house band for a progressive rock festival in 1979.  
</P>
<P>
 Laswell wasted little time building up a corps of regular collaborators 
ranging from big names, including former P-Funk mainstay Bootsy Collins and 
Burroughs, to such musicians' favorites as Jamaica's Sly & Robbie rhythm team. 
A 1982 Material album featured the pairing of fiery jazz saxophonist Archie 
Shepp with a then-unknown Whitney Houston.  
</P>
<P>
 Laswell recently ventured into Moroccan music with field recordings of Gnawa 
musicians and the Master Musicians of Jajouka, but a bigger shift came in 1991 
when he acquired the Greenpoint Studio in Brooklyn and launched his own 
Island-distributed label, Axiom. With those developments, Laswell is poised for 
more unconventional explorations of the musical frontiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found a sound quite a while ago and I'm just spreading it out in different 
areas," Laswell says. "A lot of it is based on a sonic vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's liberating to explore what you can do with technology and look for a 
kind of spirituality in technology as well as the musical vocabulary. I think 
by doing that you're able to go that much further into the unknown."

DIGEST: URCAN QUITS CSUN VOLLEYBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gene Urcan, a sophomore from Chatsworth High, has left the Cal State 
Northridge volleyball team, Coach John Price said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Urcan, the Matadors' top backup at middle blocker and opposite hitter, was not 
happy with his role, according to his coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Urcan was set to start at middle blocker alongside Craig Hewitt before the 
arrival of Oliver Heitmann, a member of the German national team. When Heitmann 
took over in the middle, Urcan was shifted to opposite hitter, and waged a 
three-way battle for playing time with Jon Baer and Jason Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 Urcan could not be reached for comment and he did not tell Price of any plans 
to transfer.

HE'S NOT GOING TO DIVISION I ON A PASS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: AT ANTELOPE VALLEY, 
PRINCE PROVES HE ISN'T ONE-DIMENSIONAL, BUT YOU WANT THIS GUY TO SHOOT THE

 Before going any further, Danny Prince wants to set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait. Another one? Doesn't he own a few records already after all those 
three-point baskets he has made? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes, but Prince wants to clarify a point. Actually, a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a ball hog," Prince said. "It's not like I don't pass the ball or 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 The way he can shoot from the outside, maybe he shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, a 6-foot-1 sophomore guard at Antelope Valley College, is a 
three-point specialist who can hit the mark from anywhere on the floor. And 
often. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the former Quartz Hill High standout is having remarkable success 
with his long-range shots, much more than even he anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny is the purest shooter I've ever coached," said Newton Chelette, the 
Marauder coach. "Mechanically and technically, his shot is as good as it comes. 
He is just a phenomenal shooter." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Marauders (19-11) prepare for tonight's game against Pasadena City at 
Lancaster in the first round of the Southern California regional, Prince is on 
a three-point roll. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 9, Prince set a school single-game record with 11 three-point baskets 
in a 114-80 victory over Barstow in a Foothill Conference game. Seven days 
later, he made 10 more in the team's next game, a 103-100 overtime victory over 
Victor Valley. He also had 10 three-point baskets in two consecutive games in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 With every three-point basket he makes, Prince increases his school 
single-season mark of 171 and pulls closer to Tony Madison's school career 
record of 270, which he trails by 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince's shooting also improves the chances of winning for the Marauders. He 
was the team's leading scorer in 18 of the 30 games, including a career-best 43 
points in a 111-93 conference victory over Mt. San Jacinto on Feb. 5, and leads 
Antelope Valley in scoring with a 23.1 average. 
</P>
<P>
 His 44.1% accuracy (171 of 388) from three-point range was only slightly lower 
than his 45.5% (51 of 112) from elsewhere on the floor. And he also had 82 
assists, the third-highest total on the team, to show that the ball really 
leaves his hands in other directions rather than the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers helped him become the conference's most valuable player and were 
a major reason in Antelope Valley's second-place finish behind unbeaten Chaffey 
with a 12-4 record. Prince also proved to himself that the long hours spent in 
the gym working on his shooting were not wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to the gym at 6 o'clock every morning during the off-season," Prince 
said. "I shot for about an hour each time. I was taking about 500 shots a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The three-point shots were the main thing, but I was also practicing other 
things. I was shooting off the dribble and I was working on pump fakes -- a lot 
of different stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Chelette, in his fifth season with the Marauders, has coached several 
outstanding players in his career. But he compares Prince's determination to 
that of only Joe Dumars, the Detroit Piston guard who played at McNeese State 
when Chelette was an assistant at the Lake Charles, La., school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe is the only other player I've coached who has the work habits Danny has," 
Chelette said. "And that's kind of ironic, because Joe is Danny's idol." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, who was primarily a point guard in high school, said the off-season 
drills were physically demanding but he never wavered. He has his sights set on 
a scholarship to a four-year school and sharpening his three-point shot could 
be his ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had agonizing pain in my shoulder (after the workouts)," Prince said. 
"My wrist ached a lot. My neck and my arm bothered me. Everything hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 The conditioning paid off and transformed him into a perfectionist. The night 
he sank 11 three-point baskets, Prince took 21 shots from beyond the line, 
seven more than in any game last season. Even the ones he made, however, didn't 
always meet his high standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some shots that went in that I didn't even like," Prince said. "In 
my mind, they don't count. If they touch the rim or the glass (backboard), it's 
like they don't count." 
</P>
<P>
 They do, however, especially in the eyes of Division I recruiters. Several 
schools, he said, including Cal State Fullerton, New Mexico State, Utah State 
and Oregon, have shown interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a Big West Conference convention when we play," Chelette said. 
"Everyone is here to watch him play." 
</P>
<P>
 And to see that Prince is much more than a ball hog.

FILLMORE HIRES WILBER; SANTA CLARA NAMES WEBER AND DOLBY

 Fillmore and Santa Clara high schools hired football coaches Friday. Fillmore 
named John Wilber to replace Curtis Garner, and Santa Clara chose Dick Weber 
and Dan Dolby Jr. as co-coaches to replace Tom O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 All three appointees attended the schools at which they now coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilber, a 1979 Fillmore graduate, had been the Flashes' basketball coach. He 
accepted the football job following the conclusion of Fillmore's 10-14 
basketball season that ended last week with a loss in the second round of the 
Southern Section Division IV-AA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner resigned after leading the Flashes to a 34-30 record in six seasons. 
Fillmore was 2-8 in 1993, 0-4 in Tri-Valley League play. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilber, who had a 33-7 record as the school's junior varsity football coach 
the past five seasons, has stepped down as basketball coach. Garner will remain 
at the school as a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm honored to be selected," Wilber said. "This high school and this 
community have always been very important to me and my family. My success in 
coaching at the junior varsity level was due to the great athletes I had . . . 
and the especially outstanding coaches who worked with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Fillmore vice-principal Joseph Pawlick said the school received resumes from 
20 coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some very qualified and highly interested applicants," he said. "But 
we waited until after basketball to see if John wanted to make the switch. This 
is the guy we wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great communicator and organizer. He works well with our kids. He has 
a knack for surrounding himself with great people." 
</P>
<P>
 The hirings of Weber and Dolby was confirmed by Sister Adrienne Clare, vice 
principal. Weber is a teacher at Santa Clara. Dolby will be a walk-on coach. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien had a 7-23 record in three seasons before resigning in January. The 
Saints were 2-8, 1-3 in the Frontier League last fall.

HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; OAK PARK SEASON ENDS AT FAMILIAR 
ROADBLOCK; SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION IV-A: EAGLES TURNED AWAY FOR SECOND 
CONSECUTIVE YEAR BY CROSSROADS AND TAKE 78-58 LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Same day one year later. Same fork in the road. Same path taken for Oak Park 
High's boys' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing Crossroads -- the team that handed it a double-digit defeat in the 
Southern Section playoffs exactly one year earlier -- Oak Park again took a 
wrong turn, losing, 78-58, Friday in the Division IV-A quarterfinal game at 
Santa Monica City College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tri-Valley League champion Eagles (22-3) led by six points midway through 
the first quarter and led, 30-29, at halftime after Nick Rattray hit a jump 
shot from the wing at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until the Roadrunners opened the third quarter with a 10-0 run that 
the Eagles appeared overmatched. But it became clear that another nice season 
for the Eagles would stop at Crossroads after the hosts outscored Oak Park, 
23-10, in the quarter to take a 52-40 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think last year's team was better," said Oak Park Coach Rob Hall about the 
Roadrunners. "But these guys are good." 
</P>
<P>
 Using a full-court press early and badgering Eagle guards from start to 
finish, Crossroads forced 15 turnovers. The defense led to easy baskets at the 
other end. KeJuan Woods and Lequan Tolbert each had 18 points as the 
Roadrunners put four scorers in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward Ryan Garth, who scored 37 points against St. Joseph in the 
first round, led Oak Park with 28. Center Darren Aherne had 11. With leading 
scorer Shawn Williams out with mononucleosis, Garth was forced to carry the 
Eagles on the offensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had only one scorer on the floor," Hall said. "Ryan had two or three guys 
on him every time he touched the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 That was OK for awhile. After nailing a three-point shot from the top of the 
key to make it 26-24, Crossroads, in the second quarter, Garth smiled as he ran 
back on defense. But with 1:12 left in the half, he was given a technical foul 
for elbowing, which led to two free throws by John Skinner and a two-point lead 
for Crossroads. And momentum began to change. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Roadrunners (17-7) jumped in front by nine in the third quarter, 
Garth closed the gap to 41-36 with a strong layup that produced a three-point 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Crossroads came back with 11 consecutive points to lead by 16, Oak 
Park's confidence crumbled. Brandon Creason missed two free throws and his 
teammates started throwing air balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if a healthy Williams might have made a difference, Garth mumbled, 
"Probably." Then the exhausted and dejected senior fell into a crouch and said 
no more.

HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; SAN DIMAS TURNS HARVARD INSIDE OUT; 
SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION III-A: SAINTS HIT THREE-POINTERS, DON'T LET COLLINS 
TWINS DOMINATE.

 They played the entire 32 minutes Friday night, but San Dimas High needed only 
six. 
</P>
<P>
 A third-quarter burst was the difference in the Saints' 73-64 victory over 
Harvard-Westlake in the Southern Section Division III-A semifinals at Glendora 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 36-33, at halftime, San Dimas started the third quarter with a 19-6 
run. In that stretch, San Dimas made four of five three-point shots. The Saints 
(24-4) made nine of 17 in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been shooting as well as we could," San Dimas Coach Gary 
Prestasater said. "I knew we could do it sometime." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Veal, the Saints' Arizona State-bound swingman, made three 
three-pointers and scored 23 points. Jason Koerner also had three 
three-pointers and Sean Smith made two. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't really know that about them," Harvard senior guard Scott Garson 
said of the three-point shooting. "We knew Jeremy Veal was a great player. They 
are a great team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saints will play in their third consecutive section championship game a 
week from today. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Harvard-Westlake (24-3) settled for a school record for victories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played pretty well," Wolverine Coach Greg Hilliard said. "We would have 
liked to get the ball inside more often, but in the heat of battle, kids don't 
always execute the way they are supposed to." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolverine 6-foot-7 freshman Jarron Collins scored 19 points. His twin brother 
Jason added 13 and Garson added 21, including four three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead changed hands 10 times and the score was tied seven times in the 
first half. Harvard took a three-point lead after one quarter on a 
buzzer-beating 50-foot shot by Bobby Ahn. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, Harvard dropped into a zone defense to protect the Collins 
twins from further foul trouble, but San Dimas then hit several open 
three-pointers to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
 When the lead got to 10 points late in the quarter, the Saints slowed the 
tempo, holding the ball for as long as 40 seconds at a time. The Wolverines 
spread their defense, setting up easy layups. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard pulled to within 59-56, but San Dimas made 10 of 11 free throws to 
seal the victory.

HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; PALMDALE'S LEAD, SEASON SLIP AWAY; 
SOUTHERN SECTION DIVISION I-A: AFTER FALCONS BLOW 16-POINT LEAD, EDISON GETS 
TURNOVER AND 65-63 VICTORY. 
</P>

<P>
 When Palmdale High deserted its effective inside game and tried to match 
Edison's outside shooting, the Falcons paid a heavy price. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison rallied from a 16-point deficit for a 65-63 victory Friday night in the 
Southern Section Division I-A semifinals in front of a rowdy crowd of about 
1,200 at Antelope Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Baird hit an 18-footer from the left side with two seconds left to put 
the Chargers (19-9) in the division final. The defeat snapped a 16-game winning 
streak for the Falcons (24-4). 
</P>
<P>
 "We took shots that we shouldn't have taken," Palmdale Coach Garry Phelps 
said. "And at the same time we couldn't stop them outside. I gotta hand it to 
them, they were very patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale's 16-point lead came with three minutes left in the second quarter 
and the Falcons held a 56-46 lead after three. 
</P>
<P>
 But Edison bombed its way back into the game from the outside. The Chargers 
opened the fourth quarter with an 11-2 run that left them trailing by one 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Micah Kroeger hit a five-foot jumper to tie the score, 61-61, with 
2:18 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale's Al Lairson hit a 15-foot jumper with 1:53 remaining to give the 
Falcons a 63-61 edge. Then Edison's Ali Tofighi sank two free throws to tie the 
score with just over a minute left. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale tried to run the clock out on its next possession but Lairson was 
called for traveling with 30 seconds left, setting the stage for Baird. 
</P>
<P>
 Lairson, a 6-foot-4 forward, scored 22 points, but was in tears after the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just trying to go for that last shot," Phelps said. "We thought we 
could do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Every Palmdale player should have been in tears after getting the second-half 
shooting statistics. The Falcons made only nine of 25 shots while Edison made 
15 of 25. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed as if Palmdale couldn't hit anything in the final minutes. The 
Falcons even tried going back to their consistent inside game, but it was too 
late. "Well we were pretty bad in the first half," Edison Coach Larry Hirst 
said. "And I was surprised that they didn't press us more. But I was impressed 
with their athleticism." 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeger scored 20 points for Edison and Darred Adams had 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice Wright scored 16 points for Palmdale, including a pair of spectacular 
dunks.

HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; WOUNDED RESEDA THWARTED; CITY 3-A 
DIVISION: REGENTS RALLY WITHOUT STAR GUARDS, FALL SHORT TO ROOSEVELT, 52-49. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With its two Division I recruits nursing injuries on the bench, Reseda High 
suffered from poor ball maintenance and three key mistakes in the game's final 
six seconds and lost to Roosevelt, 52-49, Friday night in a City Section 3-A 
Division quarterfinal playoff game at Birmingham High. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded Regents (18-2), playing without guards Trenton Cross and Archie 
Williams, were forced to play catch-up throughout most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross, who has committed to Cal State Northridge, suffered a season-ending 
foot injury a couple of weeks ago and watched helplessly from the bench in 
street clothes. At the other end sat Texas El Paso-bound Williams, who was 
dressed to play, but unable to bend his right knee, which he reinjured 
Wednesday in the Regents' first-round victory over San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Regents, who committed 21 turnovers, were clearly not the same team 
without their backcourt stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Reseda made a run at Roosevelt (13-11) late in the fourth quarter 
and finally tied it, 49-49, on a three-point basket by reserve Marc Harrel with 
53 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrel picked off a pass on the ensuing inbounds play, giving the Regents an 
opportunity for the winning basket. 
</P>
<P>
 But, all went wrong for Reseda thereafter. Damon Bailey drove to the basket 
and was whistled for charging with six seconds remaining. To make matters 
worse, it was Bailey's fifth foul. 
</P>
<P>
 With the game still tied, 49-49, Roosevelt inbounded the ball and started up 
the court when Harrel fouled Mario Hernandez with two seconds remaining before 
Hernandez had even crossed midcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who scored a team-high 20 points, buried two free throws for a 
two-point lead. But, as soon as Hernandez's second free throw fell through, the 
Regents called a timeout -- which they did not have. Hernandez went back to the 
line to shoot the two technical free throws and converted the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Roderick Jones' play was perhaps the force that kept the injury-riddled 
Regents in the game at all. Jones, who finished with a game-high 23 points and 
13 rebounds, scored 19 of Reseda's 26 first-half points.

HIGH SCHOOL BOYS' BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS; UC SANTA BARBARA USES TIPTOP TACTICS TO 
DOWN NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In terms of excitement, the volleyball tip ranks right up there with the 
opening tip in a basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a bunt compared to a grand slam. A changeup instead of a 
95-mile-per-hour fastball. 
</P>
<P>
 But in volleyball it can win a match. Such was the case Friday night as UC 
Santa Barbara defeated Cal State Northridge in a Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation match in the Northridge gym. 
</P>
<P>
 The line score will show the fifth game was the decisive one in a 15-13, 
12-15, 15-4, 9-15, 15-8 Gaucho victory. That is misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 The match was won when Santa Barbara managed to hold off a Northridge rally to 
take the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors entered the match unbeaten in six games over two matches at home 
this season, but the Gauchos succeeded in nibbling them to a slow death. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play very smart," Northridge Coach John Price said. "They tipped it 
what seemed like 1,000 times. And it cost us big points." 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy also caused the Matadors to bring up a back-row defender to 
protect against the tip play, leaving Northridge more vulnerable to typical 
bash-ball volleyball tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Donny Harris hammered home 33 kills in a pleasing homecoming of sorts. Harris, 
a 6-foot-7 redshirt freshman, said he was recruited light and late by 
Northridge two years ago out of La Canada High. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was OK, though," he said after running his team-high season kill total 
to 176. "I was set on (going to) Santa Barbara anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Score a recruiting coup for the Gauchos, who snapped a pair of Northridge 
winning streaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors had won their previous three matches and brought a five-match 
winning streak over Santa Barbara to Friday's match. The win improved the 
Gauchos to 7-6, 4-3 in conference matches. Northridge fell to 6-4, 2-2 in the 
MPSF. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you saw here were two very similar teams both struggling," Price said. 
"The difference was we were a little uglier in the games they won, and they 
were a little uglier in the games we won." 
</P>
<P>
 Price shuffled in fresh players at a brisk pace, but none of the combinations 
seemed to click. Oliver Heitmann was the only Northridge player steady on the 
attack. The 6-7 German import accounted for 24 kills and an attacking 
percentage of .450. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Collin Smith added 21 kills, but hit only .250, and the rest of the 
Matador attack was dismal. Jon Baer and Jason Hughes, who alternated at 
opposite hitter, had attacking percentages of .115 and .172, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Hewitt, usually a force in the middle, had only 11 kills and hit at a 
.103 clip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hewitt had an off night and both opposites had a bad night," Price said. 
"That we had any chance to win this match is an indication of how bad the match 
really was."

CSUN STILL CAN'T BRING ITSELF TO PULL RANK IN 5-4 DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Cal State Northridge Coach Bill Kernen keeps repeating the same sales pitch, 
over and over. Stop thinking trailer park in the boonies. Start thinking 
chateau on the French Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's the thing about the high-rent district. Sometimes, the payments are 
brutal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to believe we belong in the same neighborhood (as our competition)," 
Kernen said. "Man, we've bought a house already." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge again came close to knocking off one of the nation's best teams in 
the first round of the Florida Gator Slug-Fest on Friday, but failed to hold a 
pair of one-run leads and lost to sixth-ranked Oklahoma State, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the latest installment of the not-quite-ready-for-prime-time Matadors. 
But the margin is getting smaller by the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (4-7) lost its fourth consecutive game to a team ranked 13th or 
higher in the national polls. Pricey digs, to be sure, but Northridge has 
played in three consecutive NCAA Division I regionals, so Kernen says it's time 
the players believe they own the penthouse deed, not a lease. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is where we live," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And living on the edge, as usual. The Matadors have played in six one-run 
games, winning two. Kernen said it should never have come to that against the 
Cowboys, Big 8 Conference champions since 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting pitcher Marco Contreras couldn't throw the ball between the backstop 
poles early, but recovered in time to keep the Matadors in the game. In the 
second inning, Contreras walked four batters and threw 39 pitches as Oklahoma 
State (7-1) scored twice on one hit to take a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Thereafter, he walked . . . zero. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the tough thing about being a pitcher," said Contreras, who allowed 
seven hits and struck out four in eight innings. "Now I've got to live with 
this for whole 'nother week." 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras (1-3) said he felt stronger as the game progressed, and it showed. 
The offense couldn't say the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors managed one hit after the fifth inning against right-handers 
Jason Bell (3-0) and Rob Gaiko. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaiko, a right-hander who throws side-arm, pitched a scoreless ninth to earn 
his first save, but he shed a few beads of perspiration. Kevin Howard opened 
the inning by reaching first on shortstop Beau Champoux's throwing error. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaiko, though, chalked up Eric Gillespie on a called third strike and retired 
Jason Shanahan on a fly to left. Tyler Nelson, who had reached base nine times 
over the past three games and singled once in his first three at-bats, took a 
called third strike on an 0-and-2 pitch to end it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rolled four zeros at the end," Nelson said. "The offense only played half 
a game. Marco pitched well enough to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 2-0, in the fourth, the Matadors took advantage of another error by 
Champoux and scored three times. Joey Arnold doubled and with one out, scored 
from third on a grounder by Keyaan Cook that Champoux threw away at first. 
Gillespie followed with a two-run homer over the scoreboard in right-center for 
a 3-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't last long. Roberto Lopez, who earlier this season broke an Oklahoma 
State record with hits in 10 consecutive at-bats, beat out a bunt. Lopez, who 
was born in Puerto Rico, stole second base. 
</P>
<P>
 The throw by Northridge catcher Josh Smaler was on the bag at second, but 
shortstop Chad Thornhill didn't glove it. Lopez bolted for third as Jake Benz 
grounded to the right side and didn't so much as slow down while rounding 
third. After Shanahan flipped to Contreras covering at first for a 3-1 putout, 
Lopez beat the throw home to tie the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge took a 4-3 lead in the fifth when Nelson scored on a groundout by 
Arnold, but again, it didn't last. 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner had it been announced that Contreras was preparing to throw his 
100th pitch than did outfielder Peter Prodanov hit it 100-and-some yards over 
the fence in left to tie it, 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
 It was tied until the seventh, when Benz stepped in to lead off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't swung at the first pitch any of the other times up," he said. "I 
guess I gave them the impression that I always take the first pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 He took it, all right. Right over the fence in right-center for a game-winning 
homer.

CITY SECTION WRESTLING; ULLMAN KEEPING A PRESIDENT'S SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As did the rest of his classmates at El Camino Real High, Rick Ullman finally 
returned to school Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ullman spent much of his time during the five-week break on the 
Conquistadore campus anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Camino Real senior class president spent the past few weeks 
representing students to determine a schedule for the quake-damaged school in 
discussions with administrators. He attended a two-hour advanced-placement 
economics class in an undamaged bungalow on campus each morning. 
</P>
<P>
 He also found time to prepare for the City Section wrestling championships, 
scheduled for today at Bell High. The preliminary round will begin at 11:15 
a.m. with the finals scheduled to begin at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman, 22-2 in the 152-pound class, is a favorite to win a City title and 
advance to the state championships next weekend in Stockton. Only the champion 
in each weight class advances. Ullman placed second in the City at 152 last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend Ullman won the Valley League title and was named the outstanding 
wrestler in the upper-weight division. El Camino Real won the team title with 
163 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman's only two losses this season came in the Morro Bay tournament, a meet 
that featured many of the state's top wrestlers. In the Alemany tournament 
earlier this season, Ullman pinned two opponents, shut out a third and was 
named the outstanding wrestler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything has gone really well this season," Ullman said. "Winning the City 
has been my goal, and if everything goes well there, then it'll be a success." 
</P>
<P>
 The mat isn't the only place Ullman has succeeded. Besides his duty as senior 
class president, Ullman recently was appointed to the Naval Academy in 
Annapolis, Md., and hopes ultimately to be a fighter pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman is also a top performer on the Conquistadore swim team, specializing in 
the breaststroke and 200 individual medley. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Swimming) practice started this past week but I've been busy with other 
things, including the wrestling," Ullman said. "I'm supposed to start next 
week, but that might change depending on this weekend. I'll probably have to go 
talk to the swim coach again." 
</P>
<P>
 Ullman turned to wrestling through the swim team. As a freshman, he planned to 
compete in swimming only but a teammate convinced him to try wrestling his 
sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure who it was that brought him over," Conquistadore wrestling Coach 
Terry Fischer said, "but (Ullman has) been our most consistent guy the last two 
seasons." 
</P>
<P>
 After the earthquake, when Ullman wasn't at school, he spent afternoons 
repairing an outside wall at his home or working on his sister's house in 
Chatsworth. "But now it's back to school and back to some kind of normalcy," 
Ullman said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino Real has the best chance of unseating defending City champion Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe finished second in the Central League and is led by Alfonso Brizuela at 
125 pounds. Jose Barahona, a City champion at 125 pounds for Canoga Park, 
returns at 130. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior twins Fernando (135 pounds) and Armando Avila (140) of Chatsworth won 
City titles at 145 and 140 last year.

 Trailing, 5-2, after three innings, Pierce (3-5) tied the score in the fourth 
on a bases-loaded double by Tapia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brahmas took a 7-5 lead in the sixth when Martinez singled with two out, 
stole second and scored on Brian Sturges' double. Sturges scored on a single by 
Tapia. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricky Staves (1-0) won in relief of Jason Warren. Staves entered the game with 
two out in the third, the bases loaded and Pierce trailing, 5-2. He retired the 
first batter he faced and allowed four hits and a run in 4 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura 5, Southwestern 5 -- The Pirates advanced to the quarter -- finals of 
the San Bernardino tournament by outhitting Southwestern, 10-6.

score, 5-5. Robert Fick was four for five for Ventura (6-2). 
</P>
<P>
 East L.A. 8, Canyons 6 (10 innings) -- Fernando Pina went four for five and

LOFTON WILL MISS LAST 2 GAMES FOR NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge's basketball team will finish its season without forward 
Brent Lofton, one of its top offensive players. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Matadors leave for Birmingham, Ala., today, Lofton will stay behind 
on the advice of team doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard Coskey, a heart specialist, administered electrocardiogram and 
echocardiogram tests on Lofton in Tarzana on Friday. The results of both, 
Lofton said, were inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart looks abnormal, but that's not necessarily bad because an athlete's 
heart usually isn't (normal)," Lofton said. "They just don't know exactly 
what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Lofton will be further examined next week, starting with a treadmill test on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm done with this season," he said. The 6-foot-5 senior is averaging 9.6 
points and has provided a spark off the bench recently. In his last seven 
games, Lofton scored 96 points and grabbed 39 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Lofton, experiencing upper chest pains and shortness of breath, checked into 
the Northridge Student Health Center on Tuesday. The results of an 
electrocardiogram administered that day kept him out of the Matadors' game 
against Southern Utah on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed I can't play, but I'm glad I went in," Lofton said. "I'd 
rather be alive than out there playing and have something happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (7-17) plays at Alabama Birmingham on Sunday. The Matadors conclude 
their season at San Diego State on Thursday night.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: WITH SECURED VARSITY STATUS, FICK ROLLS ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This time last baseball season, Chris Fick was on the verge of being left on 
the Cal Lutheran junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is among the most-feared hitters in the NCAA Division III. 
</P>
<P>
 Fick went on to earn All-Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic 
Conference and All-Western Region honors as a designated hitter last season. 
And he has picked up where he left off. 
</P>
<P>
 In Cal Lutheran's last four games before Friday, Fick had 10 hits in 14 
at-bats, including four home runs. He was six for nine last weekend with 10 
runs batted in as the Kingsmen swept three games from Pomona-Pitzer. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, he came back with a 4-for-5 performance against The Master's as Cal 
Lutheran came back from an 8-1 deficit to forge a 10-10 tie in a game called by 
darkness. Fick's double with two out in the bottom of the seventh drove in the 
tying run. CAL LUTHERAN 
</P>
<P>
 Get-Tough Policy 
</P>
<P>
 An attitude adjustment seems to have worked for Rupert Sapwell (6-foot-6, 
220), who has moved from center to forward on the basketball team. He has made 
25 of 37 shots from the field in three games after suffering through his worst 
shooting performance of the season (three of 15) in last week's 85-76 overtime 
loss to Pomona-Pitzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's made a breakthrough," Coach Mike Dunlap said. "He's starting to assert 
himself more and that's what I want. Against Pomona, he looked very tentative 
at times. But after that game, I told him that he needs to be more aggressive. 
I don't care if he gets called for charging, just as long as he takes the ball 
to the cylinder." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Kingsmen baseball team trailed Master's, 8-0, after an inning and a half 
on Monday even though the Mustangs had only one hit, a looping single. 
</P>
<P>
 In Master's first two at-bats, Cal Lutheran issued eight walks and hit four 
batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Wagner, a junior left-hander, was wild in his debut as a starting pitcher 
for the Kingsmen. "We threw him in there with the lions," Coach Marty Slimak 
said, "and the lions ate him." JUNIOR COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Canyons Scramble 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Peterson, golf coach at College of the Canyons, says the competition is 
heating up for the top six spots on the roster of the defending state champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last week in March, we play in the Monterey Peninsula College Golf 
Invitational at Pebble Beach," Peterson said. "I only take six players and they 
all want to go. They are fighting tooth and nail." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, who are coming off a 28-2 season and their third Western State 
Conference championship in five years, have only two returnees among the 12 
players trying to crack the top six positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Returnees Andy Houlette from Saugus High and Adam Hill from Hart head an 
inexperienced-but-promising group that Peterson hopes will mature quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very young team and they are playing like it, too," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The newcomers are redshirt freshmen Mike O'Brien and Jason Black from Hart, 
and Jason Wolter from Canyon. Others include Paul Muniz (Granada Hills), Glenn 
Musser (Alemany) and Ryan Shaffer (Crescenta Valley). 
</P>
<P>
 Canadians Jason Tlosz and Marshall Patterson, Ryan Caress from Utah and Perry 
Denardo from Pennsylvania also are competing for spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said the players' rankings on the team change almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in a three-week rotation to handicap the guys," Peterson said. "We 
play three times a week and it takes nine rounds to generate the handicaps. 
They are seeded according to how they shoot in those rounds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his two basketball seasons at Ventura, forward Calvin Curry thrilled crowds 
with his super-long three-point shots. He is doing the same in his first season 
at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've invented a new stat for Curry," Billy Tubbs, the Sooner coach, said 
recently. "We're going to go with total footage." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In a roller-coaster season marred by injuries and other adversities, the 
Glendale men's basketball team was on the brink of disaster several times but 
managed to avoid a collapse. Now, the Vaqueros (15-14) find themselves in the 
Southern California regional with a first-round game against Southwestern 
(24-5) tonight in Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale opened the season with five victories in six games, but injuries to 
6-5 point guard Maurice Sowells and forward Michael Wright proved costly for 
the Vaqueros, who lost five consecutive games in January before rallying in WSC 
South Division play. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale, seeded 22nd in the regional, finished tied with Santa Monica for 
third place in the South with a 6-4 record. The Vaqueros are seeded one slot 
higher than Santa Monica because they beat the Corsairs twice in head-to-head 
competition in conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a group of guys who kind of maintained through it all," Coach Brian 
Beauchemin said. "I think we did reasonably well under the circumstances. . . . 
We are privileged to be in the playoffs." CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise Starter 
</P>
<P>
 The men's volleyball lineup has among its ranks a highly regarded freshman, 
but not the one who was expected to make the most-immediate impact. 
</P>
<P>
 While Jason Hughes, a top junior national player, is in a battle with Jon Baer 
for playing time at the opposite hitter position, Collin Smith has taken over 
at one of the outside hitter spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, from Santa Cruz Soquel High, beat out Cameron Green for a starting 
position during training camp. Since then, he has further secured his role. 
</P>
<P>
 He is second on the team with 59 digs and third in kills with 74. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's steady play has been somewhat of a surprise, though not totally 
unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expected a lot out of him," said Tim Koth, a Matador assistant. "We just 
weren't sure how soon it would happen." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Oliver Heitmann has been playing volleyball in the United States for a month. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been attending university classes at Northridge for two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But he was not "Matadorized" until Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 When some two dozen crazily attired "Matamaniacs" made their usual raucous 
appearance during the first half of Northridge's basketball game against 
Southern Utah, Heitmann, a 6-7 native of Hamburg, Germany, was, for the first 
time, among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Suffice it to say that his debut was not his idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, Coley Kyman and Chris McGee left him no other alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't give him an option," said John Price, Northridge's volleyball 
coach. "He didn't know what was going on. They just gave him some stuff to wear 
and said, 'Here, put this on.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Matamaniacs were regulars at basketball games in Kyman's four years as a 
full-time student at Northridge. This season, however, they have brought their 
zaniness to only the last two contests. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, they missed their ringleader. 
</P>
<P>
 Kyman, who created the group along with volleyball teammates McGee and Matt 
Unger, returned to Northridge two weeks ago. Before that, he was in Colorado 
Springs, Colo., rehabilitating his surgically repaired knee at the U.S. Olympic 
Training Center. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 For the past two seasons, Andre Chevalier and Brooklyn McLinn have had a 
friendly competition to see which player could account for the most steals. 
</P>
<P>
 McLinn was the winner last season with 49, three more than Chevalier. 
</P>
<P>
 And going into Thursday's game against Southern Utah, McLinn appeared as if he 
would repeat. He already had 51 steals, five more than Chevalier. 
</P>
<P>
 Not any more. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier had six swipes against Southern Utah to McLinn's two. With two games 
remaining, they are neck and neck, but each with only an outside chance of 
reaching the Northridge season record of 62, set by Derrick Gathers in 1982-83. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nice choice: On the cover of the game program for last Saturday's basketball 
game against Sacramento was a large picture of Matador forward Chris Yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Yard is healing from a torn knee ligament and a broken hand. Not only is he 
out for the season, but he also has not played since Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When during a game can a coach relax and enjoy himself? If you are Matador 
Coach Pete Cassidy, apparently never. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge was leading Sacramento, 80-44, last weekend with three minutes to 
play, and there Cassidy was, his head buried in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Ozan Korkut, a reserve guard, had just committed a turnover by throwing the 
ball away while attempting a wraparound pass on a fast break. Were the score 
any closer, Korkut would soon have been seated alongside his coach on the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
 As it was, Cassidy grimaced and bore it. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, patience paid dividends. About a minute later, Korkut, a walk-on from 
Istanbul, Turkey, drilled a three-point baseline jumper. He also scored on a 
layup. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The baseball team has posted a 2-1 record as the home team, but the mark 
deserves an asterisk. Because of earthquake-related problems, one Matador home 
game was played at Pierce College and another at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Northridge is not scheduled to play its second game at Matador Field 
until Wednesday against Cal Baptist. The third home game is the WAC opener with 
Hawaii on March 13. The WAC opener will mark the team's 20th game of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Northridge was 22-6 at home, 12-13 on the road and 2-1 at neutral 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Home sweet home? Well, maybe. In its lone game at Matador Field, Northridge 
was blanked by Fullerton, 1-0. THE MASTER'S 
</P>
<P>
 On the Rebound 
</P>
<P>
 It would be easy to blame Emeka Okenwa's poor free-throw shooting (zero for 
seven) for the Mustangs' 88-84 loss to Biola last week, but it was their 
inability to keep the Eagles off the offensive boards that ruined their 13-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Master's (26-4) outrebounded Biola, 37-25, in an 84-75 victory over the Eagles 
on Feb. 4, but the Mustangs were hammered, 55-37, in that department last week, 
including a 26-14 deficit on the offensive glass. 
</P>
<P>
 There were times when even the 6-7, 230-pound Okenwa was getting shoved 
around. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Okenwa followed his 0-for-7 free-throw performance against Biola with a 
4-for-4 outing against American Indian Bible on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Biola game, Okenwa had made 11 of 13 free throws. Around the 
Campuses . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * Ventura's Brandon Jessie led the WSC men in scoring (22.5 points) and 
rebounds (10.7), and Moorpark's Sean Martin led in assists (8.1). 
</P>
<P>
 * Julie Hardy of Ventura finished second among WSC women in scoring with a 
21.6-point average and Rebekah Cunnan of Canyons was third at 18.8 points. 
Terra Bruessel of Canyons led in assists with a 7.7 average. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dave Ulloa is ranked 18th on Cal Lutheran's single-season and career assists 
lists with 108 and 186. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the second time in his four-year career, Andre Chevalier led Northridge 
in rebounding for a game. The 6-foot senior point guard grabbed six against 
Southern Utah, equaling his career high. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chevalier, who needs 35 points in two games to tie Jim Malkin's Matador 
career scoring record of 1,301, has reached double figures in scoring in five 
consecutive games and nine of the last 10. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forward Peter Micelli has been Northridge's most-consistent scorer lately 
with seven consecutive games in double figures. During the stretch, Micelli's 
high is 17 and his low is 12.

DISNEY TO LAY OFF 360 AT FLORIDA PARK; CUTS EXPECTED IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Still reeling from theme park losses in Europe, the Walt Disney Co. Friday 
said that it will dismiss 360 employees from its Walt Disney World resort in 
Florida. An unspecified number of job losses also are anticipated at 
Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Expect reductions at Disneyland," Judson C. Green, president of Disney's 
theme park division, told a group of park managers at a Jan. 27 meeting. He 
said the cuts will be "relatively minor in the big picture" but that slimmer 
operations have been "part of doing business in the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 A Disneyland spokesman said there were no layoffs on Friday at the Anaheim 
attraction, which has 6,000 employees in the winter and up to 9,000 workers 
during the peak summer season. 
</P>
<P>
 Company sources say the theme park has been suffering lately from weak 
attendance compared to past years, as evidenced by how the park is keeping a 
reduced admission price of $22 for Southern California residents in place 
through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 At the managers meeting, Green and Disneyland Executive Vice President Norm 
Doerges painted a rosier picture. They said that group sales have increased and 
that park attendance appears to be rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
 Times have changed because of increased competition, however, and Disneyland 
must work harder to lure patrons, said Green, adding that the cutbacks will 
affect the entire corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 360 workers to be cut at Walt Disney World represent 1% of the work force 
of 36,000. Spokeswoman Jane Adams said the cuts were part of a larger 
restructuring aimed at boosting financial growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has been under pressure to perform because of the failure of the 
Euro Disneyland theme park outside Paris, of which the corporation owns about 
half. The park lost more than $900 million last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development at its resort outside Orlando, Disney said it is 
dropping Michael Jackson's 3-D "Captain Eo" movie at Epcot Center. "Captain Eo" 
will be replaced this fall at Epcot by "Honey I Shrunk the Audience" but will 
continue at Disneyland and at the Disney park in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the decision had nothing to do with claims that the performer 
sexually molested a teen-age boy. "We have to keep offering something new," 
said David Herbst, a Disney spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 In Anaheim, a Disneyland spokesman said that the Jackson movie will continue 
to play in Tomorrowland. It could be replaced next year, but the change would 
also be to simply bring the audience something new -- not because of the 
singer's legal troubles.

 Doubletree Owners File Chapter 11: A limited partnership based in Irvine that

KEY DEPARTURE AT CRUTTENDEN 'PHILOSOPHICAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A key executive at Cruttenden & Co., Orange County's largest investment bank, 
has left the firm reportedly because of philosophical differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley Weddon, manager of retail sales for more than three years, reportedly 
left Cruttenden on Wednesday, just as the Irvine-based company is undergoing a 
major ownership shift. 
</P>
<P>
 Weddon did not return phone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've parted company. There was a difference in general philosophy," said 
Walter Cruttenden III, chairman and chief executive. "He didn't quit, but it 
was a sort of parting of the ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Cruttenden has not selected a replacement for Weddon, who, as branch manager 
of the Irvine office, supervised nearly 25 Cruttenden brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great guy and he'll be snapped up. While he was here he grew the 
company in a lot of ways," said Cruttenden. 
</P>
<P>
 Before being hired by Cruttenden in October, 1990, Weddon spent five years 
with Prudential-Bache Securities, according to the National Assn. of Securities 
Dealers Inc., an organization which regulates stock brokers.  
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Cruttenden & Co. announced that its corporate finance 
chief, Byron Roth, 31, was promoted to president. Roth and two other executives 
are negotiating to buy 22% of Cruttenden from Vista Ventures, a Connecticut 
venture-capital firm. Walter Cruttenden, with a 35% stake, will remain the 
largest shareholder. He said Friday the deal was nearly complete.

 Trimedyne Hit by Patent Lawsuit: Trimedyne Inc., a maker of medical laser 
products, is the target of a suit alleging patent infringement. Coherent Inc., 
a Santa Clara laser systems manufacturer, has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District 
Court in San Francisco alleging Trimedyne in Irvine is infringing on three 
patents covering the use of a type of laser in orthopedic surgery and a laser 
tool.Trimedyne Chairman Marvin P. Loeb said the lawsuit is without merit. "In 
our opinion, the patents are invalid and may have been obtained improperly. 
What they are doing is trying to damage our business," Loeb said. Coherent said 
its laser system was the first of its type to be cleared by the Food and Drug 
Administration. The laser, delivered through small fiber-optic probes, is 
finding widespread applications in minimally invasive surgery, the company 
said. In very heavy trading, Trimedyne stock was down 87.5 cents, closing at 
$13.875 per share on Nasdaq.

 Trust Buys Mission Viejo Apartments: A real estate investment trust in Chicago 
has purchased a 608-unit apartment complex in Mission Viejo called Vista del 
Lago, but it would disclose few other details of the transaction. Equity 
Residential Properties Trust said Thursday that it had bought five apartment 
complexes nationwide, containing a total of 2,124 units, for $124.6 million.Two 
of the complexes are located in Charlotte, N.C., with the others in Palatine, 
Ill., and Southfield, Mich. The Mission Viejo apartment complex is located at 
21622 Marguerite Parkway. With the purchase, the company now owns 86 apartment 
communities with 26,984 units, which it says makes it the nation's largest 
publicly traded, apartment-owning REIT. The company's stock was down $1.25 a 
share Thursday, closing at $32 on the New York Stock Exchange.

 Recycling -- The attorneys general of California and 10 other states have said
