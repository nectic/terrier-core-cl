 REACHING OUT: Ain't no mountain high enough to keep emergency call boxes off 
Pacific Coast Highway. . . . Having overcome transmission problems caused by 
the coastal mountains, transportation officials are now ready to install 28 
call boxes along a stretch of the highway between Mugu Rock and the Ventura 
County line. . . . "It's a very unforgiving road," said Mary Travis, 
transportation commission spokeswoman. "We know from our success with call 
boxes on other routes how critical they can be in times of accidents or 
emergencies."

 HOLY GUACAMOLE: Grand theft avocado. That's what two men have been charged 
with after allegedly stealing 1,800 pounds of avocados from a Saticoy orchard. 
. . . Two grove workers called police recently after they saw the pair raiding 
the orchard. . . . For their help, each of the workers received a $250 reward 
from the California Avocado Commission. Since 1990, the commission has 
recovered nearly 36,000 pounds of avocados.

 STAYING ALIVE: Guadalupe Govea's blood cells lie in a deep freeze at Westlake 
Comprehensive Cancer Center, waiting to give her a fighting chance at life 
(B5). . . . The Moorpark woman is taking part in an innovative bone marrow 
transplant procedure being offered locally for the first time. . . . "My doctor 
told me if I get another cancer anywhere else in my body there would be nothing 
that they could do," Govea said. "From what I understand, after this I won't 
have cancer at all."

 CD PLAYERS: Technicolor Inc.'s Camarillo plant is becoming a major player in 
the production of CDs and CD-ROMs (Valley Business, Page 8). . . . Since the 
company added a compact-disc duplicating unit to its video operation in 
February, it has produced 2 million of the discs. . . . The expansion has added 
110 new workers at the former Everest & Jennings Inc. wheelchair plant, 
bringing its total payroll to 1,200. The division expects to hire 40 more 
workers next year.

MEDICAL TRAINING FOR ABORTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I consider Katherine Dowling's anti-abortion article, "No Choice for 
Hospitals" (Commentary, July 20), confusing and lacking in relevant 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 While I am sure it is true that more than 20% of abortions in this country are 
done after the first trimester, Dowling does not mention that the vast majority 
are done before the third trimester, when the procedure is done only if the 
life of the mother is endangered. She also completely fails to mention the 
increased maternal mortality that would occur if safe abortions were 
unavailable and they were performed by untrained personnel. With the increasing 
ability of medical technology to diagnose lethal and/or catastrophic disorders 
prenatally, the availability of safe, legal abortions becomes ever more 
important. This does not take into account the numbers of women who, for 
personal reasons (teen-age pregnancy, financial insecurity, drug or alcohol use 
during pregnancy, high-risk pregnancy, etc.), seek their constitutional right 
to a safe and legal abortion. It is incumbent on medical schools and hospitals 
to provide training in abortion technology in their obstetrical/gynecological 
residency programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catholic hospitals and medical schools that refuse to sanction abortions 
are out of step with current philosophy for the majority of Americans. It is 
unfortunate that they provide inadequate ob/gyn programs to their residents. We 
need well-trained physicians in this increasingly important specialty.

 Dowling's article states that 20% of all abortions occur in the second and 
third trimester. While she is quick to give the graphic details of the 
procedure, as a true anti-abortionist always does, she never explains that only 
1% of legal abortions take place in the third trimester (about 160 per year). 
She also never mentions that these procedures are always medically necessary 
and are to save the life of the woman.  
</P>
<P>
 Abortion is a medical procedure that is a part of a woman's total reproductive 
health care. The Catholic Church is also against contraception and infertility 
procedures. Should these areas of education also be omitted? Doctors should 
learn this procedure no matter what type of medical school they attend 
(Catholic or otherwise). They just might need it to save a woman's life.

 Republican Govs. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and Pete Wilson of 
California recently stated their intention to work for the exclusion from the 
1996 Republican National Platform of the principle that the unborn child has a 
fundamental individual right to life. They say that the recognition of that 
right, and opposition to the practice of abortion, is not an appropriate 
position for the Republican Party to take because abortion is a "personal" 
decision and should not be a political issue. 
</P>
<P>
 What is "personal" about U.S. citizens being forced to pay for abortions? What 
is "personal" about public policies and laws that create programs to carry out 
experiments on freshly aborted fetal tissue?  
</P>
<P>
 The Roe vs. Wade decision, which legalized abortion throughout nine months of 
pregnancy, has propelled us into an era in which lawmakers and public-policy 
experts are dealing on a daily basis with issues that 30 years ago seemed 
unthinkable. Are women entitled to informed consent before they submit to an 
abortion? Should parents have the right to consent to medical treatment for 
their minor children -- except for abortion? Will legislators decide that 
people have a right to commit suicide? Can those who are extremely ill be 
denied nutrition and hydration? Far from being "personal," the life issues are 
a very public matter indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of American voters expect the Republican Party to remain 
pro-life, and we don't intend to disappoint them.

 Re "Bishops Should Sit This One Out," by Andrew Greeley, Commentary, July 25: 
</P>
<P>
 While it never surprises me to see Father Andrew Greeley at odds with the 
bishops of our church, it does disturb me that he, a priest and a sociologist, 
would position himself at odds with the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Greeley claims that the U.S. bishops, by opposing mandatory abortion coverage 
in any comprehensive health-care package, are "trying to force on Americans 
moral principles that the majority do not share, including the majority of 
Catholics." This is simply not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls consistently show that a significant majority of Americans do not want 
to pay for someone else's choice to kill her pre-born baby and do not want 
abortion as part of the basic benefits in any health-reform bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Greeley fears that the bishops will be cast as the "bad guys" if universal 
coverage (which they, like most Americans, favor) fails because of the abortion 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 I submit that the real villains are those pro-abortion members of Congress who 
have vowed to torpedo any health-care bill that does not include mandatory 
abortion coverage, the will of the American people be damned.

POOR DEFENDANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times has done a disservice by printing as true and accurate the article 
by Charles Lindner "The Case for the Defense -- If You're Poor and Charged With 
Murder" (Opinion, July 17).  
</P>
<P>
 It is hypocritical for Lindner to refer to his colleagues in the 
court-appointed Bar and in the public defender's office as "broken down Yugos." 
It is hypocritical because Lindner was a member of that very fleet until 18 
months ago when he was refused admission to the court's new flat-fee panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindner's comments denigrate some of the finest lawyers in the U.S., both in 
the public defender's office and those in private practice who accept court 
appointments in capital cases. These lawyers are experts in this area. This 
group of lawyers has succeeded in limiting the number of death verdicts in the 
Central District to 10 in the last six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in the method of payment to attorneys representing indigent capital 
defendants was not unilaterally accomplished by judges but was instituted after 
two years of discussion and negotiation between the L.A. County Bar and the 
Superior Court.  
</P>
<P>
 Lindner writes that in the first year of the new policy there were as many 
death verdicts as there were in the previous six years combined. Only one 
flat-fee capital case has gone to penalty verdict since the new policy was 
instituted. In that case, the verdict was life without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Your readers have been told that attorneys are paid a flat fee of $60,000 per 
case. In fact, each capital case is graded by degree of difficulty into four 
grades. The flat fees are as follows: $60,000, $90,000, $125,000 and 
$200,000-plus. The amount of expense money granted for the hiring of experts 
and others is hinged to the grade of the case and given to the lawyer to spend 
as he or she sees fit.  
</P>
<P>
 It is blatantly untrue that "lawyers have had their pay cut each time they won 
a motion, causing a direct conflict of interest with their clients." Only one 
type of motion could result in a reduction of the flat fee and that is a 
successful motion to dismiss the special circumstances. This is because the 
case could no longer be a capital case or that the case would be terminated.

PRESCRIPTION LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was just informed that after Sept. 1 all Medi-Cal recipients would be 
restricted to six prescriptions per month for medicine and pharmacists fees 
would be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 As a pharmacist providing pharmacy services to board-and-care homes for mostly 
mentally ill patients, this will be a disaster for the patients and a disaster 
for the financial state of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicine is the only thing that is keeping many of the patients out of 
acute-care hospitals. Restricting patients, who are unable to pay, to six 
prescriptions will force these people into overcrowded acute-care hospitals for 
which the state costs will skyrocket. How will the state pay for the increased 
expense of hospitalization?

THE DRAGNET AGAINST DRUNK DRIVERS; IMAGINATIVE SHERIFFS' PROGRAM, BACKED BY 
STATE AID, RATCHETS UP THE PRESSURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New laws and a less tolerant attitude in much of society have helped cut down 
on drunken driving, according to state officials. One successful approach worth 
watching is regionalizing the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department now has a program specifically 
designed to find intoxicated motorists and get them off the road in the area 
patrolled by its City of Industry substation. The deputies patrol Industry, La 
Habra Heights and La Puente, cities that contract with the sheriff, as well as 
the adjacent unincorporated county territory. 
</P>
<P>
 In southern Orange County, an even bigger program has been under way for seven 
months. The Orange County Sheriff's Department has deputies devoted exclusively 
to cracking down on drunken driving in seven cities it patrols. The program has 
now expanded to include sobriety checkpoints. 
</P>
<P>
 In both counties, money for the program has been provided by the Office of 
Traffic Safety, a state agency that funnels federal funds to localities. The 
Orange County cities of Dana Point, Laguna Hills, Laguna Niguel, Lake Forest, 
Mission Viejo, San Clemente and San Juan Capistrano are also contributing 
$18,000 each during the two-year program. Since their inception, the patrols 
have accounted for one-quarter of the arrests for driving under the influence 
in the area. The DUI arrest total is up 15% during the period. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes sense for several patrol cars whose only job for the night is finding 
drunk drivers to be given as wide an area as possible. Spreading the net 
increases the chances of arrests and attacks a problem that does not recognize 
city boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional approach is part of a coordinated attack on the problem that has 
showed results. Four years ago, the amount of alcohol in the blood required 
before a motorist was presumed guilty of DUI was cut from .10% to 0.08%. Then 
police were given the right to take the driver's licenses of those suspected of 
drunk driving. Last year, the California Supreme Court ruled that the location 
of sobriety checkpoints need not be publicized. And the public has been 
increasingly unforgiving of those who drink and drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the California Highway Patrol reported that last year 1,569 people were 
killed and 42,936 injured in state accidents in which alcohol was a factor. If 
the regional approach helps cut those horrific statistics, it will be worth 
imitating in other jurisdictions where sheriff's departments provide services 
to a group of communities.

A JUDGE WHO DISRESPECTS DAY CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If nothing else, the recent decision by Michigan Circuit Judge Raymond R. 
Cashen to remove a child from the custody of a mother who placed her in day 
care demonstrates that the judge should be reading more widely.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his lawbooks, Cashen should look at the June issue of the 
Monthly Labor Review, published by the U.S. Department of Labor. There he might 
be surprised to learn that almost half of U.S. children now live in families 
where Mom works outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 20 years, the proportions of married mothers in the labor force 
rose dramatically. By 1992, the Monthly Labor Review reports, two-thirds of all 
married mothers were working or looking for work. That's married mothers, those 
women who presumably have some choice in the matter. Unmarried mothers, like 
Jennifer Ireland, the woman in the Michigan case, do not even have that luxury. 
They have no choice, save welfare, but to work outside the home or acquire the 
skills to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland, a mother at 16, has chosen education and gainful employment over a 
potentially dead-end existence on welfare. But incredulously, that decision has 
cost her physical custody of her 3-year old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland and the father of her child never married. She lived at home in Mt. 
Clemens while finishing high school; her mother cared for the baby. Last fall 
Ireland moved to Ann Arbor to attend the University of Michigan on a full 
scholarship. She enrolled her daughter in day care. Even Judge Cashen says it's 
good, licensed day care, in a private home.  
</P>
<P>
 But last week Cashen awarded custody of the girl to her father, who did not 
see her during her first year, solely because his mother has promised to care 
for the child full-time while he's at work. Ireland is appealing the decision. 
Despite what even Judge Cashen acknowledges is a deep, positive bond between 
Ireland and her daughter, he ruled that day care by blood relatives is 
inherently superior to care by anyone else and this factor should determine 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the judge should also spend some time with a recent study by the 
Families and Work Institute, which found that care by relatives was often no 
better, and sometimes worse, than that by day-care centers. And when he's 
finished, he should think hard about whether he might not harbor an unspoken 
bias against the growing millions of mothers who work, whether by choice or 
necessity.

 * Thank you for your editorial, "Libraries Get a Renewed Shelf Life" (July 
25). The proposed County Library Community Facilities District (CFD) would cost

COLUMN LEFT/ HARRY BERNSTEIN: BUS MECHANICS WIN ONE FOR ALL WORKERS; THE MTA 
BOARD'S ATTEMPT TO DIVIDE THE UNIONS WAS INTENDED, LONG-RANGE, TO BREAK THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HARRY BERNSTEIN, Harry Bernstein for many years was The Times' labor writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tentative agreement reached early Monday to end the crippling strike 
against the Metropolitan Transportation Authority certainly did not mean that 
MTA had broken the mechanics' strike or ended the long-range hopes of some 
transit board members to break the unions themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But the unity of the striking mechanics, along with clerks, drivers and others 
who observed the mechanics' picket lines, must have dampened the hopes of the 
true anti-union MTA board members. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise settlement provides some very limited contracting out of jobs, 
but far less than management demanded, along the lines previously accepted by 
clerks and drivers. While final terms of the proposed agreement are still 
confidential, the strike kept the number of potential job losses to a minimum, 
to the dismay of some key MTA officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-union animus of Supervisor Mike Antonovich and other MTA board 
members is no secret; they apparently wanted to break the transit unions, not 
just this strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Ed Edelman and Richard Alatorre wanted and encouraged talks to get 
a negotiated settlement, one that reportedly includes much less than the MTA's 
original demand to contract out many of the mechanics' jobs. Union members will 
vote on the pact today, so its terms are being withheld pending the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 At the onset of the strike, management distributed a "Dear Fellow Employee" 
letter containing confusing versions of management's contract offer, in an 
attempt to split union ranks. The letter, signed by MTA's chief executive 
officer, Franklin White, said that strikers' jobs would not be affected for two 
years by the increased subcontracting that MTA wants. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't much solace for workers, but management presumably thought the 
letter would serve to divide strikers facing the loss of their paychecks while 
management "saved" millions by not having to issue paychecks during the strike. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Executives are often callous when they look at ways to slash wages and 
benefits of workers to trim budgets in the public sector or to swell profits of 
even wealthy corporations in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to cut costs of, say, factory-made equipment, gasoline or 
electricity. Workers are usually easier targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the drivers' and clerks' unions had negotiated an agreement with the 
MTA, the mechanics recognized the long-range dangers to their jobs and at first 
refused to go along with any contracting out of jobs. That labor split was also 
a weapon in management's anti-union arsenal, but it did not work. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA ploy didn't do much to help struggling transit riders, either, but 
didn't hurt the salaries of management, like the $175,000-a-year White. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA demands were part of a nationwide trend toward bashing workers by 
contracting out jobs in the public sector to private, lower-paying, non-union 
firms. This trend has brought harsh anti-union battles and vast increases in 
the hiring of part-time and temporary workers, who usually get no health 
insurance or other fringe benefits and can be easily cut from the payroll -- 
"disposable workers," as they're often called. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives in both the public and private sectors need to look beyond their 
own special interests to see the broad impact of their actions, as they ratchet 
down the income of workers and thereby increase the ever-growing number of the 
working poor. Impoverishment of workers makes more and more of them dependent 
on government assistance, and in the end it costs all taxpayers more money. 
</P>
<P>
 That the MTA's mechanics held out while the other unions were willing to 
settle was not surprising. Just before the strike, MTA laid off 80 mechanics, 
arguing that the layoffs were planned earlier and didn't represent a false 
promise to the workers. Even if that was true, the timing was monumentally 
stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 Was wider politics involved? Consider that the transit unions had asked Gov. 
Pete Wilson, no friend of labor, for a 90-day "cooling off" period to give more 
time to seek a settlement without a strike. That proposal was fought by the MTA 
board, which apparently wanted an immediate strike it thought it would win. 
Wilson rejected the cooling-off period. 
</P>
<P>
 While the buses may be back, the real issue remains -- not just for MTA and 
its workers, but for all of us: Do we really want a low-wage society with fewer 
and fewer full-time jobs (and fewer and fewer job benefits)? Since the answer, 
for most of us wage earners, has to be "no," workers around the country should 
applaud the strikers at the MTA.

 Sources close to the Pittsburgh Penguins say Mario Lemieux probably will tell 
Penguin owner Howard Baldwin on Wednesday or Thursday that he isn't healthy 
enough to start the new season. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin said Lemieux, who is visiting Scotland, hasn't made a final 
decision.The Penguins declined comment until after the meeting, scheduled "very 
shortly." 
</P>
<P>
 The worst of the likely scenarios: Lemieux retires. The best: He takes more 
time off to get healthy and returns to the NHL after January. 
</P>
<P>
 The third choice is that Lemieux sits out an entire season.

 And Then There Was One: Bethel '94, the smaller of two competing Aug. 13-14 
concerts celebrating Woodstock's 25th anniversary, was effectively canceled 
Monday after the event's financial backer pulled out of the concert that was to 
have been held at the original Woodstock site in Bethel, N.Y. Shea 
Entertainment said that despite pumping $2 million into the concert, only 1,650 
of the 50,000 available tickets had sold, prompting the company to cut its 
losses and pull out of the event, which was to have featured 26 acts. However, 
promoter Sid Bernstein, who had pulled out of Bethel '94 earlier Monday, 
changed his mind after hearing his partners had also dropped out. He said he 
would try to find the $3 million to $4 million to restart the concert. "I've 
been calling the town fathers, I'm asking for 48 hours. We already have the 
possibility of another backer," Bernstein said. "I believe in miracles." . . . 
Meanwhile, the larger concert, Woodstock '94, has its own ticket sale woes. 
With nearly 100,000 tickets still available, organizers on Monday extended the 
purchase period to Aug. 11 and relaxed some of the Saugerties, N.Y., event's 
stringent parking rules.

PERSPECTIVE ON IMMIGRATION; BALANCING THE LEDGER ON JOBS, TAXES; IMMIGRANTS

By MICHAEL FIX and JEFFREY S. PASSEL, Michael Fix and Jeffrey S. Passel are 
senior analysts at the Urban Institute in Washington and co-authors of its new 
study, Immigrants and Immigration: Setting the Record Straight. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two principal misperceptions dominate the current bare-knuckle political 
debate over immigration. One is that immigrants take jobs and reduce the wages 
of natives. The other is that immigrants are a drain on the public coffers, 
using more in services than they pay in taxes. Both suggest that immigrants -- 
legal or illegal -- are changing our nation for the worse. And both are 
inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 Since such impacts are measurable, what explains the prevalence of these 
misconceptions? Part of the explanation lies in the sheer complexity of the 
issue. While the overall economic impacts of immigration are positive, they can 
vary by level of government, the strength of individual labor markets and the 
types of immigrant on which we focus. But this complex reality has been lost in 
a debate that all too often demands a simple good or bad bottom line. 
Labor-market effects. When viewed in terms of the nation as a whole, the 
studies that use the best data and methods find that immigration has little to 
no overall effect on the labor-market opportunities of natives. But when the 
lens is focused on individual labor markets in times of growth and decline, a 
different, richer picture emerges. In times of growth, immigration actually 
increases natives' economic opportunities in labor markets where immigrants are 
concentrated, because their spending and investing has a ripple effect. (In 
1989 immigrants earned and recycled through the economy $285 billion.) In times 
of economic decline or stagnation, immigration reduces the opportunities of 
low-skilled workers. Moreover, the one group that is consistently hard-hit by 
immigration is other recent immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Distinctions between regional labor markets and periods of the economic cycle 
are important because job production in the U.S. economy collapsed between 1989 
and 1992. So it is not surprising that worries about competition surged and 
remain with us still, despite the recent upturn in new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Public-sector impact. This, too, depends on the lens through which the issue 
is viewed. When all immigrants who arrived since 1970 are examined, it appears 
that immigrants generate a net public-sector surplus of $25 billion to $30 
billion annually. But when a distinction is made among immigrants by legal 
status, most of this surplus is found to come from legal immigrants. Illegal 
immigrants, who are poorer and less educated, generate a netpublic-sector 
deficit of roughly $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 These findings are sharply at odds with other recent studies that find that 
immigrants create a huge annual deficit. What accounts for the differing 
results between those studies and ours? The analyses that purport to find such 
high costs are flawed in several important ways: They underestimate immigrant 
incomes and, as a result, the taxes that immigrants pay; they omit or 
understate major types of taxes such as Social Security and unemployment 
insurance; they systematically inflate costs, for example, by overstating the 
rate at which immigrant children attend schools; they inflate the size of the 
undocumented population, exceeding the government's own estimates by 50%; they 
ignore the job-creation effects of immigrants; they overstate the extent to 
which native workers are displaced, and they inflate the welfare costs 
associated with displacement, assuming, for example, that displaced natives 
never return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 But if immigrants generate a $25- to $30-billion net annual surplus, as our 
research indicates, why is the debate over immigration so furious in some 
sectors? In the first place, federal spending on programs that are targeted to 
immigrants or to the communities in which they settle has been dramatically 
reduced as immigration levels have risen. Federal refugee spending fell from 
$7,000 per refugee in the mid-1980s to $2,000 in the early 1990s. While federal 
spending on bilingual education fell by 50% through the 1980s, there was an 80% 
growth in the population of schoolchildren with limited English proficiency.  
</P>
<P>
 More important, while immigrants generate a net fiscal surplus, the bulk of 
the taxes they pay are federal, while the obligations for providing them 
services remains with local and state governments. Hence, in some communities, 
immigrants generate a net deficit at the local level. 
</P>
<P>
 The scale of recent immigration, its concentration in several states and in 
urban areas and its pace (half of the current immigrant population was not in 
the United States 10 years ago) raise serious questions about the fairness of 
federal fiscal policy. But before a new federal reimbursement policy for state 
and local governments is proposed, it is necessary to find a principled 
approach to the redistribution of federal tax dollars.  
</P>
<P>
 Such an approach requires an understanding of the differences between the 
costs imposed by immigrants and by natives. It also requires taking into 
account the fact that different immigrant groups -- legal, refugee, illegal -- 
have very different fiscal impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the federal government's responsibility in terms of policy? For 
instance, should the federal government be held fully accountable for the 
public costs that flow from the behavior of employers who profit by hiring the 
undocumented with impunity? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorting out these complex issues with factual information rather than 
misperceptions is a key first step toward lowering the decibel level in the 
angry debate over immigration. Where Immigrants Come From Legal immigration by

AL MARTINEZ: THE CHECK WAS IN THE MAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 R.D. Williams is an ordinary guy who runs a small machine shop that makes 
polished aluminum swords for theme parks and movie studios. His "earnings" last 
year were minus $12,000 and the year before that minus $14,000. Any day soon, 
R.D. always used to say, he was going to start making some real money. But he 
never expected it to come from Taco Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 The way R.D. tells it, he was in his shop the other day on a nondescript 
Paramount industrial strip when a guy from Airborne Express came to the door 
with a package accompanied by a separate envelope. 
</P>
<P>
 The package contained some pens used for computerized drawings that R.D. had 
ordered for $10 a set. He figured the envelope held paperwork for the order, so 
he didn't open it right away. R.D. likes to do things in his own way at his own 
pace, the way he's done it for the past 30 years as a machinist. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when he'd finished setting the pens in place did he open the envelope, 
which was addressed to him. It contained a check for $750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, he thought it was for $750, but then realized there were too 
many zeros for that. A guy like R.D. doesn't see a lot of zeros on checks, so 
it took a minute for it to sink in. When it finally did, R.D. panicked. The 
money wasn't his, but the impact was. He was holding three-quarters of a 
million dollars in his hands. He never stopped feeling dazzled for the five 
days the check was in his possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Never once did he think about trying to cash it, though. He knows hackers who, 
utilizing computers, would take a check like that and put it in a Swiss account 
for 10% of the take, but R.D.'s not that kind of guy. When the immediate shock 
wore off, he began trying to get the money to its owner. It wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The check was from Taco Bell and was payable to someone I'll call James 
Perkins. That's not his real name, but I'm not going to be the one to tell the 
world the name of a guy walking around with $750,000 in his pocket. A letter 
with the check indicated that Perkins had ended his relationship with Taco Bell 
and this was part of a refund that would ultimately total $2.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing R.D. did was try to reach Perkins. He knew that calling 
Airborne Express was useless because no human would pick up the phone, and 
their answering machine wasn't working right. He'd run into that trying to get 
his pens delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 But the James Perkins named on the check was out of business and not 
reachable, so R.D. telephoned Taco Bell and asked for the man who'd signed the 
check, one Robert Girvin, the company's director of taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 At first the secretary said he was out to lunch, but by then R.D. was getting 
a little frantic. He said, "Lady, I've got his $750,000 check and I've got to 
talk to him." She said he was gone for the day, call back tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, R.D. kept looking at the check, afraid to let the damned thing out 
of his sight for fear it would get lost somewhere and he'd have to come up with 
the three quarters of a million to pay Perkins back. 
</P>
<P>
 As I indicated earlier, R.D. isn't rolling in dough. He's had his own business 
only four years and it's not making money. His wife, Judy, is a teacher and 
pays the rent for their modest 1,300-square-foot Burbank home. They don't 
exactly vacation on the French Riviera every summer.

 During the five days he held the check, R.D. made a dozen telephone calls 
trying to return it. One was to a friend at the Paramount Police Department, 
who was out of town. That's when he said to hell with it and dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, trying to return a misdelivered check isn't a function of 
emergency services. An operator suggested he call Airborne Express, but he'd 
already tried that without success. 
</P>
<P>
 R.D. held on to the check through a long, nervous weekend. His wife thought it 
was about the strangest thing they'd ever experienced. So did everyone else 
R.D. showed it to. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Girvin called back and had the check picked up, and the episode ended 
as quickly as it had begun. R.D. says he spent a lot of time and money making 
long-distance calls in an effort to return the check and didn't even get a taco 
out of it. Girvin, who was feeling pretty tense about the whole thing when I 
talked to him, said he'd thanked him over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 R.D., meanwhile, has gone back to making polished aluminum swords in his 
crowded little shop off Paramount Boulevard. I asked what he'd do with $750,000 
if he had it. He said he'd buy a boat and he and Judy would sail off into the 
sunset. I hope they can do exactly that someday. An honest man deserves more 
than just a thank you over the telephone.

DODGERS GET TOO LITTLE TOO LATE; BASEBALL: THEY RALLY FROM A 5-1 DEFICIT IN 
EIGHTH AND NINTH INNINGS BUT THE PADRES HOLD ON, 5-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were interesting moments in the Dodgers' 5-4 loss to the San Diego 
Padres at Dodger Stadium on Monday night -- the five-man infield, Mike Piazza's 
bullet home run, and, perhaps most impressive, a towering home run by Raul 
Mondesi in the ninth inning that landed deep in the left field pavilion before 
39,244. 
</P>
<P>
 But almost was the Dodgers' theme in this game, mainly because of Padre 
starter Joey Hamilton (8-5), who held the Dodgers to one run before departing 
in the eighth inning in the midst of a two-run rally. Trevor Hoffman pitched 
the rest of the way and earned his 16th save. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came back pretty good," Piazza said of the Dodgers' rallying from a 5-1 
deficit. "I think Orel (Hershiser) would be the first to tell you he didn't 
have his best stuff, but you have to give the Padres credit . . . they are a 
young, aggressive team, but we tried to come back and kept battling." 
</P>
<P>
 The best news for the Dodgers was that the San Francisco Giants also lost, 
allowing the Dodgers to maintain a one-game lead in the National League West, a 
position they have held for the last 71 days. Other good news was a strong 
effort from the bullpen, which relieved Hershiser (5-6) after the sixth inning 
and held the Padres to two hits the rest of the way.  
</P>
<P>
 Hershiser, making his second start since being sidelined for 10 days because 
of a strained left side, was in jams in all but one inning, leaving with the 
score, 5-1, and runners on first and second and none out. Jim Gott relieved 
Hershiser, who gave up 11 hits, and retired the next three batters in order. 
Rudy Seanez held the Padres to two hits during the final two innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "My side is fine," Hershiser said. "I made some bad pitches in tough 
situations and location was a problem tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by four runs, the Dodgers knocked Hamilton out of the game after they 
led off the inning with three consecutive singles and Brett Butler scored from 
third base on a bouncer up the middle by Piazza, who was three for four in the 
game and knocked in two runs.  
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman relieved Hamilton, and, after striking out Tim Wallach, gave up a 
towering sacrifice fly to Eric Karros that Phil Plantier caught at the wall in 
left field, scoring Delino DeShields. Mondesi led off the ninth inning with his 
16th homer of the season, but Hoffman retired the next three batters. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, who was called up from the Padres' triple-A club May 24, is the top 
winner on the Padre staff and the only starter to have a winning record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just tried to get ahead in the count so I could throw the strikes I 
wanted," Hamilton said. "We are just trying to win ballgames, not play the role 
of the spoiler." 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza's homer in the fourth inning was a line drive that cleared the wall in 
the corner of the right field pavilion. It was Piazza's 23rd home run this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Padres ahead, 3-1, in the fifth, the Dodgers stranded runners on 
first and third when Butler's attempted bunt down the third base line with two 
out went back to Hamilton instead. He threw to first to end the inning.  
</P>
<P>
 Butler, trying to bunt toward third with third baseman Craig Shipley playing 
him deep, appeared disgruntled when it didn't work out, especially when the run 
would have been a give-away. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondesi had reached first when shortstop Luis Lopez made a wide throw to first 
on a routine grounder. With two out, Hershiser hit a 2-and-2 pitch up the 
middle for a single, moving Mondesi to third. But Butler's bunt was a bust. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hershiser wasn't having as easy a time as Hamilton. After taking a 
1-0 lead in the first inning, the Padres scored again in the third when Eddie 
Williams drew a two-out walk and moved to second on a wild pitch. Williams 
scored on a ground ball single by Craig Shipley that Rafael Bournigal got to, 
but it got away.  
</P>
<P>
 The Padres added two runs in the sixth, despite the Dodgers employing a 
five-man infield at one point. After Luis Lopez doubled and scored on another 
double by Brad Ausmus, the Dodgers brought in Henry Rodriguez from left field 
for a five-man infield for the expected bunt by Hamilton. Hershiser easily 
struck out Hamilton, but the Padres eventually scored when Hershiser fielded a 
comebacker by Roberts and threw wide to Karros, moving Lopez to third. Lopez 
scored on groundout by Derek Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just mad that I didn't get the bunt," Butler said. "You can write it 
was the turning point in the game . . . I take responsibility."

MORNING BRIEFING: RUTH'S PACE PUTS THESE UPSTARTS IN PROPER PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's much talk about the home run paces of Matt Williams, Ken Griffey Jr. 
and Frank Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 But none is on a pace to achieve what Babe Ruth did in the 1920 and '21 
seasons. Although Ruth hit 60 in 1927, most baseball historians are more 
impressed by Ruth's feats in consecutive seasons at the start of that decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth hit 54 and 59 homers those two years, drove in 137 and 171 runs and 
batted .376 and .378. But even more impressive: His slugging averages were .847 
and .846, by far the two highest in history. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Name the only time in major league history when every player on a 
team had the same batting average -- both before and after the same game. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, Canada . . . Lounge singer Dennis Park sang a stirring rendition of the 
Canadian national anthem recently, before a CFL game between Ottawa and 
Hamilton. Park received a rousing ovation from an enthusiastic crowd of about 
11,000 at Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 So What? So finally, Park had gotten it right.  
</P>
<P>
 On July 16 Park, from Los Angeles, butchered the Canadian anthem in a CFL game 
at Las Vegas, singing the wrong words to the wrong melody to a national 
Canadian television audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel relieved it's over and done with," Park said. "I haven't slept. It 
became a personal thing with me, professional pride." 
</P>
<P>
 Sign of the times: The Marlboro Man is going to benefit the American Cancer 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign depicting the tobacco-loving cowboy that towered over left-center field 
at Syracuse's MacArthur Stadium for 13 years was auctioned Sunday for $500 
during a doubleheader. The money will go to the society. 
</P>
<P>
 John Simone of the minor league Syracuse Chiefs said that when the sign was 
removed before opening day, so many people asked to keep it that he decided he 
might as well sell it. 
</P>
<P>
 The big cut: At baseball's Hall of Fame induction ceremonies Sunday, Al Lopez, 
85, was discussing his 1935 holdout, after he hit .273 and caught 140 games for 
the Brooklyn Dodgers.  
</P>
<P>
 "They tried to cut me back by $3,000, from $8,000," he said. "(But) I got most 
of it back." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, who earned his Hall of Fame status later as a manager, said the most he 
ever made as a player in his 19 major league seasons was $16,500 with 
Pittsburgh in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: April 16, 1940, when Bob Feller of Cleveland pitched an opening 
day no-hitter against Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Phil Rizzuto, at his Hall of Fame induction, talking about his role 
with the New York Yankees: "The Yankees, all they needed was someone to catch 
the ball, make a double play, get hit by a pitch and not get hurt." EARL

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels should have lowered themselves from the heavens and agreed to play 
the Seattle Mariners in Tacoma this week. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 After all, the Angels played all their home games in 1961 in a minor league 
park, Wrigley Field in Los Angeles. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants began at Seals Stadium, former home of the Pacific 
Coast League's Seals. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Seattle's first American League team, the Pilots, played at Sick's Stadium, 
former home of the Rainiers. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Brooklyn Dodgers played 10 games in each of the 1956 and '57 seasons at 
Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Oh well, at least minor league prices will be charged at Anaheim Stadium 
tonight through Thursday, $6 a ticket. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ken Griffey Jr. has hit 18 home runs in 44 games at the Kingdome and 18 in 57 
games on the road. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There will be a rare freeway doubleheader Thursday, the Dodgers vs. Houston at 
1 p.m. and the Angels vs. Seattle at 5:35 p.m. . . .  
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Despite all the complaints about realignment, the only runaway divisional race 
is in the New York Yankees-dominated AL East. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Al Downing's highest baseball salary was $65,000 in 1977, but he says he isn't 
jealous of the present-day millionaires. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "What does bother me is that so many players come to the major leagues 
prematurely," said the former Yankee, Oakland, Milwaukee and Dodger 
left-hander. "They're learning how to play in the majors now, instead of the 
minors.". . . 
</P>
<P>
 I loved the reckless abandon Raul Mondesi showed on the bases when he scored 
from second on a passed ball in the Dodgers' series against the Astros. Now, if 
he can just show a little less reckless abandon at the plate and stay away from 
some of those outside breaking pitches. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Aug. 12 strike date had a lot to do with the Milt Thompson-Tom Edens deal 
between Philadelphia and Houston being the only one made on waiver deadline 
day. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On old-timers' night at Dodger Stadium on Saturday, a young-timer, Taylor 
John, son of Tommy, earned a standing ovation with his singing of the national 
anthem. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Look-alikes: Jim Eisenreich and Lou Gehrig. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In appreciation of their efforts, USC is offering Coliseum construction 
workers two free tickets for the Trojans-Washington Huskies game Sept. 3. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers ought to keep wearing the attractive, throwback uniforms they 
displayed Saturday in the Hall of Fame game at Canton, Ohio. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thumbs up to Del Mar management for signing the match race between sprinters 
Soviet Problem and Cool Air on Aug. 21. Racing needs more imagination. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Kerlan is out of intensive care at Centinela Hospital Medical 
Center after four months and seven surgeries. Hollywood Park Chairman R.D. 
Hubbard has had a satellite dish installed so that Kerlan can watch the races. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 If Bud Grant made the Hall of Fame, then Marv Levy can't be too far behind. .

</P>
<P>
 Forrest Gump isn't the only All-American football player from the state of 
Alabama named Forrest. Remember Forrest Blue, the San Francisco 49ers' old 
center from Auburn?. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 A lot of NFL coaches are opposed to the new 30-yard-line kickoff rule because 
it means more runbacks and chances for injuries. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Best fight this year could be James Toney-Roy Jones Jr. bout Nov. 19 at a site 
to be announced, probably not Las Vegas. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It would take some doing on his part -- such as beating Michael Chang and 
Richard Krajicek along the way -- but Brad Gilbert could face new pupil Andre 
Agassi in the final at the L.A. Open on Sunday at UCLA. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The California state heavyweight championship will be resurrected tonight when 
Jeremy Williams of Long Beach fights Mark Wills of L.A. at the Grand Olympic. 
Hollywood Legion Stadium regulars from the 1950s will remember state title 
bouts involving such local favorites as Willie Bean, Young Jack Johnson, 
Frankie Daniels and Dale Hall. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Former All-American volleyball player Julie Bremner has become the first UCLA 
female student-athlete admitted to the UCLA Medical School. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Jim Harrick became a grandfather Thursday when son Monte's wife Melanie gave 
birth to 8- pound 10-ounce daughter Morgan Paige. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Once again, I'm devastated that there was no defensive-player-of-the-game 
balloting at the Magic Johnson all-star game at the Forum, won by the Magics, 
168-166. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to believe that Sergei Bubka went two years between outdoor pole

DOCUMENTARY; THE GOMA CAMPS: AN AFRICAN TRAGEDY; A CORRESPONDENT FINDS 'THE 
FINAL HORROR OF THE RWANDAN REFUGEE NIGHTMARE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the road, about 50 yards away, it looked like a busy construction site. A 
huge, yellow front-end loader belched black diesel smoke and roared about, 
while a smaller backhoe growled as it dug nearby.  
</P>
<P>
 But up close, I found the final horror of the Rwandan refugee nightmare the 
most grotesque scene in nearly two weeks of witnessing unimaginable pain and 
death. Especially death. 
</P>
<P>
 Only God knows how many of the million or more Rwandan refugees who reached 
this Zairian border town have died here so far. U.N. officials use a figure of 
20,000, but they don't know. They blame a cholera epidemic for the corpses that 
appeared by the hundreds, or the thousands, along the roads each day. But 
again, they don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 Some refugees died of dehydration, their lips parched and faces contorted in 
pain. Others fell to measles or dysentery. Some simply keeled over, too weak 
after days without food or water, and too exhausted by days of walking, 
walking, endless walking.  
</P>
<P>
 How many simply died of anguish, alone and afraid in a living hell of volcanic 
rocks and gut-wrenching misery? Even worse, how many were buried alive, swept 
up by burial crews while sick or sleeping? On my last day here, I met a boy who 
was pulled alive from a mass grave.  
</P>
<P>
 Each day, trucks drive down the road to collect the corpses and ferry them to 
mass graves bulldozed beside the main road at the airstrip. Then crews toss the 
bodies one by one into the foul trenches, corpse upon corpse, tumbling down 
into a ghastly jumble of flesh and bone and rag, like garbage on a heap. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, as usual, French soldiers arrived to bulldoze dirt over the mound 
of rotting bodies dumped in a grave the night before. Many were wrapped in 
blood-soaked rush mats, tattered gray blankets or rags soaked with the stench 
of death.  
</P>
<P>
 Then one bundle began moving. 
</P>
<P>
 "The soldier thought it was a rat, so it he hit it with a stick," said 
Christian Clark, a UNICEF worker. "And it began to cry." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy has spindly legs and his knees are painfully swollen by rickets, so he 
walks without bending them, stiffly, like a crane. His face is covered with 
scabs. He looks about six, but weighs about 15 pounds, say the doctors at the 
French army clinic where the boy is cared for. 
</P>
<P>
 As he stands, he wobbles weakly and a filthy diaper sags and then drops onto 
his feet. He stands mute in his feces until a nun pulls off his shirt, leads 
him by the hand and gently washes him in a tub. His ribs and spine are tiny 
bumps and ridges against his emaciated back, and his spider-thin hand clutches 
the woman's dress. 
</P>
<P>
 He says nothing now except his name -- Ntibagirirwa. His eyes seem dim and 
glazed, his lips thin and tight, his secret hell locked inside. His future, at 
least, is assured. The French lieutenant who found him has decided to adopt 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 I met Ntibagirirwa while making the morning rounds aboard a white UNICEF 
truck. Each morning at 8:30, it rumbles up to Munigi, which has become an 
infamous cholera death camp, where thousands died in days on a moonscape of 
black volcanic rocks. Then it stops at the French army compound, by a church in 
town, and elsewhere, searching for orphans and unaccompanied children.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, UNICEF and other agencies have collected about 8,000 unattended 
Rwandan children and put them in 11 orphanages and care centers. They estimate 
another 20,000 are still living alone in the streets and fields. But again, 
they're guessing. No one knows the depths of pain here.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these kids were at their mother's breast when we picked them up, but 
the mother had been dead for two days," said Clark, the UNICEF aide. A few have 
died on the truck. Even fewer have been reunited with their families. 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, the truck picked up 35 children in less than an hour, including a 
dozen with a large blue O marked on their foreheads. Camp doctors mark them so 
others will know: They are orphans. Three are infants, wrapped in blankets on 
the truck floor.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the oldest children was naked. He sat at the back of the truck, his 
legs pulled up to his chest. His name is Cyprian Bigirimana and he is 12. Once 
he had eight brothers and sisters. Now, he doesn't know if they're alive. He 
only knows about his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents are dead," he said in a whisper. "They died in Goma. They died a 
week ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Covered in filth, his naked body laced with sores and scabs, Cyprian literally 
had nothing. He clutched a gray blanket in one hand, but it belonged to the 
little girl behind him. She sat with her huge eyes half closed, hugging the 
wheel well of the truck. Others sat crying, eyes wide with fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, a cheerful 34-year-old Canadian, bustled about the truck as it lurched 
along, hugging the children and singing. Major relief agencies have been 
heavily criticized for the planning and pace of their operation here. I have 
nothing but awe for aid workers like Clark and his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first couple of days you sort of cry and cry," said the Canadian, who 
rushed here from another horror show in Somalia. "Then you roll up your sleeves 
and get to work. And now I look forward to it. These kids actually give me 
strength. They've persevered through so much." 
</P>
<P>
 He brushed aside a question about how he endured the work each day. "People 
feel sorry for the aid workers because we've witnessed genocide. But these kids 
have lived through it. The least we can do now is do all we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 One child starts crying, and soon a dozen are wailing. Clark picks two up, and 
hugs them. I grimace. I've tried not to touch any of the refugees, made wary by 
doctors' warnings about contracting cholera or any of the other deadly diseases 
that have cut through the camps like a scythe.  
</P>
<P>
 The two children hush, their legs wrapped around Clark's chest. A little girl, 
her clothes soiled with fecal stains, rests her head on his shoulder and 
instantly falls asleep. "That's all it takes," he says softly, cooing in her 
ear. "They want to be picked up. They need love." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, they need much more. This was the worst humanitarian disaster in a 
generation, the standard by which all tragedies must now be judged. Like 
something out of the Bible, more than 1 million people fled Rwanda's brutal 
civil war almost overnight, on foot, into one of the most inhospitable places 
on Earth. Pestilence awaited them.  
</P>
<P>
 What's it like to see death on a scale not seen except at the Nazi death camps 
of World War II? The first day was shocking; the next day I was numb. I saw but 
did not see, looked but did not feel. How could one do otherwise? 
</P>
<P>
 I only broke down once. I couldn't talk to the withered old woman who came up 
and offered me her orphaned infant granddaughter, pleading for me to take it to 
America, to safety, to a life away from this. I directed her to the nearby 
medical tents and walked away, blinded by tears.  
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I got angry. Early on, I met a refugee wearing surprisingly clean 
jeans, black loafers and a T-shirt from Louisiana State University. His name 
was Alphonse Rubagumya, he said, and he had graduated LSU with a Ph.D. in 
sociology last January. Then he'd gone home to Kigali, capital of Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda is not much bigger than Vermont and about as rugged. The Hutus, 
Rwanda's poor majority, held the power. The Tutsis, the rich minority, wanted 
it. Nevertheless, they have lived side by side, often in the same family, for 
generations. It is an old story in Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Then something snapped. In April, the Hutu president was killed in a 
suspicious plane crash. Suddenly, in nearly every village and town, Hutus began 
butchering Tutsis with machetes and grenades. Rwanda became a charnel house. 
Some say 300,000 died, others 500,000 or more. Does it matter? 
</P>
<P>
 So I asked the American-trained Hutu sociologist how he could explain the 
madness, the genocide, the horror? What does it say about the human condition 
when killers proudly pose for photos before bodies stacked in tidy heaps?  
</P>
<P>
 He shrugged. "This has been going on for centuries," he said. "It is our 
history, that's all." I asked if he was helping the desperately understaffed 
relief agencies.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing I can do," he said with a smile. "I am only a refugee." 
</P>
<P>
 Which gets back to the construction site. First some geology. Still-active 
volcanoes have left a thick cover of black igneous rock in eastern Zaire. Older 
lava flows have a thin layer of soil and brush, but the most recent eruptions 
deposited sharp-edged boulders and rocks. It's difficult to walk on, and 
impossible to dig. 
</P>
<P>
 So when mass graves in Goma began to fill up, crisis turned to catastrophe. 
Hundreds of bodies piled up in Kibumba camp alone, stuck behind cooking fires, 
stacked around the tent hospital, and, in greatest number, abandoned along the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in traffic at Kibumba several days ago, I counted 180 bodies piled next 
to my van. Many were uncovered, and some had been run over by passing vehicles. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, most were moved to an open field to be buried. They were heaped high 
and hideously in two long rows, bloated and stiff, and the stench flooded the 
busy roadside vegetable market and open-air cattle butchery.  
</P>
<P>
 For two days, a French army bulldozer clanked and rumbled, trying to dig a 
grave. It only got a few inches down in the rock. Then it broke down. 
</P>
<P>
 Something had to be done. On Sunday French soldiers appeared again. They put 
on surgical masks and gloves and began their grisly task. 
</P>
<P>
 I only stayed a minute, but the details are etched in my mind.  
</P>
<P>
 As a soldier guided him with hand signals, the driver of the big yellow loader 
dropped the huge shovel to the ground and lurched forward into the mountain of 
death. Seven sharp teeth on the edge of the shovel caught under and in the 
corpses as the driver scooped his grim load. 
</P>
<P>
 As the shovel flipped up, one bloated body teetered on the edge, an arm and a 
leg hanging over. The driver shook the shovel. Then again. Finally the body 
tumbled back out. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver shifted gears, and with a snort of black smoke, the machine backed 
up, turned and rumbled over to the face of a small hill. He emptied his shovel, 
and the latest load tumbled onto a growing embankment. Then came the backhoe, 
dropping grass and dirt.  
</P>
<P>
 The only requiem was the roar of the machines, the only eulogy the whistle of 
the wind. Death is rarely pretty. Here it is obscene.

CULTURE; TROUBLE IN THE SOUTH PACIFIC; TRYING TO SAVE THEIR CULTURE, EASTER 
ISLAND'S PEOPLE DEMAND CONTROL OF THEIR LIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The huge altar and its towering stone statues have been meticulously 
reassembled and now stand silhouetted against a seascape of craggy cliffs and 
crashing waves, a sight unseen for centuries. With their backs to the South 
Pacific, the monolithic icons evoke the forsaken gods of a culture that was 
devastated long ago and remains shrouded in tantalizing mystery. But the people 
of isolated Easter Island are focused on the present as much as the past. 
</P>
<P>
 They call their island Rapa Nui and are demanding increased control over its 
affairs. Ultimately, they want dominion over the land that was lost by their 
Polynesian ancestors and annexed by faraway Chile, 2,300 miles of unbroken sea 
to the east on the South American mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 Easter Islanders also fear losing what remains of their culture, including 
their language, as increased tourism and other contacts with the mainland flood 
the island with foreign influences. For many, restoring their ancestral 
monuments goes hand in hand with reclaiming land rights and cultural identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Restoration of Tongariki ahu , the greatest monument of prehistoric Polynesian 
culture, is nearly complete. Thirteen of the massive statues, or moais , have 
been resurrected on the huge stone altar, the ahu . The last two will be raised 
by the end of the year. They stand as tall as 27 feet, with elongated heads and 
shortened torsos, long ears, prominent noses and pursed lips. The work at 
Tongariki is a landmark in efforts to study and preserve the remains of the 
civilization that flourished here in a past era of glory, then collapsed in 
violent upheaval, a milestone in the island's tumultuous history. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of distance, Easter Islanders are the most isolated people on Earth. 
Their nearest neighbors are on Pitcairn Island, 1,200 miles to the northwest. 
The isolation was complete until Easter Sunday, 1722, when three Dutch ships 
under the command of Capt. Jakob Roggeveen arrived at Rapa Nui, putting it on 
the map with a Christian name. 
</P>
<P>
 Before 1965, there were no airline flights, and supply ships came only once or 
twice a year. Now LAN-Chile flies in twice a week from Santiago, and twice more 
on return flights from Tahiti. Tourism has become the island's bread and 
butter. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, more than 7,000 visitors arrived, a presence overwhelming the 
nearly 3,000 islanders. In 1862, the population was estimated at 6,000 but 
contact with the mainland, including disastrous slave raids from Peru and 
imported diseases, cut the count to an almost unsustainable 111 in 1877. Eleven 
years later, Chile took possession of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a series of irregular land deals and rental contracts, a private sheep 
ranch occupied nearly all of the island's 40,000 acres from 1895 to 1953, when 
the Chilean navy took over administration. In 1965, the Chileans gave the 
islanders a civilian administration similar to mainland provinces and 
development began. 
</P>
<P>
 Small hotels and inns, tourist agencies, restaurants and curio shops have 
proliferated in Hanga Roa, the only town. Mainland business people and 
television have arrived, adding to outside influences. What is left of the 
traditional Polynesian culture is fading rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsistence agriculture has declined as food imports increase. Social 
problems, especially alcoholism, have grown serious. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a 1992 study, only 5% of Easter Island's schoolchildren spoke the 
Rapa Nui language, down from 70% in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 "The language is heading for extinction," said Lilian Gonzalez, an 
anthropologist with the University of Chile's Institute of Easter Island 
Studies. If the language dies out, she added, "one of the strongest indicators 
of cultural identity would be lost." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, concerns have focused on a power struggle between two rival groups 
that claim leadership of the Council of Elders, a community organization based 
on traditional Rapa Nui social structure. At issue is how the islanders should 
regain control of government lands and, more broadly, what interests should 
prevail in the island's development. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1970s, the president of the Council of Elders had been Alberto 
Hotus, who also is the current mayor of Hanga Roa. Hotus and his supporters 
back a Chilean government plan, established under a newly enacted Indigenous 
Peoples Law, to distribute surplus government lands to the native people. The 
plan also would give them a greater say in the administration of remaining 
government lands, including a 16,000-acre cattle ranch and a 16,000-acre 
national park. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, a group led by owners of tourist businesses challenged Hotus' 
leadership of the Council of Elders. The new group elected a new council, but 
Hotus and his followers have refused to step down. The challengers reject the 
plan to share responsibility for government lands under the Indigenous Peoples 
Act. Instead, they say the lands should be directly ceded to Easter Islanders 
for administration in coordination with the national government. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the challengers began what they call a "strike," which has consisted 
of periodic motorcades through Hanga Roa and rallies in a tent on the grounds 
of the town's Roman Catholic church. Benito Rapahango, a spokesman for the 
demonstrators and owner of a tourist agency, says they are pressing for private 
property rights. Rapahango said the group would accept community ownership of 
the cattle ranch, with leases or concessions to private users, but neither it 
nor other land should remain under government control. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want dominion over that land and over the park," he insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotus, the longtime president of the Council of Elders, prefers to work with 
the government for gradual empowerment of the island community while 
reinforcing traditional culture. "There is a sensitivity in the government for 
Easterites to take on more responsibility," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the rival group represents private business interests, including those 
of people who want to buy and sell land. That, he said, would result in further 
concentration of wealth in a few hands. 
</P>
<P>
 An anthropologist who studies Easter Island said concentration of holdings is 
already taking place, threatening the tradition of social equality. "I think 
that in the next generation, the problem of social classes is coming," said the 
anthropologist, speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 It was probably the quest for land that brought Polynesians eastward across 
the Pacific to Easter Island sometime after AD 500. How they found this speck 
in the vast emptiness of the Pacific is not known, but they may have been 
helped by the flight patterns of fishing birds that nested here. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s, Norwegian explorer Thor Heyerdahl sailed westward from Peru in a 
reed raft called the Kon-Tiki, trying to prove that South Americans may have 
settled the island. But recent archeological studies have produced more 
convincing evidence that the island's early inhabitants were all of Polynesian 
origin. 
</P>
<P>
 They are believed to have used typical Polynesian slash-and-burn agricultural 
techniques, razing more and more of Rapa Nui's natural woodlands as the 
population grew and prospered. Recent research shows that by about 1500, there 
was little or no timber available. 
</P>
<P>
 The population expanded to a high point of 10,000 or more, archeologists say. 
But producing food from depleted soils apparently became difficult, and with 
little wood left for canoes, fishing was also limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the culture identified with the great stone statues began. 
According to speculations of archeologists, rival clans or tribes quarried 
volcanic rock from the Rano Raraku crater on the east side of the island, 
building moais to adorn their altars.  
</P>
<P>
 The cult of the moai occupied increasingly large labor forces to carve stone, 
move statues and build grandiose monuments around the island. Rivalry among 
tribes intensified. According to widely accepted theories, a major motivation 
was the concept of mana -- a mystical combination of power, prestige and 
prosperity. In a belief system that included ancestor worship, moais 
representing a clan's most revered forebears were believed to bestow mana on 
living leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Because mana was transmitted from ancestors through moais , the tribes 
competed to build bigger and bigger statues and altars, said archeologist 
Claudio Cristino, who heads the Tongariki restoration project. Making more 
moais became a compulsion, he said: "At a given moment, the whole society was 
dedicated to this." 
</P>
<P>
 But the competition drained energy from the tasks of producing food, and 
Cristino speculates that, meanwhile, clashes between tribes resulted in the 
destruction of crops and deliberate burning of what little woodland remained on 
the island. 
</P>
<P>
 Conflict and upheaval climaxed in the 1600s. Archeological studies and oral 
traditions, recorded by later European visitors, have yielded strong evidence 
of bloody battles and massacres, cannibalism, mass destruction and anarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 All but a few of the moais , which stood on hundreds of ahus , were toppled 
and broken in the turmoil. Often, the statues were deliberately decapitated and 
otherwise damaged. The great statues could have been toppled as warring tribes 
sought to destroy each others' mana , but Cristino has another explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 As the established order deteriorated and warfare spread, he suggests, 
warriors may have wrested power from the traditional chieftains, leaving them 
only symbolic influence. The breakup of the old order could have led to an 
overall loss of faith, even a popular revolt, according to Cristino. The tribes 
that had raised the moais may have torn them down in rebellion against a social 
and religious structure that no longer seemed to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you had here was a religious revolution," Cristino said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the moai cult faded, Easter Island turned to a "bird man" cult in which 
athletes competed to bring back the first egg of the nesting season from sooty 
terns on a nearby islet. The competitors raced out to the islet and back using 
reed floats. The tribes whose designated athlete brought back the first egg 
ruled the island for the next year, according to the tradition, which survived 
into the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the archeological record is sketchy, and because oral traditions are 
often distorted or even reinvented, exactly how the old Rapa Nui culture was 
destroyed remains a puzzle with most of the pieces yet to be found. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the great fascination in Easter Island," said Cristino. "In that 
sense, it's all yet to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tongariki's moais were toppled in the chaotic end of that era, most 
of the damage to altars, the ahu , came later. Cristino said cut stones from 
the altar were removed in the late 19th Century to make fences for the sheep 
ranch that had taken over the island. In 1960, a tsunami swept over the site, 
scattering moais and ahu stonework over an area of eight acres. 
</P>
<P>
 "The energy of a tsunami is an atomic bomb," Cristino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cristino's crew has spent nearly two years studying the site, picking up 
pieces and replacing them exactly where they belonged, as calculated from 
computer studies of old photographs. The Tongariki ahu's main platform is 325 
feet long, and extending wing walls add nearly 400 feet to the total length. 
</P>
<P>
 Before any of the statues were moved, they were treated with chemicals to 
harden the porous volcanic rock. The first of the 15 moais was craned into its 
upright position about a year ago. The Japanese company Tadano donated the 
$700,000 crane. The cost of the entire project will be about $2 million, 
Cristino said. 
</P>
<P>
 The smallest moai erected at Tongariki, about 35 tons, was as big as the 
largest moai previously restored to an upright position elsewhere on the 
island, Cristino said. Tongariki's biggest statue is about 27 feet tall and 
weighs a total of 88 tons. Because its 27-ton head had been broken off long 
ago, its torso was set upright first, and then its head was replaced with more 
than 80 tons of special cement. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the Rapa Nui people set the statues upright without power equipment? 
Cristino has studied the problem and come up with what he says are answers to 
one of the great mysteries of Easter Island. Using manpower and leverage, he 
said, the people lifted a statue inches at a time, piling in volcanic stones 
underneath, lifting some more, until the figure stood at an 80-degree angle 
supported by a hill of stones. Then they wedged pieces of rock under its base 
until it stood upright. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent rainy afternoon, Cristino watched as his restoration crew prepared 
to put one of Tongariki's biggest statues, moai No. 14, back in place. Workers 
carefully fitted the huge stone statue with a harness, then hooked it to a 
cable from a powerful hydraulic crane. The crane lifted, let down, lifted 
again, but never brought the statue's full weight of more than 60 tons off the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 A computerized mechanism in the crane had malfunctioned and needed cleaning or 
repair. Later, Cristino suspended the erection of moais No. 14 and No. 15. The 
project was running out of money, and Easter Island's rainiest season was 
coming on. Better to wait for dry weather and new funds before finishing up, 
Cristino said. 
</P>
<P>
 But by sometime in October, he promised, the remaining two maois would be in 
place, and the broken-off heads of six statues would be cemented on. With other 
finishing touches, Tongariki ahu would once again be the pride of Rapa Nui. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety percent of the workers who have helped restore Tongariki are 
descendants of the earlier natives who carved more than 900 moais and built 
more than 300 ahus on the island. Cristino said today's islanders are taking 
great pride in restoring their ancestors' masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people say, 'Our project, our ahu ,' " he said. "This gives a new 
dimension to the concept of cultural identity, and the people are very proud of 
it." MAJOR EVENTS ON EASTER ISLAND

 Negotiators for Israel and Jordan will meet Thursday in an air-conditioned 
tent at Ein Evrona, a desert nature preserve on the Israeli side of the 
frontier, to discuss border problems. At stake are several thousand acres of 
land claimed by Jordan but currently cultivated by Israeli kibbutzim 
(collective farms).Land, water and travel rights are top subjects as the Middle 
East neighbors enter a peaceful relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The two nations formally ended their 46-year-old state of war last week at a 
historic summit between Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and King Hussein in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin and Hussein are tentatively scheduled to attend the opening of a new 
border crossing near the twin ports of Aqaba and Eilat on Monday. But only 
foreign tourists -- not Israelis and Jordanians -- will be allowed to use it. 
Jordanian Aqaba and Israeli Eilat are major producers of tourist income for the 
two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Queen Elizabeth II will open Buckingham Palace, her London residence, to 
tourists again this year, beginning Sunday and running through Oct. 2.The royal 
palace in the center of the British capital threw its doors open to visitors 
for the first time last year. Over a similar two-month period, about 370,000 
visitors toured the historic palace, 47% of them foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 Palace officials say this year substantially more tickets will be available 
through travel agents. Otherwise visitors must line up to buy tickets on the 
day of their visit. "Buck House" was opened to the public to help defray costs 
of repairing fire-damaged Windsor Castle and last year made a net profit of 
$3.3 million.

<P>
 Ernesto Samper will be sworn in as president of Colombia Sunday amid a 
simmering scandal over attempts by cocaine traffickers to finance Samper's 
electoral campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Samper has conceded that leaders of the Cali cartel, who control 80% of the 
international cocaine trade, offered money, but he denies accepting it. The 
allegations, which came to light with the release of secret recordings of the 
traffickers discussing their plans, alarmed U.S. officials and raised concerns 
about Colombia's resolve to continue the war on drugs.

 If everyone had not been so well-dressed and polite, the meeting would 
certainly have been deemed subversive. Even an old Marxist saying boomed down 
from loudspeakers around the stage of the elegant concert hall, the adage about 
the people having nothing to lose but their chains. 
</P>
<P>
 But the speaker was loosening no more than the smart executive tie around his 
unbuttoned collar. Cem Boyner is one of Turkey's richest textile manufacturers, 
doing business with Italy's Benetton and Levi-Strauss in the United States. Yet 
he is fast becoming the best known of Turkey's born-again democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turkey needs a revolution in mentality. The mega-state is bankrupt. Turkey 
has to make a choice between enlightened democracy and an oppressive 
dictatorship," Boyner told his audience, launching a frontal assault on the 
taboos of a 70-year-old republic long-dominated by strait-laced military and 
civilian bureaucracies. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit the spot. Applause swelled from the audience of a thousand of the best 
and brightest in Turkey's thirty-something generation, who are fed up with 
corrupt politicians and an ideologically and financially bankrupt system of 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone talks like this between themselves. At last somebody is saying it 
out loud," said ship Capt. Alev Tunc, 36. The friend who had brought him to the 
meeting, educational counselor Ayse Buyukdora, agreed. "It's like a dream," she 
said. "We are gathering around an idea. Everything is very new, very different, 
against the system. The public is ready for these things. The movement will 
grow very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyner, 39, is one of a number of new Young Turks trying to shake their 
country awake before it is drowned by the ethnic and religious conflicts that 
have overwhelmed the regions all around them: the Balkans, the Caucasus and the 
Middle East. In many ways, Boyner, whose listeners had gathered to hear him 
promote the New Democracy Movement of which he is spokesman, fills a void left 
by last year's sudden death of Turkish leader Turgut Ozal. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Democracy Movement is one of dozens of such groups and networks that 
have sprung up in Turkey over the past year: Forty have been counted in 
Istanbul alone. "The Wave From the Deep" and "Civilians Rise Up" are just a few 
of the series on the phenomenon that have been run by Turkish newspapers. They 
track groups interested in everything from human rights to Istanbul's dwindling 
water supply. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are led by open-minded retired generals, others by angry young members of 
the Greens. "I think of my movement as a cross between free-masonry and an 
Islamic brotherhood," said Tinaz Titiz, Ozal's long-serving minister of tourism 
whose White Point Assn. aims to educate, enlighten and bring probity to all 
aspects of Turkish life.  
</P>
<P>
 In an Istanbul suburb of half-finished concrete buildings, messy back alleys 
and hectic street life, the headquarters of Boyner's New Democracy Movement 
gives little clue to its fast-rising profile. But with more than 6,000 members 
gathered in just a few months, mainly from the young elite of business, 
academia and professional life, it is now probably the biggest of the new 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The same groundswell for change was discerned last year when traditionally 
conservative politicians from Anatolia chose the dashing Tansu Ciller to be 
Turkey's first woman prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ciller has since disappointed many Turks with her headstrong style and 
reliance for support on the powerful Turkish army. Her True Path party could 
muster only 21% support in nationwide local elections in March, and that was 
the biggest share of the vote, showing what a splintered mess the Turkish 
political system is in. 
</P>
<P>
 Left-wing parties that traditionally see themselves as progressive have 
collapsed. And fed by wide-reaching political debate on private television 
stations, the sense of ferment is unprecedented. An idea of the sense of 
national disgust with the system came when the newspaper Milliyet last month 
reported that 69% of Turks thought the government was unsuccessful, 58% thought 
the opposition was useless, and 70% did not trust Ciller.  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the first to profit in elections has been the Welfare Party, which 
has been organizing the Islamic vote under various names since the 1970s. With 
a strong local organization and alleged backing from conservative Arab states, 
it is determined to bring Turkey's 60 million people closer to their Islamic 
roots.  
</P>
<P>
 The Islamics' share of the vote rose to a record 19% in the March elections, 
not only because their candidates were seen as honest and hard-working, but 
also because their party offered an alternative with the slogan "a new system." 
 
</P>
<P>
 But the Islamics' "new system" remains undefined. Author Rusen Cakir described 
the enigma in the title of his book, "Neither Democracy nor Islamic Sharia 
Law." Turkey's secular majority became increasingly suspicious that it would 
have an intolerant Iranian-style Islamic regime forced upon it. 
</P>
<P>
 Car window stickers have told the story of a society divided: Those declaring 
"Peace of mind is in Islam" or "Islam rules" vied with others saying "O Father, 
we follow in your steps," referring to the uncompromising secularism of the 
early 20th-Century nationalist Mustafa Kemal, called Ataturk, which means 
Father of the Turks.  
</P>
<P>
 The upper classes, increasingly closeted behind the walls of their luxury 
compounds, were worried by the conflict. The secularism drummed into young 
Turks' heads by the school system were no longer enough to keep society on an 
even keel. And many modern-minded women were frightened by the Islamics' rising 
fortunes; at meetings of the New Democracy Movement, half the audience is 
female. 
</P>
<P>
 "The elections showed that our rose garden was surrounded by sewage," said a 
woman bank official. "I wanted to do something. I don't want to have to wear a 
head scarf. The trouble is, I have a bank to run. I don't have time to get out 
door-stepping the suburbs, while the Islamic women can get out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the new groups do not want to form regular parties, and the idea is 
controversial even in the New Democracy Movement. But Boyner and his wife, 
Umit, have moved off the society pages of glossy magazines and are determined 
to unite the political center.  
</P>
<P>
 The New Democracy Movement is trying to collect and synthesize different 
political tendencies under one party roof -- a feat not pulled off since Ozal's 
heyday in the 1980s -- and to attract strong leaders. It is also trying to be a 
common home to all the ethnic groups of Anatolia, the vast Turkish heartland. 
</P>
<P>
 Crisscrossing the poor towns of Anatolia, the Boyners and the movement's other 
leaders have already visited more than half of Turkey's provinces on trips that 
are usually organized by groups of young businessmen and women. Sometimes the 
talk of commerce goes a little too far: Boyner tends to talk about gaps in the 
market, and complex, computer-generated overhead projections make them seem 
like a sales staff trying to peddle a new soap powder. 
</P>
<P>
 But the movement's agenda is clear -- and similar to that of other democratic 
groups: political reforms to end the bloody conflicts between the Turkish army 
and the Kurds in the eastern provinces; privatization and sale of state lands; 
a more democratic constitution; compromise with moderate Islamic groups and 
freedom of religion for all faiths. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to turn the whole thing upside-down," Boyner told reporters. 
Paradoxically, he believes that some of his most important help may come from 
people inside the system like himself. "There are many people in the army, 
police and the Establishment who also want to change."

POSTSCRIPT; REFLECTIONS ON AFRICA REVISITED: PROGRESS AND TRAGEDY; AFTER 14

 Some changes noted upon returning to sub-Saharan Africa after an absence of 
more than 14 years: 
</P>
<P>
 The last time I was in Kampala, Idi Amin had just been overthrown and the 
lobby of the Apollo Hotel was full of drunken Tanzanian soldiers who delighted 
in shooting out ceiling lights. The hotel had no food or electricity, and I 
drew my drinking water from a fire hose. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the newly renovated hotel is a Sheraton and a popular gathering spot in 
a city on the mend. Being able to direct-dial the United States from my room 
seemed truly revolutionary. A pianist played during dinner and the Nile perch 
was superior, even though it came from Lake Victoria, where the bodies of 
Rwandan massacre victims had been washing up on shore. I asked the waitress if 
South African wine was available and she said, "Not yet, but we'll have it 
soon." 
</P>
<P>
 The memories of my earlier time in Africa remain, and are often at odds with 
today's scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 * One of the first things most African nations did on gaining their 
independence was to start a national airline. The result was that Africa ended 
up with a gaggle of little carriers whose service and safety standards stunned 
even the heartiest of travelers. Kenya's former Atty. Gen. Charles Njonjo used 
to phone Kenya Airways on days he was scheduled to fly. If the pilot was a 
Kenyan, instead of an Indian or a British expatriate, he'd change his 
reservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Today I suspect Njonjo would be happy flying with a Kenyan at the controls 
because Kenya Airways, like a lot of other African carriers, is as good as any 
airline on the O'Hare-La Guardia run. Still, I was unnerved when the pilot 
announced over the intercom that we were flying from Nairobi to Addis Ababa, 
Ethiopia, then added after a pause: "So far so good." 
</P>
<P>
 * Mile-high Nairobi used to feel like a large, pleasant country town. But 
Kenya never heeded warnings that its birthrate was out of control, and now 
Nairobi is starting to resemble Lagos, Nigeria -- awash with too many people, 
too much crime and not much hopefulness. 
</P>
<P>
 I joined an African friend for lunch recently, and we talked about the future. 
He had been a strapping young journalist and aspiring actor. Now he was gaunt 
and wore a frayed suit. Four of his cousins had died of AIDS. He was out of a 
job and still bore the scars of two weeks' torture at the hands of the police. 
He had no idea why he had been picked up or why he had been beaten. Those 
things happen, he said without anger. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked me if I could give him $100, which I did. Why had things gotten so 
off track? I asked, and he replied with an evenness of tone that was 
unsettling: "Sometimes I wonder if Africans weren't born to suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 * After visiting Rwanda in the late 1970s, I wrote that despite a facade of 
stability, the country still seethed with tension and that the Hutu-dominated 
government had done little to foster equality for Tutsis. A government minister 
condemned the comment as ill-informed and said I would not be welcome to 
return. 
</P>
<P>
 I did return, for the first time, last month. The drive from Rusumo to 
Rwamagana was a chilling one: There were abandoned villages, looted shops, 
bloodied machetes. This had been Tutsi country, and now most of those who had 
lived along this road were dead. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eritrea, finally at peace after a 30-year war, is an appealing little 
country, though drought-stricken and very poor. A group of Eritreans gathered 
outside the library in Asmara on a recent morning. They were reading a notice 
taped to the window: The United States was holding a "diversity immigration 
lottery" that would offer legal residency to 55,000 foreigners. To enter, one 
had only to write a letter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next month a dozen Africans -- among them hotel doormen, waiters, cab 
drivers -- gave me unstamped letters and asked me to mail them when I returned 
to the United States. It's a common practice in Africa, where the postal system 
doesn't work very well. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't think much about them until I noticed that all were addressed to the 
National Visa Center in Portsmouth, N.H. Each contained a dream -- to hit the 
lottery and win a better life in the United States.

AMERICA FROM ABROAD; TOKYO'S BIGGEST U.S. EXHIBIT ISN'T JUST ABOUT FLAG-WAVING; 
AN OUTSPOKEN AFRICAN-AMERICAN PERSUADES JAPANESE PLANNERS TO SHOW RACISM AND 
CONFLICT ALONGSIDE APOLLO SPACECRAFT AND MT. RUSHMORE.

 Lonnie Bunch, project director of the Smithsonian's most ambitious exhibit 
ever -- American Festival Japan '94 -- had had enough. For days, he had argued 
that Japan's first comprehensive display of U.S. history and culture should 
stress America's racial diversity. For days, however, the Japanese side had 
resisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese just won't understand," Bunch, who is an African American, says 
he was told by his counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 So he launched into what he calls his "Martin Luther King meets William 
Jennings Bryan" speech, a thundering oration on how America had grown and 
changed by grappling with conflict. He roared that the concept was critical to 
fathoming the American national soul. He leaped to his feet. He shook his fist. 
He pounded the table. An exquisite performance -- or so he thought. 
</P>
<P>
 But from the Japanese side of the table, there was dead silence. Shock, 
perhaps, from a people accustomed to self-restraint. Finally, someone spoke, 
puzzled and concerned: "Dr. Bunch, are you feeling sick today?" 
</P>
<P>
 As Bunch tells it, it was one of the more memorable cultural snafus of the 
three-year project sponsored by the Smithsonian, Japan's NHK television network 
and the nation's largest daily newspaper, the Yomiuri Shimbun. But it reflected 
how those who staged the Smithsonian's biggest attempt to bridge a cultural 
divide had to overcome perception gaps themselves -- including differences in 
defining America. 
</P>
<P>
 Ending Aug. 31, the mammoth undertaking, an eight-week festival in the Tokyo 
suburb of Chiba, cost $41 million and covers 200,000 square feet. About half is 
devoted to the Smithsonian's exhibit, a panoramic introduction to America's 
land, people, history and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to sending extensive photos and videos, the museum shipped more 
than 400 priceless artifacts -- many shown outside the United States for the 
first time. They include the Wright Brothers' 1911 Vin Fiz airplane, the Apollo 
14 space module, Thomas Edison's first light bulb, George Washington's mess kit 
and the original gifts exchanged when Commodore Matthew Perry sailed into Edo 
Bay with his black warships to open Japan to the United States in 1853. 
</P>
<P>
 The other half was organized mainly by NHK and the Yomiuri and is more 
playful: a NASA "orbitron" to simulate space travel, a basketball court in the 
NBA Hall of Fame and concessions selling everything from hotdogs to baseball 
caps. 
</P>
<P>
 From the very start, the two sides had to sort out differences in vision, 
execution and even the basic motivation for staging such an ambitious project. 
The Japanese sponsors say they wanted to better bilateral relations and 
revitalize America's image, deteriorating into that of a land ridden with 
crime, racial conflict and economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Their initial thought was to remind people of America's great scientific 
inventions and technological grandeur, its frontier spirit and creative popular 
culture. High on their wish list were treasures that would convey this -- and 
draw in the crowds -- such as U.S. spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese people, especially young people, think they know everything about 
America and some people think we have nothing left to learn from the U.S.," 
says Mayumi Harada, a Yomiuri spokeswoman. "We wanted to deter this arrogance." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Smithsonian official they approached was not inclined to paint only 
rosy pictures. Bunch -- former senior curator of the California Afro-American 
Museum in Los Angeles -- initially turned the Japanese down flat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't interested in doing a show that just says, 'Look at these beautiful 
pieces,' " he says, as he escorts a visitor through the exhibit. "I wanted to 
tell a story. I felt strongly that if the Smithsonian was going to do this, we 
had to challenge and expand the Japanese notions of America." 
</P>
<P>
 Bunch's idea: to present a vision of how America was transformed, enriched and 
strengthened by racial and cultural diversity -- including the political 
protests and ethnic tension that engendered change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to say that America is great, but one reason is because we have 
struggled with issues of race, and that has enlarged our ideas about 
citizenship, liberty and notions of fairness," Bunch says. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a vision meant the show had to include mementos of not only America's 
ideals, but of their failure, such as a Ku Klux Klan robe. 
</P>
<P>
 It meant dealing with slavery and highlighting the civil rights movement with 
a video of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I have a dream" speech. Bunch says the 
Japanese negotiators initially resisted the proposal, but the video has turned 
out to be one of the more powerful attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunch's vision also meant enlivening the Japanese-requested icons -- the 
Statue of Liberty, the Stars and Stripes and Mt. Rushmore -- with a video of 
Ray Charles singing "America the Beautiful" and scenes of Americans in all 
shapes, sizes and colors. He added a section on women pilots and black pilots 
next to the Wright Brothers airplane. He began the Western frontier section 
with a giant photo of an Anasazi cliff dwelling in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 His aim, he says, was to go beyond the stereotypical images of America and 
show the nation's complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two sides did not always see eye to eye. "At one meeting, I was told 
that all I ever wanted was shadows and they wanted light," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The perception gap came to a head -- Bunch calls it "a wonderful moment" -- 
when a Japanese negotiator pulled him aside and said, "You're African American. 
You've been discriminated against. You're critical of America and you're angry. 
We understand that, but we just don't want it to dominate the exhibition." 
</P>
<P>
 That's when Bunch launched into another passionate speech he says surprised 
even himself, on why his criticism of America was not an expression of anger 
but an "act of love" to continue improving his cherished nation. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, the Yomiuri representatives downplayed the differences and 
said they knew nothing of the incidents Bunch related. "It's not that we 
thought the show was too gloomy, but we thought maybe it was too serious, too 
scholarly," said spokesman Masato Kikuchi. "If it's no fun, people won't come." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the NHK-Yomiuri team added the second element to the show -- 
"Enjoying America" -- featuring the sports displays, concession stands and 
American homes. They also added brought Americans from various regions to talk 
about their hometowns with Japanese audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Bunch's vision prevailed because the Smithsonian contractually 
controlled the show's content. But he remains unsure whether his message got 
across. Can a nation with only tiny minority groups truly understand America's 
racial dynamics? Is it possible to appreciate a national value that holds that 
debating problems helps solve them when a Japanese proverb advises: "Put a lid 
on smelly things"? 
</P>
<P>
 "It tested all my years as a museum curator and scholar of history," Bunch 
says, "but you're never sure whether they're going to get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the crowd's reaction, many did. The reactions were as diverse as 
America itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Aki Tachikawa, 22, was mesmerized by King's speech and said she wished Japan 
produced such visionaries. "I know America has problems with social issues . . 
. but everyone is trying to search for something and that's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadao Kishino, 58, was impressed by the forthright manner in which the exhibit 
presented the nation's legacy of racism. "If it were Japan, the negative 
aspects would never have been shown, because Japanese want to be well thought 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nobumasa Kawamura, 22, said the exhibit covered up America's flaws. "They 
should have shown more on the suppression of Native Americans, or the Vietnam 
War," he said. "America is a sick country." Biography

CULTURE; BULLDOZERS UNEARTH TREASURES IN BEIRUT; AS THE CITY REBUILDS AFTER 
WAR, ARCHEOLOGISTS SCOUR SITES. PHOENICIAN WALL IS FOUND BENEATH A MOVIE HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There's a lot of history in, around and under the streets and buildings of 
modern Beirut, enough to get in the way of eager archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent historical overlay is a definite pain. When peace finally came 
to the city in 1990, after 15 years of civil war, the first teams to start work 
were not academics but mine-disposal experts of the Lebanese army. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the military's work was done, the archeologists found they had to do 
battle with people more interested in building a new Beirut than in finding the 
old one. 
</P>
<P>
 The demolition of war-ravaged buildings downtown, as well as rebuilding, is 
the responsibility of the Lebanese Company for the Development and 
Reconstruction of Beirut Central District, known as Solidere, its French 
acronym. The company is also responsible for preservation of the area's 
archeological sites, including the ancient Phoenician port and the more recent 
Islamic city. 
</P>
<P>
 When Solidere's engineers announced that they would blow up the Rivoli movie 
house, the archeologists at the Phoenician site -- just a firecracker's throw 
behind the condemned structure -- began fingering their worry beads. On July 5, 
Solidere's engineers bored holes, laid more than 2,500 pounds of explosives and 
carefully aimed the blast so it pitched the theater forward, away from the 
Phoenician site. 
</P>
<P>
 As giant clouds of dust rolled off the pancaked building, the engineers 
scuttled alongside the groaning structure to the archeological dig. Grins 
showed under their yellow hard hats as they pronounced the site free of damage 
-- other than a thick layer of modern dust settling on the 3,000-year-old walls 
of the Phoenician city.  
</P>
<P>
 The Phoenicians called their city Berytus. It was on the eastern Mediterranean 
coast at the foot of the Lebanon Mountains and became an important center of 
Mediterranean trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the centuries, the site was occupied by Romans, Arabs, Crusaders and 
Ottoman Turks, all adding to its archeological treasures, before Lebanon became 
independent in this century after French dominion. Until the past few years, 
there had been little archeological digging in Beirut because the city had been 
continuously occupied since Phoenician times. 
</P>
<P>
 So when bulldozers paired off with dump trucks in July to clear the Rivoli 
site, the archeologists buzzed with anticipation. They recalled rumors that 
ancient structures had been buried beneath the cement floor of the theater when 
it was erected in the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 What was found, under the watchful eye of Leila Badr, an American University 
of Beirut archeologist, was a well-preserved Phoenician glacis (sloped wall) 
just 20 inches beneath the asphalt of a modern road. 
</P>
<P>
 Budgeting for a bulldozer had never crossed the mind of Helga Seeden, another 
AUB archeologist, when her team began excavating an Islamic site in downtown 
Beirut. Seeden had as much to learn about urban archeology -- and its tools -- 
as her students did when the dig began this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the current digs, the history of Phoenician Beirut had to be pieced 
together from documents. The archeological sources remained largely untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 Important pre-Phoenician cut-rock tombs from Beirut's earliest days had been 
accidentally bulldozed in 1954 while workers dug foundations for a building. 
Fortunately, much of the funerary material was salvaged. 
</P>
<P>
 In this summer's digs, coffee breaks at the Islamic site took on a special 
meaning after a bulldozer unearthed a coffee cup dating to the 1940s, a recent 
clue to the earlier culture. The site -- dating to 1517 -- was the sanctuary of 
an eminent Islamic religious authority, Abu Ali Muhammad ibn Iraq Dimashqi, who 
lived there until he left for Mecca, where he later died. His son returned to 
Beirut in 1540, with a newly popular drink called qahweh , which came into 
English as coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 During Dimashqi's time, coffee was viewed with suspicion by religious leaders, 
who forbade drinking it in Islamic Beirut. But in later eras, Beirut's port 
grew rich exporting coffee to European markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeden, head of the Islamic dig, says ignorance can be as destructive to a 
site as a bulldozer. She recalled the loss of the neolithic site of Kamed el 
Loz in the Bekaa Valley. During 20 seasons of excavations, German teams failed 
to explain their work to the locals. When the Germans left, before the Israeli 
invasion of 1982, the villagers tore into the site in search of treasure, badly 
damaging the dig. 
</P>
<P>
 The next stop for Beirut's bulldozers is an area behind three major downtown 
churches. From ancient texts, archeologists know that Beirut's renowned school 
of Roman law was in this area. Dr. Hareth Boustany, a consultant with Solidere 
on archeology and heritage, says the rulings and texts that issued from the 
school became the basis for European law systems in use today. In the 6th 
Century, Boustany says, a Greek historian wrote: "Until all the world follows 
the laws of Beirut, there will be no peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Peace has arrived in Beirut, but watching Seeden and her noisy bulldozers it 
seems some time may pass before there is quiet.

ENVIRONMENT; A TREE GROWS IN PORT-AU-PRINCE: THE BIRTH OF A GARDEN; A 
CELEBRATED AMERICAN DANCER AND A CANADIAN NATIVE ARE DETERMINED TO BUILD A 
BOTANICAL RETREAT IN ONE OF THE WORLD'S WORST SLUMS.

 The estate sits in the middle of Haiti's largest slum, a 30-acre, 
down-at-the-heels Eden that has served as a connection to a lost continent, a 
mad princess's castle, a slightly naughty resort and a voodoo shrine. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called Le Habitation LeClerc, built in the early 19th Century as the home 
of Pauline Bonaparte, the sister of Napoleon and the wife of Gen. 
Victoire-Emmanuel LeClerc, the French governor of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The estate today is largely a grand ruin, its massive trees and plants 
surrounded by crumbling walls. The streams are fetid and polluted with trash, 
its few structures almost empty. 
</P>
<P>
 The surroundings are even worse, far worse. Carrefour is a sprawling 
shantytown of tin huts scattered helter-skelter from the sea to a rutted, 
eroded mountain. Nearly half a million people are jammed into the stinking -- 
literally -- town, which abuts Port-au-Prince and is one of the poorest and 
most desperate sections of the poorest nation in the hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 When it rains, the rubble-strewn streets turn into impassable paths of gooey 
mud and boulders. When it's dry, the slum is choked with dust. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of this sort of squalor, Habitation LeClerc is an oasis, the last 
remaining coastal forest in Haiti, an area spared complete degradation because 
of its status among Haiti's voodoo followers as a sacred "community of 
spirits." 
</P>
<P>
 In its day it was glorious, one of the Caribbean's most magnificent forests. 
And if its current owner and some of the world's most important botanists have 
their way, Habitation LeClerc will thrive again, resurrected as an impressive 
scientific garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a legacy for the people of Haiti," says Cameron Broham, 44, a 
Canadian who represents the owner, American folkloric dancer Katherine Dunham. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea will be to turn the still-verdant and valuable (about $7 million) 
estate into a botanical garden. "This will be a working laboratory," Broham 
said. "It will have working trees -- fruits and plants that can be the basis 
for restoring Haiti's ecology and economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything will be of commercial value," he continued, "mangoes, gourds and 
plants for medicine." In addition to the estate itself, the long-range plans 
call for adding two more parcels in other parts of Haiti for a total of 85 
acres. 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't much in a country where 96% of what Columbus called "the Emerald 
Island" has been deforested by centuries of land-clearing plantation owners, 
wood-gathering villagers and consequent erosion. But, said Broham, "it will be 
a significant start in turning Haiti into a food-exporting nation." 
</P>
<P>
 It is no pipe dream. Dunham, who first came to Haiti in 1935 to study voodoo 
dancing and anthropology as part of a doctorate program at the University of 
Chicago, has allied her project with the most important organizations in the 
world of botany, including the prestigious New York Botanical Garden and the 
British Royal Botanical Gardens, otherwise known as Kew Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 She bought the land in 1944 for $75,000 and, after nearly two decades of using 
it as a home, Dunham turned much of the land into a spectacular resort, with a 
small hotel and private villas with swimming pools. The rooms were decorated 
with exotic, often erotic art. 
</P>
<P>
 Habitation LeClerc attracted the likes of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Mick 
Jagger and other jet-setters who found the luxurious setting and the licentious 
ambience of Haiti the equal of the Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fair to call it a bordello," said Cathy Booth, an American 
journalist who vacationed at Habitation LeClerc with her husband in 1981, "but 
it certainly was hedonistic. It was special." 
</P>
<P>
 The forest was extraordinary. It was originally called "the Source" because of 
its sweet springs which, local legend has it, rose in the lost continent of 
Atlantis. The inhabitants of Haiti had always attributed mystical powers to the 
Source, and when Spanish and French colonialists brought African slaves to the 
island, the Africans added their spirits to the mystical forest. It has been a 
religious shrine ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the French, who ruled colonial Haiti until its successful revolution and 
independence in 1804, Habitation LeClerc was known for the eccentric behavior 
of its mistress, Pauline Bonaparte, and the bloody and brutal methods of the 
governor general. After the revolution, the estate was used for the next 
century and a half as the residence and playground for various oligarchs and by 
the voodoo community for rites. More recently, the hotel, beset by changing 
international tastes, the unstable conditions of Haiti and the outbreak of 
AIDS, was shut down in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunham had left LeClerc to move to Africa and then back to the United States, 
and the estate began to deteriorate. In 1984, she asked Montreal native Broham 
to find some use for the property. He looked into several possibilities, and 
finally, in 1989, he and Dunham settled on a botanical garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspiration was the discovery of two large snakes in Dunham's bathroom in 
the house she built for herself in the 1960s. Dunham and Broham are voodoo 
initiates, and snakes, which represent Damballah, a powerful voodoo god, had 
special significance. "It has been 25 years since Damballah visited madam's 
boudoir," one of the caretakers told Broham. 
</P>
<P>
 This led to the idea of restoring the estate in the spirit of the voodoo gods 
by returning it to "the community of spirits" represented by trees and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for skeptics, the forest as it now stands is special. There are eight 
mapau trees, soaring members of the cottonwood family that grow hundreds of 
feet high. The aroma of the mango trees, ginger bushes and the hundreds of 
species of flowers fills the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunham, through a foundation, has raised about $2 million for the project, 
Broham said. He said the money is now in escrow because of an international 
economic embargo imposed after Haiti's military overthrew President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the sanctions are over," Broham said, "I think we will be successful. 
It's going to happen."

NATIONAL AGENDA; WANTED ALIVE: EX-KGB AGENTS AND INFORMERS; BALTIC STATES HUNT 
DOWN FORMER SOVIET OPERATIVES WITH A VENGEANCE. ALREADY, A PRIME MINISTER AND A 
FOREIGN MINISTER HAVE BEEN TOPPLED.

 Uldis Strelis was 11 when he was arrested during a geography class at school. 
"They sent five KGB officers for me, a little boy," Strelis said, amused at the 
memory. 
</P>
<P>
 The KGB also arrested his parents and shipped the family in cattle cars from 
their native Latvia to a collective farm in Siberia. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years after Josef Stalin's death in 1953, the Strelis family returned to 
Latvia, and today Strelis, 56, heads the now-independent nation's Department 
for the Investigation of the Crimes of Totalitarianism. One of his first 
official acts was to arrest Alfons Noviks, the man in charge of the KGB squad 
that interrupted his geography lesson all those years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Noviks, 86 and Latvian-born, was booked in mid-March, the most infamous catch 
in a Baltics-wide dragnet for KGB agents and informers from the days when 
Latvia was part of the Soviet Union. The hunt has toppled a prime minister in 
Lithuania and a foreign minister in Latvia; it has fostered accusations against 
Latvia's president, the Estonian president's late father and a handful of 
Latvian congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging by the comments of prosecutors, politicians and ordinary citizens, the 
hunt is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 As Latvian KGB head from 1941 to 1953, it is said, Noviks put to death so many 
enemies of the Soviet regime that their blood at times clogged up the shower 
drains at police headquarters. But his fortunes changed with Stalin's death; 
Noviks fell from power that same year and has spent most of his time since then 
fishing on a duck pond near his two-story cottage in Riga. Now in jail, he 
awaits trial, probably this fall, on charges of "genocide against the Latvian 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 That, at least, is what Strelis says. Noviks himself is not allowed to comment 
on his KGB days, his fishing, or anything else. Strelis won't let him meet with 
journalists, even though Noviks has yet to be tried, much less convicted.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want him to stay in isolation," Strelis said. "He should feel punished." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Latvians agree. Noviks' arrest was greeted with quiet approval, and few 
have risen to the defense of a man whose deeds earned him a reputation as 
Latvia's Stalin. 
</P>
<P>
 Noviks' son-in-law is an exception to the chorus of condemnation. His 
complaint echoes Strelis' memory of his elementary school arrest 45 years ago: 
"They sent men with machine guns to arrest him. He's just an old man." 
</P>
<P>
 In the days when the Baltic nations of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were 
gaining independence, citizens watched in dismay as smoke poured from the 
windows of KGB headquarters in the capital cities of Tallinn, Riga and Vilnius: 
The KGB was destroying files. Many more were secretly sent to Moscow, where 
they remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Within a month after Latvia achieved independence from the Soviet Union in 
1991, members of Parliament boldly marched into KGB headquarters to seize a 
batch of secret files: 3-by-5 cards listing KGB collaborators. Each 
collaborator had one card, with his name, code name, address and date of 
recruitment. There were tens of thousands of cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The cards were carried, in two suitcases and two sacks, to Parliament, where 
they were put into a safe. Later, they were handed over to Strelis. They came 
to be known as "The Sacks," and for three years Latvians have wondered 
anxiously who or what they held.  
</P>
<P>
 There were also thousands of dossiers on victims of KGB repression. Such files 
were captured throughout the Baltics -- though many were destroyed or sent to 
Moscow -- and they are now being made available to victims and their families. 
Many people in the Baltics are learning for the first time, through these 
impersonal archives, what happened to relatives who disappeared into the Soviet 
gulag or were secretly executed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to know what happened to my father," says one of many letters on 
Strelis' desk. "I want to know where his grave is." 
</P>
<P>
 "Information on victims is one thing; files on collaborators are much rarer," 
Strelis notes. "Only Latvia has The Sacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Latvian law requires candidates for Parliament to sign a pledge certifying 
that they never worked for the KGB. Following elections in June, 1993, those 
pledges were handed over to Strelis to check. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we began to verify our 100 deputies in Parliament," Strelis said, "we 
found five of them in The Sacks." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the five was Latvian Foreign Minister Georgs Andrejevs. Confronted with 
a 3-by-5 card saying he was agent Ziedonis, recruited in 1963, Andrejevs became 
the only deputy to confess. In an open letter splashed across three pages of 
Diena, Latvia's largest newspaper, he recounted how, when he was 31 and an 
up-and-coming doctor, the KGB asked him to spy on his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening, Andrejevs told his wife about the agent's offer, reassuring her 
that "I hadn't given and wouldn't give any compromising information about her 
friends or colleagues." They decided that Andrejevs should play along; 
otherwise, his doctor's career would be ruined. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing along, Andrejevs wrote, meant filing reports filled with boring 
nonsense, warning colleagues in whom the KGB had expressed interest, and 
otherwise behaving eagerly but doing nothing. Even his enemies concede that he 
became a great doctor who modernized Latvia's hospitals and medical practices. 
</P>
<P>
 In his letter, Andrejevs begged his colleagues to end the KGB hunt. He argued 
that The Sacks were far from definitive -- cards could be forged, or dug up 
from Moscow files and slipped back into Latvia to serve Russia's ends. 
</P>
<P>
 The hunt for collaborators, he said, "is the greatest absurdity and danger to 
Latvia . . . (and) will be used by various forces to achieve their narrow, 
short-term ambitions of power." 
</P>
<P>
 Parliament stripped Andrejevs of his office in June. Today, according to 
friends, he spends his days gardening. But his parting letter prompted a 
long-overdue debate. "Before Andrejevs' letter, we never had a serious, ethical 
discussion of our past," Sarmite Elerte, editor in chief of Diena, explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Latvia, Elerte said, has learned from the examples set by other countries -- 
notably Lithuania and East Germany, which threw open their secret police files 
in 1992, and were shocked to see heroes, idols and political leaders tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without the famed Latvian Sacks, KGB hunters quickly turned up a file on 
Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, a leader of the anti-Soviet 
independence movement. As agent Shatri, she -- like Andrejevs -- wrote academic 
reports for the KGB on trips abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "If such a thing can be called cooperation with the KGB, then all of us can be 
accused of cooperation with the Soviet system," Prunskiene said. In 1992, she 
too was stripped of office. 
</P>
<P>
 Latvian President Guntis Ulmanis, meanwhile, denies charges published in the 
Russian-Palestinian weekly Al Quds that he was once a KGB informer code-named 
Hugo. (The weekly is published in Russian, Arabic and English and has ties to 
the Palestine Liberation Organization, its Russian editor says.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Al Quds version gets oblique support from Andrejevs, who says that his own 
knowledge of English attracted the KGB's interest. As a boy, Andrejevs was 
taught English by a cousin who usually taught math and physics. "My cousin told 
me in 1993 that she had only taught English to two boys in her life. The first 
is known to you, while the second is the current president, Guntis Ulmanis." 
</P>
<P>
 Agent Hugo? 
</P>
<P>
 Strelis says that's not possible. "We would have found his card," he said. He 
dismissed suggestions that the card was stolen or sent to Moscow, saying the 
KGB would have to have been clairvoyant to pay special attention to Ulmanis, 
who only became president after The Sacks were seized. But Ulmanis' uncle, Karl 
Ulmanis, was Latvia's president before the 1940 occupation, while Ulmanis 
himself was a leader in the anti-Soviet opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment and with the notable exception of Noviks, Latvian KGB files are 
being used only to screen politicians. But Latvians foresee a day when legal 
actions will be brought against ordinary citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Criminal acts (indicated in the files) will be tried under criminal law," 
Elerte predicted. "If I've always wondered, 'Why have I been so unlucky in 
life?' and then, looking through the files, I see that someone who worked next 
to me all my life took care of me -- informed on me, ruined my career -- well, 
shouldn't I have the right to demand justice?"

PHOTO ESSAY; THE FADING OF REVOLUTIONARY FERVOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Stork, Stork, a Dutch photographer, recently spent two months in Cuba. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What are the three big successes of the Revolution? "Hospitals, education and 
athletics." And the three failures? "Breakfast, lunch and dinner," quipped the 
young woman waiting for her daily ration of one bread roll in central Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Tuesday, Fidel Castro celebrated yet another anniversary of his 1953 
attack on the Moncada Barracks, the first step toward revolutionary victory in 
1959. Once again the merits of the Revolution were put forth to the Cuban 
people, but tired of hearing the now old glories, they make cynical jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 While there is a small sector of the population that remains loyal to Castro 
and the Revolution, most people are simply waiting for change, any change. 
Those loyal to the cause faithfully attend neighborhood meetings of the 
Committee for the Defense of the Revolution and unanimously vote to 
"unconditionally support any and all measures employed by the government." 
Typically fewer than 15% of a block's residents attend these meetings. The 
majority of the population of Cuba continues to wait. 
</P>
<P>
 They wait for food, buses, water, electricity, government understanding and 
compromise, but most important, for the passing of Fidel Castro. "No evil can 
last 100 years," said a taxi driver. Castro, however, seems to be healthy and 
stubborn. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro's die-hard attitude of toeing a Communist line seems confused at best. 
His policies of developing tourist centers such as Varadero are done at the 
expense of rebuilding long-crumbling Havana. When buildings fall, they are left 
where they collapse. Eventually the rubble is cleared away but hardly ever is a 
new structure raised. Often these open spaces have a couple of benches erected 
and are declared parks. Public recreation facilities are left to the mercy of 
the sun and sea. Meanwhile, large hotels with luxurious swimming pools and 
restaurants cater to foreign tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 What keeps Castro in power is in part a huge black-market system of goods 
stolen from the state, as well as Cubans' uncanny mentality of comedic patience 
about their own condition. But the situation continues to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
 Those without access to dollars from either family members in the United 
States or contact with the tourist industry are quickly becoming the most 
indigent segment of society. 
</P>
<P>
 So Castro leads his country into another year of a Revolution that exists in 
name and history only. The Cubans continue to play dominoes and to gossip, the 
primary topic being how difficult their lives have become. 
</P>
<P>
 And as one old man said, "I am no longer a Fidelist, I am now a finalist." He 
too continues to wait.

MEN'S TENNIS; KRAJICEK WANTS PLAY, NOT SEEDING, REMEMBERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Krajicek is the two-time defending champion of the Los Angeles Open, 
but is seeded fifth in this year's 32-player draw. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two other players have won the tournament three consecutive times, Don 
Budge and Fred Perry, both members of the International Tennis Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 If Krajicek is on the verge of joining such an elite group, why was he seeded 
so low? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I am supposed to think of that," Krajicek said. "It means 
that the rest of the year I didn't make as many good results as I should have." 
</P>
<P>
 Seedings are based on rankings from the ATP tour and Krajicek is currently 
25th. Players seeded ahead of Krajicek in the tournament are Michael Chang, 
ranked sixth, Boris Becker, ranked 11th, Andre Agassi, ranked 15th, and 
Alexander Volkov, who fell three spots to No. 27 in the rankings this week, 
after the seedings had been completed. So tournament organizers had no choice 
but to seed Krajicek fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 But Krajicek showed Monday that despite his low seeding, L.A. is his turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Krajicek defeated Michael Joyce, 7-6 (7-1), 6-1, in a first-round match at the 
Los Angeles Tennis Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the 6-foot-5, big-serving Krajicek got his serve warmed up, he shot 11 
aces past 172nd-ranked Joyce, a wild-card entry. 
</P>
<P>
 For Joyce, the experience of playing a feature night match at the tournament 
was a little intimidating. Just last year, Joyce got nervous hitting in 
between-match exhibitions with junior players on the stadium court at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce, who attended St. Monica High, was a finalist in the boys 18-and-under 
division at Wimbledon in 1991, but found playing before his hometown crowd even 
more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very nice when you play well, but it can be terrible when you play bad," 
Joyce said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyce maintained his poise trailing, 6-5, in the first set by holding serve to 
force the tiebreaker. From there, however, Joyce had difficulty staying close 
to Krajicek. 
</P>
<P>
 "He impressed me more with the rest of his game than with his serve," Joyce 
said. "If you're 6-5, you should serve big." 
</P>
<P>
 Krajicek used a dominating forehand, covered the net well and moved around the 
court well despite knee problems. 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes the magic that he has found in Los Angeles the past two years 
continues. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people are very nice, the weather is always nice and you have a lot of 
good restaurants," Krajicek said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the possibility that Krajicek could meet Chang in the semifinals, 
which would be a rematch of last year's final. Despite having a difficult time 
against Chang last year -- Krajicek lost the first seven games in an 0-6, 7-6 
(7-3), 7-6 (7-5) victory -- Krajicek remained upbeat about the possibility of a 
rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope I play him in the semis because it means I (will have reached) the 
semis," Krajicek said. 
</P>
<P>
 In another first-round match Bryan Shelton of Atlanta, Ga., had three match 
points against Volkov, but could not capitalize. The Russian rallied to win, 
6-7 (5-7), 7-6 (9-7), 6-3. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's about as frustrating as it gets," Shelton said. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Open Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's attendance was 7,004. . . . A security guard did not immediately 
recognize Boris Becker and prevented him from entering the locker room after 
noticing that Becker did not have a proper pass.

 First-round draft choice Wayne Gandy, who has been moved from third to second 
team, will start at left tackle in Saturday's exhibition opener against the 
Green Bay Packers at Madison, Wis.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's made a move," said Jim Erkenbeck, Ram offensive line coach."It's going 
to be hard to keep Gandy out of there. This guy can play and will play. He has 
that ability to turn it up a notch, that game tempo that makes him something 
special." 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy missed the opening of training camp while completing negotiations on a 
five-year contract. He remains No. 2 behind Clarence Jones, but Bill Schultz, 
who was working as No. 2 left tackle, has moved to right guard to challenge Tom 
Newberry.

 Quarterback T.J. Rubley, who is battling Jamie Martin for the No. 3 spot, has 
been ordered by team physicians not to throw for a week to rest a sore arm.

<P>
 The knee injury to starting defensive end Fred Stokes has given veteran Gerald 
Robinson and rookie Brad Ottis an opportunity to improve their stock.

 Dallas Cowboys running back Derrick Lassic, backup to Emmitt Smith, faces 
surgery this week for a torn knee tendon and likely will miss the entire 
season. Lassic injured the quadriceps tendon in his right knee during Sunday 
night's exhibition victory over the Minnesota Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 Former first-round draft pick Kelly Stouffer was waived by the Miami Dolphins, 
meaning Doug Pederson will likely be the team's No. 3 quarterback this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan returned a $20,000 pay cut he had forced linebacker Garth Jax to 
accept. It had been the second pay cut in two years for the ninth-year player. 
</P>
<P>
 Moe Elewonibi, who started 15 games at offensive tackle after Jim Lachey was 
injured last preseason, was released by Washington. The Redskins were 
apparently looking to make room under the salary cap in order to sign 
quarterback Heath Shuler, their No. 1 draft choice.

<P>
 Raider linebacker Rob Fredrickson, the team's No. 1 draft choice, was unhappy 
with his play in Sunday's 25-22 overtime exhibition victory over the Denver 
Broncos at Montjuic Olympic Stadium in Barcelona, Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson is being asked to switch from his outside linebacker spot to the 
middle for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was different out there, like going from checkers to chess," he said. 
"Overall, I'd rate my performance poor, but, because it's the preseason, I'm 
not disappointed. Every day, I feel I'm getting better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to concentrate on the mental aspect. I think I can adjust to the 
speed of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson is battling second-year player Greg Biekert for the starting 
middle linebacker spot left vacant when Joe Kelly was cut in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Denver Coach Wade Phillips was understandably upset about losing to the 
Raiders for the fifth consecutive time. But what upset him most was the manner 
in which it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders won a coin toss at the start of overtime, marched down the field, 
and Jeff Jaeger kicked a 39-yard field goal for the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos never touched the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversy has always surrounded the NFL's sudden-death format, but Phillips 
thinks a new rule that moves kickoffs back from the 35-yard line to the 30 is 
unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "By kicking from the 30 the team that receives (in overtime) is going to win 
90% of the time," he said. "All the pressure is on the defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Would he like to see a full 15-minute overtime instead of sudden death? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that would be fairer," Phillips said. "The percentages now are too 
high. It's too big an advantage." STEVE SPRINGER

 U.S. Labor Secretary Robert Reich met separately last week with the lead 
negotiators for baseball players and owners, and the Clinton Administration 
said Monday it is willing to assist in the stalled talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Rosenthal, an associate deputy secretary of labor, said Reich had met 
with union head Donald Fehr and management negotiator Richard Ravitch last week 
in New York. 
</P>

 Eugene Orza, the associate general counsel of the Major League Baseball 
Players Assn., said the union was willing to talk with the Labor Department but 
not let any outside party impose a settlement.

 The Oakland Athletics put first baseman Mark McGwire on the 15-day disabled 
list and recalled outfielder Ernie Young from triple-A Tacoma. 
</P>
<P>
 McGwire has a muscle pull in his left heel. It is his second stint on the 
disabled list -- he sat out 43 games from April 30-June 17 -- and his third in 
the last two seasons.

<P>
 McGwire was batting .252 in 47 games with nine home runs and 25 runs batted

BASEBALL DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; THIS IDEA SIMPLY DIDN'T HAVE CHANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans organizing against a players strike called for those attending games to 
chant "No Strike, No Strike," during the third inning. But at Dodger Stadium, 
Monday night's third inning passed without any chanting. 
</P>
<P>
 Brett Butler, told before the game about the fans' third-inning protest, said: 
"They need to do that in the owners' conference room, it's not the players who 
are doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler called the comments Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf made Sunday 
posturing. Reinsdorf said that he would be willing to come to an agreement with 
the players union without a salary cap, which is being sought by the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would be hopeful from some of the things they are saying that it appears 
they would want to get this thing done," Butler said. "But if they don't want a 
work stoppage, they would have done something a long time ago." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers will play a day game in Cincinnati on Aug. 11, the day before the 
players have threatened to strike.  
</P>
<P>
 "The strike doesn't start until the final out of the final game on the 11th, 
so after our game we will get on the (team) plane and come back (to Los 
Angeles)," Butler said. "I'm making plans to go home to Atlanta with my family 
on the 14th, unless things are changed. " 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers have a nine-game homestand scheduled that begins Aug. 12 and 
includes three games each against the Chicago Cubs, the Pittsburgh Pirates and 
the Florida Marlins.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza has thrown out only 17 of 78 runners attempting to steal, 22%, 
compared with 35% last season. "It's part of my game that I need to work on 
(defense), which sometimes it is difficult because I can't come out before a 
game and throw to second base, I have to conserve my energy for the game."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; REDS USE LONG BALL, PASSED BALL TO OVERCOME WILLIAMS' 
41ST HOMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cincinnati Reds hit three solo home runs and used a passed ball in the 
ninth inning for the go-ahead run to defeat the San Francisco Giants, 4-3, at 
San Francisco for their fourth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinch-runner Jacob Brumfield, in for Brian Hunter, who had walked, came home 
when reliever Steve Frey's pitch bounced off the glove of Giant catcher Kirt 
Manwaring. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Burba (2-6) started the ninth for the Giants and retired one batter 
before walking Hunter. After Brumfield stole second, Tony Fernandez walked and 
Bret Boone, who homered earlier, grounded out to advance the runners. 
</P>
<P>
 Frey relieved and walked pinch-hitter Brian Dorsett, as Brumfield came home on 
ball four. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a sinker -- just like any other of my sinkers," Frey said. "It wasn't 
a strike. Normally, it would have been a walk and I would have moved on to the 
next guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Ruffin (7-2) got the victory with two innings of scoreless relief. Jeff 
Brantley pitched the ninth for his 13th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Williams hit his major league-leading 41st home run for the Giants in the 
fifth to cut San Francisco's deficit to 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, Boone and Hal Morris all hit solo home runs and right-hander Erik 
Hanson just about shut down the Giants' powerful middle hitters before he 
sprained his left knee with the score tied, 3-3, in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 4, New York 2 -- Greg Maddux pitched an eight-hitter at New York for 
his major league-leading ninth complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddux (14-6) struck out eight and walked one as the Braves won for the fourth 
time in five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred McGriff hit his 28th homer against loser Jason Jacome (4-2) in the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacome, in his sixth major league start, accounted for New York's first run 
with an infield single in the second inning. He gave up two runs on five hits 
while striking out three and walking one in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 3, St. Louis 2 -- Marquis Grissom hit an inside-the-park homer 
against Rich Rodriguez in the 10th inning at Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Grissom led off the inning with his 10th homer, a shot off the glove of center 
fielder Gerald Young in deep center field. 
</P>
<P>
 Young tried to make an over-the-shoulder catch, but the ball glanced off his 
glove and caromed along the wall toward left field as Grissom, who never 
hesitated, raced around the bases and beat shortstop Ozzie Smith's relay to the 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
 The NL East-leading Expos have won 12 of 13 games, while St. Louis lost for 
the eighth time in nine outings. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado 8, Houston 3 -- Lance Painter pitched four-hit ball over five innings 
and Mike Kingery had four hits at Houston as the Rockies continued their 
mastery of the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies are 17-4 against the Astros over the last two seasons, 5-2 this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was Houston's fourth in a row and dropped the Astros 3 1/2 games 
behind the Cincinnati Reds in the NL Central Division. The Astros led the 
division by a half-game five days ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Bagwell hit his 37th homer for the Astros, a two-run shot in the fourth 
that tied Jimmy Wynn's club record. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 8, Florida 5 -- Chuck Crim was a winner at Chicago in his first start 
in seven years, helping the Cubs extend the Marlins' losing streak to seven 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Wilkins and Rey Sanchez each drove in two runs in a five-run first inning 
as the Cubs won for the 10th time in 14 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Crim (5-4), a last-minute replacement for the injured Mike Morgan, gave up six 
hits and two runs in 5 1/3 innings. He did not walk a batter and struck out 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Crim's sixth major league start and first since 1987, when he pitched 
for Milwaukee. His only other victory as a starter was June 2, 1987, over 
Kansas City, in his first major league start. 
</P>
<P>
 Crim's longest relief outing this season was three innings. His longest start 
was 6 1/3 innings on June 16, 1987, against Minnesota.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; INDIANS DON'T MISS BELLE IN BEATING TIGERS

 Who needs Albert Belle? 
</P>
<P>
 The Cleveland Indians, beginning a seven-game stretch without their suspended 
slugger, got home runs from Paul Sorrento, Carlos Baerga and Manny Ramirez and 
defeated the Detroit Tigers, 6-2, on Monday night at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Belle, who leads the Indians with 35 home runs, 98 runs batted in and a .359 
average, began his six-day, seven-game suspension for taking a corked bat to 
the plate July 15 in Chicago. The impact of his absence, however, was debatable 
because he has only a .174 career mark against Mike Moore, the Tigers' starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, you can't replace Albert in the lineup," said Sorrento, who turned 
the game around with a two-run homer in the seventh. "He's too valuable, one of 
the best in the business right now. But I think the team was ready for the 
challenge. We're just going to have to pick up the slack for six or seven 
games." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Grimsley struck out eight in 7 2/3 innings to help stop the Indians' 
three-game losing streak. They pulled within 1 1/2 games of the AL 
Central-leading Chicago White Sox, who were idle. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Whitaker homered, doubled and scored twice for the Tigers, who are 0-4 at 
Jacobs Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimsley (4-1) gave up two runs and six hits in 7 2/3 innings. Eric Plunk got 
the final out in the eighth, and Jeff Russell finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 1, Minnesota 0 -- Cal Ripken became only the second major leaguer to 
play in 2,000 consecutive games, reaching the mark at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken got a standing ovation from the crowd of 27,712 when he came to bat in 
the first inning after it was announced that he was playing No. 2,000. He waved 
to the crowd, then waited a moment before taking off his helmet to acknowledge 
the appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken, trailing only Lou Gehrig's streak of 2,130 games, went 0-for-4. He 
made two nice plays at shortstop, spinning completely around after grabbing 
Jeff Reboulet's grounder behind second base in the second inning and going deep 
in the hole to throw out Shane Mack to end the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Rhodes (2-5) pitched a seven-hitter a day after being recalled from 
triple-A Rochester. He was saved with two outs in the ninth when defensive 
replacement Mike Devereaux made a diving catch in center field on Matt 
Walbeck's liner with a runner on first. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhodes, whose struggles had left him back in the minors, struck out four and 
walked one in the second shutout of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore scored an unearned run on Mark McLemore's single in the second 
against Pat Mahomes (8-5). Baltimore won for the fourth time in 13 games while 
Minnesota lost its fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 8, Milwaukee 3 -- Melido Perez gave up five hits in eight innings and 
Mike Gallego hit a two-run homer for the Yankees at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez (9-3) overcame a wild third inning, when he hit Kevin Seitzer just below 
the left eye with a pitch. Seitzer left under his own power and was taken to a 
hospital. The Brewers said he suffered a sinus fracture. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez, who hasn't lost since June 8, won his fourth consecutive decision, his 
sixth win in nine starts, striking out seven -- including Greg Vaughn three 
times. Perez walked one and threw two wild pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallego tied the score, 3-3, in the fifth inning with his sixth homer of the 
season, a two-run drive against Bill Wegman (8-4). Paul O'Neill's sacrifice fly 
scored the go-ahead run. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 6-3, Boston 2-4 -- Mo Vaughn homered to cap a four-run first inning as 
the Red Sox won the nightcap to gain a doubleheader split at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto won the first game as Joe Carter hit the 300th home run of his career 
and Pat Hentgen pitched a six-hitter for his sixth complete game. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, Nate Minchey -- called up from the minors between games of 
the doubleheader -- was helped by three double plays. Minchey (2-3) gave up 
eight hits in seven innings and lowered his earned-run average from 11.25 to 
8.61.

 Mark Gubicza gave up three hits in eight shutout innings Monday night as the 
Kansas City Royals defeated the Oakland Athletics, 4-2, at Kansas City to 
extend their winning streak to 10 games, their longest in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gubicza (7-8) struck out three and walked one.Jeff Montgomery got his 24th 
save after making a two-run throwing error with the bases loaded in the ninth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Darling (10-10), who had won six consecutive decisions, gave up three runs 
and nine hits in seven innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most games, that's a winning effort," A's Manager Tony La Russa said. 
"Gubicza left him no room for any mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Lind singled with one out in the third and Brian McRae hit his fourth 
homer. Lind doubled in the seventh and scored on McRae's single, and a 
run-scoring double by Mike Macfarlane in the eighth gave the Royals a 4-0 lead.

 And now the test. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash won its 10th home game of the season, a 7-1 victory Monday over the 
Pittsburgh Stingers, the best road team in the Continental Indoor Soccer 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Splash's fourth victory in five games, and now comes the critical 
point in its 28-game season. On deck is the CISL's longest trip, seven games 
against four teams with a .500 record or better. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash (13-5) is 10-1 at The Pond of Anaheim, but only 3-4 away from home.

 "Championships are won on the road," defender Ralph Black said. "If anybody 
thinks going 3-4 on this road trip is good, we might be watching the 
championship at home; 3-4 is not acceptable for this team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash at least has some momentum heading into the trip. Rod Castro and 
Armando Valdivia scored twice against the Stingers (9-9), and Denis Hamlett, 
Doug Neely and Dale Ervine each scored once. 
</P>
<P>
 Raffaele Ruotolo, who assisted Neely on his league-record 11th power-play 
goal, extended to 19 his indoor record for consecutive games with an assist. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash's next home game is Aug. 28 against Sacramento.

LOCAL NOTES: HARRIS LEAVES LOYOLA MARYMOUNT FOR RANCHO SANTIAGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Point guard Jimmy Harris, a four-year starter at Ocean View High, has left 
Loyola Marymount after one season and enrolled at Rancho Santiago College. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Harris, Harris' father and basketball coach at Ocean View, said his son 
needed a change of scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was unhappy with himself and he needed a fresh start," his father said. 
"We took three, four weeks and sat and talked about it. I'd rather have him 
happy than secure with a scholarship. If he's half the player we think he is, 
he'll come back and re-enter another (four-year school)." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, who averaged 18 points as a Ocean View senior and was named 
second-team Times All-County, started half of LMU's games and averaged three 
points and four assists.

 Dick Rosenthal, athletic director at Notre Dame since 1987, will retire next 
year and be succeeded by Canada's ambassador to Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal announced his plans Monday, saying he wanted to spend more time with 
his family. The retirement becomes effective on Aug. 1, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal was responsible for an exclusive contract with NBC-TV for home 
football games, plans for an expansion of Notre Dame Stadium, the hiring of 
John MacLeod to replace Digger Phelps as basketball coach and, starting in 
September of 1995, affiliation with the Big East Conference in all sports 
except football. 
</P>
<P>
 As is Rosenthal, who played basketball and baseball at Notre Dame in the early 
1950s, the school's next athletic director is a former Irish athlete: Michael 
A. Wadsworth, a 1966 Notre Dame graduate and Canadian ambassador to Ireland 
since 1989.

 Krushelnyski, 34, a forward, had played for Toronto the last four seasons. He 
had five goals and six assists in 54 games last season. Krushelnyski also 
played on three Stanley Cup champions in Edmonton and was involved in the trade 
that sent Wayne Gretzky from the Oilers to the Kings. In 12 seasons, 
Krushelnyski has 239 goals and 325 assists.

JACKSON, PRESLEY ARE WED, SAYS PUBLICIST; CELEBRITIES: THE ENTERTAINER AND THE

<P>
 In an unprecedented merging of pop dynasties, Elvis Presley's daughter 
confirmed Monday through a publicist that she and Michael Jackson were married 
about 10 weeks ago in a private ceremony outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Marie Presley, 26, announced her wedding to Jackson, 35, in a statement 
released through Jackson's publicist in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very much in love with Michael," she stated. "I dedicate my life to 
being his wife. I understand and support him. We both look forward to raising a 
family and living a happy, healthy life together. We hope friends and fans will 
understand and respect our privacy." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no comment directly from the pop star groom or from Presley. But Bob 
Jones, his publicist, said Jackson is "very happy . . . like any newlywed." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the couple were staying in an apartment at Trump Tower on 5th 
Avenue in New York City, owner Donald Trump told reporters. A large crowd 
waited outside the building for a glimpse of the pair after a statement by 
Trump that the newlyweds appeared happy. 
</P>
<P>
 The pop world was startled by confirmation of the marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I'm surprised that the rumors were true, and most everybody I talked 
to in the business has felt the same way," said Jeffrey Pollack, chairman of 
Pollack Media Group, a prominent international consulting firm for radio and 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony apparently occurred May 26 in the Dominican Republic -- just as a 
Dominican judge, Hugo Francisco Alvarez, had been saying for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The marriage comes at a critical time in the singer's career -- just months 
after he spent an estimated $15 million to $24 million to settle a lawsuit 
filed on behalf of a 13-year-old Beverly Hills boy who said the pop star 
sexually molested him in 1993. The entertainer said the negative publicity 
surrounding the accusations caused him to become addicted to painkillers and 
forced the cancellation of his world tour. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has vehemently denied the allegations but remains the subject of a 
criminal investigation in Los Angeles. His lawyers demanded on July 6 that 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti either charge the pop star or exonerate him now that a 
grand jury investigating the matter has been disbanded. So far, Jackson has not 
been charged, nor has the investigation been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Casale, program director at news-talk radio station WMC in Presley's home 
town of Memphis, said listeners jammed telephone lines with calls about the 
marriage during Janis Fullilove's popular drive-hour show. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like, 'This just can't be real,' " Casale said of listeners' 
responses. "Elvis would be turning over in his grave if he heard the news." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the wedding was reported aggressively by tabloid newspapers, other 
media backed off the story after the reports at first were heatedly denied by 
Jackson's representatives, including Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Contending that the denials hurt his reputation, the Dominican judge offered 
last month to take a lie detector test and fly to the United States with copies 
of wedding documents. 
</P>
<P>
 In her statement Monday, Elvis Presley's daughter, who plans to use the name 
Presley-Jackson, said the public confirmation was delayed for "several reasons, 
foremost being we are both very private people living in the glare of the 
public media. We both wanted a private marriage ceremony without the 
distraction of a media circus." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple has been in New York since the wedding, sources said. Jackson has 
been working there on final details of an album that is scheduled to be 
released in early November. Titled "History: His Story," the collection is to 
include five new songs, as well as 20 of Jackson's biggest hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as his career goes, I don't think it will matter one way or the 
other," Pollack said. "If the songs on his new album are good, Michael will be 
a hit. Michael is still widely respected by radio programmers everywhere. 
Whether he's married or has had difficulties, it doesn't matter. All that 
counts is the music." 
</P>
<P>
 Priscilla Presley, mother of the bride and former wife of the late rock star, 
issued a statement Monday that she was "totally supportive" of the wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Jackson's family, a representative of the singer's parents said: "They 
are not saying a word." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to Jackson said he and Presley have known each other for about 
two years. They have been seen in public frequently, including earlier this 
year in Las Vegas. In April, Presley announced that she was ending her 5 
1/2-year marriage to rock guitarist Danny Keough, 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny and I will always love each other," Presley said in a statement at the 
time. "However, friendship was more suitable for us than marriage. We have two 
wonderful children (Danielle, 5, and Benjamin, 18 months), and we plan to have 
joint custody of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Jackson, Presley has been an extremely private person. Jerry Schilling, a 
longtime friend of her father's and a veteran Los Angeles pop manager, said 
that he helped her explore a singing career a few years ago but that she gave 
up that pursuit when she became pregnant with her second child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lisa Marie is very smart and very strong-willed," Schilling said. "When she 
says something, she looks you in the eye and means it. She's not someone to do 
things on a whim or to be easily manipulated. She wouldn't do this unless she 
believed in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Elvis Presley, the most celebrated figure in modern pop history, died on Aug. 
16, 1977. He named Lisa Marie, his only child, as his only heir. The estate was 
put in trust for her until she turned 25 on Feb. 1, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The net value of the trust is believed to be nearly $150 million.

PLAN FOR NEW SCHOOL COMPLEX OKD BY BOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first step toward creating a large complex of schools in one of the Los 
Angeles Unified School District's most crowded areas, the Board of Education on 
Monday approved an ambitious project aimed at providing 16,500 students with 
courses linked to their career interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would be the largest of its kind in the nation and would enable 
about 3,600 students who are bused to less crowded campuses primarily in the 
San Fernando Valley to remain in their Pico-Union, Chinatown and Echo Park 
neighborhoods, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the kids who are on the bus now will have a choice to come home," said 
Dominic Shambra, the district's director of planning and development. "We're 
looking at taking a different instructional approach and using our facilities 
in different ways." 
</P>
<P>
 The Belmont Learning Complex would involve converting Belmont High into a 
middle school, building a new high school for 5,300 students on 35 acres 
Downtown near Temple Street and Beaudry Avenue, and opening a communications 
and media high school on an existing campus. Plans also call for a school 
designed for immigrant students. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 5 to 1 to move forward on the project. Board member Leticia 
Quezada opposed the project because of its size and cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district has already acquired the land for the high school, 
officials say they are relying on the state to pay most or all of the 
$110-million price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the project gets funded probably will be determined in November when 
voters decide a school construction bond measure. The district, the largest in 
the state, would receive a large chunk of that money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're betting on the come," Shambra said. "If that bond doesn't pass, nobody 
will build a school in the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, district officials said they are forging ahead with their 
ambitious plan to open the schools by July, 1998. "It's on a fast track," 
Shambra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the district does not receive full funding from the state, Shambra 
said the school system has other options. The developer could build and finance 
the project and then the district could later buy it back, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But board members expressed concern that the money might not be available and 
that the project could be derailed. "It's a lot of money and I don't know where 
the millions of dollars are going to come from," Quezada said. "I can't really 
feel confident that we can say the money will come." 
</P>
<P>
 The board is expected to vote again in January -- to approve a developer and 
final plans for the high school -- and officials said they would have a better 
idea then of the financial picture. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools would be state-of-the-art campuses with computers in every 
classroom. Students would be able to take courses in international studies, 
health and human services, law and government and travel and tourism. A 
so-called Media Academy would be established at the existing Downtown Business 
Magnet, which is next to the district's television station offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada said the proposed high school is too large and would be unfair to 
teachers and students.

STILL JUST A FLICKER; WOMEN ENTERED FIREFIGHTING YEARS AGO, BUT FEW HAVE JOINED 
THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 1986 TV movie "Firefighter," the first woman to join the Los Angeles 
County Fire Department blazes a gender-bending trail meant to light a fire 
under prospective female recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though in real life the subject of the film faced hazing that included a 
sanitary napkin dispenser being thrown at her feet (to which she responded, 
"That's not my brand" before stalking out), Cindy Barbee hoped that her 1983 
breakthrough would encourage other women to storm the firehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 But 11 years later, any sequel to the TV movie about Barbee would be too 
downbeat to be made. Out of 2,400 county firefighters, only 11 -- less than 
half of 1% -- are women, one of whom is undergoing a sex-change operation to 
become a man. 
</P>
<P>
 And to the chagrin of county officials, a federal judge recently overturned 
the Fire Department's attempt to be sensitive to its female employees: a ban on 
Playboy magazine and other sexually explicit magazines in fire stations. 
</P>
<P>
 The court found that the ban violated constitutional guarantees of free speech 
and press. The county is appealing the order, which specifically permits "the 
quiet reading" of Playboy, but some female firefighters fear that a second 
court defeat would strengthen the male grip on the department by permitting all 
skin magazines in the stations, including hard-core pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 Dismal as the county's record of hiring female firefighters sounds, the 
national picture is not that much brighter. Since the first woman became a 
full-time firefighter 20 years ago in Arlington County, Va., only 4,000 women 
have joined the ranks. They constitute less than 2% of the 250,000 paid 
firefighters nationwide.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's still a men's club, or, as I like to call it, a boys' club, because some 
of them aren't that mature," said Barbee, who is 38. 
</P>
<P>
 It pays to be a member of that club. County firefighters earn at least $35,000 
a year for working 10 round-the-clock shifts per month, an annual salary that 
increases with seniority, promotions and overtime. Last year, Barbee earned 
$89,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the allure of the money, few women succeed at getting hired because 
they lack the upper-body strength to pass entrance exams that include dragging 
bulky hoses and lifting heavy ladders. Fewer women than men apply anyway, and 
when they do, their failure rate is much higher. In the county's last physical 
exam for the firefighter trainee program, almost half of the hundreds of male 
applicants passed, while only six women -- or 16.6% of the 36 who tried -- made 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighting is one of the few professions in which technology has not 
necessarily made the job less physically taxing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the introduction of some automated equipment, firefighters need to be 
stronger than ever because the modern gear they wear -- including oxygen tanks 
that resemble scuba equipment and weigh nearly 40 pounds -- is heavier. But 
just how much strength is necessary to do the job and whether mandatory 
physical entrance exams are designed fairly are central questions in the debate 
over how to bring more women into fire service. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one agrees on how much strength you need and how you measure it," said 
Terese Floren, executive director of Women in Fire Service, an international 
trade association. "Every citizen who pays taxes has a right to expect 
firefighters who are competent to do the job. The question is how strong is 
strong enough? If you (overemphasize) one aspect, you're going to miss out on 
others, like teamwork and intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, where women make up 8% of the Fire Department -- among the 
highest proportions in the nation -- a spokesman said women have improved life 
in the firehouse for everyone. Women are responsible for the fact that most 
modern fire stations have semiprivate sleeping areas instead of large, communal 
dormitories, said San Diego Capt. Bob Zepeda.  
</P>
<P>
 Several major departments have managed to hire a larger percentage of women 
than Los Angeles County, largely because they have changed their physical tests 
and training programs, prompted in some cases by affirmative action lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles, which was under a federal consent decree in the 
mid-1970s to increase the number of minorities in its Fire Department, 
eventually started actively recruiting women to avoid being sued, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has 53 female firefighters -- 2% of the force -- many of whom 
participated in a special training program run by the department to get women 
in shape for the physical test. But a spokesman said the department may soon 
eliminate the 10-week program or find private funding to pay the 
$45,000-per-session cost because of fear of a lawsuit by male firefighters who 
have formally complained that it is discriminatory to spend public dollars to 
train only one gender. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County has never made a special effort to train women to take the 
test. Officials say the county cannot afford to provide such programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The handful of female county firefighters who agreed to be interviewed said 
they support more aggressive efforts to recruit women, but oppose offering 
special training programs or making the physical test easier because they 
believe strength is an important qualification. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Deborah Lawrence, the highest ranking woman in the county Fire 
Department, said she had no trouble passing the physical test seven years ago 
when she decided to switch from nursing to firefighting.  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be superhuman," said Lawrence, who is a muscular, 5 feet 7 
1/2 inches tall and weighs 135 pounds. "Women can do it if they get in shape, 
but you have to want it, you have to commit yourself to training hard, and you 
have to do it for the rest of your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence, 38, said her upbringing probably helped her succeed. Her parents 
treated her and her three younger brothers equally, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Physical weakness is not the only reason women have not broken into fire 
service in great numbers, firefighters say. Even strong women may be deterred 
by the lack of privacy in older stations that have communal dormitories and 
bathrooms, by grooming standards that until recently called for military-style 
men's haircuts for women and by the sometimes hostile working environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're definitely working in a fishbowl, and there are people that want to 
see you fail," said Janet Babcock, 31, the third woman to join the county Fire 
Department. "I've seen guys drop ladders, but no one talks about that. You hear 
about it if you're a girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Male and female firefighters agreed that the days are long gone when sexist 
incidents were common, like the one in which a fire captain threw the sanitary 
napkin dispenser at Barbee's feet in a fit of pique shortly after she joined 
the department. "The way things are now, if you get out of line, there's a 
lawyer waiting in the wings," said Los Angeles County Firefighter Rick Ortiz, 
41. The county department still does not have a women's locker room in its 
training academy in East Los Angeles, much to the consternation of female 
trainees. Unlike men, who have a large room with showers and lockers, female 
trainees have to scramble down to the basement to use a small restroom with a 
shower during the brief periods recruits are given to change clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials cited limited financial resources, but a new battalion 
chief in charge of training has recently pledged to find the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbee and Inspector Jerilynn Haertsch, another county firefighter, also are 
trying to get the department to force its supplier to make uniforms for women. 
Now, female firefighters have to either make do with baggy, ill-fitting 
uniforms cut for men, make expensive alterations or spend their own money on 
properly fitting clothes, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But ill-fitting uniforms and unequal facilities pale by comparison to the 
physical test as deterrents for women. 
</P>
<P>
 Like night and day, San Diego and New York illustrate how differences in those 
physical tests affect the composition of a fire department. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York City, applicants are ranked primarily according to how fast they 
complete events such as climbing stairs while wearing heavy gear. Men beat 
women in most events, so they are hired first. The department hired its first 
woman in 12 years this summer.  
</P>
<P>
 To get women in shape for the New York test, female members of the department 
recently helped raise $75,000 from private sources for a pre-training fitness 
program.  
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the spectrum, San Diego changed its physical test in 1977 
in response to an affirmative action lawsuit. Among other things, the 
department abolished height and weight requirements, and eliminated such events 
as having to lift a ladder overhead five times consecutively, Zepeda said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been absolutely no decline in our safety record or the quality of 
our applicants," Chief Robert Osby said. "If anything, it's been the opposite." 
Women on the Fire Lines 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, a woman in Arlington County, Va., became the first female, 
full-time, paid firefighter in U.S. history. Today, fire service remains a 
male-dominated occupation: 03,17,23,14 Location Number of Women/Total % of 
Women * Nationwide 4,000 out of 250,000 1.6% * L.A. County 11 out of 2,400 Less 
than 1% * L.A. city 53 out of 2,700 About 2% * San Diego 71 out of 851 About 8% 
* San Francisco 73 out of 1,459 5% * New York 36 out of 11,234 Less than 1%

DETECTIVES IN SIMPSON CASE WEIGH POSSIBLE LIBEL ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police detectives in the O.J. Simpson murder investigation -- 
whose credibility has been assailed by defense attorneys, tabloids and a 
national magazine -- are striking back, asking lawyers to investigate libel or 
defamation action on their behalf and demanding a public apology from Simpson's 
lead attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the Los Angeles Police Protective League and a private attorney 
are investigating filing lawsuits against members of the defense team and 
against publications who published statements suggesting that the detectives 
had lied. Several tabloids and the New Yorker magazine are among the possible 
defendants, lawyers for the officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were asked by members of the league, who are investigating officers in the 
O.J. Simpson case, to represent their legal interests," said Hank Hernandez, 
general counsel to the league, the union that represents rank-and-file police 
officers. "We are in the process of investigating defamatory statements made in 
some of these tabloids and magazines." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said the league's board of directors authorized the move and that he 
was preparing to "take aggressive action to exonerate the reputations of these 
outstanding detectives." 
</P>
<P>
 The most assertive action has come from Detective Mark Fuhrman, a veteran 
detective in the LAPD's West Los Angeles division, whose actions in the Simpson 
case were attacked by unnamed defense attorneys in a New Yorker piece published 
July 25. In that article, lawyers for Simpson were quoted as calling Fuhrman a 
"bad cop" and a racist who might have planted a key piece of evidence against 
their client. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without question, these defamatory statements have been republished more 
times, through numerous forms of media, to more people than any prior 
defamatory statements in the history of mankind," said Robert H. Tourtelot, a 
lawyer representing Fuhrman, said in a letter sent Monday to Simpson's lead 
attorney, Robert L. Shapiro. "The statements are not only false and libelous, 
they are simply outrageous and despicable." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Tourtelot said he expects to sue the New Yorker as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurie Perl, vice president in charge of public relations at the New Yorker, 
declined to comment on Tourtelot's letter or statements. "At this point, I 
would have nothing to say on that," Perl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said he had not accused Fuhrman of racism and did not intend to make 
the detective's racial views an issue in the case. "I've always said that race 
is not and will not be an issue," Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 No lawsuit has yet been filed, Tourtelot said, explaining that he did not want 
to do anything that might compromise the investigation into the June 12 murders 
of and Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. Tourtelot added that he 
expects to name Simpson as a defendant in his lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, however, he urged Shapiro to publicly retract the accusations 
against Fuhrman and asked members of the defense team to make a public apology 
to the detective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although a retraction and apology certainly cannot erase the pain and anguish 
which our client and his family have suffered, you can help ease the 
humiliation and hurt they continue to experience arising from the hatred and 
contempt which your statements have engendered," Tourtelot wrote.

ALLRED URGES D.A. TO REQUEST DEATH PENALTY FOR SIMPSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In another sign of the politicization of the O.J. Simpson murder case, 
feminist attorney Gloria Allred on Monday called on Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti to 
ask for the death penalty against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Allred contended at a Downtown news conference that if Garcetti declines to 
seek the maximum penalty of death, it will indicate that he is showing 
favoritism to a celebrity defendant and manifesting insufficient concern about 
the plight of battered women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Were it not a celebrity defendant, it seems highly likely that (Garcetti) 
would ask for the death penalty in a case such as this involving allegations of 
first-degree murder with special circumstances as he has in the Menendez 
brothers case, where there are the same number of victims as exist in this 
case," Allred said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a photo of Nicole Brown Simpson on her bright red suit, Allred noted 
that in recent months the district attorney's office had asked for the death 
penalty in two cases in which women had hired "hit men" to murder their 
husbands. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mr. Simpson committed the murders with which he is charged, he certainly 
shouldn't get a break from the D.A. on the death penalty because he committed 
the crime himself rather than hiring others to do it," Allred said. 
</P>
<P>
 To strengthen her contentions, she brought along anti-abortion activist Susan 
Carpenter McMillan and a woman whose husband is in jail for spousal battery. 
The trio demanded that Garcetti meet with women's groups about this issue, as 
he did with civil rights leaders July 19. 
</P>
<P>
 At that meeting, ministers, political figures and others, including attorney 
Johnnie L. Cochran, who later joined Simpson's defense team, made suggestions 
to Garcetti designed to ensure that Simpson receives a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, at the end of the meeting, John Mack, president of the Los Angeles 
Urban League, urged that Garcetti not seek the death penalty. Mack said he 
opposed it on moral grounds and because Death Rows "throughout California and 
throughout the nation" are disproportionately filled with black people. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti "set a precedent meeting with African American leaders, which has 
opened the door for him to meet with women's groups. Had he never met with any 
group then we wouldn't have the right to ask for a meeting," Carpenter McMillan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is too late for Nicole, but not too late for me to stand up and demand 
that she and other battered women be remembered and respected," said Maria St. 
John Conde, a victim of battering. 
</P>
<P>
 The women stressed that they were not making any statement on Simpson's guilt. 
Rather, they said that if the jury finds Simpson guilty of murdering his former 
wife and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman, it should be able to decide whether 
the death penalty is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 An eight-member, all-male committee of Garcetti and senior deputy district 
attorneys is to make a decision before the trial's scheduled Sept. 19 start on 
whether to seek the death penalty. Under California law, Simpson would be 
eligible for capital punishment because the murder charges carry the special 
circumstances that more than one person was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said that Garcetti faces a thorny decision and that Monday's 
news conference adds another dimension that has been beneath the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, UCLA criminal law professor Peter Arenella said, "the 
seriousness and pervasiveness of male violence against women cannot be 
ignored." Considerably more resources need to be devoted to that problem, he 
said, including "many more shelters for battered women, domestic violence units 
in prosecutor's offices, significant penalties for first-time male offenders, 
and greater compassion for battered women who lash back against their abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 "But asking for the death penalty in the Simpson case would not advance any of 
these goals," Arenella said. "When Simpson was convicted of spousal abuse in 
1989, he should have received a sentence that reflected the gravity of his 
crime, rather than the slap on the wrist he got" -- no jail time, a fine, 
community service and a counseling program. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, seeking the death penalty now would only be a futile exercise in 
symbolic politics," Arenella said. "And the symbolic message behind such a 
request would only perpetuate the myth that our criminal justice system somehow 
depreciates the seriousness of an unjustifiable homicide when it imprisons a 
convicted murderer for the rest of his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Law School professor Laurie Levenson also expressed reservations: "You 
have to be careful about using the death penalty to advance political causes. 
Each decision on whether to seek the death penalty must be based on the facts 
of the case, including the background of the defendant, the nature of the crime 
and any mitigating or aggravating factors." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran called Allred's suggestion "outrageous." While emphasizing that he 
considers spousal abuse a serious problem, he said Allred "knows that there has 
been no linkage established that these killings were a result of spousal 
abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is tragic that she would use this forum to exploit this 
situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran added that the district attorney's office should make its decision 
"using the standards it uses in every case." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office declined to comment on Allred's statements.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; 1 OF 4 
GIRLS RUN OVER BY CAR LEAVES HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of four girls injured in a bizarre North Hollywood car accident was 
released from Childrens Hospital Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor said she and another girl, brought to the same hospital, are expected 
to fully recover from their injuries.Two other girls were recovering at UCLA 
Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, ranging in age from 5 to 10, were injured Saturday at a home in 
North Hollywood when a 2-year-old boy, alone in a car with the engine running, 
put the car in gear and it ran over them, trapping them underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 A hospital spokeswoman said that Janette Rodriguez, 10, left Childrens 
Hospital on Monday. Her brother, also injured in the accident, had been 
released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Janette suffered multiple cuts and bruises, said Dr. Richard Reynolds, who 
treated her and Valeria Fernandez, 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Both girls suffered from hemorrhaging in the upper body caused by the weight 
of the car on their mid-sections. In addition, Valeria suffered a broken 
collarbone, three broken ribs and a broken arm. Valeria could be released from 
the hospital as early as Wednesday, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA Medical Center, Guadalupe Rodriquez, 9, and Leslie Vega, 5, the other 
two girls injured in the accident, were in good condition Monday, a hospital 
spokeswoman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Los Angeles Police Department traffic investigators said they 
expect to decide today whether they will seek charges against a woman who 
police said left the car's engine running while she left to look for her purse.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA CLARITA; 3 
MOTORISTS RESCUE CHP OFFICER FROM ALLEGED ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three motorists Monday rescued a California Highway Patrol officer who 
allegedly was being beaten by a man she had stopped for speeding on the 
Antelope Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Amy Bonilla, 28, suffered cuts and bruises in the altercation, which 
ended when the motorists -- including two off-duty Burbank police -- wrestled 
away the man and held him down until more officers arrived to arrest him."They 
certainly kept her from further harm," said CHP Chief Edward Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla was treated and released from Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Bonilla had pulled over Ronald Arnett Coleman, 33, of 
Palmdale shortly after 8 a.m. Bonilla said she had clocked his Cadillac at 
about 80 m.p.h.  
</P>
<P>
 Coleman was argumentative during the traffic stop near the Golden Valley Road 
off-ramp, Gomez said. Coleman lunged at Bonilla when she attempted to 
administer a field sobriety test, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman tried to pull Bonilla's baton away from her and then began punching 
her in the face, Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla -- who is 5 feet, 5 inches tall and weighs 110 pounds -- drew her gun, 
firing once into the pavement. Coleman tried to pull the gun from her grasp but 
failed, Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman was on top of Bonilla, punching her and grabbing for the gun, when the 
three motorists stopped and ran to her aid, authorities said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: FLEISS, FATHER PLEAD 
NOT GUILTY TO FEDERAL CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAWN HUBLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heidi Fleiss, the accused Hollywood madam, and her father, a 60-year-old Los 
Feliz pediatrician, pleaded not guilty Monday to federal charges of tax evasion 
and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
 Their U.S. District Court arraignment came just weeks before Fleiss, 28, is 
scheduled to go on trial in state court on charges that she operated one of the 
West Coast's most exclusive call-girl rings. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities allege that Dr. Paul Fleiss helped his daughter hide the illegal 
profits from her prostitution business, that they lied on their income tax 
returns about the source and size of her income, and that they lied on bank 
documents linked to the purchase of her $1.6-million Benedict Canyon home. 
</P>
<P>
 But Heidi Fleiss, in earlier interviews, has staunchly denied any conspiracy 
and, in particular, any wrongdoing by her father, who for decades has operated 
a highly respected pediatrics practice. Philip Heller, lawyer for Paul Fleiss, 
also took issue with the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a 60-year-old pediatrician who has spent most of his life caring for 
children and helping others. He has taught on the medical faculties at USC and 
UCLA, and is universally regarded and respected by his peers, colleagues and 
patients for his character and integrity," Heller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a very gentle man, a father of six who raised his children as 
vegetarians. One of his children is in medical school now, trying to follow in 
his father's footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would someone of this man's stature participate in a criminal conspiracy, 
when he had nothing to gain and everything to lose?" 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Fleiss' attorney, Donald B. Marks, predicted that she would be 
exonerated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heidi is very much eager to fight the charges," Marks said. "She's very upset 
and feels it was unnecessary to (charge her father as well)." 
</P>
<P>
 The father and daughter were indicted last week by a federal grand jury on 
charges that they conspired to hide hundreds of thousands of dollars she made 
procuring prostitutes for rich, famous men. The indictment alleges that she 
signed over to her father thousands of dollars in personal checks from people 
for whom she provided prostitutes, and that the father deposited those checks 
in his bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment does not name the men who allegedly wrote the checks, or say 
what led the grand jury to believe that the checks were from prostitutes. Heidi 
Fleiss' attorneys have predicted that if the federal case goes to trial, the 
identities of some of her clients will become public. SHAWN HUBLER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SOUTH PASADENA; 
EX-MAYOR WINS $7,500 IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES AFTER $1.2-MILLION AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former mayor of South Pasadena on Monday asked for -- and received -- 
minimal punitive damages against the three city officials he had sued. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in vengeance," said former Mayor Lee. D. Prentiss, who won a 
$1.2-million verdict against the city Friday for general and compensatory 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the jury decided that ex-Mayor Evelyn Fierro must pay Prentiss 
$4,000 in punitive damages; Clarice Knapp, a Cultural Heritage commissioner and 
wife of Councilman Harry Knapp, $2,000, and Transportation Commissioner Joanne 
Nuckols, $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury agreed with Prentiss' contention that the officials had conspired to 
revoke the building permit on his house to punish him for the conservative 
positions he took when he was a council member.  
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said Monday it was unusual for a plaintiff to ask a jury to 
limit punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants' lawyer, David D. Lawrence, doubted that Prentiss' call to keep 
the punitive damages low was an act of altruism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they recognize that (Friday's) verdict is excessive and a large 
punitive damages award would just emphasize that," said Lawrence, who plans to 
recommend that the City Council seek a new trial. The $1.2 million would be 
paid by the city, probably out of its insurance, but punitive damages are 
levied against defendants personally. Prentiss' attorney, David King, on Monday 
asked the jury to limit the punitive damages to no more than $5,000 per 
defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal battle began in September, 1990, when a council majority, including 
Fierro, voted to revoke a building permit that allowed Prentiss to build a 
1,750-square-foot addition to his 86-year-old Craftsman-style house. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the permit was revoked, Prentiss had cut a new arch in a wall, 
removed concrete and bricks and poured foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they had to revoke the permit because the house was on the 
state Historic Resource Inventory and the expansion plans needed environmental 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the state Supreme Court last July let stand an appellate court ruling 
that the city had acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony during the Superior Court trial indicated that Nuckols and Clarice 
Knapp lobbied council members to revoke Prentiss' building permit. The jury 
found that Fierro, Nuckols and Clarice Knapp acted with "malice or oppression" 
against Prentiss. RICK HOLGUIN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
ROBBERS HOLD UP 4 STORES IN 2 HOURS, SHOOT MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armed robbers held up at least four San Fernando Valley stores between 
midnight and 2 a.m. Monday, shooting a man outside a convenience store but 
apparently netting comparatively little money. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the whole crime spree, I don't think they got more than $500," said Mel 
Arnold, a robbery detective in the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting victim, whose identity was withheld for his safety, was 
hospitalized in serious but stable condition and was expected to survive, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robberies took place at four 7-Elevens, and the same gunmen may also have 
hit a doughnut shop in the 14860 block of Sherman Way at about 1:30 a.m., 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police believed all the holdups were the work of the same robbers, 
they were unsure how many there were, saying witness descriptions and 
videotapes by store security cameras appeared to indicate that two to four 
robbers in their teens or early twenties were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The M.O. and the physical descriptions appear to be the same," said Lt. Dan 
Hoffman of the LAPD's Valley headquarters. "But that is why (detectives) are 
all looking at all the tapes, to see if they are the same or if it is just 
coincidental." 
</P>
<P>
 Devonshire Division robbery Detective Michael Brandt said the gunmen "come in 
in masks, in twos or threes, jump over the counter and take the money trays." 
In most cases, they shouted at cashiers to give up their money or be shot, he 
said.

 Police shot to death an unarmed man after he came toward them with his hand 
concealed in his waistband, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers spotted the 22-year-old man Sunday at a street corner where gang 
members with guns were reported to be congregating, police Capt. B. Hagerty 
said.The man, whose name was not immediately released, fled in a car with 
police in pursuit, crashing a short time later. 
</P>
<P>
 When the man got out of his car and ran, two officers followed him to a grassy 
area in front of the Maritime Museum in San Pedro. The man stopped in the 
middle of the lawn, then began to walk toward an officer in a "threatening 
manner" with his hand in his waistband, Hagerty said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the man ignored several commands to show his hand, an officer shot him 
once in the torso, killing him, Hagerty said. No weapon was found on the man's 
body.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAN PLEADS 
NOT GUILTY TO KIDNAPING WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Michigan man pleaded not guilty in federal court Monday to the kidnaping at 
gunpoint of a Val Verde real estate agent who was left tied up in an Arizona 
motel room two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy Daniel Shue, 38, is accused of kidnaping Paula Harrington, 26, by 
posing as a prospective customer at the real estate office where she worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue is being held without bail and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison 
without possibility of parole if convicted. Magistrate Judge Brian Robbins set 
his trial for Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that on June 29 Shue asked Harrington to show him homes in 
Val Verde, a small community northwest of Santa Clarita. Shue reportedly 
kidnaped her after the two looked at several homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington was found the morning of July 1 tied up in a motel in Gila Bend, 
Ariz., a small town about 68 miles southwest of Phoenix. Shue was arrested July 
6 in Ogden, Utah, after reportedly displaying a handgun to a topless dancer in 
a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Debra Yang said Shue's actions during the three-day 
incident -- such as allegedly forcing Harrington to withdraw money using her 
ATM card -- left behind a trail of evidence "that we will have to follow."

VENDORS PROTEST AGAINST LAPD; REGULATION: STREET PEDDLERS ACCUSE OFFICERS OF 
HARASSING THEM. NO VENDING LICENSES HAVE BEEN ISSUED SINCE ORDINANCE LEGALIZING 
THE PRACTICE WAS PASSED IN JANUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Like hundreds of other Los Angeles street vendors, Maria Paz believed that her 
problems with the police had ended when the city legalized sidewalk vending 
more than six months ago. But now, caught between a need to survive and an 
ordinance that many vendors view as impractical, Paz still finds herself 
running from the law. 
</P>
<P>
 She and about 30 others protested outside the Los Angeles Police Department's 
Rampart station Monday, alleging police harassment of street vendors in the 
Pico-Union and Westlake districts west of Downtown. "We just want to make an 
honest living," said Paz, 27, as she cradled her 7-month-old son, Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 With their children in tow, the mostly female protesters marched in front of 
the station. Some shouted, "Police, we want to be your friends!" Others waved 
signs with Spanish slogans such as "Somos vendedores, no criminales," or "We 
are vendors, not criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 The scene was a far cry from the jubilation in January, when several hundred 
vendors packed City Hall to watch council members approve the vending 
ordinance. It was the culmination of a six-year battle to legalize street 
vending in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the vendors have discovered the realities of a law that is 
cluttered with bureaucratic hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a single vending license has been issued, and the vendors are months away 
from establishing the eight districts that were approved by the council as part 
of a two-year pilot program. Any proposed district can be killed by the 
signatures of 10% of the business owners or residents in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still a long way off from being legal," said a frustrated Javier 
Bustillo, as he sold mangoes and Spanish-language comic books Monday afternoon 
near MacArthur Park. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pico-Union and Westlake districts near the park, vendors and their 
supporters say eight women have been arrested and scores of others ticketed in 
the past several weeks. They allege that the police activity is the result of 
intolerance of Latino immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is definitely an attitude of intolerance of immigrants on the part of 
some of the (LAPD) rank and file," said Javier Rodriquez, an organizer with the 
Street Vendors Assn., which represents more than 800 vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 Police deny any harassment and say they are just responding to complaints from 
business owners that the vendors block sidewalk traffic, discard rubbish on the 
street and undercut their business. "Vending is just as illegal now as it was 
five years ago," said Capt. Nick Salicos, commander of the Rampart division. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Mike Hernandez said Monday that he has not received many 
complaints of police harassing vendors. "There might be an officer or two who 
are harassing, but I would say the majority are not," said Hernandez, who 
represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Rampart division police were unable to provide arrest figures Monday, but 
tickets issued to vendors citywide are up substantially compared to last year. 
Police issued 839 citations to vendors between Jan. 1 and May 23, compared to 
952 such actions during all of 1993, according to data made public at a Police 
Commission hearing in May.

PUBLIC'S HELP SOUGHT IN HIGHLAND PARK KILLINGS; CRIME: POLICE SAY THEY HAVE NO 
CLUES IN THE JAN. 2, 1993, STRANGLING OF A 23-YEAR-OLD WOMAN AND HER 3-YEAR-OLD 
DAUGHTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Even in a neighborhood known for its gang activity and occasional weekend 
murders, the crime was especially brutal: Veronica Ultreras, 23, and her 
3-year-old daughter were found dead inside their burning Highland Park duplex 
on the morning of Jan. 2, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, investigators speculated that they might have been the victims of a 
Christmas tree fire, or a blaze triggered by a cigarette dropped on a sofa. But 
police later determined that the mother and child were strangled by an 
assailant and left to perish in an arson fire. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, police and the victims' family members begged for the public's help 
in solving the crime. Detectives say they have run out of leads. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of unsolved homicides," Los Angeles Police Detective Steve 
Spear said at a news conference outside the duplex where the slayings occurred. 
"But it's unusual not to have any leads. We have canvassed the neighborhood, we 
have knocked on every door. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing. Zero." 
</P>
<P>
 Spear said the crime is even more haunting because of indications that it 
could be linked to the theft of Ultreras' purse, which was stolen from her car 
outside her North Avenue 50 home in September, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The purse was later found by police in an alley about two blocks from the 
duplex. Although the driver's license and other forms of identification were 
left inside, pictures of Ultreras had been meticulously cut from the cards and 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe whoever stole her purse became enamored with her because she was a very 
pretty woman," Spear said. "If he was that enamored with her looks, did he lay 
in wait and come back? We don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters were called to the house on the morning of the slayings after 
residents reported seeing a Christmas tree on fire. Ultreras was found near the 
burning tree in the living room. Her daughter Cynthia was found submerged in a 
bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultreras' husband, who was at work at a nearby Echo Park dry cleaner at the 
time of the slayings, said he is frustrated that police have been unable to 
solve the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart is broken," said Rodolfo Ultreras, who is now living with an uncle. 
"Not knowing who did this makes it worse." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he and his wife and daughter had been living in the small, beige 
duplex for about a year before the killings. Veronica Ultreras had been working 
as a teacher's assistant and had hoped someday to become a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was real outgoing and smart," said Elizabeth Adame, Ultreras' sister. 
"She never had any problems with anyone. . . . What kind of sick person would 
do this?" 
</P>
<P>
 It's a question that troubles the neighbors who live along North Avenue 50. 
They have become accustomed to gang killings and the sound of gunfire at night, 
they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, residents say the attack on the mother and child has served as a 
reminder that no one is safe from violence in the northeast Los Angeles 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared, everyone is scared," said one neighbor, who asked not to be 
identified. "I want to move out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 In renewing their call for assistance, police and the Los Angeles City Council 
have offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of the killer or killers. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they are looking for a woman who reported the fire at the duplex. 
She is not considered a suspect, but detectives want to talk to her to find out 
what she saw that day. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, believed to be white or Latino and in her 50s, was driving a 
light-colored, late-model vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "She happened to be driving by," Spear said. "She parked across the street and 
began banging on doors to alert the neighbors to the fire."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ugo Carusi, 92, the son of Italian immigrants who became U.S. immigration 
commissioner during World War II and helped resettle hundreds of thousands of 
European refugees after the war. A lawyer, he began federal service with the 
U.S. attorney general's office in 1925 and retired from the government in 1967 
after a trip to South Vietnam, where he studied the issue of refugees.He was 
private secretary and personal assistant to the attorney general until January, 
1945, when he was appointed U.S. commissioner of immigration and 
naturalization. In 1948, President Harry S. Truman sought his recommendations 
on resettling European refugees in the United States. Truman eventually 
established a Displaced Persons Commission and 400,000 refugees found a new 
life in the United States. Carusi later served on President Dwight D. 
Eisenhower's Committee for Hungarian Refugee Relief. In Washington on July 21.

ERWIN RINGEL; AUSTRIAN SOCIAL CRITIC, PSYCHIATRIST AND AUTHOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Psychiatrist Erwin Ringel, a prominent Austrian social critic, author of a 
best-selling book on anti-Semitism who also once wrote that nearly half of 
Austrians seeking medical help do so for imagined ills, has died of a heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Ringel, who was 73 when he died Thursday in Bad Kleinkirchheim in southern 
Austria, denounced Adolf Hitler during World War II and drew attention late in 
life as an opponent of Kurt Waldheim, who was elected president in 1986 despite 
having served in Hitler's army. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Erwin Ringel, Austria has lost a particularly important voice of its 
conscience," said Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, a friend of Ringel. 
</P>
<P>
 Ringel, who became a psychiatrist in Vienna in 1946, specialized in the 
problems of suicide and its prevention and set up a crisis center for potential 
suicides in Vienna in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love life," he once said. "For me, suicides were the most hapless of 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Ringel believed in both individual and collective psychiatry and therapy and 
in his later years wrote several books analyzing the "Austrian soul" and 
expressing his views on events and Austrian reactions to them. 
</P>
<P>
 A staunch anti-Nazi, Ringel was briefly arrested by the Gestapo in 1939 before 
being drafted into the German army where he served in the medical corps, mainly 
in Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1943, Ringel publicly called Hitler a psychopath. A doctor working with the 
Resistance movement helped Ringel avoid persecution, and had the army discharge 
him by claiming he had a thyroid problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Austrian Soul," published in 1984, became a bestseller. It included a 
controversial analysis of anti-Semitism while charging that his homeland was "a 
breeding ground of neurotics." 
</P>
<P>
 Ringel used a wheelchair in later life after he was found to have multiple 
sclerosis.

CAITLIN THOMAS; COLORFUL WIFE OF RENOWNED WELSH POET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Caitlin Thomas, 81, a boozing, brawling partner in marriage to the Welsh poet 
Dylan Thomas. She once described their famously discordant lives together as 
"raw, red bleeding meat," a torment of mutual infidelity climaxed by her 
violent tantrum at the bedside of her dying husband.The former Caitlin 
MacNamara, free-spirited daughter of a bohemian family from County Clare, 
Ireland, married the poet in 1937. "Ours was not a love story proper," she 
wrote in 1982. "It was more of a drink story. . . . Our primary aim was to get 
ourselves noticed at any cost: to show off like crazies to gain attention." Her 
husband died in New York in 1953, collapsing after a night of heavy drinking in 
Greenwich Village. He lingered long enough, however, for her to burst into his 
hospital room, where the comatose poet was attended by his current mistress. 
The raging wife demanded, "Is the bloody man dead yet?" then bit an attendant 
and fought with bystanders until she was subdued. She later found a more 
settled life with Giuseppe Fazio, a Sicilian movie director. On Sunday in 
Catania, Italy.

HENLEY CAN PLAY IN NFL; PRO FOOTBALL: FORMER RAM CORNERBACK, WHO FACES DRUG 
CHARGES, IS CONSIDERED A FREE AGENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue notified the Rams on Monday that cornerback 
Darryl Henley, who is awaiting a Jan. 10 trial for cocaine possession and 
conspiring to distribute cocaine, has been reinstated for the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ram President John Shaw: "I think it means he is a free agent, and I 
would think we would have an interest in him." 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, a starting cornerback for the Rams who played for UCLA, requested a 
leave of absence after the fifth game last season when his legal problems 
became public. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams paid Henley his entire $600,000 salary for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like him back," Coach Chuck Knox said. "If he's cleared by the 
commissioner, he's free to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Tagliabue's ruling, which came in response to Henley's July 28 request to 
resume playing, was made "without prejudice," and allows Henley to join any 
team in the league once a contract has been signed. The commissioner reserved 
the right to change his ruling if "trial results are not favorable." 
</P>
<P>
 The Seattle Seahawks are known to be seeking cornerbacks, but the Rams believe 
they have the inside edge in working out a deal with Henley. Henley has been a 
visitor at Rams Park several times in the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Demoff, Henley's agent, has been in Barcelona with the Raiders and 
Denver Broncos and could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug enforcement agents have alleged that Henley used his Brea home as a 
distribution point for a national narcotics network. A federal grand jury 
indicted Henley and five others; Henley pleaded not guilty to charges of 
cocaine possession and cocaine distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Tracy Donaho, a former Ram cheerleader who was also indicted, pleaded guilty 
and has agreedto cooperate with the prosecution.

HE GIVES, HOPES TO RECEIVE; RAMS: PLAGUED BY SELF-DOUBT AS ROOKIE, LACHAPELLE

<P>
 Finally, an explanation of why Sean LaChapelle appears so slow: The young man 
says he has been saddled with self-doubt while running his pass routes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this really what I want to do?" LaChapelle asks himself. "Am I up to 
handling the pressure of relentless competition? Can I find the fires that 
burned so hot while at UCLA? Do I have it in me to give it everything I've got 
and know I still might get cut?" 
</P>
<P>
 So much self-analysis, so few catches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wasn't prepared for the pressure of what you have to go through to 
make it," he said. "I was high-profile and everything at UCLA, but this is such 
a business. . . . I've thought about (quitting). I mean there are other things 
I want to do with my life. I think at times about wanting to play golf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been away from home for six years now. I talk to my friends and they 
tell me they're going camping on the weekend, and I'm saying to myself, 'Damn, 
I'd like to be there with them.' " 
</P>
<P>
 LaChapelle, former UCLA wide receiver and present-day Ram, has displayed the 
courage to throw his body in the path of agitated linebackers, but fear and 
eroding confidence have stifled his progress as a professional football player. 
</P>
<P>
 Perched on the bubble of his own making, LaChapelle spent much of last year 
blubbering about his poor state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whining," LaChapelle said Monday after the first of two scheduled practices 
at UC Irvine. "I was whining, but it was my way of being honest about how I 
felt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't prepared for this; you had to perform and perform every play. There 
was this constant inner struggle: 'Can you do this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The immediate answer was an emphatic no . "If they were looking for me to make 
an impact right away, then you'd have to say I was a bomb," LaChapelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 LaChapelle, who remained a faithful companion to quarterback Jim Everett a 
year ago when almost everyone else abandoned him, caught two passes for 23 
yards. Thanks for the memories: That's 14 yards against the Cardinals, nine 
yards against the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football wasn't as important as Jim was," LaChapelle said. "I stand by my 
friends, and I still think Jim has the qualities to be a great quarterback. I 
was there for him when he needed me. Not everyone was on his side, but the way 
things were going for me, it really couldn't make things any worse for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett and LaChapelle found a kinship in their shaky play and resulting 
criticism. But at season's end, it was obvious that Everett was headed 
elsewhere, leaving LaChapelle behind to fret about a career going nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football was fun in high school and for the most part in college, but that 
feeling was dead last year," LaChapelle said. "I chose to stay at Rams Park 
through the off-season and work four days a week, though, to see if I could 
regain that feeling for the game. If I had left Rams Park during the 
off-season, I don't think I would have ever returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to try and find that fire I used to have, that fun I had playing the 
game. I haven't had that feeling and played the game as well as I know I can 
since the first game of my senior year at UCLA. It's like I can't remember how 
to do the things I used to do that made me be so successful." 
</P>
<P>
 LaChapelle pushed himself to lift weights and run at Rams Park. If hard work 
can change first impressions, LaChapelle will no longer be considered the 
chronic bellyacher. But then again, will it be enough to alter reality? 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of two speedy receivers in the draft, two more as veteran free 
agents and another acquired in a trade will test LaChapelle's rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
 "You figure Flipper (Anderson) is going to be here along with the two draft 
choices and Nate Lewis (acquired in a trade)," LaChapelle said. "That leaves 
everyone else competing for probably two spots. Is there enough time? Am I good 
enough to have them keep me?" 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, LaChapelle will probably need a few breaks to remain with the 
team this year. However, the hiring of Steve Moore during the off-season to 
coach the Ram wide receivers has already provided LaChapelle with a fresh start 
and a sympathetic ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sean is a very honest person," Moore said. "And when he has self-doubts or 
questions motivations, he speaks his mind and explores them rather than trying 
to stuff it. I think that's very healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite LaChapelle's off-season dedication, at the outset of training camp 
nothing had really changed: LaChapelle remained a mess. He talked about the 
prospects of being cut as if determined to make it a self-fulfilling prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just really didn't matter to me what happened when training camp opened," 
he said. "But then something started to happen. Things were different this 
year, and I think there's going to be a lot of winning and I want to be a part 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember, I basically did nothing the past two years in football. 
My confidence was shattered at UCLA after Wayne Cook went down in the opener my 
senior year. I went through four quarterbacks and three injured ribs after 
deciding to stay in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Past events at UCLA have dogged LaChapelle and sabotaged his brief stay in the 
NFL. After his junior season, LaChapelle thought seriously about joining 
teammate Tommy Maddox and leaving UCLA to make himself available for the NFL 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
 There was talk at the time that LaChapelle might have gone in the top two 
rounds, and while that might have been propaganda spread by agents, friends or 
family, it is something he has held onto ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, no, I think I'm getting over it now," said LaChapelle, who was selected 
in the fifth round of the 1993 draft. "I think I've matured a little bit. I 
feel something happening, and in the last few days I feel like I'm playing more 
like I used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Will the Rams notice? Will it be enough to save his job? "He's picking up his 
tempo a great deal," Moore said. "He's much more competitive than he was 
earlier." 
</P>
<P>
 LaChapelle went hard across the middle a week ago on the final play of 
practice and made a tough catch while being tackled in the non-tackle drill. He 
injured an ankle, missed a few days of practice, but quickly responded to the 
pressure of having to impress and reported back for duty. They might cut him, 
but not without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of guys on the bubble," LaChapelle said. "It's just a lot 
different in this environment. You work 9 to 5 and maybe you're a little late 
or you forget to punch out. You drop a few passes here and they punch you out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I can play at this level; I just have to play with confidence. I just 
hope that's enough."

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; PRIVACY A KEY TO KEEPING STREAK ALIVE, RIPKEN SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I remember sitting with Cal Ripken Jr. in a golf cart at Miller Huggins Field 
in St. Petersburg, Fla., on a warm afternoon last March. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baltimore Orioles had finished a three-hour workout, and their renowned 
shortstop was taking a break before training in the weight room. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a different kind of spring for Ripken, a more relaxed and pleasant 
spring, he said. That was because media focus was not on his consecutive-games 
playing streak but on the Orioles' high expectations in the aftermath of the 
$40-million-plus spending spree by new owner Peter Angelos, and the signing of 
Rafael Palmeiro, Sid Fernandez and Chris Sabo among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Those expectations have largely evaporated now. The New York Yankees are 
burying the Orioles in the American League East. The focus is squarely on 
Ripken again as The Streak rolls on, likely to be interrupted only by a players 
strike on Aug. 12, delaying his pursuit of Lou Gehrig's record of 2,130 
consecutive games. Ripken figures to surpass it next June or July, depending on 
the length of the imminent work stoppage. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken made it 2,000 in a row Monday night in Minnesota. He has not missed a 
game since Memorial Day of 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating at a position more susceptible to injury than any other except 
catcher, he is in his 12th year of defying both injury and the disabled list, 
which is often nothing more than an excuse for a midsummer vacation. Major 
league disabled lists have been used more than 3,100 times since Ripken began 
his streak. A total of 492 players have appeared at shortstop in that time. The 
next longest major league streak is that of Jeff Conine of the Florida Marlins. 
Conine is only about a decade behind Ripken. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incredible," said Mark Belanger, a former Baltimore shortstop who is special 
assistant to Executive Director Don Fehr of the players' union. "Besides being 
a great player, do you know how strong he has had to be physically and 
mentally? 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, there've been a lot of times at clinics or in conversations with 
other players when we've used Cal as an example of the approach we wish all 
players would take. Everyone likes to talk about the big salaries, but the 
Orioles are getting a bargain with Cal. Consider his contributions on and off 
the field and he's worth even more than they're paying him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken is in the third year of a five-year, $30.5-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Roland Hemond, the Orioles' general manager, characterized Ripken as the 
consummate example of dedication and application. Manager John Oates said his 
lineup cards come with Ripken already typed in. The shortstop decision is out 
of his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Good Lord wants him to have a day off, he'll let it rain. Otherwise, 
if he stays healthy, he'll break the record," Oates said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken talked about it again as he sat in the golf cart that day in March, 
even as he described how it had taken a secondary role to questions about the 
team and how lovely that respite was. He talked about it as he is forced to do 
nearly every day, a patient prisoner of a streak that has become his identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with Gehrig and everything to do with my view of 
baseball," he said. "If I thought I was hurting the team, I'd sit down in a 
minute and have no regret about the streak. I mean, the streak is only the 
result of my approach, and I've never understood the criticism. I've never 
understood being criticized for wanting to play at a time when a lot of players 
are criticized for not playing." 
</P>
<P>
 He is criticized only when he is not hitting and it is suggested he could 
benefit from rest. Barry Bonds accused Ripken last year of being stupid and 
costing the Orioles a pennant. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ripken: "I've asked myself all the same questions. . . . Should I play or 
shouldn't I? Is it too much of a grind mentally? Am I strong enough to handle 
it? I've considered all kinds of things, and in the end I go out and play. In 
the end I don't feel I should have to apologize for wanting to play. In the end 
I try to simplify it by working hard and fixing whatever hitting problems I 
have, because the questions seem to be the loudest when I'm not hitting." 
</P>
<P>
 Ripken was batting .312 with 12 home runs and 69 runs batted in as he played 
in his 2,000th consecutive game. His application is such that he seldom misses 
infield practice and is often the last player to leave the clubhouse after a 
game. Once considered too big to play shortstop, he has played the position in 
virtually every game of the streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the attention surrounding the feat, he often registers under a 
fictitious name at a different hotel than the team's and takes a van, rather 
than the team bus, to the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been portrayed as aloof, in hiding, not a team player, but all of that 
is taken out of context," Ripken said. "The streak seems to have become my 
identity, and I have to deal with it in just about every city, every series. 
The longer it goes, the bigger it becomes, and the more it's an issue of 
management. I have only so much concentration. I can't use up 75% of it before 
I even get to the ballpark. I have to protect a certain amount of my privacy. I 
owe it to the club and myself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always looked on myself as an unselfish, non-controversial player whose 
only goal has been to work hard and play every day. I find it amazing that the 
streak has evoked so many strong opinions and so much criticism." 
</P>
<P>
 The countdown to Gehrig is likely to go on hold in two weeks. Amazing, indeed. 
It will take a player walkout to stop the player who only wants in.

JIM MURRAY: HE WOULD TELL THEM WHERE THEY CAN PUT THEIR PLAQUE 
</P>

 Leo Durocher must be livid someplace today. Probably kicking dirt on an 
umpire. Snarling, "Stick it in his ear!" from a dugout. Looking for a rival to 
bench jockey. "Did you get that belly from beer or pork, Hoss? When's the last 
time you saw your shoes?" 
</P>
<P>
 He has achieved his lifelong dream. He's in the baseball Hall of Fame. He got 
in Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, it's too late. Durocher wanted to get in while he could smell the 
roses, hear the applause, maybe get a license plate saluting his achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 As Durocher himself might say in two words he personally gave to the language 
of slang, "No way!" 
</P>
<P>
 The last time I saw Durocher, a year or two before he died, he was bitter that 
he hadn't been inducted into the Hall of Fame. He told me he not only would 
refuse induction if it were offered, but he would specifically instruct in his 
will that it not be accepted posthumously.  
</P>
<P>
 Durocher was baseball's bad boy. He was noisy, contentious, boisterous, 
contemptuous. He came to beat you. He never did anything easily -- except start 
the double play -- in his life. So, why should getting in the Hall of Fame be 
an exception? 
</P>
<P>
 Durocher always figured it was him against the world. He simply wanted to be 
sure he won. The world was on its own. Durocher kept it on the defensive.  
</P>
<P>
 They got him out of a pool hall in Springfield, Mass., but in a sense, he 
never left it. Life was a hustle to Durocher. Sportsmanship was for English 
lords in monocles chasing foxes. Durocher wanted to beat you. How was another 
matter.  
</P>
<P>
 Being around Durocher was like being inside a kettle drum. He had a voice that 
I once described as a cross between a train whistle and an air horn on an 
18-wheel rig. It could keep ships from running aground in fog. Durocher never 
whispered in his life. He took the position everybody had a lot of con in him. 
So, Durocher beat them to it. He always cut the cards, checked the dice, looked 
up your sleeve. Durocher wanted the deal.  
</P>
<P>
 Trouble could always find him. It didn't have to look very hard. Durocher went 
to meet it. He gave new meaning to the word brash . As a rookie, he tried to 
spike Ty Cobb. He called Ruth "Fatso," and when the Babe's watch was stolen, 
they suspected Leo. He wasn't guilty. Durocher never stole anything in his 
life, including second base. He didn't have to. He found other ways to beat 
you. When he once said of one of his players, Eddie Stanky, "He can't run, he 
can't field, he can't hit -- all he does is beat you," baseball figured he was 
talking about himself.  
</P>
<P>
 Except Durocher could field. Oh, could he field. He was a magnificent 
shortstop. He had to be to stay in the big leagues 17 years with a .247 batting 
average.  
</P>
<P>
 That probably wouldn't have gotten him in the Hall of Fame, although another 
shortstop, Rabbit Maranville, got in with a .258. But if his glove wouldn't, 
his brain would.  
</P>
<P>
 The Hall of Fame is a hybrid organization. For years, it was the sole 
prerogative of the baseball writers to decide who got in the Hall. But they 
left so many names out, they had to set up a separate but equal "Veterans 
Committee." 
</P>
<P>
 The writers were too hard to please. They can vote for as many as 10 players a 
year. But most years, you're lucky if one gets in. The required number of votes 
is 75% cast. We would never get a President in that election.  
</P>
<P>
 Joe DiMaggio didn't get in in his first year of eligibility, to give you an 
idea. Bill Terry had to wait 13 years. All he had going for him was being the 
last National League player to bat better than .400 and he had a lifetime 
average of .341. Even two decades late, he got only 77% of the vote. Mickey 
Mantle got only 88% of the vote, and even though Henry Aaron got 98%, there 
were still nine writers who left him off their ballots.  
</P>
<P>
 But even given this eye-of-the-needle stuff, if Durocher's glove didn't quite 
merit inclusion, his managerial talents did. Durocher in the dugout -- or the 
third base coaching box -- was tough competition. Only six managers in the long 
history of baseball won more games. Hardly any of them did it with less. All 
Durocher really needed was a Willie Mays and eight guys in the chorus for him 
to win.  
</P>
<P>
 There were 13 managers in the Hall of Fame before Durocher. Most of them came 
up well short of his 2,010 victories.  
</P>
<P>
 Keeping Durocher out of the Hall of Fame became a lifetime job for somebody. 
Durocher thought it was the former commissioner, Happy Chandler. When Chandler 
was commissioner, he had barred Durocher from baseball for a year for an 
all-but-invisible infraction of the rules. Since the commissioner's power was 
absolute in those days, Durocher served the time but never lost an opportunity 
to deride the commissioner in and out of print.  
</P>
<P>
 The Durocher interpretation is, Chandler never forgave him -- and made it the 
business of his life to keep Durocher out of Cooperstown.  
</P>
<P>
 If he did, he succeeded. Durocher never made the Hall of Fame in person and in 
voice. What a shame.  
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere today, Durocher is looking for a helmet to throw, a water cooler to 
kick, an umpire to insult, a signal for his pitcher to hit somebody. I can hear 
him roaring, "You can't do this to me!" It's too little, too late.  
</P>
<P>
 It's the ultimate irony. Durocher's legacy to the world, his epitaph, as it 
were, his contribution to quotes to live by in Bartlett's, is "Nice guys finish 
last." 
</P>
<P>
 No way would Durocher let them get away with this form of finishing last. No 
way would Durocher let them get away with calling him a nice guy.

ANALYSIS; ANYWAY THAT YOU SPELL IT, GAMES HAVE BIG PROBLEMS

 The ice inside the practice rink is so slushy that figure skaters can barely 
stand on it without sinking to their ankles, and there is some question about 
whether the ice inside the main rink will be ready in time for tonight's short 
track speed skating competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The pool was so murky that the swimming competition was postponed for a day; 
computers used to calculate scores in women's gymnastics were not programmed 
correctly; transportation has been an adventure, and the only things more 
numerous than athletes' and coaches' complaints have been empty seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, so what's the problem? 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Turner, chairman of the board and president of Turner Broadcasting System, 
Inc., and founder of the Goodwill Games, sat at the head of the table in a 
conference room of the Grand Europe Hotel on Monday and appeared as if he did 
not have a care in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, he did acknowledge one. 
</P>
<P>
 "My No. 1 concern is that 'The Mask' opened this weekend, and I have to find 
out how that did," he said. "We're in the movie business now." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Goodwill Games, he said: "I can tell you right now, I think the 
Games have been a huge success." 
</P>
<P>
 Many would argue otherwise, but Turner does not have their perspective. In an 
effort to share his, he invited a few reporters here for the Goodwill Games to 
join him for an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner mentioned during the course of the session that he once had a habit of 
"talking before my mouth was fully engaged with my brain," as if that was no 
longer a problem for him. It could be suggested that he occasionally has 
relapses. But amid his ramblings, there often is a glimpse of the big picture 
that he sees. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a reporter asked about the glitches in the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "What glitches?" Turner replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pool," the reporter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one glitch," Turner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scoring in gymnastics," the reporter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed that," Turner said. "There's glitches everywhere. If you recall, in 
Munich, people were killed. A team was bombed. Is that a glitch? In every one 
of your newspapers, there are a couple of misspelled words every day. How many 
years have you been doing it? Hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why focus on this? When everything goes right, that's expected. When it 
doesn't, that's news. Look at all the great things O.J. Simpson did. Now, 
nobody focuses on them. It's CNN, too." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused to catch his breath, looked at the reporter who asked the question 
and continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "You did say glitches, not a disaster? Teams being killed at the Olympics, 
that's a disaster. A scoring problem in gymnastics, that's like a misspelled 
word in the newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes, when put in the context of the 1972 Olympic Games at Munich, where 
Israeli athletes and coaches were massacred by Palestinian terrorists, 
virtually every sporting event before or since should be considered a roaring 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 But when put in the context of other international sporting events, it is the 
responsibility of the sporting press to report that the third edition of the 
Goodwill Games is not a significant improvement over the first in 1986 at 
Moscow, or the second in 1990 at Seattle. The class of the athletes here is 
better than it was in either of those, but the quality of the venues and the 
efficiency of the organization have taken giant steps backward since Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The sporting press has a point, Turner acknowledged. But he said that it 
should not be overlooked that these Goodwill Games are occurring in Russia 
while the country is in transition to a free-market economy after more than 70 
years of strangling Communism. In other words, a dirty swimming pool is not the 
worst of St. Petersburg's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Considering the turmoil this country has gone through, there was a lot of 
skepticism that the Games would take place at all," he said. "They had trouble 
financing it. The country is not in the greatest financial shape in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it has been widely speculated that the 1998 Goodwill Games in New 
York will be the last, Turner said that he would like to return them to Russia 
in 2002. He is flying today to Siberia to see a potential site that the 
Russians have suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 He said in 1986 that he created the Goodwill Games to promote friendship and 
cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union after the boycotts 
of the 1980 and '84 Summer Olympics. Now that the Cold War has ended, he said 
he wants them to continue because he believes they are a plus for the Olympic 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just another sporting event," he said. "It's the only other 
international sporting event of a global consequence (besides the Olympics)." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the Goodwill Games are to survive into the next century, Turner must 
sell them to his board of directors as a sound investment for TBS. After the 
event lost $44 million in '86, $27 million in '90 and a still undetermined 
amount this year, he has some convincing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm personally committed to it," he said. "We're televised in 117 countries, 
so we're getting there. It would be crazy not to preserve it." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged, however, that he is disappointed because so few in one of 
those countries, the United States, are watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the only bad news," he said of the most recent ratings. "Still, we've 
got millions of people watching it. That's about as many as you have readers." 
</P>
<P>
 After answering the last question, he stood and thanked the reporters for 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks even for writing about the glitches," he said. "Just spell our name 
right: G-O-O-D-W-I-L-L."

COOPER IS ARRESTED IN DOMESTIC DISPUTE; JURISPRUDENCE: FORMER LAKER STAR, WIFE 
INVOLVED IN INCIDENT AT THEIR NEW MEXICO HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Cooper, former Laker star and current assistant coach, was arrested 
for battery and assault last week after allegedly threatening his wife with a 
vase during a domestic dispute at their vacation home near Albuquerque, N.M., 
according to a police report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said a Corrales, N.M., police officer saw Cooper pull his wife, 
Wanda, off a bed by her ankle and raise his fist toward her before being 
restrained Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said Cooper threatened his wife with a vase after officer Bruce 
Ellis arrived in response to a late-night call. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute was triggered when Cooper became angry by his wife's request that 
he attend an Alcoholics' Anonymous meeting with her, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Cooper referred to his wife with a crude phrase and used profanity 
when he told Ellis, "That . . . . goes to AA and now tries to tell me that I . 
. . . need help." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Cooper could not be reached for comment. Wanda Cooper described the 
dispute to the Associated Press as an argument that escalated. 
</P>
<P>
 "They make it sound as if the man was absolutely killing me," she said. 
"That's not the case at all." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her husband's conduct was completely out of character. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael has never expressed anger like that," she said. "This is a total 
aberration of who he is." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coopers later issued a joint statement through their Albuquerque-based 
attorney Joe Lang, denying that Cooper struck his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "While this incident is truly regrettable, it should be made clear that 
Michael never hit Wanda and that Wednesday night's activities were truly an 
aberration," the statement said. "Sometimes, people who have been married for 
many years have problems like everyone else. Unfortunately, just because you're 
a public couple, like Michael and Wanda Cooper, you're not immune." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis said when he arrived at the house, the front door was open, and he could 
hear voices from the bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 After knocking on the door, the officer said he heard a "male voice later 
identified as (Michael Cooper) shout, 'Go answer the door . . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
 After Ellis identified himself, he said Cooper responded: "I don't give a . . 
. . about no police, go answer the . . . . door." 
</P>
<P>
 Wanda Cooper began crying after seeing the officer and ran toward him. Police 
said Cooper ordered his wife to return, saying: "Oh, now you cry because the 
police are here, get back in the . . . . room." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's wife ran past the officer and back into the bedroom, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the officer told Cooper he was responding to a domestic dispute, Cooper 
said, "That's right because the . . . . is trying to tell me that I need help." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Cooper jumped to his feet, grabbed his wife's right ankle with 
his left hand and pulled her from the bed and onto the floor, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police reported that Wanda Cooper began crying after her husband raised his 
right hand in a fist and said, "Please, don't hit me, baby. Please don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Cooper grabbed a small vase from on top of a wardrobe and "reared back 
his hand as though he were going to strike the victim," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, 38, was handcuffed and taken to Sandoval County Jail where he was 
booked before being released on bond. Marco Banales, police spokesman, said he 
believed a court date was being set.

<P>
 The Kings have had trade talks about acquiring Brett Hull from the St. Louis 
Blues, Kings General Manager Sam McMaster acknowledged Monday, but he said 
those discussions have "reached an impasse." 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been able to agree on who we would give up," McMaster said. 
"There've been discussions since the draft but we've gotten nowhere. . . . 
There are no discussions right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Hull, who has led the NHL in goal-scoring three times, said recently that he 
would like a chance to play with Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my dream," Hull said.

 The Blues would reportedly want King defenseman Rob Blake to be part of any 
deal. ROBYN NORWOOD

 Center-forward Pervis Ellison on Monday became the fifth player signed by the 
Boston Celtics in M.L. Carr's drive to revive the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Carr took over as the team's director of player personnel, he also has 
signed forwards Blue Edwards, Derek Strong and Dominique Wilkins and guard 
David Wesley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison, a 6-foot-10 shot-blocker, was the No. 1 pick overall by Sacramento in 
1989, but played in only 34 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The last two seasons, Ellison, slowed by injuries, played in 96 games for the 
Washington Bullets. He averaged 7.3 points and 5.1 rebounds last year. He 
averaged 20 points, 11.2 rebounds and 2.7 blocks per game in the 1991-92 
season.

GOODWILL GAMES ROUNDUP; MILLER MAKES MOST OF LAST CHANCE IN GYM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shannon Miller would not settle for second this time. 
</P>
<P>
 A day after finishing second in the all-around competition, the U.S. gymnast 
reasserted her dominance Monday by winning two gold medals and two silvers in 
the individual apparatus finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like a challenge," said Miller, of Edmond, Okla. "I like to rise to the 
challenge. I did at this competition and I feel really good about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 17, the most decorated U.S. gymnast in history, finished first in the 
balance beam and floor exercise and second in the vault and uneven bars. That 
brought her medal total to five -- two golds and three silvers. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller finished ahead of Russia's Dina Kochetkova, who had beaten her by 0.057 
points for the all-around title Sunday. It was Miller's first loss in two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shannon Miller proved she is the best gymnast in the world," Coach Steve 
Nunno said. "After yesterday, we had a little discussion and I told her, 'You 
have another chance. You can prove it by showing you are better in every event. 
You have the opportunity to redeem yourself.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Miller scored 9.824 in the vault to finish behind Liliya Podkopyeva of Ukraine 
with 9.831. On the uneven bars, Svetlana Khorkina of Russia scored 9.862 points 
to Miller's 9.850. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller won the beam event with 9.875 points. She started with a front 
somersault to the bar and ended with a full twisting back double somersault. In 
between, she added two reverse splits and had a series of a back handsprings 
followed by two back aerials. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller capped her day with an outstanding floor routine, earning a 9.937. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I had to come in and hit my routines," she said. "I tried to do my 
best in both competitions. And it seems I got better as the days went by. I got 
more used to the equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said she had gotten over the disappointment of finishing second Sunday 
in the all-around, her first loss since taking the silver at the 1992 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 There was another medal for the United States, but this one was a surprise. 
Marianna Webster, 15, who trains with Miller at the Dynamo Academy in Oklahoma, 
won a bronze in the beam. It was Webster's first medal in major international 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that this kind of makes a name for me in the international scene," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Webster was originally listed in fifth place with a score of 9.625. But Nunno 
appealed to the judges, arguing that they had not awarded her enough points 
based on the difficulty of her routine. The judges revised Webster's score to 
9.725, moving her to third.

 The U.S. women defeated Germany, 15-10, 15-9, 15-5, in pool play to advance to 
the semifinals against China. Russia and Japan will meet in the other 
semifinal. Japan defeated Peru, 15-5, 15-7, 16-14, China defeated Cuba, 13-15, 
15-13, 15-7, 15-10, and Russia defeated the Netherlands, 15-8, 15-9, 15-5.

DATELINE / ST. PETERSBURG; SERVING A PINT ON CAPITALISM'S FRONTIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's an Irishman like you doing in a place like this? 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I keep asking myself," Frank Peyton said. "I still haven't come 
up with the answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Peyton, 42, sold his bar in County Cork this year, said goodby -- temporarily 
-- to his wife and five children and came to St. Petersburg to lose his 
fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, he doesn't have a fortune, and what he did have he doesn't plan to 
lose. But opening Mollie's Irish Traditional Bar on Rubensteina Street, just 
off Nevsky Prospect, was not about money. It was about adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 An adventure it has been since opening July 1. With a clientele consisting 
primarily of English-speaking expatriates and wealthy Russians, he serves 
authentic Guinness, Kilkenny and Harp on tap and is searching for an 
authentic-sounding Irish singer to provide entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Peyton is one of many foreign entrepreneurs who have brought their pounds, 
marks, francs, yen and dollars to St. Petersburg in exchange for the 
opportunity to explore capitalism's new frontier. 
</P>
<P>
 When he and other investors from Ireland began looking into the possibilities 
here, they discovered that St. Petersburg already had an assortment of 
restaurants (including Tex-Mex) and night clubs, a Baskin-Robbins and even an 
Irish bookmaker's shop. What it did not have was an Irish pub. For $300,000, it 
does now. 
</P>
<P>
 Peyton said the most difficult thing he has had to deal with, besides 
homesickness, is the Russian bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to sign four or five different papers from four or five different 
people just to buy six bottles of Heineken," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also had to buy three filters from Finland to purify the tap water, which 
is safe to drink for locals who have built up an immunity to the bacteria, but 
not for visitors. Other parasites, known as members of the Russian Mafia, prey 
on foreign business, but they have not bothered Peyton. So far. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had known what was ahead of me, I don't think I would have done it," 
Peyton said. "For a younger person, it would be easier to just cut off and go 
for it. But the bottom line is that I'm just too old for it." 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to give Mollie's a year, get it up and running at a profit and then 
turn it over to a manager while he goes home to County Cork. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is one more enterprise he wants to start before leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Kentucky Fried Chicken (restaurant)," he said. "I love Kentucky Fried 
Chicken." RANDY HARVEY

 Traded to the Dodgers late in the 1959 season, Essegian, an outfielder, went 
on to become one of only two players to hit two pinch-hit home runs in the same 
World Series. He hit his first in the second game against the Chicago White Sox 
that year, and his ninth inning shot in the sixth and final game capped the 
club's first World Series championship in Los Angeles.

 Treasury Yields Fall in Auction: Interest rates on short-term Treasury 
securities fell to the lowest level in two weeks. The Treasury Department sold 
$12.6 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 4.35%, down 
from 4.43% last week.Another $12.4 billion was sold in six-month bills at an 
average discount rate of 4.75%, down from 4.83%. The three-month bill rate was 
the lowest since they sold for 4.31% on July 18. The six-month bill rate was 
the lowest since they averaged 4.71% the same day. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors: 4.46% for three-month bills, with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,890, and 4.93% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,759.90. T-Bill Auction: Aug. 1, 1994

<P>
 Another rally in industrial stocks lifted the broad market for a second 
consecutive session Monday, as bond yields held steady despite some healthy 
economic reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.67 points -- exactly the same point 
gain as Friday -- to end at 3,798.17, highest since June 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Winners outnumbered losers by nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, in 
a sign of investors' renewed interest in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The market had jumped Friday as bond yields plunged, after the government 
reported surprisingly weak growth in second-quarter gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the bond rally failed to follow through. Yields rebounded early in 
the day after a strong report on the nation's factories, but fell back later to 
close mostly unchanged. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond ended at 
7.39%, the same as Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market was in part pressured by another fall in the dollar, after the 
United States began long-awaited trade sanction proceedings against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 99.28 Japanese yen, down from 100.20 on 
Friday but up from Tokyo's Monday close of 98.77. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, analysts noted that the bond market was more focused on Monday's 
economic reports, where the news was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Growth at the nation's factories last month was stronger than many analysts 
had expected, according to the National Assn. of Purchasing Management's latest 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
 That raised new concerns about potentially higher inflation in the economy, 
which could encourage another round of credit tightening by the Federal Reserve 
Board. 
</P>
<P>
 But other reports Monday, such as on June consumer spending, hinted at slower 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks led Wall Street's rally, as they did Friday, suggesting 
that many investors don't believe the economy is headed for a serious slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel shares surged, in part over expectations that auto makers will agree to 
pay significantly higher prices for steel in 1995. Inland Steel leaped 2 1/4 to 
40 1/4, USX-U.S. Steel gained 1 7/8 to 39 1/8, LTV jumped 1 to 19 3/4 and Rouge 
Steel surged 1 7/8 to 32 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among other industrials, Caterpillar rose 1 1/2 to 109 7/8, Union Carbide 
gained 1 1/2 to 29 3/4, Georgia-Pacific jumped 1 3/8 to 65 7/8 and Inco was up 
1 to 28 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil stocks were up as crude prices hit 17-month highs, after Nigerian oil 
unions backed out of talks designed to settle a 4-week-old strike that has 
disrupted the country's exports. 
</P>
<P>
 On the New York Merc, crude futures for September rose as high as $20.98 a 
barrel, the highest since March 5, 1993. The contract settled at $20.55, up 25 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Among oil stocks, Exxon rose 5/8 to 60 1/8, Mobil jumped 1 3/8 to 85 1/4 and 
Unocal was up 3/4 to 29 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Utility stocks rebounded, a sign that some investors side with the Wall 
Street camp that sees interest rates going lower. The Dow utility index jumped 
3.49 points, or 1.9%, to 189.89. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among the day's big losers, Newbridge Networks plunged 13 5/16 to 28 5/8 
after the computer networking firm said the recent quarter's earnings will fall 
short of expectations. Newbridge's announcement had a dampening effect on some 
other tech stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo's Nikkei index lost 178.04 points to 20,271.35 as the dollar 
weakened. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hong Kong shares rocketed, with the Hang Seng index up 200.87 points to 
9,683.68. In China, the Shanghai exchange's official 'A' share index soared 
36.1% after authorities decided to halt new share listings, coping with a glut 
of securities. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the FTSE-100 index added 14.8 points to 3,097.4. In Frankfurt, the 
DAX index inched up 7.15 points to 2,153.79. DAILY DIARY: Aug. 1, 1994

Records Chairman Mo Ostin as word spreads that a sudden meeting had been held 
to iron out the latest wrinkle in the corporate realignment at Warner Music 
Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a restructuring plan announced last month, Ostin and all U.S. label 
heads are required to report directly to Doug Morris, chief operating officer 
of the corporation's new domestic division, Warner Music-USA. Former Elektra 
Chairman Bob Krasnow resigned one day after the announcement, blaming his 
departure primarily on his exclusion from the new corporate inner circle. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based Morris flew in unexpectedly Friday and met behind closed 
doors for several hours with Ostin, who is also believed to disapprove of the 
new chain of command. Sources said Ostin has been resistant to suggestions that 
he streamline his label and reluctant to anoint a successor, whom most insiders 
believe will be his longtime sidekick and current Warner Bros. Records 
President Lenny Waronker. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Ostin nor Morris could be reached for comment, but sources said Ostin 
is expected to fly to New York today to try to resolve the matter.

 Television: In a candid chat with reporters covering the Goodwill Games in St. 
Petersburg, Russia, cable mogul Ted Turner said Monday what everyone already 
knew anyway: that he would like to buy one of the big three networks. "One of 
these days, I plan to have one of the big networks," said Turner, who once made 
an unsuccessful run at CBS."I may never get there, but I've been thinking about 
it for a long time." Asked whether he is talking to CBS in the wake of the 
network's collapsed merger plans with QVC Inc., Turner said that "there's 
nothing at the present moment." But he said he is in contact with CBS, NBC and 
ABC, adding that "basically all three of them are available for the right 
deal." Turner said there would be synergy in combining his operation with that 
of a major network. As an example, he said, combining CNN's news operations 
with those of a major network could result in a savings of between $50 million 
and $100 million a year.

 Interactive: In what amounts to a shuffling of assets, Spelling Entertainment 
Group said it has completed the acquisition of a 90% stake in Virgin 
Interactive Entertainment from Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. Spelling, which 
is controlled by video rental giant Blockbuster, in turn issued about 22 
million common shares valued at $8.95 apiece, or $197 million. The new Spelling 
shares increase Blockbuster's share of Spelling to 78% from 70%. Spelling 
expects Virgin Interactive, which develops, publishes and distributes 
interactive entertainment software, to bring in an additional $200 million a 
year of revenue for the company. Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.-based Blockbuster 
recently purchased the stake in Virgin Interactive from Richard Branson Family 
Trusts and toy maker Hasbro.

 LIGHTS ON: Tonight is supposed to be lights on at your house, if you want to 
be in tune with the annual National Night Out Against Crime. . . . In Garden 
Grove, the police are hosting an open house. In San Clemente, residents plan to 
turn on their outside lights and have numerous neighborhood potlucks parties. 
Says Jan Sener, San Clemente's crime prevention specialist: "We've always had a 
good response. It gives people a chance to say as a neighborhood: 'We want to 
make crime less a factor.' "

 QUANTUM LEAP: One company making a tidy profit in the health care business: 
Quantum Health Resources in Orange, which provides health care to people with 
chronic diseases. It made Fortune magazine's list of 100 fastest-growing 
American companies. With sales last year at $221 million, its growth rate 
within the last five years is 82%. Quantum success comes partly, the magazine 
says, from charging considerably less than most hospitals. Says a Quantum 
spokeswoman: "We've seen the magazine; we think it's great."

 AL'S NEMESIS: Perky, cute, working on her second husband, Amanda Bearse's 
character Mary Rhodes D'Arcy makes the perfect warring neighbor for Al Bundy's 
sexist lines on TV's "Married With Children." In real life, Bearse, the only 
openly gay actor on a regular prime-time series, is a leading gay rights 
activist. She'll be grand marshal in the Orange County Gay and Lesbian Pride 
Celebration parade in Irvine on Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 REAL STREET PARADE: One thing different about this year's gay parade: It will 
be on the streets. The last four years it has been on the UC Irvine campus 
because city officials in Irvine were reluctant to grant a street permit, 
fearful of unruly incidents involving the crowd. But with the parade so orderly 
the last four years, says parade spokeswoman Kimberly Syre, the city has 
lowered its insurance requirement for organizers. The parade route off campus 
will be on Campus Drive between Berkeley and Bridge streets.

INSOMNIAC IN CHARGE; MOUNTING LOSSES GNAWING AT ANGEL MANAGER LACHEMANN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marcel Lachemann looks at his clock. It is 2 in the morning. Once again, he 
cannot fall asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything is shut down for the night, but his mind continues to whirl in the 
darkness, replaying every pitch, of every inning, of yet another Angel loss. 
</P>
<P>
 He has already watched TV, started reading his latest book, but now he is 
listening to the night, waiting for his mind to cooperate and turn in for the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't supposed to be like this. It was going to be a challenge, sure, but 
one that he relished. This was the opportunity to finally win, and who knows, 
maybe even erase the haunting memories of Game 5 of the 1986 American League 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it figures to go down as just another frustrating season in Angel 
annals, making this no different from many of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The only real distinction this time is that Lachemann feels responsible. This 
time, Lachemann is manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's taking this hard, very hard," said Marcel's wife, Sue. "He never has 
taken losses well, but now, it's as if he feels responsible for the whole 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he gets down, he usually gets quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 "And lately, it's been real quiet around here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who might be playing their last home stand of the season 
considering the upcoming Aug. 12 strike date, are 18 games below .500. Their 
44-62 record is the worst since 1980, and since May 19 when Lachemann was 
hired, they are 27-38. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not his fault," Angel shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. "You can't blame 
this one on the manager. We're not losing because we're out-managed, or the 
fans don't cheer, or anything else. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're losing because we stink." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is no solace to Lachemann, who continues to be tormented by the 
mounting losses. He despises losing, and has even more contempt for excuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "He takes losses as tough as anybody I've ever seen," Angel General Manager 
Bill Bavasi said. "What makes him unique is that he takes the losses hard, and 
then his next day of work is guided by that. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'How did it happen? Why did it happen? What didn't I do?' 
</P>
<P>
 "He can handle what we're going through, he's very resilient, but when we 
lose, I know it eats at him all night." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lachemann: "I'm not very good at losing. Never have been. Never will. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to lose at anything. Even if I play a game of Ping-Pong, I want 
to beat your . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Competitiveness has driven Lachemann throughout life. He refused to allow an 
arm injury to deter him, so he resorted to throwing side arm, and made a 
nine-year career out of it. He married Sue in the middle of the 1965 season, 
and although his minor league manager, John McNamara, gave him three days off 
for a honeymoon, he returned the next day. He helped convert Bryan Harvey from 
a softball player into an All-Star closer, and Chuck Finley from a middle 
reliever into an 18-game winner. 
</P>
<P>
 This drive prompted him to leave the Angels after the 1992 season. He could 
have stayed as the pitching coach under Buck Rodgers, but Rodgers wanted full 
control of the pitching staff, and Lachemann did not want to follow orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was kind of disenchanted," said his brother, Rene, manager of the Florida 
Marlins. "He needed a change. He was going no matter whether I became manager 
or not." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lachemanns spent 1 1/2 years with the Marlins before Bavasi telephoned 
Marcel the night of May 16. He asked if Lachemann would manage the Angels. If 
not, the Angels would stick with Rodgers, although they were convinced Rodgers 
was not the same man he was before the harrowing bus crash in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a difficult decision. He could have remained, keeping his reputation 
intact as one of the finest pitching coaches in baseball. And he would still be 
with his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the best 1 1/2 years we ever had together," Marcel Lachemann said. "It 
was a pretty special time. We got to know each other like we never have 
before." 
</P>
<P>
 That competitive drive again made Lachemann accept the offer. He knew that one 
day he'd like to become a manager, and if he turned down this opportunity, 
there might never be another. 
</P>
<P>
 Now his life has forever changed, leaving him to wonder during times of 
frustration what in the world he has gotten himself into. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be less than honest," Lachemann said, his face breaking into a smile, "if 
I haven't asked myself at times, 'What the hell have I done?' 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when I took the job, managers came up to me and said, 'What, are you 
crazy?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it would have been easy to stay in my nice comfortable surroundings. I 
was perfectly content. I knew exactly what I wanted to do every minute of every 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he has the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't exactly inherit the '27 Yankees," Finley said. "I'm just glad he's 
a quiet guy. If he wasn't, he'd be hoarse by now watching the way we play." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann, 53, realizes there is no miracle cure. If there are shortcomings, 
he believes they can be remedied simply by hard work, and certainly, no one's 
going to outwork him. 
</P>
<P>
 He is up by 8 each morning, reads the Bible, takes a 30-minute run, makes out 
his lineup, does calisthenics, showers, grabs breakfast, and is at the ballpark 
by noon, seven hours before game-time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of a guy I'd rather have in that spot," Bavasi said. "When we 
made the change, we weren't getting him for the quick-fix. We were looking for 
a different way to go about things, and believe me, he has fulfilled his end of 
the bargain." 
</P>
<P>
 Said DiSarcina: "You got to remember, this is still not his team. These are 
all Buck's guys and Bill's guys. He's still not playing with the guys he 
wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure in the off-season, he'll say, 'If I'm going to lose, I'm going to 
lose with my team.' There's only so much he can do right now, but I'm sure 
you'll see some changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann said inheriting a team in midseason has been difficult. He can't 
overhaul the team's personality. He can't suddenly administer a rash of new 
rules. And he can't develop the close relationships with his players he had as 
a pitching coach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he continues to gather ideas, hoping to implement them next 
spring. He'll keep talking almost daily to Rene, occasionally with McNamara, 
and whenever possible with Gene Mauch, whom he still considers to possess the 
finest managerial mind he has known. 
</P>
<P>
 He aches for the day when the Angels can become winners again, and perhaps 
then people will be able to forget Dave Henderson's ninth-inning home run that 
forever haunts this organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know something," Lachemann said, "this is the only place I would have 
come back to manage. I mean that. There would be no greater feeling like 
winning a championship with the California Angels, and when it happens, I want 
to be here. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I won't be satisfied until we do."

QUICKNESS COULD BE THE KEY FOR BRYANT TO PASS HIS TOUGHEST TEST; BASKETBALL: 
FORMER SCC POINT GUARD HOPES HIS PLAY IN SUMMER PRO LEAGUE WILL HELP HIM LAND A 
JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Danin Bryant knows he is a longshot. Most professional basketball teams don't 
beat down doors belonging to 5-foot-9 point guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Still Bryant, a former Southern California College player, dreams about 
getting his chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Clippers said they might invite me to camp," said Bryant, who lives on a 
street called Clipper Court in Fairfield, Calif. "Maybe it's fate if it works 
out that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Rockford (Ill.), Rapid City (S.D.) and Fargo (N.D.) of the Continental 
Basketball Assn. also have contacted Bryant. He said he also will consider 
playing in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I have to sit back and wait for them to call me," Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Remaining idle doesn't appear to suit Bryant. 
</P>
<P>
 As a player, Bryant never waits for defenders . . . he just drives past them.  
</P>
<P>
 "He is one of the quickest players on the West Coast, at any level," SCC Coach 
Bill Reynolds said at the beginning of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant's forte is his playmaking, dribbling through defenses to create scoring 
opportunities for himself or teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "In high school, I was more of a scorer," Bryant said. "Now with all of these 
6-9 and 6-10 guys to contend with, I'm mainly a passer." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Bryant averaged 16.5 points and six assists while earning 
first-team All-NAIA District 3 honors for SCC. As a junior, Bryant averaged 7.8 
assists, fifth best nationally in the NAIA. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing his senior year at SCC in May, Bryant was looking for any 
opportunity to play professional basketball. Earlier this summer, he played in 
a pro league in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the Sacramento Kings -- like Mitch Richmond, Spud Webb and Wayman 
Tisdale -- played in that league," Bryant said. "That's where Don Sellers found 
me. He's a former scout for the Clippers, and he told me about trying to play 
in Irvine." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant returned to Orange County in July to play in the ASICS Summer Pro 
League at UC Irvine. He opened some scouts' eyes averaging 17.3 points and 6.3 
assists while shooting 53% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant also tried to show his leadership skills this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 As a senior in high school in 1990, Bryant led Fairfield Vanden High to the 
State Division IV championship game. But Oxnard Santa Clara, with Southern 
Section Division IV player of the year and future UCLA standout Shon Tarver, 
defeated Vanden, 56-38. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, Bryant's team, Circuit City, made no championship charge, winning 
only one of seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a learning experience," Bryant said. "It was frustrating sometimes 
because I'd break my man down and pass off to an open teammate, but then he 
would miss the shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, the scouts saw that I can be a playmaker. Since I went to a 
smaller college, people may not know about me. But the scouts know I can play. 
I just have to show that I can produce every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Clark, a coach/agent who led the Orange County team to the free agent's 
division championship for the second consecutive season at the Irvine league, 
agreed that Bryant faces an uphill battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's his best agent right now," Clark said. "He just has so many more things 
to go through. If he gets invited to a CBA camp, he'll have to go to a rookie 
camp and prove he deserves a tryout with the veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, he'll have to survive another cut at the veterans camp. Another thing 
that's tough is that most teams are looking for an experienced point guard." 
</P>
<P>
 Summer provided some valuable experience for Bryant, and it took some time for 
him to adjust to confronting the players he has seen on television. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had posters of Magic Johnson, watched him play," Bryant said. 
"But a week ago, I was playing in the same summer league as him. I've patterned 
parts of my game after Spud Webb, but there I was, playing against him in the 
summer league in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time I went up against him, it didn't go too well. But the next 
time, I just played my game and did much better." 
</P>
<P>
 And the summer league in Irvine provided Bryant with valuable insight just 
watching current NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw Pooh Richardson and Mark Jackson play, and I have to develop the same 
confidence," Bryant said. "They have the attitude that they can do anything, 
and there are no questions or doubts." 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant's only doubt is if anyone will take a chance on a small point guard 
from a small college. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, I'll be in camp in October," Bryant said. "Somewhere."

FOR THREE GAMES, INEXPENSIVE SEATS ARE EVERYWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans accustomed to sitting in remote corners of Anaheim Stadium for Angel 
games will get a chance to see baseball from a different perspective during a 
three-game series with Seattle beginning at 7:05 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets throughout the stadium -- including box seats on the field and club 
levels -- are being sold for $6 on a reserved, first-come, first-served basis. 
</P>
<P>
 These are officially Mariner home games but are being played at the Big A 
because of repair work being done on the ceiling of the Kingdome. They are not 
part of the Angels' season-ticket package. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking rates will remain $5. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's game also will begin at 7:05; Thursday's at 5:35.

 The format changes, the stakes increase and the competition continues as 
surfers head into the first U.S. Open, the fourth stop on the world 
championship tour and the only one in the continental United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, being held at Huntington Beach Pier, opens today with women's 
surfing, longboarding and bodyboarding. Men's surfing begins Wednesday. A total 
purse of $140,000 will awarded. After the first round, competition turns to a 
one-on-one, single-elimination format. 
</P>
<P>
 Men and women who earned enough competition points last year qualified for the 
1994 world tour. 
</P>
<P>
 With 48 spots in the men's event and only 44 male surfers on the world tour, 
the Assn. of Surfing Professionals offered a wild-card invitation to three-time 
world champion Tom Curren. Three other surfers earned invitations by virtue of 
their finish in the Op Pro, which ended Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Deffenbaugh of Huntington Beach, Richie Collins of Newport Beach and 
Shane Stoneman of San Juan Capistrano surf the Bud Surf Tour and other 
world-qualifying events. Collins, who shapes his own boards, surfed on the 
world tour last year but left to concentrate on his shaping business. 
</P>
<P>
 Deffenbaugh survived the pressure of a huge crowd on his hometown break to 
become the only non-world tour surfer in the quarterfinal round of the Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked for his picks, Don Meek, the executive director of the U.S. Open, 
named Collins, Deffenbaugh and Stoneman without hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm liking the local guys who have come through the trials," Meek said. 
"They're all from the 714 area code and they should be tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Machado and Kelly Slater, winner and runner-up at the Op Pro, should also 
be in the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Curren, who lives in France, received a wild-card invitation to the Op Pro and 
did not compete. He said he didn't realize until he arrived in California that 
the Op Pro conflicted with his mother's wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 The top finishers in the Op Pro women's division also will turn up their 
performance level for the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Andersen, currently the women's world leader, looked on the Op as tune-up 
for the Open. 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring .36 points less than winner Frieda Zamba, Andersen said, "This 
wasn't really the contest for me to win. I feel I've set myself up for next 
week. I kind of know the break." 
</P>
<P>
 With six Op victories behind her, Zamba also is familiar with the pier-formed 
sandbar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminds me of the break at home," the Flagler Beach, Fla., native said. 
"It's really peaky." 
</P>
<P>
 In bodyboarding, the one to watch is Mike Stewart of Anaheim. An eight-time 
world champion, Stewart's toughest competition will come from the current world 
champ Guilherme Tamega of Brazil. Other top competitors include Brian Wise and 
Jay Reale, both from San Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Open Beach Expo will be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Seventy 
booths set up behind the grandstand will house a surfboard factory, wetsuits, 
accessories and apparel displays and environmental information from the 
Surfrider Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>

A SQUEEZE PLAY TAGS THE SUMMER BOX OFFICE; A SEASON OF MONUMENTAL SUCCESSES -- 
AND FLOPS -- WORRIES MANY EXECUTIVES THAT CROWDS ARE SHUNNING MID-RANGE FILMS 
IN FAVOR OF A FEW HOME-RUN HITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER and RICHARD NATALE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Eller is the Times 
movie editor and Natale is a free-lance writer. 
</P>

<P>
 While media attention has centered on this summer's record box-office weekends 
and such runaway hits as "The Lion King," "Forrest Gump" and "Speed," what has 
been obscured is how many big expensive movies have been trampled in their 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There could possibly be a record number of losers this summer," producer Sean 
Daniel says. "It looks like Shiloh out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the biggest pools of red ink are the Kevin Costner Western "Wyatt Earp," 
John Hughes' production of "Baby's Day Out" and Rob Reiner's comedy "North."  
</P>
<P>
 And that's just for starters. The list of summer flops includes several other 
high-profile, high-cost films: "I Love Trouble" starring Julia Roberts; Penny 
Marshall's "Renaissance Man" starring Danny DeVito; the Billy Crystal comedy 
sequel "City Slickers II"; and the Eddie Murphy action sequel "Beverly Hills 
Cop III." 
</P>
<P>
 The season's most distressing trend, industry executives say, is the 
disappearance of movies grossing in the middle range (between $40 million and 
$75 million). "There was only room for the home runs this summer," Paramount 
Pictures chairman Sherry Lansing says. "Audiences rejected everything else. We 
seem to have lost the doubles. And that's sad." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the films that were big were gigantic. There are more 
movies grossing $100-million-plus this summer than ever in recent memory. So 
far there are four ("Lion King," "Gump," "The Flintstones" and "Speed") with 
another potential three or four on their way ("True Lies," "The Mask," "Clear 
and Present Danger" and "The Client"). 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers seem to be returning time and again to their favorite films and have 
no interest in other releases, producer Jerry Bruckheimer says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This leaves a big gap between the $100-million blockbusters and the rest of 
the pack. Whereas in summers past, there were at least nine or 10 movies that 
grossed $40 million to $75 million, so far this summer, there have been few. 
The top three or four films in any given weekend are doing between 75% and 90% 
of the business, Castle Rock Pictures president Martin Shafer says. 
</P>
<P>
 "This summer there will probably be eight movies that gross more than $100 
million (there were five in '93), but there will be another eight that will 
lose a lot of money," Warner Bros. distribution chief Barry Reardon says. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, as virtually any industry executive will tell you, is plain and 
simple: There are too many movies, and they're crashing into one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry watchers and the decision makers themselves are again questioning the 
wisdom of squeezing all their movies into the summer rather than in less 
competitive periods like spring and fall. Universal chairman Tom Pollock 
decided to pull Meryl Streep's "The River Wild," as well as Jean Claude Van 
Damme's "Time Cop," and fit them into more comfortable fall berths. "And I 
think we'll do better with both of them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The logjam was particularly problematic for family movies. Even though 
children are available seven days a week in the summer and go to more movies, 
this year proved that market isn't limitless. Cases in point: Fox's "Baby's Day 
Out" and Columbia/Castle Rock's "Little Big League." The former played on 
Hughes' successful "Home Alone" phenomenon; the latter is another in a skein of 
kid-oriented baseball movies following last year's popular "Rookie of the Year" 
and "The Sandlot." 
</P>
<P>
 Executives and producers admit that in many cases they become overly 
enthusiastic after test screening their movies. For instance, Shafer says, the 
previews on "Little Big League" were sensational. But the fallibility of 
marketing previews is that they don't take the competition into account, 
industry pundits say. "When you have a screening in March, it doesn't tell you 
whether your movie can break through as a consumer choice in June or July," 
says Daniel, citing his own 1993 film, "Hearts and Souls," as one such example. 
</P>
<P>
 What none of these family films saw coming was the "Jurassic Park"-type 
drawing power of "The Lion King," which is expected to gross $275 million. 
Twentieth Century Fox chairman Peter Chernin says he believes one of the 
biggest problems for "Baby's Day Out" was that "our release date was July 1," a 
holiday weekend when five new movies opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, in retrospect, we were too close to 'The Lion King,' which devoured all 
the family movies in its path," Chernin says. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Shafer says Castle Rock was eager to have "the first kid's baseball 
movie out there" with "Little Big League" (to beat out Disney's "Angels in the 
Outfield"). 
</P>
<P>
 "Did we want to go opposite 'The Lion King'? No. . . . We got buried and 
couldn't hang in there," Shafer says. "If we had to do it over again, we'd 
probably come out in late August." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether any of these movies would have performed better in other time slots is 
anybody's guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Other studio executives were trafficking in 20/20 hindsight about such 
disappointments as "The Cowboy Way" starring Woody Harrelson, "Wyatt Earp" and 
"I Love Trouble." Several of the non-performers, which also included sequels to 
"City Slickers" and "Beverly Hills Cop," looked like sure bets. All of these 
movies were expected to do far better than they did at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sequels haven't been working for the past year," Reardon says. And star 
vehicles can sometimes work better at other times of the year. Paramount's 1993 
movie "Indecent Proposal," starring Robert Redford and Demi Moore, grossed more 
than $100 million, and it was released in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nature of the business is for studios to bring out their big guns in 
summer, because between Memorial Day and Labor Day the industry racks up 40% of 
its annual box-office revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 But losses can be huge, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless "Wyatt Earp" performs substantially better overseas than it did at home 
-- which was the case with Costner's last domestic dud, "A Perfect World" -- 
Warner Bros. stands to lose a good portion of its reported $60-million 
investment in the film. "Earp's" ultimate $25-million U.S. gross will not cover 
even its additional marketing expenditure.  
</P>
<P>
 Marketing costs, particularly high in the competitive summer season, can range 
from $12 million to $30 million, depending on the success of a particular 
movie. And a studio only retains about half of any film's box-office gross; the 
rest remains with the theater owner. 
</P>
<P>
 At least "Earp" has Costner as a drawing card for video and foreign release, a 
factor that could also ease some of the pain for other summer losers such as 
"Cop III," "City Slickers" and "I Love Trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 But box-office watchers say an expensive family film like "Baby's Day Out," 
with no box-office names, has little hope of recouping its cost from other 
outlets based on its miserable performance at home. Fox's Chernin admits, 
"We'll lose some money on the movie," but nonetheless insists that "Baby's" 
foreign potential could be "quite good" because "all the foreign exhibitors 
really like the movie. And (John) Hughes is a big name overseas." 
</P>
<P>
 Another expensive family-movie underachiever is the $40-million "North" 
starring Elijah Wood, which is Reiner's first flop. Shafer says Castle Rock has 
no money in the movie (which has only been in release two weeks) because it was 
financed by its domestic distributor, Columbia Pictures, which paid for a small 
portion of the budget and all marketing, and New Line Cinema, which will 
probably recoup its investment because it has domestic video rights and sold 
off foreign rights before the film went into production. 
</P>
<P>
 Other movies that will potentially be a bottom-line drain include Disney's "I 
Love Trouble" and Universal's "Cowboy Way." Unless they perform extremely well 
overseas or in video, each could lose between $8 million and $14 million, 
sources say.  
</P>
<P>
 Pre-sales and deals in which studios sell off partial foreign rights to films 
act as protection when a movie doesn't perform up to snuff, as with Universal's 
"The Shadow" and Disney's "Renaissance Man," minimizing the impact of the 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The summer relay isn't over yet. "Traffic won't clear up until late August," 
Reardon says. "About five or so films will do business. The rest will fall by 
the wayside." 
</P>
<P>
 It's yet to be seen if moviedom's decision makers will rethink their 
competitive postures and learn something from this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the hits will keep coming. And so will the losers. Box Office 
Busts 
</P>
<P>
 These nine summer movies were supposed to bring in a flood of paying 
customers, but instead they were swept aside by the season's runaway hits.

PUMPING LIFE BACK INTO THE OLD PAL; CLUBS: SHERRY THOMAS, WIDOW OF A PALOMINO 
CO-OWNER, STEERS THE NORTH HOLLYWOOD HONKY-TONK BACK TO A HOT COUNTRY VENUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The office Sherry Thomas keeps at "the world famous" Palomino is a mess. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the usual paperwork and piles of cassettes and CDs from bands hoping 
for a gig at the 42-year-old honky-tonk. But now the floor is crowded with 
hammers, electric saws, drills and other tools, and the phone doesn't stop 
ringing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas is working to rebuild the North Hollywood venue to its former glory as 
the West Coast's premier showcase for country music. The widow of club 
co-founder Tommy Thomas has returned after spending eight years in Oregon 
raising their two sons, and is determined to make Palomino's stage again a hot 
spot for local and touring country acts, rather than the stylistically 
scattered roster of recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like home to me," said Thomas, sitting at her desk in a denim top and 
jeans. "When you're a new singer-songwriter and want to make it, you have got 
to have some place to rehearse, a place to play, some place to be seen. I felt 
a responsibility to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1952 by Tommy Thomas and his brother, Bill, the club presented such 
important country talents as Hank Williams Sr., Johnny Cash, Kitty Wells and 
Waylon Jennings. Rock acts from Neil Young to Elvis Costello have also passed 
through. And Linda Ronstadt once performed in the early '70s backed by the 
musicians who would later become the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's significant about this club is that it encompasses the history and 
tradition of American musical culture -- not just with country music, but with 
rockabilly and with blues," said Ronnie Mack, a local country singer-guitarist 
and host of the Palomino's free-admission "Barndance" showcase for local 
artists on Tuesday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But by the early '90s the club had lost much of its luster, with the rear 
patio in disrepair and declared unsafe by the fire department. Just six months 
ago, the Palomino sat on the edge of oblivion as then-co-owner and manager 
Billy Thomas (son of the late Bill Thomas) gave serious thought to turning the 
place into a pool hall or closing it down altogether.  
</P>
<P>
 It was then that Sherry Thomas, who had remained a co-owner, decided to 
return, and in May she bought out her nephew's interest in the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first got back I was a little in shock with the work that it was going 
to take," she said of the 300-seat club, listing all the paint, lumber, carpet, 
new kitchen appliances and labor she's already invested. "I knew things were 
run-down, but I didn't realize how serious it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Only three bar stools were left, and in the trash out back she found about 20 
of the classic Palomino performance photos that had decorated the club, 
including one shot of George Jones at the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas expects to spend about $25,000 in materials on the project, doing much 
of the work herself with the help of various friends and volunteers. "I've had 
musicians in here helping me paint," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want it to look like the Pal used to look," added Thomas, who is now in her 
40s. "It was a real successful place and it was home to a lot of people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Palomino became Thomas' home in 1970 when, in search of a waitress job, 
she walked in just in time to catch one of Jennings' frequent performances 
there. By the time she and Tommy married a few years later, she filled a 
variety of roles, from cooking and scheduling waitresses to booking talent -- 
all tasks she is working at again. 
</P>
<P>
 By early August, she said, the Palomino will revive its old weekly talent 
night with a house band backing star wanna-bes. The club is booked through the 
summer, and Thomas has had discussions with Dick Clark about a television 
special centered at the club. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the Palomino's calendar, Thomas insisted, will be filled with local 
country performers not often acknowledged on the club circuit.  
</P>
<P>
 "The L.A. talent scene as far as country music goes is being totally 
overlooked. I've probably booked 100 of them since I got back here," she said. 
"And they're good." 
</P>

JENNIFER YORK'S HIGH-FLYING DAYS, BASS-PLAYING NIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an old story: struggling musician works a day job to supplement the 
meager wages earned while playing late-night club dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Jennifer York is no exception. But her day job starts when most 
after-hours jazz clubs are still going strong. She's up at 4:30 a.m., gathering 
her wits and her makeup. She arrives at Van Nuys airport by 5:15 a.m. and by 
5:30 a.m., as the airborne traffic reporter for KTLA Channel 5 News, her 
cameraman and the pilot are lifting off in Skycam 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking a little green this morning," says the cameraman as he hits York with 
a spotlight that comes on while she makes her report. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was up till midnight," she counters, teasing her hair and smoothing her 
makeup, while unscrambling the traffic information that's pouring into her 
headset. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a spilled load of bicycles on the San Gabriel Freeway, and Skycam 5 
will be there to document the backup. York props a pair of stuffed animals in 
the copter's window, scribbles some notes on her clipboard and turns to face 
the camera mounted in the rear of the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple nights later, York can be found fiddling with her bass amp on the 
tiny bandstand inside Tribeca, a sleek Encino restaurant and watering hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Her quartet moves into the familiar strains of "Autumn Leaves." She leads the 
way playing an upright that makes York, who is tall to begin with, seem small 
by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second set, she switches to electric bass guitar, pounding out the 
rhythmic vamp of Grover Washington Jr.'s "Mr. Magic." During her solo, she 
slaps the strings in the heavyweight style of bassist Marcus Miller (one of her 
heroes), combining rhythmic and melodic elements in a way that causes a knot of 
male patrons at the bar to shout their approval. 
</P>
<P>
 York, 31, twists and turns with the beat, obviously deep within the music and 
enjoying herself mightily. By the time the night's last set is finished, 
there's little more than four hours left before her alarm clock goes off again. 
</P>
<P>
 York's daily schedule would leave most people sleepy-eyed and cranky. But she 
is a whirligig of energy at both ends of the day, bursting with the kind of 
enthusiasm that few bring to a single job, let alone two. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love both my jobs," York asserts with such animation that even a cynic 
can't help but believe her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jennifer has more energy than any 10 people I know," says saxophonist Ann 
Patterson, leader of the Maiden Voyage big band that also boasts York as its 
bassist. "She's so serious about her playing. There's no way that she's 
depending on her visibility in television to get by on the bandstand. She's 
working very hard to become a great musician." 
</P>
<P>
 York is equally dedicated to her broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Her clear-headed reports during last year's Laguna and Malibu fires, coming on 
days that often found her working 18 hours without a break, helped her team 
earn an Emmy nomination for live coverage of an unscheduled news event. 
</P>
<P>
 The divergent paths York follows is a result of both conscious effort and 
circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like I tripped and fell into this job," she says of reporting. "I 
consider myself a bass player first, but I love doing newscasting. I can't 
imagine my life without both." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Covina, York grew up in Hemet and began playing the piano when she was 
5. She was attracted to an electric bass in the seventh grade because "it 
looked just like the one Paul McCartney played." 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to keep up both piano and bass for a while, but bass finally won out. 
It was rare to see a girl play bass and it felt really special to me. It's a 
very rhythmic instrument, very percussive and melodic, and I found I could 
combine both those aspects." 
</P>
<P>
 York gave up the bass when she moved on to study political science at UCLA. 
Now broadcasting was her goal. She went to New York in 1984 for an internship 
with ABC and "Good Morning, America," a stint that she turned into a full-time 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 After three years in New York, she joined the staff of a Hackensack, N.J., 
radio station as its promotions director. It was there that she realized how 
much she missed being involved with music. 
</P>
<P>
 So in 1987 she returned to the Golden State, enrolled at the Musician's 
Institute in North Hollywood and waited tables at Jerry's Deli. She was quickly 
hired to play in an all-female band at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe I got the gig," she says. "I had left the bass for eight 
years and had truly forgotten how to play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney job allowed her to support herself as a musician. But when the gig 
ended after a year, things changed. "That's when reality hit. I didn't know 
that you might need a day job other than playing." 
</P>
<P>
 She parlayed her broadcasting experience into a position as traffic reporter 
for KFWB-AM (980), becoming its airborne reporter in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, she kept plugging away at her music career, playing in the 
pop band Smart Cookies and, later, the Christian band Rachel Rachel. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was also developing a new love: jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always a fan of Weather Report and (its bassist) Jaco Pastorious, and I 
thought playing 'Bird-land' like him would be the greatest. In 1987, I went to 
a Chick Corea concert in San Diego and totally fell in love with (the playing 
of Corea bassist) John Patitucci. I'll never forget that concert. It totally 
freaked me out, and I thought, 'My gosh, that's what I have to do the rest of 
my life.' " 
</P>
<P>
 York began pursuing the upright bass in 1992, studying with respected bassist 
John Clayton, composer and co-leader of the Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra. 
That same year she was hired by KTLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Now York works the occasional club date -- she can be found every Wednesday at 
Tribeca and occasional Sundays at Amazon in Encino -- as well as working with 
Patterson's Maiden Voyage and trumpeter Stacy Rowles' Jazzbirds. As a measure 
of her seriousness, she studies with Christopher Hanulik, principal bassist of 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Her husband of less than a year, Nils Johnson, is 
also a bassist who travels with the Ray Charles Orchestra. 
</P>

 She says she's anxious to get a CD out with her quartet and travel the world 
playing jazz festivals.

 "The group's only been together nine months and it's been such an enjoyable

<P>
 But her broadcasting career is also important.

 "John Tesh is a great role model for me," she says. "He does his TV show

broadcasting and music work together."

 So has Jennifer York.

THEATER REVIEW; A GOOD LOOK AT THE HARD LESSONS OF 'GOOD PERSON' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bertolt Brecht had no time for subtlety. The German playwright was on the run 
from the Nazis with his Jewish wife when he wrote "The Good Person of Setzuan." 
</P>
<P>
 When the gods name prostitute Shen Te as the world's sole, good person, they 
give her a cash reward that attracts all the greedy, hungry and lazy in 
Brecht's mythical but all too familiar city. "Good Person" shows Brecht at his 
essence, barraging the audience with the world's toughest questions, starting 
with "What claim exactly do the hungry have on us?" 
</P>
<P>
 At the La Jolla Playhouse, writer Tony Kushner's hip and poetic adaptation 
(from a literal English translation) provides a direct link between Brecht and 
Kushner's own consuming search for decency that makes up much of his epic 
"Angels in America." But there are differences. Kushner can make you cry; 
Brecht has no interest in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hands of the remarkably versatile director Lisa Peterson, this vividly 
entertaining production spans the two sensibilities, both comically cold and 
unexpectantly touching. Her Setzuan is a true melting pot, spilling over with 
evil, humor and color, and kicked into life by an eclectic/funky score 
(provided by Los Lobos' David Hidalgo and Louie Perez) that embraces pop, rap 
and Latin rhythms with equal energy and fun. Peterson knows how to keep an 
audience entertained, even one that is being lectured to. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer Robert Brill sets the playfully agonized tone by stripping the deep 
stage bare to the back wall, which is painted a bright red and half-covered by 
a gigantic lizard slithering on its belly down toward the action. There it 
hangs, threatening to engulf the town but never moving an inch. 
</P>
<P>
 This impending monster seemingly propels the townspeople into all sorts of 
enterprising immoralities. "Under less miserable circumstances, we would have 
been OK," muses the rogue lover Yang Sun (Lou Diamond Phillips) after 
exploiting Shen Te's generous devotion. Energetically shedding his too-good 
film image from "La Bamba," Phillips swaggers and sings his way across the 
stage with desultory pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his songs, a slave-driving incantation delivered to yellow-suited 
workers who toss boxes to one another in a stationary dance, is one of the high 
points of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlayne Woodard is the woman he woos and abuses, the incandescent Shen Te, 
who loves Yang Sun and vows: "I won't calculate what it costs me." Woodard is 
lyrical in the play's only purely joyful passage, Shen Te's ode to an awakening 
city after a night spent with her lover. In Brecht's happily atheistic view, 
the dirty pavement leading from a lover's house is infinitely preferable to the 
heavenly clouds promised to us by gods who have no practical understanding of 
the world we live in. 
</P>
<P>
 Using her reward money, Shen Te buys a little tobacco shop that is immediately 
threatened by an army of creditors. In order to stop the hordes from milking 
her dry, Shen Te dresses as a man, the ruthless Shui Ta. Brecht probably 
divided his heroine to depict the tough love of capitalism, in which one is 
coldly pragmatic in order to protect what one loves most. Woodard uses it to 
show both a woman's crippling inability to face what she must and the terrible 
price a man pays for performing the dirty work.  
</P>
<P>
 Using wonderful masks -- which make the gods look alternately sad, tired, wise 
and unknowing -- Peterson continually pumps up Brecht's innate theatricality 
and provides an avenue into a world designed to be emotionally alienating. In 
one scene, a lost child is represented by a puppet. Manipulated by a fully 
visible puppeteer on a high rafter, the child makes its way to a garbage can, 
where it fishes out some paper that it either eats or uses as tissue for its 
futile tears. This eerie image, bone chilling in its directness, is infinitely 
more mysterious and stirring than any actual child actor could have provided.  
</P>
<P>
 The cast (with actors in multiple parts) largely understands that Brecht's 
bold overstatement must be tinged with the ridiculous. Especially good are 
Chris De Oni as the puffed-up barber who loves Shen Te for her generosity, even 
as he beats beggars who annoy him; Ching Valdes-Aran as the landlady who's a 
cross between David Bowie, Lotte Lenya and the bride of Frankenstein; Diane 
Rodriguez as Yang Sun's overweening mother, and Gedde Watanabe as the fearful 
but eventually brave water seller. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brecht's favorite user-unfriendly mode, the play ends abruptly, in an 
epilogue that begs the audience's indulgence. Peterson stages it with charming 
simplicity. In a line, the actors read verse that winds up on a Dr. Seuss note, 
asking theater-goers to be "brave and just . . . for the world must be happy/It 
must, must, must." 
</P>
<P>
 This, however, is no tacked-on optimism. "If hope isn't forced to encounter 
the worst possibility, then it's a lie," said Tony Kushner in a recent Los 
Angeles Times interview. Brecht too had no patience for sentimentality, false 
hope or lies. And Lisa Peterson sets the stage for this debate between two 
major playwrights who share a taste for hard lessons and high theatricality. 
Amid misery, they form a happy triumvirate.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; TRITT'S WHOOSH OF ENERGY OUTSTRIPS HIGH-TECH SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NOEL DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Travis Tritt appeared determined to revisit the arena-rock overkill of the 
'70s at the Pond here on Sunday. Introduced by a whoosh of synthesizers, a 
laser eagle and theatrical fog, the rock-edged country singer roared onto the 
stage on a Harley and immediately launched into full-bore versions of his hit 
"Put Some Drive in Your Country" and the new "Wishful Thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Swinging his hips, doing jumping jacks and a modified duck walk, Tritt bounded 
back and forth across the stage like Bruce Springsteen, Steven Tyler and Bono 
all rolled into one. If Tritt was going to unleash so much dynamite during the 
first two songs, what would be left for the rest of his set? 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty, as it turned out. Tritt not only played the expected energetic 
versions of several hits, but also offered personalized versions of songs made 
famous by other artists, including Steve Earle and Charlie Daniels. He also 
paid tribute to three of country's legends by delivering spine-tingling 
readings of Johnny Cash's "I Walk the Line," Merle Haggard's "Mama Tried" and 
George Jones' "If Drinkin' Don't Kill Me (Her Memory Will)." 
</P>
<P>
 Tritt's performance was so dynamic that all the high-tech trappings -- 
including flashing lasers, a futuristic drum riser, glowing initials and a 
liberal use of video -- seemed almost superfluous. Tritt's music and charisma 
were so strong that he could have delivered the same set on a bare stage and 
little would have been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 * Travis Tritt, Joe Diffie and Lee Roy Parnell appear Thursday at Glen Helen 
Blockbuster Pavilion, 2555 Devore Road, Devore, 7:30 p.m. $12.50-$22.50. (909)

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; MILLA'S UNFOCUSED MIX HAS ITS CHARMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Milla Vanilla? That's the flavor you might expect when an 18-year-old 
supermodel and actress decides to do her music thing. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as most of the reviews agreed, Milla's recent debut album is a legit if 
imitative effort, and her live Los Angeles debut on Sunday at LunaPark followed 
suit.Alternately evocative and overbearing, touching and trivial, Milla's 
manner and music were thin but entertaining, and a definite charm and authority 
are floating around in her unfocused mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Persona-jumping from goofy, wisecracking hyper-teen to scowling, in-character 
performer of serious song, Milla never managed to center herself -- she 
provided no real transition from her casual mode to the theatrical, so the 
artifice was more evident than it should be. 
</P>
<P>
 If her music doesn't go too deep, its surfaces are certainly seductive and 
evocative. With a sort of world-music string band weaving exotic pastiches 
behind her, she traversed Kate Bush territory with a voice whose dynamics and 
interpretive skills are well beyond the standard for her age. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, her voice sounds like that of a much older woman, with a ragged edge 
of experience that suggests either a gifted mimic or someone who's crammed a 
lot into a short time. RICHARD CROMELIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 LONG WAY: Actor Dustin Hoffman recently started work on his new film, 
"Outbreak," about a deadly virus. But Hoffman may always be most remembered as 
the confused Benjamin in the 1967 classic, "The Graduate," which, incidentally, 
gave a plug to the Valley. . . . During Ben's graduation party, his mother told 
him to see his guests, including one couple who "came all the way from 
Tarzana." 
</P>
<P>
 THEY WERE HERE: The Rolling Stones, who opened yet another tour Monday, have 
never actually performed as a group in the Valley. But Mick Jagger and Keith 
Richards haven't ignored us, either. Jagger once used the Country Club in 
Reseda to shoot a video for a solo album, and Richards has played at the 
Universal Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
 FAMOUS CLUB: A few months ago, it looked as if the Palomino, the former home 
of country music legends, might be put out to pasture. But instead, with Sherry 
Thomas (above) returning to town, the North Hollywood club may rise again (F1). 
. . . Clint Eastwood used to be a frequent patron. In fact, two of his films, 
"Every Which Way But Loose," and "Any Which Way You Can," were shot there. 
</P>
<P>
 MAKING FRIENDS: Greg Gooden is the kind of guy who lets guests hang out in his 
spare Van Nuys bedroom even if he hardly knows them. Now that's hospitality, 
huh? . . . Well, not exactly. Gooden communicates with them through his own 
computer bulletin board company, one of more than 57,000 systems nationwide. 
"It's like going to the library without leaving the house," he says. See Valley 
Business, Page 10. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW MARKET: Hollywood will soon be coming to a CD-ROM near you, courtesy of 
Image Entertainment in Chatsworth, which hopes to take advantage of the 
millions of computers with that technology. . . . But most of the films will 
have sex or violence. "I don't see putting 'Terms of Endearment' on CD-ROM," 
said CEO Martin Greenwald. See Valley Business, Page 4. Michael Arkush

OFFICIALS SEEK TO PRESERVE CHERRY FARM TRADITION; AGRICULTURE: LEADERS IN 
MICHIGAN'S OLD MISSION PENINSULA PROPOSE A TAX INCREASE TO BUY UP DEVELOPMENT 
RIGHTS AND STEM THE FLOW OF SUBDIVISIONS INTO THEIR 20-MILE-LONG SLICE OF LAND.

<P>
 For almost a century, orchards have flourished amid the rolling hills, 
well-drained soils and Lake Michigan breezes of the Old Mission Peninsula, 
where fruit farming is a way of life and the cherry is a cultural icon. 
</P>
<P>
 But the breathtaking vistas afforded by this 20-mile-long spit of land are 
also drawing developers of subdivisions and country estates, who offer farmers 
more money than some can turn their backs on. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid warnings that they risk losing their treasured open spaces, which draw 
sightseers from across the Midwest, voters will decide today whether to boost 
property taxes. The increase would raise $2.6 million over 15 years to buy 
development rights to thousands of acres, in effect paying willing farmers to 
keep farming instead of selling out. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of a house worth $100,000 on Old Mission Peninsula now pays $1,150 a 
year in property taxes. The proposed increase would hike that by $62. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a fabulous opportunity to protect precious farmland and . . . some of 
the most spectacular views you can find," said Glen Chowan, director of the 
Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say taxes are high enough and express irritation at newcomers who 
want farmers to forgo lucrative offers just so they can keep their pretty 
views. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very bitter against all these protection groups," said Ann Fouch, who 
with her husband has raised fruit on the peninsula for 44 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of these people who've come out here and built these beautiful homes has 
ever done anything for us. . . . What right have they got to tell us what to do 
with our land?" 
</P>
<P>
 The peninsula is the scenic crown jewel of Grand Traverse County in Michigan's 
northwestern Lower Peninsula. Grand Traverse and three neighboring counties 
produce 40% of the nation's tart cherries -- the ones made into pie filling. 
They grow 12% of its sweet cherries, used for juices, canning and table fruit. 
One in every 20 of the region's jobs is linked to cherry farming. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the peninsula's 17,000 acres, 10,000 are zoned for agriculture, although 
only 7,000 are being farmed. That means there's still plenty of open space, but 
officials are nervous about the steadily encroaching subdivisions and pricey 
vacation homes that dot the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
 About 4,300 people permanently live on the peninsula, but current zoning would 
allow a population approaching 30,000, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 If enough cherry farms disappear, courts could order a zoning change from 
agricultural to commercial, allowing an influx of hotels, restaurants and strip 
malls, warns Peninsula Township planner Gordon Hayward. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect is ominous for many farmers, who say their delicate coexistence 
with residents, particularly new arrivals, is fraying. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just the housing developments, growers say. It's the single families 
who move to the country and then gripe about farm noise and pesticides. It's 
rowdy youths who strip cherries from trees and damage equipment in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that kind of thing keeps up, I may reach the point where I just don't want 
to put up with it any more," said Rob Manigold, a 43-year-old cherry farmer and 
township supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family has been farming here for nearly 100 years," Manigold said. "I'd 
like to stay in farming and pass it on to my children. But if we don't take 
action now, I don't know if that will be possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the preservation plan hope the $2.6 million would buy 
development rights to 1,100 to 2,000 acres. Combined with state money, private 
grants and other sources, they hope ultimately to protect 9,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't saying let's slam the door and not let anyone else in," Hayward 
said. "What we're trying to do is channel the growth in ways that won't destroy 
our agriculture industry and our quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters acknowledge a big obstacle in Michigan's longstanding hostility to 
property taxes, which for years were well above the national average. Only five 
months ago, voters approved a sweeping rollback in exchange for a higher sales 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
 On the peninsula, supporters hope anti-tax fever will be cooled by the 
prospect of losing a cherished way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Johnson, 71, a lifelong resident of peninsula cherry farms, said he'll 
be the first to offer his development rights for sale if the plan passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd wanted to live in a suburb, I'd have left the farm a long time ago," 
Johnson said. "I have a great attachment to this land, this way of life. . . . 
It's in my blood."

COVERED CALLS ARE A CAREFUL STEP INTO OPTIONS MARKET; INVESTMENTS: THESE 
PROMISES TO SELL STOCK WORK BEST WHEN THE MARKET IS AMBIGUOUSLY TRADING IN A 
NARROW RANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Individual investors who like trading stocks can squeeze some extra profit 
from an uncertain market by taking a conservative step into the options market. 
</P>
<P>
 They can sell covered calls -- promises to sell the stocks they already own. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a strategy that Naples, Fla., money manager Richard Schmidt calls 
"awesome -- the derivative we know and love." 
</P>
<P>
 On the upside, such a strategy will pay you to wait with a stock that is 
trading in a narrow range. The downside, is that if the share price goes up 
past the "strike price" set in the call, the stock can be sold out from under 
you. In the right circumstances, even that's not so bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it worked recently for Schmidt, who publishes the Risk Report, an 
investment newsletter. He bought Motorola for $48 a share, and watched the 
share price drop to $44 and then back up to $48. More than once. 
</P>
<P>
 Reasoning that the stock was going nowhere fast, he sold a covered call on the 
shares he owned, promising to sell his Motorola stock for $50 a share in 
October. The calls were $4.50 per share; on 100 shares he would have pocketed 
$450, less the $30 he paid his deep discount broker to place the order. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola share prices slid. When the stock hit $46, the same calls he sold 
were selling for $2.50 per share: He bought them back, for a net gain of $1.40 
per share (after broker's commissions coming and going.) And still had his 
Motorola. 
</P>
<P>
 What could have happened? Schmidt could have held the stock and not 
repurchased the call. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Motorola passed $50 before the option expired, his stock would have been 
sold. He still would have $4.50 a share for the call, plus the $2 per share 
that was the difference between his purchase price and the $50 "strike price" 
at which the call required he sell. If Motorola never passed $50 during the 
period when the call was outstanding, the option would just expire at the end 
of the three months. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a strategy that works, but only in a narrow set of circumstances. It 
doesn't work for "buy and hold" investors who like to pick blue chip companies, 
ignore their market activity for 20 or 30 years, and then cash in the 
certificates. It may not work for investors who are trading outside of a 
retirement fund: Capital-gains taxes can eat away much of the profits. And it 
probably doesn't work for investors who use full-service brokers, says Schmidt. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes the discounts offered by a cut-rate broker to make the strategy add 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 When is the situation optimum for selling covered calls? When the market is 
ambiguously trading in a narrow range. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the market move out of its doldrums and hit an upward trajectory, 
investors would do better to hold on to their winners than to sell them for the 
price of a call and a couple of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the market become a full-fledged bear, there wouldn't be enough money 
out there buying calls to make it worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 If your interest is piqued, keep these tips in mind as you tread into new 
waters: 
</P>
<P>
 * Use your retirement account. If you sell a covered call and the stock you 
love ends up bought out from under you, you can always just buy it again. All 
this trading has no tax impact in a tax-deferred retirement account like a 
Keogh or a SEP IRA. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sell calls only on big-name stocks that see lots of activity. They always 
have some people buying and others selling. Sell calls on a stock that's too 
obscure, says Schmidt, and "everyone could end up on the same side. You could 
be the market on a given day." Schmidt's picks for selling covered calls 
include Caterpillar Inc., Chrysler Corp., Home Depot and Williams Companies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Learn the trading range of your stocks. Sell the calls when you are near the 
top of the range; they'll fetch a heftier price. Then, buy them back at bargain 
prices when the stock goes to the low end of its range. 
</P>
<P>
 * Set a "strike price" that is comfortably above the top of that range. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be prepared to watch your stocks more carefully than you otherwise might. If 
you have a call outstanding against a stock in your portfolio, you really need 
to monitor the stock's price. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crunch the numbers. Make sure you have enough shares, low enough brokerage 
fees, and a high enough offering price before you sell calls. Otherwise you 
could just be buying a lot of activity for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Learn more. Options contracts are listed in the major financial newspapers, 
and a quick study of the tables will help you understand what's really out 
there.

ACCOUNTING FIRMS REORGANIZE TO LIMIT LIABILITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ernst & Young, Coopers & Lybrand and Price Waterhouse reorganized their 
partnerships as of today to give individual partners more protection against 
lawsuits, the accounting firms said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other three Big Six accounting firms -- Arthur Andersen, KPMG Peat Marwick 
and Deloitte & Touche -- said they will probably follow suit within a month or 
so.Andersen's sister firm, Andersen Consulting, will also reorganize. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a form of organization called a limited liability partnership, or LLP, 
only partners who are directly involved in wrongdoing would have to tap their 
personal assets to pay judgments. All of the firm's assets would also be 
vulnerable, but partners not involved in the case would have their personal 
assets shielded. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the three firms making the change today will be based for legal 
purposes in Delaware. The firms will append to their formal names the initials 
"LLP." 
</P>
<P>
 "The LLP provides some measure of protection for the personal assets of 
partners not involved in any wrongdoing in the event that catastrophic 
litigation sends the firm into bankruptcy," said Peter Horowitz, a spokesman 
for Price Waterhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not limit the right of aggrieved parties to seek legal redress. But 
neither does it reduce the threat to the accounting profession's long-term 
survival posed by those who abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest accounting firms have been hit with costly lawsuits, which, 
because of the way the firms had been of the way the firms had been organized, 
put their partners' personal assets at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Some second-tier accounting firms -- those that operate nationally or 
regionally but are not as big as the six biggest firms -- will probably take 
similar action. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional service firms have been lobbying for the past several years for 
the right to organize as LLPs.

MAN HELD IN ASSAULT ON OFFICER; 3 DRIVERS COME TO RESCUE WHEN MOTORIST 
ALLEGEDLY TURNS VIOLENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A driver stopped for speeding attacked a California Highway Patrol officer 
Monday on the Antelope Valley Freeway, punching her in the face until two 
off-duty Burbank police officers and a former bouncer stopped to restrain him, 
the CHP reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The three other motorists, who pulled over when they saw the scuffle on the 
edge of the freeway, wrestled away her assailant and held him down until more 
officers arrived to arrest the man. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP Officer Amy Bonilla, 28, received facial cuts and bruises in the melee and 
one of the rescuers suffered a broken wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 "They certainly kept her from further harm," said CHP Chief Edward Gomez. 
</P>
<P>
 The detained driver, who had an open bottle of wine and a loaded revolver in 
his car, has an arrest record for assault and drug offenses, Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla, 28, who fired one shot during the confrontation, was taken to Henry 
Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital where she was treated and released seven hours 
after the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Bonilla, a highway patrol officer for five years, pulled over 
Ronald Arnett Coleman, 33, of Palmdale shortly after 8 a.m. when she timed the 
green Cadillac Coleman was driving at about 80 m.p.h. as it headed north on the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman -- who at 205 pounds weighs nearly twice as much as the officer -- was 
argumentative after she stopped him near the Golden Valley Road off-ramp, Gomez 
said. Coleman lunged at Bonilla when she attempted to administer a field 
sobriety test to see if he had been drinking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know what provoked the attack," Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman tried unsuccessfully to pull Bonilla's baton away from her and began 
punching her in the face, Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla -- who is 5 foot-5-inches and weighs 110 pounds -- drew her pistol, 
firing it once into the pavement. The 5-foot-10-inch Coleman then tried to pull 
the gun from her grasp, but Bonilla was able to hang onto it, Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman "was on top of her and was beating her with his fist" and grabbing for 
her gun when the three passing motorists stopped to help, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first individual was able to collar him around the neck and, with the two 
other people, wrestle him down," Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonilla was able to radio for assistance during the struggle, and the three 
men restrained Coleman, putting him in Bonilla's handcuffs, until other 
officers arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was blood all over her uniform and all over the ground," said an 
officer on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman was in custody at the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's station in lieu 
of $500,000 bail and will be charged with attempted murder on a peace officer, 
Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the rescuers, Brent Ambrose, 32, and Jeffrey Campbell, 35, have been 
Burbank police officers since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 The other was James Arthur Clark, who works as a limousine driver in 
Lancaster. Clark, the first to come to the officer's aid, suffered a broken 
wrist when he slipped while trying to pull Coleman off her. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark, 41, said he was driving north on the freeway after running an errand 
when "I heard the screams and I looked and I saw a black male, leaning over a 
female CHP officer. He was beating her and she was screaming." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said he doesn't usually travel out of Lancaster because he considers Los 
Angeles "too violent," but as a former bouncer -- he stands 6-feet-5 and weighs 
220 pounds -- he has broken up fights in the past and was not afraid to pitch 
in to help the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her face was completely covered with blood," said Clark. "Her face was so 
swollen and she was shaking." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark said he would take the same action if he came on another such incident. 
"That's just the way I was raised. You see someone who needs help, you help," 
said Clark. "I wasn't trying to be a hero." 
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement officials praised the men, describing their efforts as 
"invaluable" in saving Bonilla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful these citizens came to her aid," said Gomez. But he also 
cautioned citizens about becoming involved in dangerous situations that could 
lead to injury.

INCENTIVES SUGGESTED TO HASTEN QUAKE RESTORATION; RECOVERY: LAWMAKERS ARE ASKED 
TO OFFER THOSE WHO INVEST IN AFFECTED NEIGHBORHOODS A TAX CREDIT OF 20% OF THE 
DAMAGED PROPERTY'S PURCHASE PRICE. 
</P>

<P>
 Looking for new ways to hasten the quake recovery, Los Angeles Councilman Hal 
Bernson urged state lawmakers Monday to provide tax incentives for investors 
who put money into quake-damaged neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson, who represents the northwestern San Fernando Valley, pitched the idea 
to Los Angeles-based federal and state lawmakers and their representatives who 
attended a meeting of the City Council's Ad Hoc Committee on Earthquake 
Recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some lawmakers were receptive to the tax incentive idea, they doubted 
it could be enacted in the current legislative session, which ends Aug. 31. The 
next session begins in January, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like your suggestion," said Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles). "I 
just don't know if we can work quickly enough" to get it approved during this 
session, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) agreed, saying state lawmakers 
may be reluctant to adopt additional quake aid so soon after voters rejected a 
$2-billion quake relief bond act in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll just have to take a look, Mr. Bernson," she told him. "It's going to 
take a yeoman effort." 
</P>
<P>
 In other quake-recovery actions: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business 
Administration extended the deadline for federal quake loan applications from 
Sept. 16 to Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mayor Richard Riordan announced during the ad hoc committee meeting that the 
city will appoint an "ombudsman" to coordinate the various city recovery 
efforts. The various elements of the city's recovery program, such as providing 
housing, debris cleanup and business assistance, are managed by several city 
officials. The ombudsman would keep track of and coordinate all efforts. The 
appointment is likely to be announced by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * A housing and community redevelopment committee recommended Monday that the 
city issue $24-million in bonds to give banks and lending institutions money to 
provide low-interest loans to buyers of apartment buildings damaged in the 
Northridge quake. The rates would range from 4% to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Bernson's incentive proposal, investors in disaster zones statewide 
could depreciate damaged property over seven years instead of the normal 30 
years; receive a 20% one-time tax credit on the purchase price of any damaged 
property and get a 100% tax write-off on the cost of all repairs to damaged 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the federal and local governments cannot meet all recovery costs, 
Bernson said, private sector investment is vital to long-term recovery from 
what is now the nation's most expensive disaster.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking about creating an investment opportunity," he said. "The city 
has done everything it can in the short term. We have come to a wall, and to 
get over that wall we need a boost." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the skepticism that the incentive plan could be adopted soon, Bernson, 
who heads the recovery committee, said he hopes that Rosenthal or others could 
slip provisions for such a plan into existing legislation that is already close 
to adoption. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson said he got the idea for the incentive plan from a federal program 
after World War II that shortened depreciation schedules to spur more housing 
construction. The effort worked then, he said, and should work now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The private sector has the money to help us recover," Bernson told the state 
lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Others attending the meeting were state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) and 
representatives sent by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles), Sen. David Roberti 
(D-Van Nuys), Assemblywoman Barbara Friedman (D-Los Angeles), Assemblywoman 
Marguerite Archie-Hudson (D-Los Angeles) and U.S. Rep. Howard Berman (D-Los 
Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson said he has already suggested his idea to Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif.) for adoption on a nationwide basis.

PROPOSAL WOULD TRANSFORM BLIGHTED BLOCK; SHERMAN OAKS: EMPTY SHOPS COULD BE 
BULLDOZED TO MAKE WAY FOR A THREE-STORY COMPLEX THAT MIXES HOUSING AND RETAIL. 
THE DEAL WOULD END YEARS OF FIGHTING OVER THE SITE, BUT NEIGHBORS STILL HAVE 
OBJECTIONS.

 A long-vacant stretch of shops along Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks could 
be demolished soon and replaced with a senior housing complex as part of a deal 
to end nearly six years of bickering among Los Angeles officials, nearby 
residents and the project's developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, the sagging, boarded-up buildings on the south side of Ventura 
just east of Woodman Avenue would be leveled later this year -- ridding the 
neighborhood of an eyesore that residents complain attracts transients and 
vermin. 
</P>
<P>
 In its place would be built a three-story complex that blends 84 units of 
senior housing with about 3,000 square feet of street-level retail space. The 
complex would be the first "mixed-use" project along Ventura Boulevard and one 
of just a few citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal between the city and developer Jacky Gamliel must still be reviewed 
by the City Council, but Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, who represents the area, 
said he expects a quick approval and predicted that construction could begin in 
the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this means is that, finally, the end of the blight at Woodman and 
Ventura is at hand," Yaroslavsky said. He added that the dispute over the 
project "has been an embarrassment to everyone involved. Every time I drive by 
that block, it's a symbol of how things should not be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Although glad that the abandoned shops may soon be demolished, Richard Close, 
president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., said the new project still is 
not appropriate for the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mixed blessing," he said upon hearing the news Monday. "On one hand, 
we are excited to know the blight that has existed there will soon be gone. On 
the other, we are disappointed that it exceeds two stories." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, when a much larger office building was proposed for the site, 
Close's group has fought to limit the project to two floors. The current 
project would include two floors of housing above street-level shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Once home to an eclectic mix of popular shops -- including the popular Scene 
of the Crime bookstore -- the merchants were abruptly evicted late in 1988 to 
the surprise of neighbors, who wondered what was afoot. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1989, they found out. And they were not pleased. Developer Gamliel proposed 
a three-story, 85,000-square-foot building that included office space and 
stores, but no housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Protests erupted and former L.A. City Councilman Mike Woo, who represented the 
area at the time, blocked the permits to demolish the stores in an attempt to 
force a full-scale environmental review of the project. Gamliel sued but was 
rebuffed in court. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Gamliel asked for an exception to the Ventura Boulevard Specific 
Plan, which was enacted to control growth along the commercial strip between 
Studio City and Woodland Hills. The project would have been inconsistent with 
the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 His request was rejected and in 1991 Gamliel again sued the city, this time 
challenging the Specific Plan and asking for $10 million. As part of the new 
deal, the lawsuit will be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, however, the building is still inconsistent with the Specific 
Plan. "But they like it," said Gamliel's attorney, Ben Reznik, of city 
officials. "That's life." 
</P>
<P>
 While his suit was pending, Gamliel in 1991 scaled back his plans to a larger 
version of what he currently proposes. That plan called for 11,000 square feet 
of retail space and 144 apartments for seniors, but was rescinded a month 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, the shops stood empty. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation heated up again last year when Yaroslavsky asked that the block 
be demolished. Earlier this year, Yaroslavsky said he told Gamliel "to fish or 
cut bait," and negotiations began anew. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal, the city will give Gamliel a low-interest loan of $2.4 
million to provide housing for low- and moderate-income residents. The 
remainder of the $8-million project will be financed privately by Gamliel and 
through a combination of tax credits and bond issues. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the deal, struck late Friday, had yet to reach even the property's 
owner or Gamliel. Property owner Mel Guthman said: "Call us a week from now. 
You want to say the deal has been consummated, but we've not even had a wedding 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 If it is built, the project would be among one of the few mixed-use complexes 
in Los Angeles. Urban planners herald mixed-use projects, which mingle housing 
with shops or offices, as a way to reduce traffic and provide affordable 
housing. They are also viewed as a way to turn around flagging commercial 
strips such as Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this will be a good demonstration project," said attorney Reznik. "If 
people want Ventura Boulevard to not be dying, we need to be a little more 
creative." 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky agreed, saying that if this project is successful, other 
developers may be willing to follow. "It could be a prototype for all over the 
city,' he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Close doubted such projects could ever sprout without significant public 
investment. "Is this a good planning idea on Ventura Boulevard? No," he said. 
"The only potential for it is low-income housing. It won't attract people 
willing to pay the going rate."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; CENTER HELPS THOSE SEEKING CITIZENSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new citizenship center at Los Angeles Mission College is trying to expand 
its clientele, to not only help people from Latin American countries become 
U.S. citizens, but to also help those from Europe, Asia and the Middle East, an 
official with the center said.  
</P>
<P>
 The center, which opened in March, had a lot of response from its ads in 
Spanish-language newspapers and had inquiries from as far away as San Diego, 
said Alma Jimenez, the citizenship coordinator at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the center has helped 200 people file applications for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 To apply for citizenship, one must be at least 18, a legal resident of the 
United States and have a command of English. The center, at the college's 
satellite property in San Fernando, has workers who will help the prospective 
citizens fill out the application forms, learn English and get the fingerprints 
and photographs that are required by immigration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants can also take the required U.S. history exam at the center instead 
of with immigration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 None of those who applied for citizenship through the center have become 
citizens yet. The process takes at least a year, Jimenez said. 
</P>
<P>
 But getting help in applying is often crucial. Many immigrants become confused 
and intimidated by the language on the application, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Legal documents become quite scary to anyone for whom English is a second 
language," she said. "Many times the applicants would want to give up because 
they don't want to bother."  
</P>
<P>
 The citizenship center is at 1300 San Fernando Road. For information, call 
(818) 837-2240 or (818) 837-2241. The center charges $55 for the photographs, 
fingerprints and application. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; BRANCH LIBRARY REOPENS AFTER QUAKE REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Valley Plaza branch library in North Hollywood was the lucky 13th of the 
16 San Fernando Valley libraries to be put back into service after $70,000 in 
quake repairs and improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Valley Plaza officially reopened with new ceiling lights, 
carpeting, interior paint and increased electrical capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really fulfilling to know that the children have a place to come and 
study or read again," said Irene Galvan, senior librarian at Valley Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a benefit to all aspects of the community," Galvan said. She and 
her staff spent a month sorting through 40,000 volumes of books, around 10,000 
of which are no longer usable. Galvan also said that part of the ceiling caved 
in and several computers were damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Over 50 people were present for the ribbon-cutting ceremony, but Galvan 
expressed concern that no one knows that the library has reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 Service hours are Mondays and Tuesdays, 12:30 to 8 p.m., Wednesdays and 
Thursdays, 12:30 to 5 p.m., and Fridays and Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining branch libraries in the Valley that have yet to reopen are 
Granada Hills, Woodland Hills and North Hollywood Regional. Robert Reagan, 
spokesman for the Los Angeles Public Library, said that the libraries each 
sustained at least $200,000 in damage but are all scheduled to open by the end 
of this month. MAKI BECKER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VALLEY EMERGENCY BUS ROUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the duration of the strike, the metropolitan Transportation Authority has 
established emergency service on seven of the San Fernando Valley's busiest 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
 There are fewer buses on those lines, however, and MTA officials cautioned 
passengers to expect to wait twice as long as usual between buses. For example, 
they said, if a bus normally reaches a particular stop every 20 minutes, buses 
on the emergency lines will probably arrive up to 40 minutes apart. 
</P>
<P>
 The buses also run shorter hours, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. only. All buses on the 
Valley routes are free except those on the Van Nuys Boulevard line, which costs 
50 cents. Source: Metropolitan Transportation Authority

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; VIGIL TO BE HELD FOR SLAIN STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago Friday, 15-year-old Taft High School student LaMoun Thames was 
fatally stabbed while waiting for a bus that would return him from football 
practice to his South-Central Los Angeles home. 
</P>
<P>
 As a memorial to LaMoun, Woodland Hills resident Suzanne Lewis, whose daughter 
will be a senior at Taft, is coordinating a candlelight peace vigil at the 
Ralphs market parking lot at Ventura Boulevard and Winnetka Avenue -- the 
location of the murder -- on Saturday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter would have graduated with him this year," said Lewis, who 
anticipates hundreds will attend the vigil. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all too close for me," said Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said she was struck by the irony that LaMoun's parents had sent him to a 
high school in Woodland Hills because they thought he would be safer away from 
South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis anticipates hundreds will attend the vigil. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those in attendance will be actor Tony Danza, who has given $1,000 to 
Lewis to start a college scholarship fund for Taft students. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, two reputed gang members, Oscar Andres Lopez and a 17-year-old youth, 
were charged with murder after a confidential informant overheard them bragging 
about stabbing LaMoun. They are awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis arranged a candlelight vigil just after the stabbing took place, but 
wanted another one to remind the community on the second anniversary of the 
boy's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't want LaMoun to be forgotten," Lewis said. 
</P>

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; CRASH VICTIM'S SON SUPPORTS BILL BY KATZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Rightman would love to be able to undo the events of Jan. 27 -- the 
night his father was killed in an auto accident in which the other driver was 
unlicensed. 
</P>
<P>
 But he knows he can never bring his father back, so he's trying to prevent 
similar tragedies from happening to others. He's a staunch supporter of a 
proposed state law that would allow authorities to seize vehicles operated by 
people who don't have driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system, society does not move fast enough to cure its ills," the North 
Hills resident said. "We're all angry about unlicensed drivers, and yet nothing 
gets done. People have to get killed before something gets done." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, called the Safe Streets Act of 1994, would require anyone caught 
driving without a license on California roads to surrender the vehicle to the 
state. The law would also apply to those caught driving with suspended or 
revoked licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, AB 3148, was introduced by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). It 
was passed in June by the Assembly, but faces stiff opposition in the Senate 
Judiciary Committee, where the bill is scheduled to be heard Aug. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Katz, accompanied by families whose loved ones have been lost or 
injured in accidents involving unlicensed drivers, will host a press conference 
at a police towing garage in Van Nuys to draw attention to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Motor Vehicles estimates that 75% of those whose 
licenses are suspended for driving under the influence continue to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, current laws aren't working and we need to go a step farther and 
crack down on these dangerous drivers," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill has been amended to stipulate that the seized vehicles must be owned 
by the drivers in question. That was done at the behest of opponents on the 
committee who feared it would unfairly penalize vehicle owners who loaned their 
cars. Another proposed amendment would require owners to make sure that only 
licensed drivers use their vehicles, according to Katz. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is plenty of support for it, no question about it, but you've got to be 
very careful about what you are getting yourself into," said state Sen. Cathie 
Wright, (R-Simi Valley).  
</P>
<P>
 Rightman concedes the law is not perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one good loophole, obviously, that needs to be plugged," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the law would help get off the road uninsured and unregistered vehicles, 
whose owners often don't have driver's licenses, said Ed Paull of Chatsworth, 
who lost a daughter in an auto accident involving an unlicensed driver. 
</P>
<P>
 He said police have told him that often when they stop an unlicensed driver, 
they have someone else take the driver home, then impound the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, the very next day, they (the unlicensed drivers) would be going back to 
get their impounded car," Paull said.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law, someone like the driver who killed his daughter "would have 
had his car taken away sooner," Paull said. FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; SALON RAISES $4,000 TO FIGHT CYSTIC 
FIBROSIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't hate Glendale residents because they're beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 They had their hair styled and nails manicured not in pursuit of high fashion, 
but to raise money in the name of a 2 1/2-year-old Burbank girl who has cystic 
fibrosis, the No. 1 genetic killer of children and young adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Becker of Signatures Styling in Glendale partnered with Linda and Kevin 
Muldoon, parents of Madeline, for a 12-hour haircut-a-thon Sunday to raise 
money for the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in Hacienda Heights. Just over $4,000 
was raised thanks to the 150 clients that dropped in at the Signatures Styling 
salon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation divides all donations between research, health 
care and public education for this cureless disease that attacks the 
respiratory and digestive systems of its victims, according to its director of 
development, Mary Schraeger. Currently, researchers are experimenting with gene 
therapy, Schraeger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Muldoon said that she wanted to raise funds for cystic fibrosis 
research, but was searching for a creative way to get her community excited 
about getting involved. "Instead of just writing a personal check, we thought 
of a cut-a-thon," said Muldoon, who contacted Becker about her idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Having gathered 20 stylists for the event, Becker said she was especially 
excited to see the members of her industry come together. "There's no 
competition here. It's all for the same cause," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good cause," said Christina Olesijuk of Glendale, as she had her bangs 
trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker said she also had a client come in to have her hair cut Sunday who had 
come in for an appointment earlier that week. "She said, 'It just grew so much 
in three days,' " Becker chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
 The $4,000 collected through the haircut-a-thon will not go directly toward 
Madeline's bills, but Muldoon said she wants to have another fund-raiser to set 
up a foundation to buy her daughter a $20,000 air machine that insurance will 
not cover. 
</P>
<P>
 At present, Muldoon has to help Madeline clear her lungs of the tar-like mucus 
that builds up and put her on an aerosol machine, a process that takes three 
hours every day. The air machine would cut physical therapy time in half, said 
Muldoon. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; CLUB'S PARKING PROBLEM AT ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles city zoning administrator Monday postponed for two weeks a 
decision on a request by the owner of The Country Club for a liquor license, 
encouraging Councilwoman Laura Chick's office to seek a solution in the 
meantime to the club's parking problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's hearing became primarily a squabble over parking, centered on an 
unusual parking lot agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Country Club owner Tony Longval, who bought the hall at 18415 Sherman Way in 
1991, is seeking a conditional use permit to serve alcohol on the premises. 
</P>
<P>
 Longval has the support of Chick's office, the Los Angeles Police Department 
and the Reseda Chamber of Commerce in his bid for the permit, all saying he has 
gone out of his way to address concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an agreement, both supporters and critics of the request said, 
more than a dozen businesses in the area share a parking lot with 395 spaces. 
The agreement, however, does not appear to provide for business changes that 
increase occupancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this business 28 years, and I've never seen a parking 
arrangement like this," said Associate Zoning Administrator Albert Landini. 
</P>
<P>
 Landini agreed with proponents that "Mr. Longval has established himself and 
his track record in three years here," and emphasized that a series of 
stringent restrictions recommended by the LAPD would likely limit any problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also told neighboring businesses owners the way to handle the parking 
fiasco might be by taking the Country Club to court. ERIC SLATER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; AEROSPACE PLANT NEAR AIRPORT TO CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank will take another economic hit at the end of this summer with the 
closure of the UNC Pacific Airmotive Corp. plant, also known as Station 88, 
situated on Hollywood Way near Burbank Airport.  
</P>
<P>
 On July 8, employees at Station 88 received notice of the planned closure, as 
required by the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure, which will take place no sooner than Sept. 7, will affect about 
60 workers, according to Weldon Walshe, UNC director of human resources. 
</P>
<P>
 The closure is a part of an overall restructuring of UNC, announced by the 
company in late June. The work currently done at Station 88 will be shifted to 
plants in New Jersey and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's driving the closure," said Walshe, "is the aircraft industry. There's 
just not enough business to support all of the repair and overhaul companies."

 PAC, one of the oldest aerospace companies in California, opened its first 
plant in downtown Los Angeles in 1927. The Burbank plant opened in 1948, when 
it became the first union closed-shop plant in the San Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 PAC is an aircraft repair and overhaul company, and has, over the years, been 
involved in many different aspects of repair. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, it repaired engines on both large and small planes and even sold 
parts. During this time, PAC was the biggest overhaul and repair shop in the 
world, employing over 1,500 people.  
</P>
<P>
 Since 1970, however, PAC has been a subsidiary of several different companies, 
and has repeated changed its focus. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that time, "it seems like it's been a constant phase-down," said Ralph 
Baltau, chief shop steward, an employee since 1964 when he was 22. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as 1992, there were 240 production workers at Station 88, but 
difficult times forced cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, 1993, the union began bargaining with the UNC for its new 
contract and was told that the work force had to be cut from 195 to 38 by the 
end of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 The company kept all those that wanted to stay until the end of last year, but 
when work resumed in the new year, there were only about 45 workers remaining.

BOARD OKS AMBITIOUS EDUCATION PROJECT; SCHOOLS: BELMONT LEARNING COMPLEX WOULD 
ELIMINATE BUSING FOR 3,600 STUDENTS. CURRICULUM WOULD BE LINKED TO CAREER 
INTERESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 In the first step toward creating a large complex of schools in one of the Los 
Angeles Unified School District's most crowded areas, the Board of Education on 
Monday approved an ambitious project aimed at providing 16,500 students with 
courses linked to their career interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would be the largest of its kind in the nation and would enable 
about 3,600 students who are bused to less crowded campuses primarily in the 
San Fernando Valley to remain in their Pico-Union, Chinatown and Echo Park 
neighborhoods, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the kids who are on the bus now will have a choice to come home," said 
Dominic Shambra, the district's director of planning and development. "We're 
looking at taking a different instructional approach and using our facilities 
in different ways." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Belmont Learning Complex would involve converting Belmont High into a 
middle school, building a new high school for 5,300 students on 35 acres 
Downtown near Temple Street and Beaudry Avenue, and opening a communications 
and media high school on an existing campus. The district also plans to open a 
so-called Newcomer School designed for immigrant students. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 5 to 1 to move forward on the project. Board member Leticia 
Quezada opposed the project because of its size and cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the district has already acquired the land for the high school, 
officials say they are relying on the state to pay most or all of the 
$110-million price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the project gets funded probably will be determined in November when 
voters decide a school construction bond measure. The district, the largest in 
the state, would receive a large chunk of that money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're betting on the come," Shambra said. "If that bond doesn't pass, nobody 
will build a school in the state." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, district officials said they are forging ahead with their 
ambitious plan to open the schools by July, 1998. "It's on a fast track," 
Shambra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the district does not receive full funding from the state, Shambra 
said the school system has other options. The developer could build and finance 
the project and then the district could later buy it back, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But board members expressed concern that the money might not be available and 
that the project could be derailed. "It's a lot of money and I don't know where 
the millions of dollars are going to come from," Quezada said. "I can't really 
feel confident that we can say the money will come." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The board is expected to vote again in January -- to approve a developer and 
final plans for the high school -- and officials said they would have a better 
idea then of the financial picture. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools would be state-of-the-art campuses with computers in every 
classroom.  
</P>
<P>
 Students would be able to take courses -- and ultimately find internships -- 
in international studies, health and human services, law and government and 
travel and tourism. A so-called Media Academy would be established at the 
existing Downtown Business Magnet, which is next to the district's television 
station offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Quezada said she opposed the size of the proposed high school, saying it is 
too large and would be unfair to teachers and students. 
</P>
<P>
 But board member Vickie Castro, whose district includes most of the Belmont 
complex, said it is imperative that the students have local schools in their 
neighborhoods. "I think it's criminal that we keep so many kids on the buses. . 
. . This is long overdue." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the project was developed by the school district and a large 
community task force that included residents, parents, teachers and 
administrators. Board member Jeff Horton commended the panel for coming up with 
the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The result is way more than I could have imagined," Horton said.

ROBBERS HIT SHOPS, NET LESS THAN $500 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armed robbers held up at least four, and perhaps five, San Fernando Valley 
shops early Monday, shooting a man outside a convenience store, but apparently 
netted comparatively little money for such a widespread series of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the whole crime spree, I don't think they got more than $500," said Mel 
Arnold, a robbery detective in the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys 
division. "That won't even cover their gas money," he quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting victim, whose identity police concealed for his safety, was 
hospitalized in serious but stable condition and was expected to survive, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robberies took place at four 7-Elevens and the same gunmen may also have 
hit a doughnut shop in the 14860 block of Sherman Way about 1:30 a.m., police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 And although police believed all the holdups were the work of the same 
robbers, they were unsure exactly how many there were, saying witness 
descriptions and videotapes by store security cameras appeared to indicate that 
two to four robbers in their teens or early 20s were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The MO and the physical descriptions appear to be the same," said Lt. Dan 
Hoffman of the LAPD's Valley headquarters. "But that is why (detectives) are 
all looking at all the tapes, to see if they are the same or if it is just 
coincidental." 
</P>
<P>
 Devonshire Division robbery Detective Michael Brandt said the gunmen "come in 
in masks, in twos or threes, jump over the counter and take the money trays." 
In most cases, they barked at cashiers to give up their money or they would be 
shot, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives from the Downtown Robbery-Homicide Division and the LAPD's 
Devonshire, West Valley and North Hollywood divisions spent much of the day 
Monday interviewing victims and reviewing videotapes of the bandits retrieved 
from hidden security cameras in all of the convenience stores. But they said 
they have no suspects and no identification on a possible getaway car. 
</P>
<P>
 The bandits apparently struck first at 12:05 a.m. at a 7-Eleven in the 10600 
block of Burbank Boulevard in North Hollywood, taking $85, followed by a 
robbery at a 7-Eleven in the 13700 block of Vanowen Boulevard in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 In North Hollywood, one bandit carried a revolver and the other a shotgun, and 
demanded money not only from the cashiers but customers in the store as well, 
said Lt. Ron LaRue, head of detectives in the North Hollywood Division. 
</P>
<P>
 He said police believe the same men may have held up another convenience store 
on July 30, at 4506 Lankershim Blvd., taking $1,200 from the store and five 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Van Nuys robbery Monday, "two male blacks appeared to be (among) the 
same suspects that hit everybody else," Arnold said. "They got $60 in cold hard 
cash, and that's it." 
</P>
<P>
 About 1:10 a.m., two gunmen were in the process of robbing a 7-Eleven at 10690 
Balboa Avenue in Granada Hills when another robber waiting outside began 
scuffling with a man and then shot him, Brandt said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was undergoing surgery Monday for a chest wound at Holy Cross 
Medical Center in Mission Hills and "should be OK," Brandt said. Police said 
they expected to interview the man today to determine whether he could identify 
the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
 The last of the robberies occurred at 1:50 a.m.

MAN ARRAIGNED IN ABDUCTION OF REAL ESTATE AGENT; JUSTICE: IN FEDERAL COURT, 
MICHIGAN EX-CONVICT ENTERS NOT-GUILTY PLEA TO CHARGE OF KIDNAPING VAL VERDE 
WOMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A Michigan man pleaded not guilty in federal court Monday to kidnaping a Val 
Verde real estate agent at gunpoint and leaving her tied up in an Arizona motel 
room two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, Timothy Daniel Shue, 38, is accused of kidnaping Paula Harrington, 
26, after posing as a prospective customer at the real estate office where she 
worked. He is also a suspect is several similar crimes nationwide, including 
the armed robbery and sexual battery of a Petaluma woman, who identified him 
Friday as her assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue -- dressed in a blue jail uniform -- spoke in a low-pitched monotone, as 
he pleaded not guilty to one charge of kidnaping during his arraignment Monday 
in U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Federal Public Defender Ellen Barry declined to comment on the charge 
against Shue. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue is being held without bail and faces a maximum sentence of life in prison 
without the possibility of parole if convicted. Magistrate Brian Robbins set 
his trial for Sept. 13.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that on June 29 Shue asked Harrington to show him some 
homes in Val Verde, a small community northwest of Santa Clarita. Shue 
reportedly kidnaped her after the pair looked at several homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington was found the morning of July 1 tied up in a motel in Gila Bend, 
Ariz., a small town about 68 miles southwest of Phoenix. Shue was arrested July 
6 in Ogden, Utah, after reportedly displaying a handgun to a topless dancer in 
a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Debra Yang said his actions during the three-day incident 
-- such as allegedly forcing Harrington to withdraw money using her ATM card -- 
left behind a trail of evidence "that we will have to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 Allegations that Shue sexually assaulted Harrington, as well as his previous 
criminal history -- including an armed robbery conviction in Michigan -- could 
extend any sentence he receives, Yang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue is accused of similar crimes in Michigan, Ohio and Oregon and other 
states, with law enforcement agencies in many locations saying they intend to 
pursue charges against him at the conclusion of the federal case, Yang said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent allegations against Shue came Friday when a 20-year-old woman 
said he is the man who robbed her on June 27 at a formal wear store in 
Petaluma. Petaluma police said they believe Shue bound and gagged the woman, 
fondled her and then stole several hundred dollars in cash and property. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue's alleged comments to the woman link him to a series of kidnapings, 
robberies and assaults, FBI and other law enforcement officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Petaluma Police Sgt. Chris Thurman said the FBI told Petaluma police officials 
about Shue on July 12.  
</P>
<P>
 But photos of him were not available for the victim to identify until Thursday 
because there were "so many agencies asking for his fingerprints and photos 
that it took some time," he said.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; EMPOWERMENT ZONE WOULD TAP PACOIMA'S COMMUNITY SPIRIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Timothy Williams, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This fall the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is expected to 
make the final selection of which six urban areas around the country will 
become federal "empowerment zones." 
</P>
<P>
 A 20-square-mile area of Los Angeles -- including a two-square-mile section of 
central Pacoima and parts of Lincoln Heights, Boyle Heights and a strip from 
South-Central Los Angeles to Watts -- is expected to be one of the areas 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacoima area was included in the city's application to HUD not only 
because it is the poorest area in the San Fernando Valley, suffering from a 25% 
to 40% poverty rate and stubborn crime, but also because it is an increasingly 
activist community that has worked closely with local and federal politicians 
for empowerment zone status. 
</P>
<P>
 The six areas around the country that are finally selected by HUD will share 
in up to $100 million each for social service programs. Businesses there will 
be eligible for tax breaks if they hire workers from the neighborhoods or spend 
money to improve their facilities. The tax breaks will also be aimed at 
attracting new businesses to the areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of empowerment zones was originally proposed by the Bush 
Administration to help revitalize sections of Los Angeles after the 1992 riots. 
As the presidential election neared, Bush vetoed a bill to establish them, an 
act that opponents attributed to his fear of being labeled a tax-and-spender. 
</P>
<P>
 After the November, 1992, election, the idea was resuscitated by the Clinton 
Administration, which has made empowerment zones the centerpiece of its urban 
revitalization program. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the program will be effective remains questionable, largely because it 
follows similar efforts -- Urban Renewal and enterprise zones, for example, 
which have received mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City), a leading advocate for a Pacoima 
empowerment zone, talked to Times staff writer Timothy Williams about the 
zones. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What are empowerment zones, and , generally speaking, what is the 
idea behind them?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: An empowerment zone is a discrete geographic area based on 
unemployment and income figures that the federal government has designated for 
special privileges. The idea came from Jack Kemp (HUD secretary during the Bush 
Administration) and was eventually supported by an interesting coalition from 
the left and the right of the political spectrum who believed that providing 
incentives for the private sector was the best way to aid areas suffering from 
crime and poverty. The idea is that if we focus our efforts on a particular 
area, we can bring results which might not happen if the effort was diffused 
over a wide area. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is it important that central Pacoima be included in the city's zone?  
</P>
<P>
 A: With its high poverty and crime rates and a very active citizenship, it 
fits all the criteria. We were fearful in the beginning that Pacoima would be 
left out. I've never been a champion of empowerment zones, but I knew that if 
the San Fernando Valley didn't get one of these areas, there would be a sucking 
sound, and the area might go further downhill. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In the same area as the proposed federal zone in Pacoima, there has been a 
state "enterprise zone" since 1980. It has been criticized for failing to 
attract many new businesses, for failing to generate much interest. How can the 
federal zone avoid the same fate?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The state enterprise zone has been one of the least marketed things in the 
world. In fact, until I read about it in your newspaper awhile ago about how 
poorly it was doing, I had forgotten we had an enterprise zone there. We can do 
better with outreach and by focusing on individuals and specific businesses and 
just by getting the word out. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kinds of federal aid will empowerment zones receive?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Companies in the area will be eligible for employer wage tax credits, 
meaning that any business in the zone will get tax credits for hiring people 
who live in the area. Businesses will also be eligible for tax-exempt facility 
bonds that will allow them to build or renovate a structure. There will also be 
the social service block grant, which provides money for purchasing and 
improving land, job training, transportation to and from work, and loans for 
new businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 While nothing is set yet, in the Pacoima area we plan on working to strengthen 
family support programs -- concentrating on job training, child-care services 
and a gang intervention facet. To help businesses, there will be a business 
incubator training program, which will offer skills training and financial 
management counseling. The city and private corporations in the area will be 
involved in that part of it. There will also be a community development company 
to deal with the loss of jobs and the declining economic base. 
</P>
<P>
 We will also beef up local law enforcement with a cops-on-the-street program. 
There is a lot of potential for growth in that area. The most debilitating 
thing is crime and gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How will HUD choose just six areas, and what are the chances that the L.A. 
bid will be selected as one of the zones?  
</P>
<P>
 A: They will look at the local commitment, what the city and county are doing. 
See, this is a federal-local partnership. It is a bottom-up economic 
development project, so they want to see what the strategy is at the local 
level. Now in terms of being chosen, 77 other areas have applied, so there's a 
lot of competition. I cannot fathom a situation where the Los Angeles area will 
not be selected, given all the L.A. area has been through in the last five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you seeking certain kinds of businesses for central Pacoima? 
Manufacturers, for instance?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The major focus will be on small businesses, but the tax credit could be an 
incentive for medium-sized manufacturers to come in. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Over the past 30 years, we've seen any number of government programs aimed 
at turning impoverished areas around. There's been Urban Renewal, Model Cities, 
the War on Poverty and enterprise zones among others -- each with a mixed 
record at best and a lot of local enmity at worst. How are empowerment zones 
going to be different?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't build any huge amount (of expectations) into the empowerment zone 
alone, but in conjunction with the federal Crime Bill, and by providing seed 
money for defense firms, the empowerment zone in Pacoima will get more 
meaningful, and we can start turning that area around. What's been missing 
before that we have here is the awareness that if you can't make people feel 
safe, you can't convince people to move into an area. That, and the fact that 
we've finally gotten some meaningful tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, we've had a welfare system that provides incentives for not working, 
which has undercut programs in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So if an empowerment zone is not a magic bullet, what other things need to 
happen to pull poor areas out of poverty?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Conversion programs for commercializing defense firms, more cops, revamping 
the welfare system to strengthen the incentive to work, more funding for 
education and training programs, a major expansion of child care so parents can 
take jobs -- especially single parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The most important gulf in America today is between the majority that is 
making it and the underclass that has very little hope of making it in our 
society. They have very little stake in society. There is no opportunity, no 
education. Hopefully, empowerment zones will be something to turn that around. 
</P>
<P>
 The benefit is that this can become a showcase of what can be done in America 
as a whole. In a few years, we might be able to look at the area and answer the 
question "Can you address the chronic problems in this country?'

GIRL HURT BY RUNAWAY CAR IS RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL; ACCIDENT: THREE OF THE FIVE 
CHILDREN INJURED IN THE SATURDAY ACCIDENT REMAIN HOSPITALIZED.

<P>
 One of the five children injured in a bizarre North Hollywood car accident was 
released from Childrens Hospital on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A doctor said she and another girl, brought to the same hospital, are both 
expected to fully recover from their injuries. Two other girls injured were 
recovering at UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, ranging in age from 5 to 10, were injured on Saturday at a home 
in North Hollywood when a 2-year-old boy, alone in a car with the engine 
running, put the car in gear and it ran over them, trapping them underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Challenging earlier reports that the boy had been left in the car unattended, 
the boy's father said Sunday that the toddler climbed into the unattended car 
by himself, locked the doors and moved the shift lever. 
</P>
<P>
 A hospital spokeswoman said that Janette Rodriguez, 10, left Children's 
Hospital on Monday. Her brother, also injured in the accident, had been 
released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Janette suffered multiple cuts and bruises, said Dr. Richard Reynolds, who 
treated her and Valeria Fernandez, 9, the other victim brought to Childrens 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Both girls suffered from hemorrhaging in the upper body caused by the pressure 
from the weight of the car on their midsections. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Valeria suffered a broken collarbone, three broken ribs and a 
broken arm, all on the right side of her body. She also suffered some nerve 
damage in her left hand, Reynolds said. "If all goes well," Reynolds said, 
Valeria could be released from the hospital as early as Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA Medical Center, Guadalupe Rodriguez, 9, and Leslie Vega, 5, the other 
two girls injured in the accident, were in good condition and resting 
comfortably Monday, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie suffered a deep leg cut, and Guadalupe a chest injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Los Angeles Police Department traffic investigators said they 
expect to decide today whether they will seek charges against Estela Lopez, the 
woman who police said left the car's engine running while she left it to look 
for her purse.

 The number of serious crimes reported in the Santa Clarita Valley fell 3% 
during the first half of 1994 compared to the same period last year. But 
violent offenses went up, including a 57% increase in the number of reported 
rapes, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department officials said Monday. 
</P>

 The latest figures indicate that law enforcement officials efforts have 
reduced robberies and burglaries, a major crime worry last year, said Capt. 
Michael Quinn of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station.  
</P>
<P>
 But he said the Northridge earthquake may have also had an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "People may have been at home more . . . and that may have cut down on 
burglaries," he said. "The roads were damaged, and maybe that cut down on bank 
robberies." 
</P>
<P>
 The six-month crime report shows decreases in: 
</P>
<P>
 * Robberies, down to 80 compared to 93 during the first six months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * Burglaries, 547 compared to 578 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thefts, 1,060 compared to 1,127. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto thefts, 290 compared to 292. 
</P>
<P>
 Increases were reported in homicides (three, compared to two last year), 
assaults (460, compared to 433) and rapes (22, compared to 14). 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn said the station is analyzing the rape figures to determine the cause of 
the increase. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita Valley, traditionally considered one of the safest areas in 
the nation, has experienced growing crime during the past two years, including 
a substantial increase in gang activity, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Santa Clarita reported the fifth fewest crimes of any U. S. city with 
100,000 or more residents. But a recent study by Money magazine that divided 
each city's figures by its population determined Santa Clarita's crime rate 
ranked 46th out of 187 cities with 100,000 or more people.

IDB TO MERGE WITH LDDS IN $700-MILLION STOCK SWAP; COMMUNICATIONS: IDB'S MAJOR 
SHAREHOLDERS BLAST THE DEAL, WORTH $9.36 A SHARE AT CURRENT STOCK VALUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ending months of speculation, Culver City-based satellite communications firm 
IDB Communications Group said Monday that it has agreed to be acquired by 
long-distance phone company LDDS Communications in a stock swap worth more than 
$700 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But the merger terms immediately came under fire from some of IDB's big 
shareholders, who have suffered a 50% loss on their stock since IDB clashed 
with its auditors last spring over accounting issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Several institutional holders said LDDS had bid far too low a price, and they 
expressed shock that 38-year-old IDB Chairman Jeffrey Sudikoff has accepted the 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me wonder whether the (IDB) board is truly looking out for the best 
interests of the long-term shareholders," said Rod Linafelter, money manager at 
Denver-based Berger Associates, which owns about 1 million IDB shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareholder opposition raised the possibility that IDB could attract other 
suitors. 
</P>
<P>
 But IDB also announced late Monday that it is restating first-quarter earnings 
to 8 cents a share from 12 cents as a result of the accounting brouhaha and 
that second-quarter results will be break-even at best -- revelations that 
could cool the opposition to the LDDS bid. 
</P>
<P>
 However the IDB saga plays out, Sudikoff's other principal venture -- majority 
ownership of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team -- isn't expected to be 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, Miss.-based LDDS said it will acquire IDB in a tax-free stock 
exchange. At LDDS' current stock price -- $19.50 a share -- the deal would be 
worth $9.36 a share to IDB holders, based on a floating exchange rate: If LDDS 
stock is worth $22 or more when the deal closes, each IDB share will be worth 
0.451 LDDS shares. If LDDS stock is worth $16 or less, IDB holders will get 
0.520 LDDS shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Between $16 and $22 per LDDS share, the exchange ratio moves incrementally. 
</P>
<P>
 IDB stock closed at $9.50 a share Monday on Nasdaq, up 12.5 cents, but the 
deal terms were announced at the market close. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger would join IDB's extensive international long-distance telecom 
network with LDDS' fast-growing domestic long-distance system. 
</P>
<P>
 Both companies have mushroomed via acquisitions in recent years, and both now 
own relatively low-cost communications networks that compete directly with 
telecom giants such as AT&T Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 LDDS had revenue of $1.1 billion in 1993; IDB's totaled $311 million. 
</P>
<P>
 LDDS Chief Bernard Ebbers said IDB will move LDDS closer to being a "major 
player" internationally. IDB, through pacts with more than 200 nations, carries 
phone calls and data worldwide for businesses and governments. 
</P>
<P>
 But while most analysts said they believe IDB and LDDS are a logical pairing 
in the rapidly consolidating communications field, there was widespread anger 
over the proposed purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
 In a conference call with analysts and money managers, Ebbers said he expects 
the addition of IDB will boost LDDS' 1995 earnings per share rather than be 
dilutive. One money manager said LDDS had been expected to earn $1.25 a share 
next year and that with IDB, earnings would be about $1.33. 
</P>
<P>
 But given those estimates, many IDB shareholders said they believed their 
shares were worth a considerable premium to the current price. "The valuation 
being paid by LDDS is very low," said Brian Kelly, a money manager at Invesco 
mutual funds in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 IDB shares traded as high as $20.50 earlier in the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff defended the deal and made clear that IDB's value had been penalized 
by the storm over its accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to believe that we're vastly undervalued," Sudikoff said. But IDB 
has been "short in the management department," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, IDB's auditing firm of Deloitte & Touche abruptly resigned, citing a 
dispute with IDB over its first-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 While IDB initially blamed a personality dispute between Deloitte and IDB 
President Edward Cheramy, IDB's decision Monday to restate its earnings is a 
vindication of sorts for Deloitte and leaves questions about IDB's 
profitability claims in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, IDB also said Monday it is "assessing implementation" of an accounting 
change as to how it counts revenue from incoming calls. The firm said it has 
"not determined the impact of any such change upon its second quarter or its 
1994 results." 
</P>
<P>
 LDDS chief Ebbers sought to assure Wall Street that his firm has studied IDB's 
books and that LDDS' purchase offer reflects "the quality of (IDB's) future 
earnings." 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff said IDB would consider any other offers, but he said other potential 
buyers have already studied IDB, without making bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Sudikoff is expected to become a director of LDDS, but no other title was 
mentioned for him. IDB said it expects its Los Angeles operations, which employ 
150, to remain here.

REPORT SEES SOUTHLAND BOUNCING BACK; ECONOMY: THE SURVEY SAYS THE REGION IS 
POISED FOR A SPURT IN JOBS AND PRODUCTION OVER THE NEXT DECADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Southern California, still struggling to recover from a punishing recession 
and the chronic loss of aerospace jobs, is poised for job and economic growth 
that could outpace the nation through the next decade, according to an economic 
report released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The report by the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the 
California Economy projects that employment in the Los Angeles metropolitan 
area could climb 27.5% between 1993 and 2005. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by increased construction and retail spending in the short term and 
fundamental economic growth in the long term, such growth would amount to 1.78 
million new jobs, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 That would represent the largest expansion in terms of economic production and 
the fastest rate of job growth in the United States, the report says. The 
region includes Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura, San Bernardino, Riverside and 
Imperial counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The projections appear optimistic compared to previous statewide projections, 
including one in June from the UCLA Business Forecasting Project, which 
predicted that the state's non-farm jobs would remain nearly flat in 1994 and 
grow only 1.5% in 1995 and 2.4% in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is whether the historic recession that we hope is over now has 
lasting repercussions for the California and Los Angeles economies," said David 
Hensley, an economist with Salomon Bros. in New York. "My view is that it 
does." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Levy, the center's director and the report's principal author, said 
the long-term projections hinge in part on policy changes that would improve 
the region's education system, upgrade telecommunications and other 
infrastructure and reduce crime and air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opportunities are not automatic," he said. "We're arguing for where the 
policy focus should be." 
</P>
<P>
 The report is one of the first to make a detailed, long-term projection for 
the hard-hit Southern California region. So far, the metropolitan Los Angeles 
area has had the state's largest economic decline, losing 500,000 jobs from 
1990 to 1993, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate report last month, the center predicted that the entire state 
would add 3.7 million jobs between 1993 and 2005, an average gain of 310,000 
jobs a year and an overall increase of 27.2%, outpacing the nation's predicted 
17.5% gain. 
</P>
<P>
 The report's outlook in the near term is also in keeping with recent data 
suggesting that the region is finally pulling out of a prolonged economic 
slump, though aerospace job losses are expected to continue and a round of 
military base closings is in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Dataquick Information Services reported that statewide building 
activity rose in June to its highest level since 1991, with a total of $938 
million provided by lending institutions to construction projects, an increase 
of 32.9% over June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The report reiterates arguments that for the long term, the region's economic 
future will be based on foreign trade, professional services, high-tech 
manufacturing and entertainment and tourism. 
</P>
<P>
 Through 2005, professional services could provide the biggest job growth, with 
306,300 new jobs, the report says. Wholesale trade and transportation could add 
119,900 jobs, and entertainment-tourism could add 137,600. Southland Job Growth 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs in Southern California are expected to increase 27.5% between 1993 and 
2005 to a total of 8.25 million, according to a report by the Center for 
Continuing Study of the California Economy. Job growth and projections for the 
three biggest industry groups, in millions: 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing: 1.05 
</P>
<P>
 Trade: 1.72 
</P>
<P>
 Services: 2.58

U.S.-CANADIAN WHEAT IMPORT LIMIT APPROVED; COMMERCE: THE NEGOTIATORS AVERT A 
TRADE WAR WITH TENTATIVE ONE-YEAR PACT. OFFICIAL CITES CURB AT 1.5 MILLION 
TONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 U.S. and Canadian trade negotiators, averting a potential trade war between 
the world's biggest trading partners, tentatively agreed Monday to limit wheat 
imports from Canada for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said the agreed-to limit will result 
in "a substantial reduction" in imported grain from last year, but he did not 
reveal the limit placed on Canadian farmers. A weather-damaged U.S. harvest and 
a major Canadian sales drive pushed sales of wheat from north of the border to 
about 2.5 million tons in this country last year. 
</P>
<P>
 One official familiar with the agreement said trade negotiators had settled on 
1.5 million tons as the limit on wheat imports this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor said the two governments will establish a joint commission to study 
each nation's marketing systems and subsidies for all grains.  
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the two countries' policies, the commission will recommend 
ways to improve the balance of trade. But neither government will be bound to 
act on advice from the panel, which will be composed of six to 10 private wheat 
industry representatives and trade experts, Kantor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Restricting imports will not result in any appreciable increases in the prices 
of wheat products for consumers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the accord, which requires the approval of both governments, the United 
States will hold off on imposing tariffs on Canadian wheat for 12 months to 
give the commission enough time to make recommendations to the two governments, 
Kantor said. Canada has pledged not to retaliate with trade sanctions of its 
own under a "peace clause" in the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcement of the agreement caps a week of tense negotiations between U.S. 
and Canadian trade officials. Canadian Trade Minister Roy MacLaren met with 
Kantor over the weekend and trade negotiators have made several conference 
calls to hammer out the last-minute accord, U.S. officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both countries had threatened sanctions after the U.S. International Trade 
Commission ruled last month that Canadian imports had flooded the American 
market, forcing U.S. farmers to lower their prices. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. trade negotiators had tried to convince Canada to cap its exports to the 
United States at 1.5 million tons a year, and industry leaders had asked the 
Administration to seek a limit of 500,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials are expected to announce details of the 
accord this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials close to the negotiations said that determining the cap was a 
difficult issue in the talks. But it was even tougher to persuade the Canadian 
government to accept that its support of Canadian farmers "is a problem," one 
U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement reached Monday, neither country has to admit wrongdoing, 
Kantor said. But the joint commission will give trade experts a chance to deal 
with underlying issues in the dispute, including the pricing practices of the 
Canadian Wheat Board, which administers Canada's national monopoly and serves 
as a trade advocate for Canadian farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the accord was mixed among wheat industry leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Rosenthal, an international trade attorney representing U.S. pasta 
producers, said that likely increases in the cost of U.S. and Canadian wheat 
will "put a real squeeze on producers. We're left with no real alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. farm groups praised the agreement as a first step toward establishing a 
fair balance of trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian Embassy spokesman George Rioux said the agreement is "not perfect" 
but "it enables us to move forward and not have to face a trade confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian government officials said they are hoping to negotiate a final limit 
of imports above 1 million tons a year. If there are sticking points in 
negotiating a final agreement, Rioux said, "it will be in the numbers."

MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ: ROLLING RIGHT ALONG; NEWEST TWIST IN SNACKS IS OLD 
FAVORITE, THE PRETZEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE HOROVITZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fact that Paul Newman's face is now smiling from the front of a pretzel 
bag is a sign of just how far the pretzel has come. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, there's dough to be made in pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Newman, whose Newman's Own company recently began marketing "organic" 
pretzels, a slew of marketers -- from tiny start-ups to the snack food giants 
-- have caught pretzelmania. And soft-pretzel franchises, which sell 
fresh-baked pretzels for about $1.50 a pop, are giving Mrs. Fields a run for 
consumer snack dollars at the local malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Even conventional hard pretzels are on a rollicking roll. Frito-Lay has seen 
recent sales of its Rold Gold brand leave corn chips in the snack food dust. 
Eagle Snacks is preparing to get into the swim -- with a new line of pretzel 
bits shaped like seashells and sailboats. And for something special in the air, 
American Airlines recently dumped those tiny bags of nuts in favor of -- you 
guessed it -- tiny bags of pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
 Some snack mavens are even dubbing pretzels the unofficial snack food of the 
'90s. That's because pretzels are generally low in fat (about 1 gram in 10 
pretzels) and potentially high in fun. (Are you ready for the soon-to-be-sold 
hot caramel almond pretzels?) 
</P>
<P>
 "A pretzel is the only snack food that doesn't make you feel guilty after 
you've eaten one," said Paul Rogers, managing editor of the Chicago-based trade 
magazine Snack Food. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless, of course, you start piling on the gloppy stuff. And that's what 
growing numbers of pretzel makers are doing. Hot pretzels now come with dips 
ranging from melted Cheddar cheese to spicy pizza sauce. And hard pretzels are 
being baked with ingredients ranging from honey mustard to garlic and herb 
bits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you start embellishing the pretzel to appeal to the American palate, you 
quickly move out of the healthy snack category," said Judith Ashley, a 
nutrition professor at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 But while many of the newer pretzel treats aren't especially healthy, there is 
one thing that -- for a change -- they are not: boring. 
</P>
<P>
 "The blandness factor has finally been overcome," said Dennis Mitchell, a 
snack food consultant in Duluth, Minn. "It's as if someone pushed all the 
pretzel bakers to open their eyes at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, what is actually pushing the pretzel makers is sales. Pretzel sales 
in the United States topped $1 billion for the first time last year, according 
to the Alexandria, Va.-based Snack Food Assn. And while pretzels accounted for 
only about 2% of all snack foods sold in 1993, the pretzel market is growing at 
a 25% clip.  
</P>
<P>
 "Any snack food company that's not now in the pretzel business is certainly 
thinking about getting into it," said James W. Shufelt, president of the Snack 
Food Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Newman might be slightly ahead of the pretzel curve. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Newman's Own Organics was founded in Aptos, Calif., by the actor's 
daughter, Nell. It is a division of the 12-year-old Newman's Own, which has 
donated more than $56 million to charitable causes. The company began to test 
organic pretzels, which are made without preservatives and from grain free of 
pesticide residues. The pretzels are top sellers in West Coast health food 
stores, and now they're being rolled out nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pretzels are my dad's favorite snack -- next to popcorn," said Nell Newman, 
35, whose picture appears on the pretzel bag along with that of her 70-year-old 
father. "When I was a kid, pretzels were the one thing we were allowed to eat 
before dinner, because Dad ate them too." 
</P>
<P>
 But no one sells more pretzels than Frito-Lay, whose Rold Gold brand recently 
bested Snyder's of Hanover to become the nation's top seller. In February, Rold 
Gold introduced a fat-free pretzel whose sales are growing at twice the pace of 
its other types of pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest problem is figuring out how to make enough pretzels," said Hal 
Oates, Rold Gold product manager. The company recently opened a second plant to 
meet consumer demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Relative newcomer Eagle Snacks, which has the backing of parent 
Anheuser-Busch, now ranks among the nation's top five pretzel makers. 
Executives project that sales could double this year, in part because of newly 
introduced multigrain pretzel bits that have no fat. 
</P>
<P>
 The fastest-growing segment of the pretzel world is the soft side. Several 
soft-pretzel chains say their sales have doubled for each of the past two 
years; more than two dozen such chains have sprung up in less than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 SuperPretzel, the king of frozen soft pretzels, sells about 2 million soft 
pretzels every day, said Michael Karaban, vice president of marketing of J&J 
Snack Foods Corp., the New Jersey company that makes the brand. 
</P>
<P>
 SuperPretzels are sold in the frozen food sections of more than 90% of the 
nation's supermarkets. The company also operates stands at airports and 
stadiums. And some McDonald's franchises on the East Coast recently began to 
sell the brand. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Auntie Anne's. Although it might sound like a mom-and-pop 
operation, the Gap, Pa.-based chain has 240 shops in 30 states -- mostly inside 
malls -- to lure impulsive shoppers. Its Southern California locations include 
Santa Monica Place and Brea Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain expects to open as many as 100 new shops in the next year, said Carl 
Smucker, chief operating officer. Among them: a spot inside the international 
terminal at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, some passengers in the terminal may already be snacking on any of 
the 190,000 bags of pretzels that American Airlines now serves daily on 
flights, estimates Joe Crawley, an airline spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did American change to pretzels? Well, for one thing, pretzels are 
cheaper. But more important, said Crawley, customer surveys revealed that many 
health-conscious people prefer pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't received a single complaint," he said. "Although we do expect to 
hear from some peanut farmers." 
</P>
<P>

 The Santa Monica agency Rubin Postaer & Partners has picked up the $1-million 
ad account for California Pizza Kitchen. . . . The Santa Monica agency 
Kresser/Craig -- which has recently had merger discussions with Stein, Robaire, 
Helm -- has picked up the $3-million ad account for Burbank-based Disney 
Interactive. . . . The Venice office of Chiat/Day has picked up the $5-million 
ad business for Memorex. . . . The Venice agency Ground Zero has picked up the 
ad account for Futurekids, a Los Angeles firm that offers computer classes for 
children. Snack Attack 
</P>
<P>
 Although pretzels accounted for just 2.1% of all snack foods sold last year, 
their overall sales grew nearly 25% in 1993 -- the fastest growth for any major 
snack food category. How product sales stack up in the nation's ever-changing 
snack food market:

 Twentieth Century Fox said Monday that it will build its new 300-employee 
animation film studio in Phoenix after Arizona offered the company about $1 
million in job training funds and low-interest loans to buy state-of-the-art 
digital animation equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision marks the first time one of the big Hollywood studios has located 
a significant operation in Arizona, and it is another reminder that Southern 
California does not have an exclusive franchise on movie-making operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox plans to invest about $100 million in the new subsidiary, Fox Animation 
Studios, which is expected to produce an animated feature every 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Although California was one of five states originally considered for the 
studio, Fox and state officials acknowledged that it stood little chance from 
the start because executives involved in the project wanted to live away from 
Los Angeles and its traffic jams. 
</P>
<P>
 "This wasn't an indictment of the business climate in California, but rather a 
very personal quality-of-life issue for the people involved at the helm of the 
animation operation. California wasn't really in the running," California Film 
Commission Director Patti Archuletta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox President Bill Mechanic said such California cities as San Diego, Santa 
Barbara and San Francisco were considered. He said Fox executives wanted the 
operation close to its Westside studio and concluded that Phoenix, an hour away 
by plane, was close enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox officials also said Phoenix was chosen for "lifestyle reasons" -- namely 
low housing costs and short commute times that they feel will help attract and 
keep workers -- and because Arizona offered a favorable "business climate." 
</P>
<P>
 The final decision came after Fox narrowed the search to Phoenix and Spokane, 
Wash. Texas and New Mexico were considered briefly. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the decision to put the animation operation in Arizona comes as 
industry leader Walt Disney Co. has been rapidly expanding its animation 
operation in Southern California, with plans to consolidate it into a new 
building this fall at its Burbank lot. But even Disney plans to start producing 
some of its full-length animated movies entirely in Florida starting later this 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is forming its animation operation in a deal with longtime animators Don 
Bluth and Gary Goldman, whose films include "An American Tail," "The Land 
Before Time" and "All Dogs Go to Heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox wants to gain a major foothold in animation despite Disney's domination. 
Animation has enjoyed a huge resurgence thanks largely to highly profitable 
Disney films such as "The Lion King" and "Aladdin," the exploding home video 
market and the growing appetite for family films. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona's sweeteners include a $650,000 low-interest loan from the state's 
Commerce and Economic Development Commission over five years to buy the 
animation equipment.  
</P>
<P>
 Another $100,000 in job training funds have been committed, with another 
$200,000 sought subject to funding by the state Legislature. Another $150,000 
in other incentives is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox is expected to invest about $5 million in the Phoenix studio. In addition, 
it plans to spend $1 million to improve a 60,000-square-foot building there.

 Sterling Software to Buy KnowledgeWare: The company said it will pay $135 
million, or about $7.85 a share, for KnowledgeWare Inc. The stock-swap 
transaction settles concerns over the future of once-high-flying KnowledgeWare, 
whose fortunes began to wane in 1991 as its main line of business -- mainframe 
computer software -- started to become obsolete. The merger will expand 
Dallas-based Sterling's product line to include computer-aided software 
engineering products, which enable mainframe and other computers to work 
together. Atlanta-based KnowledgeWare, formed in 1986, has experienced 
difficulties in recent years because companies have been shifting from 
mainframes to networks of personal computers.

 FCC in High-Tech Reorganization: The Federal Communications Commission 
unveiled a reorganization plan, reflecting what experts predict will be 
explosive growth in the wireless communications and international 
telecommunications businesses.FCC Chairman Reed Hundt said two new bureaus will 
be created over the next several months: the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau 
and the International Bureau. Longtime Senate telecommunications aide Regina 
Keeney will become chief of the wireless bureau. Also to be created are an 
Office of Workplace Diversity and a Competition Division, a move drawing upon 
Hundt's desire to expand the FCC oversight to antitrust.

 Pentagon Approves General Dynamics Submarine: The decision means the company's 
Electric Boat Division in Groton, Conn., will have new attack submarines to 
build once it completes work on a second $2.5-billion Navy Seawolf, the company 
said.The project could be worth at least $60 billion to the company, it said. 
There are plans for a third Seawolf, but they are indefinite, officials said. 
The new submarine will be smaller and less expensive than the Seawolf and adept 
at operating close to shore. Planners say near-shore operations will dominate 
future missions. The Navy wants more than 40 of the new submarines, projected 
to cost $1.5 billion each.

PESKY SQUIRREL AGAIN DRIVES NASDAQ NUTS

 For the second time in seven years, a squirrel led to a brief closure of the 
nation's second-largest stock market Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The squirrel is suspected of chewing into power lines near the Nasdaq stock 
market's computer center in Trumbull, Conn., and causing a brief dip in power 
to the computer center, a utility spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nasdaq never lost power completely, automatic systems tried 
unsuccessfully to switch to a standby generator. 
</P>
<P>
 Technicians then started turning over computing chores to a backup in 
Rockville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq stock market closed at 1:17 p.m. EDT and reopened 34 minutes later 
after switching to the backup computer system. In 1987, a squirrel carrying a 
piece of aluminum foil shorted out service to Nasdaq.

 Accounting Firms Limit Liability: Ernst & Young, Coopers & Lybrand and Price 
Waterhouse reorganized their partnerships to give individual partners more 
protection against lawsuits, the accounting firms said.The other three Big Six 
accounting firms -- Arthur Andersen, KPMG Peat Marwick and Deloitte & Touche -- 
said they will probably follow suit within a month or so. Under a form of 
organization called a limited liability partnership, or LLP, only partners who 
are directly involved in wrongdoing would have to tap their personal assets to 
pay judgments. All of the firm's assets would also be vulnerable, but partners 
not involved in the case would have their personal assets shielded.

FIRST PENSION CHAIRMAN, 2 PARTNERS PLEAD GUILTY TO FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The chairman of failed First Pension Corp. of Irvine pleaded guilty in federal 
court Monday -- and later said he felt "incredible remorse" -- to cheating 
investors of $121.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 William E. Cooper showed little emotion during the hearing before U.S. 
District Judge John G. Davies in Los Angeles, but afterward he broke into tears 
in a hallway outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something you can't live with," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel incredibly bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, 50, of Villa Park, and his two longtime business partners, Robert E. 
Lindley, 51, of Laguna Niguel and Valerie Jensen, 47, of San Juan Capistrano 
each entered guilty pleas to two counts of mail fraud in connection with what 
has been described as one of Southern California's longest-running investment 
scams. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were accused of creating a pyramid scheme that bilked many of First 
Pension's 8,000 clients out of $66.7 million in direct investments and $54.8 in 
interest they otherwise would have accrued. Investors were enticed into phony 
second trust deed mortgage funds that the defendants on Monday admitted were 
shams from the start.  
</P>
<P>
 Each of the three faces a prison term of up to 10 years and fines of as much 
as $500,000. Davies scheduled sentencing for the trio for Oct. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The small number of investors who came to watch the proceedings were hardly 
sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see him dragged away in handcuffs," said Joseph Elia, 63, of 
Redondo Beach, who blames Cooper for the $100,000 Elia said he lost through 
First Pension. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper told the judge that he knew by the end of the first year of operation 
in 1983 that he was breaking the law because the losses were so substantial "it 
was clear we had violated laws and were violating laws, and at that point we 
invested in other businesses in an attempt to bring money back into the 
business." Lindley said he was pleading guilty "because I was involved in this 
scheme to hide losses from investors. I'm sorry I did it."  
</P>
<P>
 Jensen told the judge that although she did not initially understand that she 
was participating in illegal doings, she became "swept away by events and 
willingly participated in the acts I've been accused of." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they will continue working with the three to recover lost 
funds.

CITADEL SAYS IT'S LINED UP INVESTORS FOR FIDELITY S&L; BANKING: INVESTORS WOULD 
PAY $108 MILLION FOR STAKE IN THE THRIFT. 
</P>

 Citadel Holding Corp. said Monday that it has lined up several investors to 
buy a combined 80% ownership of its Fidelity Federal Bank subsidiary in order 
to give the thrift a badly needed cash infusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity Federal would receive $108 million from the investors, whom a 
spokesman declined to identify until the deal is completed.The deal is 
scheduled to close Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The equity sale is part of a previously announced restructuring of the 
Glendale-based thrift, which Citadel is, in effect, spinning off to raise cash 
that can help Fidelity Federal stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Fidelity Federal has been battered in recent years by bad real estate loans 
and was under pressure from federal regulators to quickly raise cash. The 
thrift lost $67 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's restructuring also calls for Fidelity Federal to sell nine of 
its 42 branch offices and to dispose of $465 million of its problem assets in a 
so-called bulk sale. Citadel said it has reached agreements with unidentified 
investors for those transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Citadel itself plans to buy four properties in the bulk sale for about $20 
million and to become a real estate management company after Fidelity Federal 
is spun off, said Richard M. Greenwood, Fidelity Federal's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 If the restructuring closes Thursday as planned, Citadel will report a 
second-quarter loss of about $92 million, which would include a $57-million 
write-off related to the assets being shed in the bulk sale. If the sale falls 
through, Citadel said, its second-quarter loss will be about $32 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Citadel's common stock gained 12.5 cents to $5.875 a share in American Stock 
Exchange trading Monday.

U.S. ECONOMIC INDICATORS INCH UP IN JUNE; GROWTH: INDUSTRIAL INDEX HITS A 
SIX-YEAR HIGH, BUT OTHER MEASURES LAG.

<P>
 A key barometer of manufacturing activity edged up to its highest level in six 
years, but other economic indicators -- including income growth, consumer 
spending and construction outlays -- were weaker than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Assn. of Purchasing Management said Monday that its industrial 
index hit 57.8 in July, the highest since July, 1988. But analysts noted that 
the increase, based on a nationwide survey of 300 industrial companies, was 
only marginally changed from 57.5 in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purchasing managers index continues to indicate that industrial activity 
is rising at a healthy pace but not accelerating," said economist Bruce 
Steinberg of Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department reported Monday that personal income growth slowed to 
0.1% in June, though it was the fifth straight advance, including a 0.4% 
increase in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The department also said consumer spending rose 0.4% for a second consecutive 
month, but analysts attributed much of that growth to the blast of air 
conditioners. They had expected spending to advance 0.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 "This morning's statistics on personal income and consumer spending were 
weaker than anticipated and confirmed the slowdown in income and spending that 
took place during the second quarter," said economist Marilyn Schaja of 
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In another report, the Commerce Department said construction spending inched 
up 0.2%, held in check by the first decline in single-family outlays in 14 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 In its report on incomes and spending, the government said personal income 
rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $5.664 trillion in June from 
$5.659 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer spending, which makes up two-thirds of the nation's economic 
activity, totaled $4.602 trillion, up from $4.586 billion in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Disposable income -- income after taxes -- rose 0.1% in June after a 1% 
increase in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Wages and salaries increased $3.2 billion in June, much less than the May gain 
of $19.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending on long-lasting items such as cars and appliances slipped 0.3% in 
June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $578.6 billion. Spending on 
non-durable goods such as food and fuel inched up 0.2% to $1.379 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
 But spending on services, including electricity for air conditioning, was up 
0.6% to $2.645 trillion. Personal Income and Spending

 Abbey Fires Executives: The company said it has fired several executives who 
were part of former President Victor M.G. Chaltiel's management team.Abbey 
Healthcare Group Inc., a Costa Mesa nursing home operator, would not identify 
the executives, but analysts said they are probably people in financial 
management posts within Abbey and its Total Pharmaceutical Care subsidiary. 
Chaltiel was head of Torrance-based Total Pharmaceutical when it was acquired 
by Abbey last year. He became Abbey's president as part of the deal.

JURY ORDERS NINTENDO TO PAY $208.3 MILLION IN PATENT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what could prove a punishing courtroom defeat for a company renowned for 
using the legal system to its advantage, a federal jury Monday ordered Nintendo 
of America to pay $208.3 million to a bankrupt computer company for patent 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
 In an earlier phase of the trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the jury 
found video game maker Nintendo guilty of "willful infringement" on the patents 
of Alpex Computer Corp., a Connecticut firm that went bankrupt in 1983. The 
firm's trustees filed the lawsuit in 1986, and any award would go to Alpex's 
creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Redmond, Wash.-based Nintendo immediately denounced the judgment as 
"outrageous" and said it would ask U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood to throw out 
the damage award. If that doesn't succeed, the company will appeal the verdict, 
Nintendo general counsel Lynn Hvalsoe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are confident we will once again prevail," Hvalsoe said. "We have no 
intention of paying a dime. We won't be held for ransom based on patents we 
have evaluated and determined are nonsense." 
</P>
<P>
 Other video game makers, including Sega Enterprises and Atari, have already 
settled with Alpex. The patent, which expired in May, is for video game 
consoles with removable cartridges that attach to television sets and control 
moving figures on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Nintendo argued that the patent was outdated and could not be used to create 
the complex video games that are the key to its success. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling may fuel fears in Japan that America's jury system is incapable of 
handling tough technical issues and is often biased against large Japanese 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, when an American jury ordered Minolta to pay Honeywell $96 
million for infringing the company's patents, Japanese analysts blamed the jury 
awards on anti-Japanese sentiment in America and predicted a surge in new court 
cases as Japanese-American competition in high-tech heated up. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Japanese executives urged their cohorts to fight lawsuits rather than 
boosting Japanese corporations' reputation as litigation-shy companies that 
could always be persuaded to settle. 
</P>
<P>
 Hvalsoe of Nintendo said the jury came to its verdict in the Alpex case in 
just five hours, following a four-week trial and the receipt of complex 
instructions from the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of outrageous verdict presents an image of bias against foreigners 
or large companies," she said. "There is a serious issue of whether a jury 
trial is the appropriate way" of handling patent disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpex, which is now in liquidation, sought $416 million in damages, or 12% of 
Nintendo's revenues on systems and cartridges sold between 1985 and 1992 that 
infringed the patents. Nintendo itself has been the subject of criticism by 
competitors, which have argued that the company cleverly used American courts 
to enforce its near-monopoly control over the game business during the late 
1980s and extract high license fees from game developers. Those fees helped 
drive game developers to create games for Nintendo's rival Sega. 
</P>
<P>
 Nintendo's court defeat comes just as its competitors are starting to gain the 
upper hand in the market. Sega now outsells Nintendo in the most critical 
segment of the game business, and Nintendo's profit is plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Nintendo has launched a desperate marketing campaign in an effort to pull out 
of its slump. The company, which had previously taken a strong stance against 
the use of sex and violence in video games and poked fun at Sega for becoming a 
target of congressional hearings, recently reversed course to allow more 
violence in games used with its machines.

CARTER-WALLACE ISSUES EPILEPSY DRUG WARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Drug maker Carter-Wallace Inc. told doctors Monday to take their patients off 
the epilepsy drug Felbatol after two people who took it died from a serious 
form of anemia, a development that led to the company's stock losing a third of 
its value. 
</P>
<P>
 The Food and Drug Administration and the company said 10 patients contracted a 
rare and frequently fatal affliction called aplastic anemia, in which the bone 
marrow stops making blood cells. Nine of the 10 were in the United States and 
two died, the FDA said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares in New York-based Carter-Wallace dropped $4.875, or 31%, to $10.75 on 
the New York Stock Exchange on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Felbatol was introduced in September, the first new drug to help prevent 
epileptic seizures in 15 years. About 100,000 of the 2.5 million epileptics in 
this country use it, officials at the Epilepsy Foundation of America said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter-Wallace said it has sent a letter to about 240,000 doctors recommending 
immediate withdrawal of the drug unless the doctor feels that not using the 
drug would pose a more serious risk to the patient. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA and the company urged patients against halting their use of the drug 
unless their doctor tells them to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors generally discourage sudden withdrawal from anti-epileptic drugs 
because of the chance that the frequency of seizures will increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "We strongly recommend that patients consult their physician as soon as 
possible, but it is critical that they not discontinue the drug on their own 
due to the risk of seizures," FDA Commissioner David Kessler said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter-Wallace will "convene a panel of experts to discuss the entire subject 
in the near future," said Lois Brown, a spokeswoman for the company. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the company is not recalling the drug, whose chemical name is 
felbamate. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second time this year that the company has had trouble with one of 
its popular products. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Carter-Wallace said it would stop selling its cough and cold medicine 
Organidine, after the FDA found that it produced cancer in rats, said Arvind 
Desai, an analyst with Mehta & Isaly in New York.

FIXATIONS: THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KEN; COLLECTOR FROM ORANGE HAS ALMOST 300 
BARBIE DOLLS. AND, DID WE MENTION HE WANTS TO BE BURIED WITH HIS FAVORITE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hi, my name is Jim and I have played with Barbie dolls. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel better now, having got that off my manly chest. As is probably the case 
with most of the males out there, it's not too difficult a thing to own up to, 
since I was chiefly doing gross guy things with the dolls.  
</P>
<P>
 Namely, while our sisters may have been playing "Barbie Goes Shopping" or 
"Roman Holiday Barbie" with their dolls, most of us guys were playing "Hershey 
Syrup Barbie Meets Fang the Dog," "Barbie's Nudist Camp" and "Barbie Gets a 
Haircut With Toenail Clippers." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Osborne, however, is a braver sort. He loves his Barbie dolls, and 
doesn't hide the fact. The 24-year-old washes their hair with shampoo and gives 
them little perms. He's taken a three-foot tall My Size Barbie to work with him 
on the bus. On his phone machine he has animated conversations with his Talking 
Barbie. He has hundreds of America's favorite doll in his small apartment. He 
even has once been mistaken for her, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd gone to a Toys R Us store here," he said in a breathless voice. "I had on 
a leather motorcycle jacket that was kind of a salmon pink color and at the 
time my hair was very blond. I walked in and this little kid screamed and said, 
'Mommy, look! It's Barbie!' It was the funniest thing. I thought I was going to 
die. The poor woman was mortified, so I turned around and said, 'Don't worry 
about it, happens all the time,' and just went off to the Barbie aisle." 
</P>
<P>
 When he started collecting the dolls 13 years ago, Osborne believes he was one 
of the first serious male collectors. Since then it has become a more 
acceptable hobby for men, and concurrently a higher-stakes game, with a mint 
1959 Barbie in the original box going for up to $5,000. In 1992 the collection 
of one San Diego collector Osborne knows was stolen and later retrieved by 
police. It's value: $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne's collection is far more modest, but substantial enough to be pretty 
scary. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're getting to know someone, it's not like one of those real casual 
things where you mention, 'Oh, by the way, I have a dog.' It's, 'By the way, I 
have 200 Barbies in my living room. I hope you like pink,' he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the standard Barbie and her nearly countless variations and 
outfits, Osborne specializes in collecting samples and prototypes, some of 
which are justifiably one-of-a-kind. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is one with silver-and-black Emmylou Harris hair, except a chemical 
process makes Barbie's silver strands turn lavender in the sunlight. Another 
has Raggedy Ann-like hair of pink yarn, while a half-finished Ken doll that 
only has a burr of hair going around the side of his head was dubbed the "Male 
Pattern Baldness Ken" by Osborne. Some of the differences are ones only a true 
fan would note, such as a Totally Hair Barbie prototype where the hair is 
center-parted instead of being in bangs.  
</P>
<P>
 "And this is the one I want to be buried with," Osborne said, pointing out a 
striking prototype My Size Barbie with brown skin, blue eyes and platinum hair. 
He refers to the doll as Ru-Paul Barbie, or Ru-Barbie for short.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what they were thinking when they did this, but it's really 
great. I like collecting the samples and prototypes because they can be so 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 So, does he spend his weekends rooting through Mattel's Dumpsters or what? 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually I do not, because they have video cameras," he said. "I do have 
friends who worked there and some who still do, and they get me stuff. And then 
some of it, like Ru-Barbie, I've found at auctions and doll shows." 
</P>
<P>
 It was from his Mattel sources that he got some eerie featureless Barbies, 
which never had lips or eyes painted on, and a hairless version of Barbie's 
sister Skipper, not to mention rows of heads mounted on a dowel rack, like 
little victims of Vlad the Impaler.  
</P>
<P>
 Osborne said, "A friend of mine actually had to leave here, he was so freaked 
out by them, saying, 'That's not the way Barbie's supposed to be!' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There has been some ruckus in recent years over just what the doll is supposed 
to be. In 1992, for example, a group of women educators complained that a 
Talking Barbie that declared "Math class is tough!" could condition girls to do 
poorly in math.  
</P>
<P>
 In her 35 years, the doll has been branded a symbol of consumerism, a tool of 
male domination, the wasp-waisted source of eating disorders, a bimbo and 
worse, but Osborne won't hear anything of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, math was tough for me too. I got in a discussion on the way to work 
just this morning with someone who said (Barbie) represents everything that's 
wrong with America, because she's a clothes-horse and blond and empty-headed. 
Barbie isn't just this blonde: I have Hispanic Barbies, Hawaiian Barbies, Asian 
Barbies, African Barbies. One thing I wanted to do with my collection is show 
that she's everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "And she also teaches girls that they can be a doctor, a police officer, a 
rock star, a Rockette, an astronaut, whatever they want to be. Barbie was the 
first woman in space, years before Sally Ride went there. She's always been a 
positive role model and that's what she's been to me," Osborne said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He says he doesn't know why other men collect Barbies, but for him it goes 
back to childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had always liked fashion, always liked doing hair. When people asked what I 
wanted to be when I grew up, I said I wanted to be a hairdresser and president 
of Mattel -- I do own stock in it now. I used to play with my sisters' Barbies 
and then kind of grew out of it. But my parents collected antiques, and I'd go 
to auctions and garage sales with them. At a doll auction my parents let me buy 
a 30-gallon trash can that was full of Barbie stuff. That was 13 years ago, and 
here we are now." 
</P>
<P>
 At one time he owned as many as 500 Barbies. Now he's down to under 300, he 
thinks. He also has store displays and Barbie yachts, cars (including a Jaguar 
and '57 Chevy), townhomes and even a European-issue cappuccino bar in which the 
cups turn brown when you pour cold water into them. 
</P>
<P>
 He's gone to Barbie conventions as far away as Oklahoma City, and hopes to 
attend a huge confab to be held at Disney World in Florida in September. He 
says the best times of his life have been Barbie times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been really good to me. I've met a lot of great people. It made me into 
a good adult: It taught me the value of money, taught me that you can't always 
have everything you want and you have to make choices." 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents worry that their children will grow up confused about their 
gender roles if allowed to play with toys intended for the other gender, but 
Osborne countered, "My parents let me have Barbies and I turned out fine. I'm 
100% man. So I think that's a bunch of bull. I don't think that if you give a 
boy a doll or a girl a Tonka truck it automatically will make the kid confused. 
I think it's the other way around. I've met people my age who did not have 
Barbies and they're a little strange." 
</P>
<P>
 He said there is still a stigma attached to men collecting dolls. "But I just 
ignore it. If people want to talk or assume things about me, I figure, fine, 
let them. I have much more better things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Like washing Barbie's hair in the sink, for instance. He uses regular shampoo. 
"I figure if it's good enough to use on my hair, it's good enough to use on 
Barbie's" he said. He once dressed as her for a Halloween party, recalling, "I 
looked pretty darn snappy, if I do say so myself." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's all in good fun, he insisted."It's not like I'm obsessed with this. I'm 
not trying to get plastic surgery so I can look like Ken, or Barbie. I have 
friends. I have a life. I have a job. I have a family. I don't just sit around 
going, 'What can I put Barbie in today?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his Barbies stay in their boxes, to preserve their mint condition. 
Some, such as certain models costumed by designer Bob Mackie that originally 
sold for $109, have jumped to $550 or more in value over four years.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there are Osborne's more routine play-with dolls, whose outfits he 
changes monthly. He says Barbie is always changing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barbie has always represented her times, as in the late '60s when a more 
young, fresh look with more natural makeup came in. Mattel redid Barbie then, 
giving her a younger face, then twistable legs. She's reflected the times. When 
you were go-go dancing, she was go-go dancing. Whatever America was doing, she 
was doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne conceded that having a house overrun with America's favorite teen-age 
fashion model could be a barrier to finding a mate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barbie doesn't spend a lot of time in the bathroom, so that's one good 
thing," he maintained. "But it does kind of freak people out when they walk in 
and the first thing they see are four three-foot tall dolls with their arms 
outstretched like they're going to haul you off into the bedroom and beat you 
up or something. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fortunately have met people who thought Barbie was great. I have friends 
who have had rocky relationships with people because they did not like Barbie. 
To have Barbie be such a wedge in a relationship is really bad. It's only an 11 
1/2-inch piece of plastic; how far can this go? Then, of course, I'm sitting 
here in my living room with 200 dolls, so it can go a ways." 
</P>
<P>
 And if it came down to a choice between giving up the Barbies or the person?  
</P>
<P>
 "It depends on the person, but probably the person." 
</P>
<P>
 How lonely could you get, after all, when, as Osborne noted, "There's a 
Talking Barbie that says, 'You look terrific! ' I'd like to hear that every 
morning."

HEALTHWATCH: BODY WATCH; 'SAFE RETURN' REGISTERS ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
Compiled by C.A. Wedlan from wire service reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Families of Alzheimer's patients worry about them becoming lost because they 
can't remember who they are or where they live. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's Safe Return, a nationwide computerized registry compiled by the 
Alzheimer's Assn. and funded by a grant from the Justice Department. The 
program works with the National Crime Information Center database to identify 
and return missing persons. 
</P>
<P>
 For a onetime $25 fee, the patient's name is entered into a national database 
in Washington, and the patient is assigned an ID bracelet or necklace with a 
toll-free number and other identifying material. 
</P>
<P>
 To register, call the Alzheimer's Assn. at (213) 938-3379 or (800) 272-3900. 
Traumatic Shock Sufferers Need to Be Kept Still, Warm 
</P>
<P>
 Traumatic shock, brought on by a serious injury, can be life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 Shock occurs when the heart reacts to an injury by reducing the output of 
blood, causing insufficient oxygen supply to the tissues. Symptoms include 
disorientation; cold and clammy skin; a faint, rapid pulse; sweating; nausea, 
and vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep the injured person lying quietly on his or her back, and loosen tight 
clothing to help blood circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover the patient with a blanket to preserve body heat. Moisten the victim's 
lips, but give nothing to drink or eat. If the patient needs to vomit, roll him 
on his side to avoid choking. 
</P>
<P>
 A traumatized person may appear all right but could still be in danger of 
shock -- medical attention is needed. Queasy Ocean Travelers Are in Good 
Company 
</P>
<P>
 If the very thought of a cruise makes you want to throw up, it may comfort you 
to know that one of every 30 travelers suffers from motion sickness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sense motion in a gyroscope-like part of the inner ear, in three coiled 
tubes partially filled with liquid," says Dr. John Ho of Cornell Medical 
College. "Tiny hairs in the tubes sense when the liquid moves and inform the 
brain." 
</P>
<P>
 If the eyes don't see anything moving, the brain can become confused. The 
result can be nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, headaches, exhaustion 
and depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk to your doctor about medication, including patches worn behind the ear. 
Try acupressure bands. 
</P>
<P>
 Start remedies before traveling so they'll be effective by departure time. 
Avoid heavy meals before and during a trip.

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; BLACK AND WHITE PARTY IS NO GRAY AFFAIR; PARTY-GOERS 
FIND CREATIVE WAYS TO STAND OUT AT NEWPORT HARBOR ART MUSEUM BENEFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 More than 1,000 party-goers who attended the Newport Harbor Art Museum's 
fourth annual Black and White Bash on Saturday proved that clothes don't have 
to be colorful to be creative. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone followed the black-and-white only dress code for the outdoor 
dinner-dance at the Neiman Marcus courtyard in Fashion Island Newport Beach. 
The bash is one of the social scene's better bargains. For $50 a person, guests 
enjoyed live music and a buffet dinner provided by 18 local restaurants, and 
still raised about $40,000 in net proceeds for the Newport Beach museum. True 
Colors 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually I can't get my friends to come to an event for love or money. This 
one, they come. It's a hoot," said Susan Porter, event chairwoman. "The best 
part is seeing what people wear. We're talking really creative black and 
white." 
</P>
<P>
 When first held four years ago, many people didn't understand the black and 
white concept, she said. Many mistook the bash for a black-tie gala, and only 
half showed up in black and white. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, all but a couple of holdouts followed the museum's fashion credo 
that anything goes, as long as it isn't in color. The black-and-white styles 
ranged from shorts and T-shirts to velvet gowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of fun being restricted in your colors," said Sheri Newcomer, who 
chose a slinky black dress and matching gloves for the occasion. "It forces you 
to be creative." 
</P>
<P>
 Robyn and Erika Ray looked like karate kids in contrasting black and white 
gees (those traditional workout robes worn in martial arts). Party-goer Marsha 
Marengo was a fuss of polka dots and stripes, wearing a strapless cocktail 
dress with a short ruffled skirt and black and white striped gloves. Kristine 
Thomas looked like a naughty schoolgirl in a short black skirt, matching vest, 
beret and knee socks. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no rhyme or rhythm" to the ensemble, Thomas said. Black and White 
All Over 
</P>
<P>
 Guests spent the evening eyeballing each other's outfits while visiting food 
stations set up all along the courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Kang, menu coordinator and owner of Five Feet in Laguna Beach, 
encouraged chefs to prepare black and white specialties. Among the offerings: 
ebony pasta with calamari dressing from Farmers Market in Fashion Island; 
chilled black bean soup with white bean salsa and black and white tortellini 
with Chinese black bean vinaigrette from Five Feet; flourless chocolate cake 
from Antoine at Le Meridien, and Tutto Mare's Italian pastry rolled with 
chocolate and creme. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the night models posed in the latest black and white styles from I. 
Magnin and jugglers in black and white face makeup strolled through the crowd 
performing tricks. Dancing to live music by Stonebridge rounded out the 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds will benefit the museum's exhibition and education programs. Big 
changes are in store for the museum in the coming year, said Joan Beall, 
president of the museum board of trustees. The museum will double in size by 
moving its administrative offices and classrooms into the recently vacated 
library next door, giving more space to the permanent and traveling exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 Faces in the crowd included Gene White, event chairman, who sported black 
shorts and a white shirt; Michael Botwinick, museum director; Darren Calkins; 
Chris Collett; Bev Diamond; Alison Frenzel; Bill Griffin; Jan and Annette 
Harzan; Carl and Pat Neisser; Tom and Marilyn Nielsen; Michael Porter and Lorie 
Dewhirst Porter; Harold and Sandy Price; Jim and Joanne Rollans; Robert and 
Margaret Sprague; Jennifer Van Bergh, and Ernesto and Socorro Vasquez. KATHRYN

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; A RACE TO THE FINISH AT CALUMET FARMS; WILD RIDE: THE 
RISE AND TRAGIC FALL OF CALUMET FARM INC., AMERICA'S PREMIER RACING DYNASTY BY 
ANN HAGEDORN AUERBACH ; HENRY HOLT $22.50, 384 PAGES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Lucille Parker Wright Markey died in 1982, she was eulogized as "the 
Grande Dame of Racing," the woman who for decades had presided over the 
country's premiere racehorse stable, Calumet Farm. She was the last of her 
kind, people said: old-fashioned, determined to raise her own thoroughbreds, 
committed to racing less for the social whirl and financial gain than the love 
of horses -- particularly Calumet's prized stallion Alydar -- and the desire to 
excel. 
</P>
<P>
 Markey left most of her $300-million estate to charity, but the sturdy, 
debt-free Kentucky farm remained in the hands of the founding Wright family, to 
be run by J.T. Lundy, the son of a sharecropper who had married one of Markey's 
granddaughters. Ten years later, Calumet Farm was bankrupt, listing debts of 
more than $167 million. Something like $100 million was missing -- and so was 
Lundy, who had almost single-handedly destroyed not only the farm but the 
Wright family fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Today most Wright family members live in Florida, debt-ridden tax refugees 
attempting to protect their remaining assets from the creditors pursuing them, 
thanks to their former in-law. Lundy is also reported to live in Florida these 
days, and like some of the Wrights, he too has declared personal bankruptcy.  
</P>
<P>
 It might seem, at first glance, that by pillaging the Wright estate Lundy has 
succeeded in bringing the family down to his level, but that's probably not the 
case: Rumors persist that Lundy -- unlike the trusting, naive Wrights -- is 
still rich, having socked away some ill-gotten Calumet millions well beyond the 
reach of U.S. law. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall of Calumet Farms is a dramatic story, and in "Wild Ride" former Wall 
Street Journal reporter Ann Hagedorn Auerbach tells it exceptionally well.  
</P>
<P>
 Race fans will love the book, of course, but so will anyone interested in 
recent cultural history, for "Wild Ride" is as much about 1980s greed as it is 
about horses. In a different decade, Lundy might have enjoyed a rags-to-riches 
life, complete with happy ending; a smart man with good horse sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Lundy was not necessarily the wrong man to run Calumet. Once in charge, 
however, it's clear that he lost all perspective, becoming less interested in 
breeding horses and winning races than in the addictions of the era -- power, 
money and deal-making.  
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, Lundy modernized Calumet, but he was soon spending money as if 
there were no tomorrow, buying private jets, staying in the best hotels, eating 
in the most expensive restaurants, and always paying the tab for his friends 
and associates -- with the farm's money, of course. Auerbach doesn't spend much 
time unearthing Lundy's motivations, but it's a sure bet that revenge was on 
his mind: You get the feeling that Lundy end-ran the legal trust that 
supposedly ran Calumet in part to embarrass the Wrights and began associating 
with convicted felons in part to shock local bluebloods. And at some level, who 
could blame him? When Lundy began running Calumet, the Kentucky gentry could be 
heard saying, cruelly: "He's drinking champagne, but he can't spell it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also true that money, for many people, was easy to come by in the 1980s. 
The horse business, being a glamour play, boomed during the decade, drawing all 
kinds of money from Wall Street, Texas, Japan, South America and the Middle 
East.  
</P>
<P>
 With Lundy, however, money in was inevitably money out: Suffering from 
advanced deal-itis and staggering lines of credit, he arranged breeding, 
purchasing and sales agreements that leveraged Calumet up to its devil's-red 
eaves. 
</P>
<P>
 On the plus side of the equation, he sold breeding rights to Alydar, the 
farm's principal asset, for millions of dollars, and often produced winners; on 
the minus side, he gave away or pre-sold those same extremely valuable rights 
to friends and associates, hyped auction prices to keep the thoroughbred market 
artificially high, and occasionally paid outrageous sums for horses -- such as 
$25 million for half-ownership of Secreto, the winner of 1984's Epsom Derby. No 
wonder the cost of operating Calumet soared from perhaps $2 million annually to 
$12 million during the Lundy era. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only a matter of time before the house of cards collapsed. The 
triggering event was Alydar's death in 1990, which Auerbach suggests -- mildly 
-- may have been deliberately orchestrated to allow Calumet to collect on the 
horse's $36.5-million insurance. There's little evidence for that theory, 
however, and in any case farm management went to heroic efforts to keep Alydar 
alive -- although it is true, as only Lundy and a few other people knew at the 
time, that with most of his breeding seasons pre-sold, Alydar was probably 
worth more dead than alive. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alydar's death aside, "Wild Ride" is told with care and circumspection, 
Auerbach setting out the evidence in a way that permits readers to decide for 
themselves whether Lundy is indeed a scoundrel (yes) and whether most of the 
Wrights were extraordinarily credulous (ditto). 
</P>
<P>
 One irony that Auerbach doesn't stress is the ways in which Lundy's tale 
mirrors that of the Wright dynasty's founder. William Wright became rich in the 
Roaring Twenties, just as Lundy became rich during the 1980s Bluegrass Bubble. 
William Wright didn't exactly earn his money in an upright manner, the Federal 
Trade Commission determining in 1927 that his claims for his baking powder were 
deceptive.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Lundy, however, the elder Wright knew when to quit. He sold the Calumet 
Co. for $32 million to the future General Foods months before the Great Crash 
of 1929 and used the money to begin turning Calumet Farm into the respectable 
operation that his great-grandson-in-law would eventually shatter.

PAVING THE WAY FOR NEW SERVICES; PAC BELL MUST WIN FCC APPROVAL BEFORE 
IMPLEMENTING ITS PLAN TO PROVIDE CABLE, INTERACTIVE VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacific Bell's announcement last November that it planned to spend $16 billion 
over seven years resurfacing its network in California for information highway 
services was hailed by many as one of the most ambitious and farsighted plans 
by any local phone company. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months later, Pac Bell is busy implementing that plan with its technology 
partner, AT&T. It includes upgrading its old twisted copper wire network to a 
hybrid system of high-speed fiber-optic and coaxial lines, the latter being the 
kind used by cable companies to deliver video. The Reseda area is one of four 
hubs throughout the state that are starting points for this new network. 
</P>
<P>
 Pac Bell hopes that by October it can offer the first Reseda residents cable 
television, to be followed by a host of interactive services including movies 
on demand, home shopping, video research libraries and video games. "There's a 
lot of excitement in our business," said Patrick McChesney, who is heading up 
installation of Pac Bell's network in Los Angeles. "We've got crews out in the 
field today actually building the network." 
</P>
<P>
 And on Thursday, Pac Bell and its San Francisco-based parent, Pacific Telesis 
Group, announced its first deal with a video programming provider. Texas cable 
executive Ron Dorchester and his Anchor Pacific Corp. have agreed to secure 
programming for 35 Pac Bell cable TV channels, and for another 12 to 15 
channels to be reserved for broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
 There's just one hitch -- and it's a big one. The Federal Communications 
Commission has yet to approve Pac Bell's request to provide these video 
services throughout its phone service franchise. Pac Bell admits that the 
decision has already taken longer than it had expected. Originally Pac Bell 
intended to have 45,000 homes in the Reseda area switched on to the new network 
by the end of the year; now it says that won't happen until March 31. Without 
the FCC's go-ahead, Pac Bell remains what it has always been -- a local phone 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC has made it clear that it supports the principle of phone companies 
entering the video delivery business. What's more, a year ago, 
Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic Corp. won a federal court case overturning a 
provision in the 1984 Cable Act that prevented phone companies from selling 
video programming to subscribers in their telephone service areas. And 
legislation is wending its way through Congress that would clear the way for 
phone companies to deliver video. 
</P>
<P>
 But each phone company's plan to provide these new services is different. And 
Pac Bell's application is particularly controversial -- in part because the 
sheer scope of it dwarfs most other phone company requests to provide video in 
small markets. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pac Bell announced its $16 billion spending plan, it was called the most 
extensive and costliest such investment by a phone company. Since then, other 
phone companies have announced similar plans, but all these big projects 
include money that the companies would spend anyway upgrading their phone 
networks. Pac Bell normally spends about $1 billion a year improving its phone 
network. Still, the company's plans to spend $9 million over seven years to set 
up an interactive system is considered one of the biggest such projects by a 
phone company. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pac Bell is now hoping for an FCC decision in the next month or two, 
the agency is not tipping its hand about the timing. "The FCC has made 
resolution of these applications a very high priority," is all that FCC senior 
policy adviser Donna Lampert would say. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Pac Bell is encountering fierce opposition from the cable 
television industry. Cable system operators argue that phone companies will 
boost phone bills to subsidize the costs of providing these new video services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Semow, director of state regulatory affairs for the Oakland-based 
California Cable Television Assn., contended that Pac Bell phone customers 
would pay for 95% of the cost of wiring the network for video services. Pac 
Bell would then charge video programming suppliers artificially low prices for 
using the network, he said. And when phone companies themselves are one day 
allowed to produce their own video content -- as is expected -- cable companies 
fear they won't be able to match phone companies' low video prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know they're going to be in our business," Semow said. "What we want to 
make sure is that when they do come into our business we compete on the same 
terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Phone companies hotly contest the cable industry's arguments. "The cable 
industry is working very hard to preserve its monopoly position," said Pac Bell 
Vice President of External Affairs Steve Harris. "They are throwing everything 
they can into stopping this, and nowhere is the battle more fierce than in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said that phone customers' rates will not increase to pay for 
installing the network. The cost of wiring the network will be paid with money 
Pac Bell would spend anyway modernizing its phone system, and through its cost 
savings from using the more efficient fiber and coaxial wires, he said. What's 
more, Harris said, the FCC must approve the tariff rates that Pac Bell would 
charge program suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pac Bell's wiring plan is "brilliant," said Jonathan Seybold, the Malibu-based 
publisher of Seybold Reports newsletters on publishing and digital media. While 
Bell Atlantic has been the trailblazer for other phone companies in winning 
approval to deliver information and entertainment services, he said, Pac Bell 
has been looked to as the trendsetter on the wiring side. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Seybold warned that a crucial issue for regulators is Pac Bell's 
proposed method of accounting for the cost of building its system. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes for Pac Bell loom large because phone companies are facing a new 
world in which they'll have competition in their local markets for the first 
time. As long-distance telephone, cable and wireless communications companies 
vie for local phone business, the local phone companies are convinced they must 
provide new information and entertainment products to keep the customers they 
have long taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Pac Bell is forging ahead with those parts of its new network 
that it says are allowed under current regulations. Although the phone company 
cannot install or even buy equipment now that would be used to deliver video, 
it is upgrading those parts of its network that it says will provide superior 
phone service. When it's completed, the capacity of the new system will be so 
great that McChesney sees no limit to the voice, video and data signals that 
could flow through these fiber-optic lines. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, crews in northern Reseda began to hang on phone poles the equipment 
for holding the new cables in place, and are now beginning to hang the cables 
themselves. The fiber-optic lines will run from Pac Bell's central office in 
Reseda out to 103 "nodes" in the community that are something like electronic 
way stations for the transmission of signals. Each node will then feed coaxial 
cable to about 450 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 A second Los Angeles beachhead for Pac Bell's new network will begin in 
Inglewood in October. Installation is also under way in Orange County, San 
Diego and San Jose. 
</P>

 From Reseda, construction of the network will move to Canoga Park, followed by 
Calabasas, Agoura Hills, Van Nuys, Sherman Oaks and North Hollywood by 1996. 
Pac Bell is still formulating its deployment plans beyond those areas and 
remains optimistic that approval of its current plan is imminent.

ON A SILVER PLATTER; IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT TO MARKET FILMS ON CD-ROMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin Greenwald is not above gimmicks. The CEO of Image Entertainment Inc. 
says the company's soon-to-be-released movies on CD-ROM may sell chiefly as 
novelty items -- but that's fine with him. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 7 million computers in the country now equipped for CD-ROM, 
reaching even a fraction of that market could mean big sales. "Maybe it will be 
just one out of 10 who buy them, but I will be the big guy in that business," 
Greenwald said. 
</P>
<P>
 CD-ROM, which stands for Compact Disc-Read Only Memory, are five-inch computer 
discs that look like audio compact discs. But CD-ROMs are played on computers, 
not stereos, and they contain images and sounds for interactive games or 
educational software programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Image Entertainment, which is controlled by billionaire John Kluge, for years 
has had only modest success in its licensing and distribution of movies on 
laser discs, 12-inch silver platters that transmit high-quality images on 
television screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Laser disc players never took off the way VCRs did. As a result, Image 
Entertainment laid off 17% of its work force last year. That cost-cutting 
helped the company report a record profit of $3.4 million on sales of $66.2 
million for the fiscal year that ended March 31. A year prior, Image lost $17 
million on sales of $60.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike laser discs, Image is entering a CD-ROM market in which the required 
delivery systems are already widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of personal computers equipped with CD-ROM drives in the United 
States is expected to reach more than 15 million by the end of the year, and 
CD-ROM drives are fast becoming a standard feature of personal computers, said 
Rich Bowers, executive director of the Optical Publishing Assn. in Columbus, 
Ohio. By contrast, Greenwald estimates the number of laser disc players in use 
to be 1.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But CD-ROM offers Image a way to expand while not straying far from the 
technology it knows best. 
</P>
<P>
 Like laser discs, Image's CD-ROMs are thin silver platters read by lasers. Pop 
one of Image's new CD-ROMs into your computer and action-packed flicks reel 
past in a postcard-sized square that fills a quarter of the screen. The picture 
is small, limited by current CD-ROM technology, and it's jerkier than a VCR's. 
But Image's CD-ROMs have the advantage of providing instant freeze-frames and 
printouts, and they're IBM and Macintosh compatible. 
</P>
<P>
 And the movies Image will be selling? "Exploitative titles," Greenwald calls 
them, meaning movies packed with scenes of spurting blood, bursts of flame and, 
in all likelihood, sex and nudity. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the first titles scheduled to be released beginning in October are 
"Silence of the Lambs," "Robocop," "The Terminator" and "Nemesis." 
</P>
<P>
 Image Entertainment is also a licensee of Playboy Home Video. Greenwald, a 
former distributor of pornographic movies, declined to say whether any Playboy 
movies are among the initial 24 titles on CD-ROM to be released. But he said 
such fare would be highly marketable in a computer format. "I don't see putting 
'Terms of Endearment' on CD-ROM," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese animation films are also top candidates for CD-ROM distribution. 
"Thirteen- and 14-year-old kids, that's really where it's at," Greenwald said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwald said the CD-ROM films will retail for between $14 and $20, far less 
than the $40 to $100 that many CD-ROM software programs now cost. Image can do 
this because much of the work required for selling laser discs -- including 
editing, post-production work, licensing and distribution -- is easily 
transferred to CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
 Image has spent about $12,000 per title to produce CD-ROM versions of movies, 
half what it would cost had Image not already been producing films on laser 
disc, Greenwald said. Its total investment in CD-ROM development is about 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to say Image plans to abandon laser discs, said Greenwald. The 
company has an estimated 35% market share in the laser-disc business, and has 
exclusive licensing agreements with Walt Disney's Buena Vista Home Video, 
FoxVideo, Orion Home Video and others. Although their popularity has by no 
means matched videocassettes, laser discs have a following among film buffs, 
and their sales have grown steadily. 
</P>
<P>
 With his bold print shirts and his zebra-striped chairs, Greenwald seems an 
unlikely corporate executive, much less a techno-whiz leading a new wave of 
multimedia publishing. His office decor pits chrome and glass furniture against 
walls crowded with art. Photos of his daughter, age 13, jostle with prints of 
models in seductive poses. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwald says it's true that the films he'll dish out to computer-addicted 
adolescents are not especially uplifting. "But it sells," he said. "And my 
mission is to sell CD-ROM." 
</P>
<P>
 Some, however, question the appeal of CD-ROM movies, which, unlike many games 
on CD-ROM, require users to simply watch, rather than interact, with their 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'm strange, but . . . I, for one, have never sat and watched a 
two-hour movie at a 14-inch distance from the screen," said Gary Arlen, 
president of Arlen Communications Inc., a Bethesda, Md., multimedia research 
company. "Why would anyone buy the CD-ROM when they already have the videotape 
sitting on the shelf?" asked David Clevinger, assistant marketing manager of 
the monthly trade journal Multimedia Monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwald counters that consumers may choose to watch movies in snippets, 
rewinding to view favorite scenes. To make the CD-ROMs more appealing to 
collectors, Image plans to include movie trailers and screen savers -- scenes 
from movies that roll by on the screen when the computer is turned off. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever its merits, Image is adding a new dimension to the realm of software 
publishing by attempting to mass market full-length feature films on computers. 
The Voyager Co. of New York broke new ground in this area when it released the 
first Beatles movie, "A Hard Day's Night," on CD-ROM last year. But many of the 
CD-ROM films available now are pornographic ones, which have found a thriving 
underground market, said Bower of the Optical Publishing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Even analysts who doubt there's much demand for "The Terminator" on CD-ROM say 
Image's strategy could pay off. With the market for multimedia publishing still 
in its infancy, companies with an early start will have "a nice hedge against 
future competition," said consultant Nick Arnett, of the Multimedia Computing 
Corp. in Campbell, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, the ultimate form hardware and software will take in this emerging 
market is still anyone's guess. Will they be discs for computers or discs for 
television? "It's not clear really which format will be the format," said 
Christopher Marlett, an analyst with Drake Capital Securities in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Image Entertainment knows that all too well. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of trying to peddle laser discs to a nation enamored of VCRs, it's 
no wonder Greenwald is leery of bold claims for the future of CD-ROM. He sticks 
to more limited pronouncements: "We aim to sell to that one in 10," he said. 
"We're Niche Industries Inc."

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: FORTUNE PETROLEUM EXPECTS $530,000 LOSS IN QUARTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fortune Petroleum Corp., an independent oil and gas exploration company 
headquartered in Agoura Hills, announced that it expects to report a loss of 
$530,000 for the second quarter that ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortune attributed the expected loss to two charges that overwhelmed what 
would have been a small profit.The charges include a $225,000 severance package 
awarded to Daniel E. Pasquini, the company's former president who resigned in 
June, and a $315,000 accelerated loss associated with an exploratory project. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasquini, 51, resigned following a disagreement with the board of directors 
over the proposed sale of the company's California properties, which once 
accounted for 80% of the company's revenue. The company said recently that a 
majority of the board now favors selling its California holdings to focus on 
ventures in other states, including Texas, which is expected to produce 75% of 
the company's revenue this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasquini, a geologist, remains with the company as a consultant. Tyrone J. 
Fairbanks, 37, has been named Fortune's president.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: APARTMENT VACANCY RATE DIPS TO 11.1% IN VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The apartment vacancy rate in the San Fernando Valley edged down to 11.1% in 
late May from 11.3% last year, according to initial data from a survey 
conducted by the Apartment Owners Assn. of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent Valley vacancy rate compares with a 12% rate of empty apartments 
reported for the Greater Los Angeles area. The average rent in the Valley was 
$646 a month in late May, compared with a high of $683 in West Los Angeles and 
$631 for the entire Los Angeles area, the association said. 
</P>
<P>
 Final results of the survey will be available in about a month, the 
association said.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: DENTSPLY TO ACQUIRE NEW IMAGE INDUSTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New Image Industries Inc., a Canoga Park-based maker of dental cameras, 
announced it will be acquired by Dentsply International Inc., a Des Plaines, 
Ill., company that makes a range of dental products. 
</P>
<P>
 Dentsply will pay $16.38 a share for New Industries in a deal valued at $91.6 
million.The acquisition, subject to the approval of the stockholders of both 
companies and their boards of directors, is expected to close in the fourth 
quarter of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Leddington, chief executive of New Image, said the company will enjoy 
enhanced credibility by being associated with the Dentsply name, and he added 
that operations in Canoga Park will not be affected by the purchase. New Image 
makes and markets dental intra-oral cameras and related imaging systems. The 
company had sales of $32 million for the fiscal year ended June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Dentsply manufactures dental products including X-ray equipment, cutting 
instruments and artificial teeth. The company had sales of $553 million last 
year.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: PLEASANT HAWAIIAN HOLIDAYS REPORTS BIG GAINS THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The recession is but a fading memory as far as Westlake Village-based Pleasant 
Travel Service is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far this year, sales of the firm's Pleasant Hawaiian Holidays tour 
packages have increased at least 40% over the same period last year, spokesman 
Ken Phillips reports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our business has improved dramatically in all parts of the country, but the 
most significant turnaround of all has been in Southern California, which is 
our No. 1 market," he said. "Of course, this area also showed the steepest 
decline when the economy wasn't doing well." 
</P>
<P>
 If the trend holds, Pleasant expects to book nearly 300,000 tours to the 
islands this year, compared with about 200,000 each in 1992 and 1993. The 
company claims to be the nation's leading provider of packaged tours to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides an improving economy, Phillips also credits a new air service with 
attracting travelers to the firm's packages. In March, Pleasant leased a fleet 
of Lockheed L-1011 jets and began offering to fly customers on what the company 
describes as its own airline. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than a charter service," Phillips said. "We have a schedule that we 
have to follow, even if there's only one passenger." On average, he said, the 
362-passenger craft are more than 90% full at takeoff time. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, he said, Pleasant's airliners have flown about 25,000 vacationers to 
the islands from Los Angeles and San Francisco. The planes' owner, American 
Trans Air, provides the crews. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our customers can use a major carrier if they wish, but we've found that many 
of them prefer to fly on our planes," Phillips noted. "Travelers are assured of 
a convenient flight time, and they have a feeling that their vacation has 
already begun when they step aboard." 
</P>
<P>
 Providing its own air service has allowed Pleasant to shave its costs a bit, 
Phillips added. With weeklong packages including air fare starting at $399 per 
person, double-occupancy, every penny obviously counts.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: CD AND CD-ROM UNIT BOOSTS TECHNICOLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Technicolor Inc.'s Camarillo plant has added a compact-disc duplicating unit 
to its video operation, and is already turning out 65,000 CDs and CD-ROMs 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the operation was launched in February, the company says it has produced 
2 million CDs and CD-ROMs -- 1 million of them in the past month alone.CD-ROMs, 
which account for 60% of the output, look like ordinary CDs but combine audio, 
video and text content. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion has added 110 new workers at the former Everest & Jennings Inc. 
wheelchair plant on Mission Oaks Boulevard, bringing the total payroll at the 
plant to 1,200, reports Pierre Loubet, sales and marketing director of the new 
optical media services division. 
</P>
<P>
 The division expects to hire 40 more workers in 1995, Loubet said. "The 
start-up has been most successful, but at this time, we're not aiming to be No. 
1 in the CD field. There are too many studios and production companies that do 
their own duplicating." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said Technicolor still hopes to be a world leader in disc production 
within five years. The company already claims to be No. 1 in video, and it's 
generally acknowledged to be the world leader in theatrical film processing. 
Technicolor is owned by a British concern, Carlton Communications. 
</P>
<P>
 As it does with movies and videos, Technicolor copies CDs and CD-ROMs for 
producers and distributors who then market the products themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the CD operation has forced Technicolor to expand beyond its 
500,000-square-foot Camarillo facility, which Loubet said is the largest 
free-standing industrial plant in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm recently moved its distribution center to a large building on Del 
Norte Road.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: COUNTY JOBLESS RATE RISES TO 7.3% IN JUNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's jobless rate, which had been declining steadily for nearly a 
year, took an upswing in June, rising to 7.3% from 6.5% in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the rise can be attributed to the loss of more than 3,000 agricultural 
jobs, officials say. The bulk of that, they add, is in strawberry harvesting 
and processing. On the plus side, 400 construction jobs were added in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The upturn in the unemployment figure came after the rate in the county 
registered a three-year low in May. 
</P>
<P>
 The jobless rate exceeded 10% as recently as July, 1993.

PINNING HOPES ON COMPUTER BULLETIN BOARDS; PEOPLE ARE STARTING HOME BUSINESSES 
BY OFFERING SERVICES THAT HELP HI-TECH AFICIONADOS REACH THE INFORMATION 
SUPERHIGHWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL BROADHURST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of Southern Californians have discovered a route to the information 
superhighway through a spare bedroom in Greg Gooden's Van Nuys home. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 60 people convene there at once. Some socialize or play games, 
others use a library, some pick up their mail. Most stay for hours and many 
linger far past midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden doesn't actually see these people. Instead that visitor traffic 
communicates over computers and through his own local computer bulletin board 
company called The Annex. "You can get almost any kind of information you need 
straight through your computer," Gooden said. "It's like going to the library 
without leaving the house." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the big on-line computer systems include Prodigy, CompuServe and 
America Online; this trio alone has nearly 10 million subscribers. Their 
customers, via computers, can buy and sell stocks, play games, do library 
research, book airline tickets and read newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 But computer enthusiasts also pay to use tiny computer bulletin board systems 
(BBS) such as Gooden's. Nationally there are more than 57,000 bulletin board 
systems operating today, according to Boardwatch Magazine, and many are run out 
of garages, basements or spare bedrooms. So many new systems are going on-line 
every month that a reliable count is impossible. "We're still not exactly sure 
how many bulletin boards are operating in our area," said Myla Harris, account 
executive with Pacific Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 For customers, part of the lure of small computer bulletin board systems is 
price: Many services are cheaper than the major on-line systems. And smaller 
systems give customers the chance to communicate more with more local computer 
users. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the boom in small bulletin board firms, however, the industry suffers 
from profitless prosperity. It's been estimated that nationally only 5% of the 
bulletin board systems are profitable, maybe another 15% break even, and the 
rest lose money. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Porter, 31, quit his job to run a bulletin board firm called KBBS out of 
his home in Northridge. He started it six years ago with a $2,000 IBM computer, 
plus $4,200 for software, computer modems and installation of 16 telephone 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago he was excited enough to quit as a computer programmer with 
Blue Cross of California to devote all his time to KBBS. More than 8,000 
computer users regularly log on to KBBS, Porter says, and while limited access 
is free to any caller, only his subscribers get full use of his programs. About 
25% of those callers eventually subscribe, and they pay an average of $10 per 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he took a substantial pay cut to run his own business, Porter 
believes that its growth potential will eventually pay off. "Running KBBS isn't 
as lucrative as my old job was, but (it's) growing," he said. "As with most 
small businesses it takes a few years to get a decent return on your 
investment."

<P>
 So 24 hours a day, subscribers throughout the San Fernando Valley and 
surrounding areas simply dial a local telephone number to link up with KBBS, 
The Annex and other computer bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
 KBBS and The Annex provide several channels where users can engage in live 
trivia games, group conversations or private chats. There are public 
discussions where users post questions or comments covering topics that range 
from horticulture to Howard Stern. They can obtain free games, spreadsheet and 
word processing programs and even buy products from an on-line shopping 
service. Subscribers can also send electronic mail to others, including to 
anyone outside the system who has an Internet address. 
</P>
<P>
 The Internet is a worldwide computer network that was designed in the 1960s to 
link computers at government research labs and universities. Today it's the 
basic infrastructure of the fledgling information superhighway. Tens of 
millions have access to the Internet and their ranks are mushrooming. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Porter's customers is Sharon Landers, 32, who has been a KBBS 
subscriber for two years. She subscribes to several local on-line services, and 
CompuServe because it has access to a hard-to-find medical database. 
</P>
<P>
 But she increasingly spends her computer time on small bulletin boards like 
KBBS. "One big attraction of a board like KBBS is its social character. I enjoy 
chatting with other users. Basically it's an on-line community." There are also 
in-person bulletin board meetings "that allow you to get together with people 
you've been interacting with" only on computers. Landers added that she met her 
current boyfriend while communicating on-line through KBBS. "Big services like 
CompuServe aren't chat-oriented," she said. "And KBBS doesn't tack on any extra 
per hour charges like CompuServe does." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 CompuServe charges users $20 to join the system and then levies a monthly fee 
of $8.95. The subscription gives users unlimited access to their basic 
services, such as on-line publications and news files, but it allows only 60 
electronic mail messages per month. Additional messages cost extra. 
</P>
<P>
 Subscribers of KBBS and The Annex are allowed full use of all system features 
for a flat rate. Porter's KBBS has a one-year subscription, which limits users 
to 90 minutes of on-line time each day, at $9.50 a month. A comparable 
subscription at Gooden's The Annex costs $8 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you buy a modem, it usually comes with a trial subscription to one of 
the national services like Prodigy," Porter noted. "But when the trial period 
ends and Prodigy sends you this big bill, you realize it's time to start 
shopping around. That's how a lot of my customers find me." 
</P>
<P>
 On-line chat and interactive games are the most popular features on local 
computer boards. "In a sense my main product is the people who use my system," 
Porter said. "A lot of computer users subscribe to KBBS just so they can 
interact with those people." 
</P>
<P>
 One popular game offered by The Annex and KBBS is TradeWars 2002 in which a 
user assumes the role of a space ship captain who forms alliances or does 
battle with other players to accumulate cargo, money and power. Another popular 
game, Trivia, is similar to the TV game show "Jeopardy!"; contestants try to be 
the first to correctly answer questions posed by the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Porter's next plan to grow is to attract small businesses to log on with KBBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most (customers) access the system at night, so I have a lot of idle phone 
lines during the workday. With that excess capacity I can offer small 
businesses across Southern California an inexpensive way to communicate as an 
alternative to phoning and faxing," Porter explained. "Employees can have 
teleconferences, exchange documents and files, and send E-mail. It's a perfect 
telecommuting set up." 
</P>
<P>
 People who run their own computer bulletin board service better like the job, 
because the hours required are enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 In a room no more than 15 feet square, Greg Gooden logs 18-hour days 
surrounded by an array of computers, monitors and technical reference manuals. 
Formerly an office manager, he was laid off last November and then decided to 
work full-time on The Annex. Since then, Gooden claims, his company would have 
been quite profitable, had he not plowed most of his revenue back into the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is probably the most competitive market in the country," he 
explained. "If you want your board to survive, you've got to keep upgrading the 
system." The Annex has just increased its phone lines and can now accommodate 
72 callers simultaneously. "And they're begging me to add more," Gooden said. 
Customers "don't like busy signals. If they get them too often, they'll just 
subscribe" somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than 2,000 active users, The Annex generates about $7,000 in 
subscription revenue each month, but Gooden typically reinvests $5,000 of that 
in his system. "I'm in this business for the long haul," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden says his revenues have increased almost every month since January, 
1992, when he started The Annex as a rudimentary system capable of handling 
only eight callers at once."So far, (it) has surpassed all my expectations," 
Gooden said. "It may not be outrageously profitable at this point, but I'm 
making a living and the subscription revenue is paying for the growth of the 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Gooden intends to expand The Annex's call-in capacity to 100 lines and 
to increase his slate of the Internet's features, including being able to 
communicate overseas, by summer's end. Gooden also sees growth potential by 
setting up a children's computer bulletin board filled with games and 
educational files. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also now moving the business out of his bedroom and into a recently 
leased office on Van Nuys Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Another bulletin board entrepreneur, who concedes he's undergoing some 
financial strains, is Eric Higgins. He owns BrainStorm, based in Simi Valley. 
"After four years . . . I haven't come close to breaking even," Higgins said. 
"Last year BrainStorm grossed $7,000. But I spent $14,000 upgrading and adding 
new features." 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins, 32, has a full-time job as an engineer with MagneTek, a defense 
subcontractor in Simi Valley -- although MagneTek recently announced it was 
moving most of its operations to Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins started his own computer bulletin board after trying various on-line 
services and finding their quality disappointing. "I thought I could put 
together a more user-friendly setup," he said. To start, he spent $2,000 on an 
IBM clone PC, and another $800 on software, modems and getting two telephone 
lines installed at his home. 
</P>
<P>
 So far Higgins has regularly tapped his defense contractor paychecks to 
subsidize BrainStorm's expansion from two phone lines to eight. He expects to 
do so again soon when he increases to 16 lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Brainstorm logs almost 200 calls a day and has about 630 regular 
callers. But Higgins said only 180 are paid subscribers. So far this year he's 
grossed about $3,400 in subscription revenue, but Higgins said BrainStorm needs 
80 new subscribers each month to break even. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't mind dipping into my own pocket to improve the system," 
Higgins said. "I'm convinced that the BBS industry has a big future, and I want 
to be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 To attract more business, he puts free ads in computer publications and he 
attends local computer club meetings and trade shows. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything else, an expanding user base -- and the subscription 
revenue it provides -- are the lifeblood of a successful bulletin board. As 
Higgins put it, "He who gets the most callers wins." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing this trio of bulletin board operators has in common is a conviction 
that their industry will keep growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1980s, people asked you for your fax number," Porter said. "In the 
1990s, they're going to be asking for your Internet address."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Zenith National Insurance Corp. reported profit declines for its second 
quarter and first half, when a gain from the settlement of litigation was 
offset by lower gains from the sale of investments and earthquake-related 
claims. 
</P>

earned $10.9 million in the three months ended June 30, down 28% from $15.1 
million in net income a year before.Its revenue edged up slightly, to $151.3 
million from $149.5 million.

its $27.7-million profit in the first half of 1993. Its revenue edged down to 
$289.6 million from $292.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Zenith's net income for the recent quarter and six months included a 
$1.1-million gain from litigation settled in 1993. But gains from sales of 
investments were just $300,000 in the second quarter, compared with $5.7 
million in gains a year earlier. Losses from the January earthquake totaled 
$1.5 million in the second quarter and $7.4 million for the six months.

MINING THE DEPTHS YIELDS A SLICE OF SUNKEN TREASURE; ENTERPRISE: O.C. COMPANY 
RETRIEVES MILLIONS OF BALLS EACH YEAR FROM GOLF COURSE WATER HAZARDS AND 
RESELLS THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a boy, Larry Margison sneaked into the Meadowlark Golf Course in Huntington 
Beach at dusk, waded into the shallow ponds and picked up sunken golf balls 
with his toes. Often the superintendent shooed him away, but Margison always 
returned and got so proficient with his toes that the golf course finally gave 
him a deal: a quarter a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 41, Margison still retrieves wet golf balls. And he still gets about a 
quarter apiece for them. But today, his company, Ball Hawk in Rancho Santa 
Margarita, employs seven scuba divers who mine the water hazards at 80 golf 
courses from Tijuana to Utah, picking up most of the 3.5 million golf balls a 
year that Margison resells. 
</P>
<P>
 That translates into a $900,000-a-year business, making Ball Hawk the largest 
company of its kind on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a natural talent for pulling them out of the water," Margison says, 
showing that he can still scoop up golf balls with his size-12 foot faster than 
most people would take to bend over and grab them by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Margison's firm actually retrieves about 2.5 million golf balls a year. It 
buys 1 million more from other dealers. Ball Hawk cleans and resells the balls 
for as much as $1.50 each. Many are sold to golf courses at discounts, and the 
balls often wind up for sale in fishbowl containers at pro shops, where they'll 
be bought, hit and most likely dropped into the water again. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't own golf balls, they just borrow them for a period of time," 
Mitchell Lombard says of the typical golfer's propensity to knock balls into 
the water. Lombard is president of Gold Eagle of Dallas, which processes about 
50 million balls a year and as such is the nation's largest golf ball retrieval 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows how many ball retrieval firms there are. Some golf courses clean 
the ponds themselves, and nighttime poachers take away a huge chunk of business 
for tax-paying entrepreneurs like Margison, who figures that illegitimate 
traders cut his revenue by 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Margison's company formally began in 1972, when he was 19, just married and 
playing golf for Golden West Junior College in Huntington Beach. He started 
with contracts from three golf courses: Anaheim, Costa Mesa and Sea Cliff. That 
year, Margison grossed about $18,000 -- picking up all the balls himself with a 
rake, his hands and his toes. 
</P>
<P>
 Margison's business has boomed with the mushrooming of golf courses -- about 
one a day nationwide in recent years -- and the growing popularity of the 
sport. "The average golfer would lose three or four balls per round," said Marv 
Kilburg, a marshal at Cypress Golf Club, which opened in the summer of 1992. 
For Ball Hawk, which has a contract at Cypress, that means a take of 4,000 to 
5,000 balls a week. 
</P>
<P>
 When he can, Margison retrieves balls with a $10,000 rolling machine that 
sweeps the lake bottom like a lawn mower, sucking up golf balls between its 
aluminum blades. But machinery won't work in most golf course lakes because 
they have fountains, pipes or plastic linings at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Cypress golf course, for example, bubbling fountains shoot out from a 
75-foot-long pond that skirts the par-four No. 8 hole. Vince Maxwell, outfitted 
in wet suit and turquoise face mask, usually spends a couple of hours a week in 
the murky lake, groping for balls barehanded. His average find is about 900 
balls, for which he receives seven cents apiece, or about $63. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the better holes," Maxwell said last week as he came up for 
air. Ball Hawk's divers, who are independent contractors, make between $25,000 
and $40,000 a year, the company says. "The money's pretty good," said Maxwell, 
adding, "It's interesting. We've come across lawn chairs, bicycles and golf 
clubs once in a while."

 Is it dangerous? "Nah," he said. Unlike Texas or Florida, where divers can run 
up against alligators, Maxwell says the worst creatures here are crawdads or 
big fish. "The other day at Sea Cliff," he said, "a two-foot catfish kept 
bumping into me." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day, divers like Maxwell dump the balls into banana boxes 
and drop them off at Margison's production facility in Rancho Santa Margarita. 
There the balls are dipped in a cleaning solution and sorted by grade, like 
lemons. 
</P>
<P>
 Margison says only 20% of the balls retrieved are in the top condition needed 
to be resold to pro shops. The rest are usually marketed to driving-range 
operators or firms that condition used golf balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Margison also runs his own retail shop near Tijeras Creek Golf Course in 
Rancho Santa Margarita, selling top-of-the-line used Titleist and Ultra balls 
for as much as $1.50 each -- about $1 less than what they cost new. Those balls 
provide the best profit margins for Ball Hawk, and Margison's hope is to open a 
similar store in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Margison likens his best used balls to cars with a couple of thousand miles on 
them. "They're not brand new," he said, "but pretty close."

ABBEY HEALTHCARE OUSTS EXECUTIVE ALLIES OF FIRED PRESIDENT; MANAGEMENT: ACTION 
REPRESENTS AN ESCALATION OF COMPANY'S BATTLE WITH VICTOR CHALTIEL, WHOM IT 
ACCUSES OF MISREPRESENTATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The battle between Abbey Healthcare Group Inc. and its former president, 
Victor M.G. Chaltiel, escalated Monday when the Costa Mesa nursing-home 
operator revealed that it has fired several executives who were part of 
Chaltiel's management team. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey officials would not identify the executives. Several industry analysts 
said they were probably people in financial management posts within Abbey and 
its Total Pharmaceutical Care subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaltiel headed Torrance-based Total Pharmaceutical when it was acquired by 
Abbey last year. He became Abbey's president as part of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey fired Chaltiel in January without public explanation but said in April, 
after Chaltiel filed a wrongful-termination lawsuit, that he was dismissed for 
inflating Total's earnings projections and for concealing other financial 
matters to promote Abbey's purchase of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, responding to what it said was Chaltiel's "insistence that Abbey is 
engaged in defamation," Abbey's board of directors repeated the company's 
allegations -- contained in a July 5 countersuit -- that Chaltiel "knowingly 
misrepresented various matters which were material in Abbey's decision" to 
acquire Total. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's statement continued, "Abbey has concluded that it was necessary to 
remove certain other members of his former management team from their 
positions, including certain (Total Pharmaceutical Care) officers who were 
terminated for cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey's common stock has dropped 47% since Feb. 9, when Chaltiel was fired. In 
Monday's Nasdaq trading, the company's shares closed at $15.375, down 12.5 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Chaltiel filed suit in April and gave investors a look at the financial 
problems the company faces, several industry analysts have published reports 
maintaining that Abbey spent far too much when it paid $197 million for Total. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Abbey reported a first-quarter loss of $6 million, contrasted with a 
$3-million profit for the same period a year earlier. The company blamed the 
loss on a $10.4-million write-off of costs related to acquisitions and 
restructuring -- including executive severance pay packages. Chaltiel received 
$1.2 million when he was fired.

BRIEFCASE: TRAVEL AND TOURISM; OCCUPANCY RATES ARE UP SHARPLY AT THE COUNTY'S 
HOTELS

<P>
 Orange County's hotel industry staged an impressive recovery in May compared 
to the same month last year and it could prove to be a good omen for summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, hotel occupancy increased to 66.7% in May, the latest occupancy 
figures available, up 5.1% over 63.5% during the same month last year, 
according a monthly tally compiled by the Los Angeles firm PKF Consulting. 
Daily room rates increased a healthy 3.2% to an average of $78.40. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest occupancy increases were seen in Anaheim, the county's convention 
capital, and at the business center around John Wayne Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase around the airport might indicate the steady pace of an improving 
business climate.

 Flying Together: USAir staged an elaborate show last week at the Four Seasons 
Hotel in Newport Center for Orange County travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The cocktail party and buffet was intended to show off the airlines new 
arrangement with British Airways. 
</P>
<P>
 As announced in March, the two carriers will try to operate as if they were 
one airline -- in some cases sharing aircraft and being listed together in 
travel agents' computerized reservations systems. 
</P>
<P>
 So what does it mean for Orange County? 
</P>
<P>
 USAir's daily Boeing 757 flight departing John Wayne Airport at 8 p.m. for 
Pittsburgh will connect directly with a London-bound British Airways jet.

 Something for the Kids: Speaking of hotels, some of the county's most 
venerable business institutions are becoming more, well, kid friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim Hilton, which is one of the largest convention hotels in the 
county and part of the complex that includes the Anaheim Convention Center, has 
initiated a program aimed at attracting more families. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "the Vacation Station," it includes everything from rewarding the tykes 
with giant chocolate chip cookies and a glass of milk in the Cafe Oasis, giving 
behind-the-scene tours of kitchens, ballrooms and the laundry and even a 
roam-around costumed mascot named Freddie the Dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that the hotel is across Katella Avenue from Disneyland, kids aged 5 to 
12 can watch a Disney movie that screens every afternoon at 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want guests to check out with so many good memories they can't wait to 
come back," Hilton General Manager Glenn Hale said.

 Fun, Games and Safety: Red Lion Hotel/Orange County Airport in Costa Mesa is 
trying to begin a program to attract party animals who don't want to risk 
drunken driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Friday and Saturday night this summer, the hotel is offering a deal to 
allow guests to be shuttled from the hotel's Club Max to the nearby upscale 
nightclubs Shark Club and Metropolis -- then back to the hotel, where they will 
have a room waiting for them. 
</P>
<P>
 For $30 a person double occupancy, guests will find food and drink specials at 
each stop and then a chance to sleep it all off. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is being aimed at couples as well as bachelor parties and 
reunions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone seems to have gotten the message that drinking and driving never 
mix, but that doesn't mean they want to stay home," said Red Lion Marketing 
Director Scott D. Williams.

COSTA MESA DEVELOPER AHEAD OF THE GAME IN $11-MILLION DEAL; REAL ESTATE: 
PARTNERSHIP BUYS 153 ACRES IN SAN CLEMENTE THAT SOLD FOR $38 MILLION IN 1988. 
THE LOT FEATURES MORE THAN $30 MILLION WORTH OF PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED 
IMPROVEMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a deal that paid for itself before the ink dried on the contract, a Costa 
Mesa commercial developer has acquired 153 acres in San Clemente's back country 
for $11 million -- less than a third of what the property sold for in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho San Clemente Partners said it plans a $100-million retail and 
residential development, including as many as 300 homes. The company is also 
planning a shopping center with several large stores as well as shops, 
restaurants and entertainment facilities, including a 12-screen cinema complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the center, to be called Plaza Pacifica, is expected to begin by next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Better even than the discount terms negotiated with the federal Resolution 
Trust Corp., which has owned the property since acquiring it from a defunct 
savings and loan in 1989, the partnership gets more than $30 million worth of 
previously installed improvements, including an underground culvert that drains 
the entire property and cost $25 million to build nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho San Clemente Partners is an investment group headed by Ramser 
Management Co., an 8-year-old Costa Mesa company that has built and owns about 
2 million square feet of industrial and commercial buildings in Los Angeles. 
Ramser is general partner and master developer for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramser also expects to sell 25 acres of the property to residential builders 
and could gross $15 million for the property at today's prices -- though the 
net cost would be considerably less because of the expense of preparing the 
property for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "The roads alone will cost $2.8 million," and grading the lots could run $4.3 
million more, said Paul Loubet, director of marketing for Ramser. "There are 
lots of costs and lots of risks" associated with residential development. 
</P>
<P>
 Loubet said Ramser plans to develop the property for a 69-acre "power center" 
-- an outdoor shopping area anchored by large stores such as Wal-Mart and Home 
Depot. 
</P>
<P>
 Loubet said Ramser initially intended to develop the housing section of the 
property after the commercial center but has seen such a swell of demand for 
residential lots in Orange County that it now is considering concurrent 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would prefer it because of the economies of scale," he said, referring to 
the grading, soil stabilization and road construction work that has to be done 
on the hilly site. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he expects mass grading of the property to be completed by the third 
quarter of 1995, with lot sales to retailers and commercial and residential 
builders beginning then and continuing into 1996. Completion of the entire 
project, Loubet said, could come as early as 1999. The development partnership 
purchased the property from the RTC in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous owner, Shanco Inc. of Newport Beach, paid $38 million for the 
same 153 acres in 1988, financing $28 million of the purchase with a note from 
Western Savings & Loan Assn. The federal government ended up with the property 
after it seized Western in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramser does not anticipate difficulty getting approval from the city of San 
Clemente because its plans for the property all involve less intensive 
development than the property is zoned for, Loubet said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300 homes the partnership proposes for the 25-acre residential portion, 
for example, represent a 42% reduction from the 517 units allowed. Ramser is 
also proposing to set aside 59 acres of the property for open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramser was founded in 1986 by former Grubb & Ellis Commercial Real Estate 
broker Philip Scott Ramser Jr. The company raises funds though equity 
investments by private parties and says its real estate portfolio is now valued 
at $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Clemente deal, one of the largest land sales in Orange County since 
the recession began in 1990, is Ramser's first in the county. Though it is 
based in Costa Mesa, the company has worked only in Los Angeles County, Loubet 
said, "because until now we thought real estate prices were just too high in 
Orange County."

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: FIRST AMERICAN TITLE INSURANCE ACQUIRES DALLAS-FT. WORTH

<P>
 First American Title Insurance Co. said Monday that it has acquired Republic 
Title of Texas Inc., a Dallas-Fort Worth title insurer that wrote $15 million 
in premiums for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 First American did not disclose terms of the deal. The Santa Ana-based title 
company previously owned 20% of Republic, which will continue operating under 
that name. Republic has specialized in the commercial real estate market and 
will be expanded to offer title insurance services in the residential market as 
well, First American officials said.

A 'SCANDAL' THAT'S MORE SNOOZE THAN NEWS; POLITICS: THE REVIEWS ARE IN -- THE 
PUBLIC AND THE PUNDITS HAVE PRONOUNCED THE WHITEWATER HEARINGS A DUD. AND 
THAT'S JUST WHAT THE DEMOCRATS WANTED TO HEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 David Dreyer is the very model of a modern White House PR man: He comes 
equipped with a full beard; one earring; stylish Italian-cut, double-breasted 
suits, and carefully matched shirts in terribly fashionable hues. The ponytail 
of younger years is long gone. Oh, and one more thing: a cellular telephone is 
almost always cocked to his ear.  
</P>
<P>
 When you are White House stage manager for the Whitewater hearings, pacing the 
corridors of Congress, passing a few choice words on to favored reporters, 
spinning the story, it is important to look good. 
</P>
<P>
 But give Dreyer credit: His flash conceals a steely commitment to defend the 
reputation of Bill Clinton's White House. And so far, Dreyer and the rest of 
the Administration's Whitewater spin patrol have achieved their main objective 
of making sure that the hearings are as boring as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater hearings have been a colossal flop, making for bad television 
while offering virtually no news or substantive insight into the Whitewater 
scandal that has ensnared the First Family for months. And what few revelations 
were to be unleashed by Republicans were judiciously leaked to the press before 
the hearings by the White House and its Democratic allies on Capitol Hill, 
further deflating their news value. 
</P>
<P>
 "These hearings are so dreary they wouldn't attract anybody," muttered House 
Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez (D-Tex.), who is presiding over 
the hearings in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The White House could hardly have asked for more. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, anyone who has seen "The Producers," Mel Brooks' 1968 comedy about 
two partners who purposefully set out to stage a terrible play that will close 
quickly on Broadway, can easily understand what the Clinton team wants from 
these hearings. Unlike Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder, the Clinton Administration 
has succeeded in staging a dud. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Republicans who demanded these dual hearings in the House and Senate 
Banking Committees, they have brought little but frustration and seething 
resentment of the Democratic congressional leadership for limiting the 
hearings' scope to a handful of issues that have already been thoroughly hashed 
over by the media and Whitewater special counsel Robert Fiske. The only issues 
now under review are questions about allegedly improper contacts between White 
House and Treasury officials to discuss a criminal referral in the Whitewater 
case from federal regulators to the Justice Department, and the July, 1993, 
suicide of White House deputy counsel Vincent Foster Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not gotten at anything very material . . . and Republicans didn't 
think we would because we've not been allowed to look at the real issues here," 
complained Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), one of the leading Republican 
questioners during the House hearings.  
</P>
<P>
 Appearing depressed and frustrated by the limited scope of the hearings, Rep. 
Jim Leach (R-Iowa), the Republican Party's leading Whitewater critic, has sat 
quietly through most of the sessions, leaving the bulk of the questioning to 
junior members with less knowledge of the scandal. Leach has apparently delayed 
scheduled testimony from his star witness, a criminal investigator on 
Whitewater, and seems to be holding his fire until a second round of hearings 
can be arranged to deal with more controversial aspects of the case.  
</P>
<P>
 The result has been that Republicans have resorted to peevish grilling of 
witnesses on trivial issues, and often appear unfocused and harping. Rep. Jim 
Nussle's endless questioning of former White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum 
about a fax of a newspaper article he received from Deputy Treasury Secretary 
Roger Altman prompted laughter and ridicule from opposing Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearings finally went from boring to farcical when a shouting match 
erupted between Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) and Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) 
after she told him to shut up and stop badgering Margaret Williams, chief of 
staff for First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and an Administration witness. 
Waters and King went at it again on the House floor the next day, providing a 
perfect television sound bite to prove the point that the hearings have 
generated some heat but little light. 
</P>
<P>
 The appearance of eccentric Whitewater figure Jim McDougal with a blonde, 
college-age friend in the audience at the hearings, along with anti-Clinton 
demonstrations outside by fundamentalist Christians led by Operation Rescue 
founder Randall Terry, only added to the comic sense that the hearings were not 
to be taken seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republicans have committed the ultimate political sin in Washington -- 
they made no news," crowed Rep. Jim Bacchus (D-Fla.), a member of the House 
panel. "After all the predictions, after all the press conferences, after all 
the dire warnings, this was much ado about not very much." 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic members of the House and Senate panels, meanwhile, confident 
that the hearings are going their way, have been content to toss softball 
questions at Administration witnesses. While they publicly deny it, the 
Democrats appear to have been carefully coached by their leaders not to make 
waves, and the lawmakers have taken that to mean they should go out of their 
way to ingratiate themselves with the White House officials at the witness 
tables.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't help but say that it's very unfortunate that individuals like 
yourself who have voluntarily given up huge incomes to come and serve in this 
city find it so rough and tumbling that sometimes you leave before you finish 
your service," said a sympathetic Rep. Paul Kanjorski (D-Pa.), when he 
questioned Nussbaum, who resigned under fire earlier this year for his role in 
Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best measure of the unified front presented by the Democrats came 
from Rep. Bobby Rush (D-Ill.); the former 1960s radical black activist was 
tossing just as many softballs to the witnesses as any other party stalwart. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So, as the hearings in both the House and Senate entered their second -- and 
final -- week yesterday, there was a sure sign that public and media interest 
had slackened; seats in the hearing rooms reserved for reporters and tourists 
went begging. 
</P>
<P>
 There is just one nagging problem for the White House spin patrol, however: 
there are some substantive questions to be answered, even within the limited 
topics covered by the hearings. Today could prove to be the highlight of the 
hearings, in fact, when Altman confronts the Senate panel and undergoes what is 
certain to be harsh Republican grilling, led by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.), 
who has already called for Altman's resignation. D'Amato, in fact, seems 
committed to making all of the Administration witnesses sweat more before the 
Senate committee, and has had more success in scoring points with new 
revelations than have his House counterparts.  
</P>
<P>
 Altman, a sophisticated and wealthy former Wall Street investment banker, has 
come under intense fire for his decision to give a "heads-up" to the White 
House earlier this year about the status of the Whitewater criminal referral 
inside the Resolution Trust Corp., the regulatory agency where he was then 
serving as acting chairman.  
</P>
<P>
 Altman, along with the other Treasury and White House officials testifying on 
their contacts, have been cleared of any wrongdoing by Whitewater special 
counsel Fiske. Yet Altman's actions have proven so controversial that the 
Administration and congressional leadership, which have been so supportive of 
other witnesses, have carefully distanced themselves from Altman throughout the 
hearings, acknowledging in interviews that Altman needs to publicly explain his 
conduct.  
</P>
<P>
 The contrast will be obvious when Altman steps to the witness table. While 
White House aides, led by senior adviser George Stephanopoulos and former chief 
of staff Thomas (Mack) McLarty, have been allowed to testify en masse, Altman 
will be all by himself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Administration officials have generated press reports in recent 
days of a looming shake-up in the Treasury Department. Altman said again on 
Monday that he will fight on, but it doesn't take a Kremlinologist to figure 
out that Altman could be rapidly turning into the Administration's sacrificial 
lamb. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think I'm going to be" the fall guy, Altman admitted Monday. 
It probably only makes it worse for Altman that he is smart and savvy enough to 
understand the political theater behind his looming demise. In an interview 
earlier this year, he claimed that D'Amato called him the night before a 
critical hearing in February, and warned him that he would be tough on him the 
next day. During that hearing, D'Amato occasionally winked at him, Altman said, 
as if to signal that it was all just politics and show.  
</P>
<P>
 Given their desultory pace and the poor reviews the nationally televised 
hearings are receiving, they may ultimately disappoint observers who relish in 
one of Washington's favorite spectator sports: observing how people drawn into 
the glare of celebrity respond to the pressure. From Watergate to Iran-Contra, 
such characters are often best remembered long after the scandal has faded from 
the headlines.  
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater's pickings are slim in that regard. A few minor figures have 
received some notice: Clifford Sloan, a junior White House attorney, came under 
intense questioning from House Republicans for his involvement in meetings 
between Treasury and White House aides last fall, while Cheryl Braun and John 
Rolla, who investigated Foster's death for the U.S. Park Police, got off a few 
good lines in testimony before the Senate committee, especially in respon se to 
questioning from Sen. Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.), who seemed singularly 
uninformed about the details of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, don't look for the next Fawn Hall or Oliver North to emerge from the 
Whitewater hearings.  
</P>
<P>
 And don't bother checking the Nielsen ratings.

THAT WAS THEN THIS IS NOW; SOME FOLKS BELIEVE THEIR WOODSTOCK MEMORIES ARE 
SACRED. BUT IS THE NEW FESTIVAL SACRILEGE? WHOSE PARTY IS IT, ANYWAY?

 "It used to be us versus them. Then, we became them and the kids became us. 
Except, we're also still us . . . aren't we?" -- Hector Lizzardi, site manager 
for Woodstock '94. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a steamy summer morning, Woodstock II is busy being born. 
</P>
<P>
 With a roar, Hector Lizzardi's Jeep bounces to the top of a grassy ridge and 
shudders to a halt. Behind the wheel, the ponytailed man with a '60s heart and 
a '90s bankroll points proudly to the green meadow below. 
</P>
<P>
 "This," he says with only a hint of irony, "is where it's at." 
</P>
<P>
 In the distance, construction crews build water fountains and lay wooden 
foundations for an immense concert stage. Others string lines for 1,000 
telephones. Within a week, 3,200 portable toilets will ring the site. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's like, wow: a gorgeous pasture bursting with wildflowers in Upstate 
New York, covering 840 acres. Just the place for Generation Xers to collide 
with Tie-Died Geezers in the latest chapter of American anniversary hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Got your calendars out? We've just relived the 25th anniversary of the first 
U.S. moon landing and the 30th anniversary of Mississippi's Freedom Summer. 
Next year, we'll kick off similar reruns for the killings at Kent State and 
Earth Day. You could spend a lifetime looking back. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest hoo-hah of all is less than two weeks away. On Aug. 12, the 
bucolic site surrounding Lizzardi will be transformed into Woodstock '94 -- a 
three-day rock 'n' roll extravaganza for 250,000 that's trying to rekindle the 
magic of the original music festival on its 25th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that this year's Woodstock is in Saugerties, 60 miles from the 
original site at Max Yasgur's farm in Bethel. Or that old-timers dismiss the 
new festival as a corporate con job -- a slick package deal that lacks the 
innocence and spontaneity of the original event. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodstock '94 backers insist that they're the real thing. And they abhor any 
comparisons to the mud-soaked music and arts event that became a defining 
moment for the 1960s counterculture, warts and all. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is 1994," says Michael Lang, who brainstormed the original festival and 
is organizing the Saugerties event. "There's a new generation involved and you 
can't just cling to what happened before. You have to turn the page." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it's hard to ignore the past, especially for an event as historically 
charged as Woodstock. To some, the original rock festival has become an 
embarrassing '60s cliche. Just one more bad memory from the generation that 
brought us peace, love and other slogans best forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Others view the 1969 gathering as a holy moment. Even if they never attended, 
millions of baby boomers keep Woodstock close to their hearts and they resent 
anyone hijacking the memory. Time may blur their recollections and harsh facts 
can get in the way. But the urge to go back is irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could never duplicate the first event and you shouldn't try," says Rufus 
Friedman, who helped construct the original site and is now an art designer in 
Venice, Calif. "For better or worse, it was from another time." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there's a possessiveness about Woodstock that can get nasty. Just 
whose party is this anyway? And what do these kids today want? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you've got big bucks on the line, the answer is obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, the first Woodstock festival was a large happening that got out of 
control and, by the grace of God, no one got badly hurt," Lizzardi says. "At 
Woodstock '94, we're geared up for a whole new generation, and we're not going 
to make the same mistakes. We have a few resources to help these kids along." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty million dollars, to be exact, much of it shelled out by corporate 
sponsors such as Pepsi and Haagen-Dazs. It's a staggering amount contrasted 
with the $3 million it cost to stage the 1969 festival. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was then and this is now. Get with the new program -- every 
micro-planned minute of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets to the 1994 event cost $135 for three days of music and other 
entertainment. Organizers want a tightly controlled festival, where 
concert-goers are forbidden to bring their own food or drink alcohol. Little 
has been left to chance, and Polygram Diversified Ventures, the entertainment 
conglomerate organizing the program, is determined to run a trauma-free event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to learn from mistakes made last time," Lang says. "I still have 
my loyalties to the '60s, but you have to live in the real world." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years ago, Lang crisscrossed Yasgur's farm on a motorbike, barking 
orders and confounding reporters with cryptic hippie wisdom. He still has long 
curly hair and talks like Mr. Goodvibes. But he's playing with the big boys 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Many ticket buyers will be under 25, Lang notes, so members of Generation X 
will be encouraged to speak out on social issues at the festival in various 
public forums and dispel the image that they're a lazy, cynical bunch. 
Promoters want them to be creative, he adds, sounding like a parent eager for 
children to have a good time at camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "If all goes well, these kids will have an event they'll never forget," Lang 
predicts. "It'll be a chance to for them to meet and see what happens in an 
open field for three days. It's not just a concert. It's a lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 But check your weirdness at the door. This time, nobody's making announcements 
about blue and green LSD tabs from the stage. Have a blast . . . and be sure to 
pick up an official Woodstock condom at the souvenir stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is corporate rock and roll," says spokeswoman Emily Rubin, who was 3 at 
the time of the first Woodstock festival. "Times have changed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1969, I was 19 and Woodstock was shaping up as the ultimate concert. 
Every week, my best friend, John, and I went down to the old Free Press 
bookstore on Fairfax Avenue, gaping at posters showing the growing list of 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
 Janis. Jimi. Country Joe and the Fish. Everybody was going to be there. The 
pull was magnetic, 3,000 miles away. But that's as close as we got. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not going," my father said. "You're not going to travel cross-country 
on a bus for five days and live in a field for three days." 
</P>
<P>
 My friend's mother, Ida, was more direct: "Using what for money?" she said 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other teen-agers, we waited for the movie the following year to 
finally get a glimpse of the excitement. And then a bizarre thing happened. 
</P>
<P>
 As we walked into the theater, my friend and I stared at huge photos of 
Woodstock concert-goers lining the walls. And damned if we didn't see two 
skinny kids who looked like us -- muddy, disheveled and happy -- in the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we made it after all," my friend deadpanned. "What a trip." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't just us. Soon, I began hearing stories from people who claimed to 
have been at Woodstock but clearly had not. Even those who admitted that they 
weren't there spoke as if they had been in a metaphysical sense -- as if movie 
and record hype had expanded the crowd well beyond the original 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Did it matter that Joni Mitchell, who wrote the song "Woodstock," never 
reached the festival? Or that Abbie Hoffman, who coined the phrase "Woodstock 
Nation," was booted off the stage when he interrupted a rock performance? 
</P>
<P>
 This was an event to be treasured, along with artifacts from the site, no 
matter how mundane. In a surprise appearance on "The Dick Cavett Show" the 
night after the festival, rock superstar Stephen Stills held a worn cowboy boot 
up to the ABC-TV cameras and proudly said: "I've still got my mud." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-five years later, I've got mine, too, no matter how metaphorical. For 
three days and nights, members of the '60s generation endured rainstorms, 
limited food, substandard sleeping conditions and mind-boggling traffic 
congestion to have a good time. They had become the third-largest city in New 
York, and when it was all over there was no violence. Just a lot of memories. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since, hundreds have gathered at Max Yasgur's farm on the 
anniversary to pay their respects. Folks who never attended the festival 
quietly tour the grassy site, buy a T-shirt . . . and bring home a little mud. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, there would have been more than mud for them this year. 
</P>
<P>
 A rival group of promoters had been planning a competing three-day festival on 
the same weekend at Max Yasgur's farm, featuring many of the acts from the 1969 
event. Performers such as Richie Havens, John Sebastian, Canned Heat, Country 
Joe McDonald, Blood Sweat and Tears, and Melanie were slated to appear at the 
Bethel '94 festival, in a calculated bid for boomer bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, however, backers withdrew their $5-million funding for the event, 
noting that only 1,650 tickets had sold in more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why spend all that money if no one's going to come?" says Harry Ruhlen, whose 
Frontier Insurance Group, an Upstate New York firm, was to be the major 
festival underwriter. "I'm sure there will be some spontaneous observance at 
the original Woodstock site . . . but you have to go where the money is": 
</P>
<P>
 To Saugerties, where promoters are luring younger customers with acts such as 
Aerosmith, Alice in Chains, Cypress Hill, Peter Gabriel, Metallica, the Red Hot 
Chili Peppers, the Spin Doctors and others. Organizers are also wooing oldsters 
with such performers as Bob Dylan; the Band; Santana; Johnny Cash; Crosby, 
Stills and Nash; the Neville Brothers, and Joe Cocker. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Bethel festival lost its funding, Lang sniffed that his competition 
was presenting "an oldies show . . . a feel-good thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have some nostalgia for the original site, but nothing beyond that," he 
adds. "There's a whole new generation of kids out there, and this is their 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Ariel Zevon, 17, who's organizing "Generation Xposition: The Youth 
Movement at Woodstock 94." Her activities include organizing a food drive for 
the homeless, setting up a child-care center, creating a "Multi-Cultural 
Harmony Gathering Place" and volunteering time as a peer counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Ariel, a student at Marlboro College in Vermont, grew up hearing her parents 
talk about the Woodstock myth. Now she wants to write her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were half a million people up there and virtually no violence," Ariel 
says. "And for most people my age, that's really inconceivable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our generation hasn't been able to come together like that, but this might be 
an occasion when it happens. I'd hope we can build a network of young people 
out of this. But it has to be our story. Something we create." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, let the old fogies with gray ponytails go somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 The comic possibilities are endless: Pepsi lampooned the aging Woodstock 
generation -- spreading waistlines and all -- in a wickedly funny Super Bowl 
commercial this year, and TV talk-show hosts have also had a field day with 
imagined reunions. In one comedy bit, gasping festival-goers are told to avoid 
the green Rolaids tablets, and counselors talk people down from bad yogurt 
trips. Imagine the festival reaching its climax, when 400,000 people rise from 
their BarcaLoungers to do the M-A-A-L-O-X cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet others aren't amused. To them, Saugerties is the equivalent of painting a 
mustache on the Mona Lisa. A rock 'n' roll desecration. 
</P>
<P>
 "That festival has become Peace-Love Inc.," charges Michael Wadleigh, who 
directed the award-winning film made of the original festival. "Woodstock '94 
is totally commercial. It's owned by sponsors and it runs counter to the real 
meaning of Woodstock." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The meaning of Woodstock. It sounds heavy, but what's the point? Ask those who 
were there, and they'll tell you hype and history are not the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "People take the Woodstock thing much too seriously, building it up," says 
Friedman, who helped build the original site. "It was more like a children's 
crusade, because we didn't really know what we were doing. We narrowly averted 
a disaster up there. We all acted professional, but it was like going to Boy 
Scout camp." 
</P>
<P>
 The near-misses would curl your hair: rainstorms that threatened to wash away 
the entire festival. Fierce winds that could have toppled rickety light towers, 
instantly killing hundreds. A dangerous shortage of food and water. 
</P>
<P>
 Some folks traveled thousands of miles and never even got to hear the music. 
Gail Collins, then an Ohio teen-ager, drove to Woodstock and got caught in a 
monumental traffic jam. After three days, she was lucky to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw people roaming through the woods and across the mud, it looked 
like the end of the world," says Collins, now a New York Newsday columnist. 
"But people survived and nobody was mean. Maybe that's the best thing." 
</P>
<P>
 For Elen Orson, Woodstock was a beautiful bubble that burst. People were 
fighting against the Vietnam War and demanding the right to live a different 
lifestyle, free from materialism, she says. It lasted three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was like any other dream not based in reality," says Orson, who was then 
a 16-year-old assistant to Michael Wadleigh's crew and is now a supervising 
film editor for Walt Disney animation living in the Hollywood hills. "When we 
tried to go on and live that way, reality intervened. It had to." 
</P>
<P>
 If she had time, Orson adds, she'd travel to Yasgur's farm once more -- to see 
what's changed, check out what remains and to remember one crazy summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd go back to that field, because I have such a clear picture of it in my 
head," she says. "It's like a house I used to live in, and I'd like to know if 
it matches the image in my mind. Lots of people have that urge." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a scorching afternoon, 25 years later, I'm finally on my way to Woodstock. 
My wife and I are looking for the original festival site, and it's hard to find 
unless you make the correct turn down a dusty, unmarked road. 
</P>
<P>
 Before we arrive, however, there's another memory to hunt down. Some 27 
summers ago, my wife went to summer camp near Bethel and she's obsessed with 
the idea of revisiting the long abandoned site. If only we can find it. 
</P>
<P>
 Does anyone remember Camp Mi Hansa? Locals frown and scratch their heads, but 
to my wife it's as clear as yesterday: bright red bunkhouses where girls and 
boys held midnight trysts. A large swimming pool. The tennis court that doubled 
as a dance area, and wide open woods. The memory is crystal clear. 
</P>
<P>
 After some detective work, we track down an old lumber-store clerk who knows 
the exact location. We follow his directions, climb a mountain road and 
suddenly the camp's in view. There's only one bunkhouse left, crumbling and 
padlocked. The tennis court is in disrepair; the pool cracked and empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Picking our way through a field of waist-high weeds, we take one last look 
before driving off. The camp site seems smaller and less imposing to her in 
retrospect, yet it really doesn't matter. It's the recollection that counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten miles from Yasgur's farm, we're racing myth and memory down the road. We 
zip past T-shirt stands, cut through fields and there it is: a sprawling canvas 
of meadow and sloping hills that once held 400,000 true believers. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a small plaque marking the site of the original stage and no one 
around except for a film crew making a rock video. We're alone with images of 
Jimi Hendrix, peace signs and teen-agers making love in the woods. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the place, man," says a Bethel '94 booster who cruises by in a red 
pickup. "Forget Saugerties. This is the real place." 
</P>
<P>
 But what does that mean -- to aging hippies or skeptical 20-year-olds? 
</P>
<P>
 You can soak up vibes for only so long before realizing that an empty field is 
an empty field. People made history here big-time, yet it won't happen again 
unless they come back and rediscover the magic. In Saugerties or anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great that somebody's trying to dream up Woodstock again, but it can 
never be the way it was or exactly how we remember it," Orson says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a new generation now. Maybe they'll show the world that we can 
still be decent to each other. Maybe they'll come up with a new message." 
</P>
<P>
 Or they might just have one helluva party and call it a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also good," Orson says. "Listen, if you make it up to Woodstock, go 
skinny-dipping in the lake for me. And stay away from the brown acid."

 Go, champ! You made it to the health club, having Roto-Rootered your way 
through miles of clogged up freeway, past "Permit Parking Only" hassleage and 
around the no-vacancy glitch in the locker room. But despite such heroics, 
you're stuck, once again, standing in line for the treadmill. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, if the cling of sweat in the air isn't strangling your good 
intentions, the clang of weight machines squeaking ceaselessly like oil 
derricks is getting on your nerves. And when it's finally your turn to hit the 
exercise pedals, those little red devils -- "LAPS," "CALS," "MILES" -- start 
flashing in your face, only to remind you of the diabolical taillights on the 
405 you came here to forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, you've been waiting all this time to go nowhere fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider a new concept: Get off the treadmill and turn your neighborhood into 
an outdoor gym. You have nothing to lose but your membership payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Take it from the exercise pros who are trading mirror and metal for a breath 
of fresh air. "A lot of personal trainers are starting to train their clients 
outside one, maybe two, days a week to run or walk and finish with crunches," 
says Kelly Jacobs, a spokesperson for the International Assn. of Fitness 
Professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I think we'll see a lot more of that. People have been going to the gym 
for so many years, they're looking for a change." 
</P>
<P>
 After years of dishing up fitness on a calculator -- "X number of calories 
burned in 20 minutes doing aerobics at 60-80% of your V02 max (click, click)" 
-- many experts are realizing that something is missing in the math. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often it's better for the soul to let go of the numbers," says Keli Roberts, 
a Hollywood trainer who led Cher's first video (she has two of her own out as 
well) and teaches at Martin Henry Fitness Studio. "I really see it in my Type A 
clients. When I get them outdoors, they come back as different people." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts also takes her less-driven clients out to a park or canyon when 
motivation gets stale. The scenery, sounds and smells of the outdoors, she 
says, definitely revive their spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fitness industry has been so body-oriented -- as in getting the perfect 
waistline -- we haven't been dealing with the other aspects of the body, such 
as the mind," says Reebok City Jam creator Christophe Toledo, known for taking 
hip-hop aerobics to the pinnacle of cool. Although Toledo made his name 
teaching in the steamy studios of Los Angeles, his next move is to develop an 
outdoor cross-training program that encourages participants to take advantage 
of their surroundings and "use their own brains." 
</P>
<P>
 It does take a bit of figuring to create your own outdoor gym. But that's half 
the fun. 
</P>
<P>
 With its varied terrain, L.A. is a no-cost circuit city of potential workout 
stations. Surrounded by mountains, beaches and forests, the sprawling 
metropolis is riddled with long public staircases and dotted with parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these parks have ready-made Parcourses that have been there, for the 
most part, since the early 1980s -- tracks studded with your basic chin-up 
bars, balance beams, stepping stumps and the like, bearing illustrated signs to 
coach you through. (Check out Admiralty Park in Marina Del Rey, Clover Park in 
Santa Monica and Warner Park in Woodland Hills; there are many others.) 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need a health club to get fit," stresses Mark Stevens who, despite 
owning the Gym in Brentwood, trains his personal clients outside it at least 
once a week, packing aerobics, strength and flexibility conditioning into an 
hour or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Stevens' favorite Westside haunts: the 4th Street Steps in Santa Monica 
and the fire roads that lace the Palisades. Between walking, running and 
climbing, these upwardly mobile workouts include calisthenics -- pushups, 
sit-ups, lunges, squats -- and stretches on the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, you can do 20 reps on the leg extension machine," Stevens says, "but 
what does it mean if you can't walk up a hill?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For those who prefer a more lateral approach, L.A.'s long coastline offers 
boardwalks, bike paths, sand running tracks and more. Toledo meets regularly 
with his Malibu buddies to cross-train outside in improvisational sessions that 
run anywhere from 30 minutes to two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in better shape now than when I was teaching 10 classes a week and I'm 
doing a lot less physical work," Toledo says. He describes a typical outing as 
follows: roller-skating a few miles down the beach, rock walking (develops 
balance, muscular control and confidence), running at the ocean's edge, and 
finishing back on the rocks with toning exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 The key is to use your imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Jef Hogan. For the 36-year-old Lakewood resident who finds gyms "too 
organized," not to mention expensive, a good tree is a Spectrum Club: "You can 
do dips from the branches, standing pushups and stretches against the trunk, 
and climbing works out all the muscles." 
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, if it's rooted in an open area he can run, mountain bike, scramble 
on the rocks and spy on a few deer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogan is quick to point out that when you train outdoors, the risks can be 
greater than just a hairy eyeball from a fellow gym member waiting for your 
treadmill. Once, while running in the hills above Chatsworth, he met up with a 
herd of cattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a few shuffles of hooves," he says. "Then a few more. When I 
turned around, I realized I was leading a stampede in full gallop. Maybe it was 
my purple shorts. I don't know -- but I ran for my life." 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, he got somewhere fast.

CRYSTAL CLEAR; NEW AGE CENTER DECIDES IT MUST RECHANNEL ENERGY TO THE 
MAINSTREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Deep in the heart of Orange County sits an old church visited regularly by a 
peasant who has been dead since the 12th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is Kavar, and, speaking in a strained staccato voice through the 
efforts of an experienced channeler, he has for years offered advice, 
predictions and witticisms to anyone willing to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 The same building is home to a monthly support group for people claiming to 
have been abducted by UFOs. And nearly every Saturday the place is overrun by 
psychics, channelers and healers of various stripes intent on offering their 
talents to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't many places like this," said Jim Miller, 58, of Tustin, one of 
the estimated 200 people who attend programs and classes here each week. "It 
provides the opportunity for personal growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bobbi Blake, 53, of West Covina, "You can't find this anyplace else." 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't literally true, of course. Throughout Southern California and 
Orange County, a handful of New Age centers offer similar or related services.  
</P>
<P>
 Patrons of the former Psynetics Foundation, however, seem infected by a 
certain affinity for its environs. This is, after all, one of the oldest and 
largest New Age centers around. And while other institutions have updated and 
modernized, admirers say, this one has pretty much stuck with its original 
program.  
</P>
<P>
 Until now, that is -- proving only one thing: that even in the halls of higher 
consciousness, sometimes the winds of change must blow.  
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the nonprofit organization made a bid for respectability by formally 
changing its name from psynetics, an obscure word meaning "science of mind and 
soul," to the Learning Light Foundation. Too many people, directors said, 
confused the old name with "Dianetics," L. Ron Hubbard's Church of Scientology, 
which some consider a cult. 
</P>
<P>
 The change was formally announced this weekend at a huge psychic and holistic 
therapy fair organized on the theme of Camelot. 
</P>
<P>
 And from now on, directors say, in addition to such old standbys as astrology, 
palmistry and past-life regression therapy, the foundation will offer on-site 
courses for business people wishing to improve their intuitive decision-making 
powers, lectures by medical doctors on good health practices, and classes in 
meditation for children and teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to become more part of the mainstream," said Susan Baucom, a 
certified public accountant with a master's degree in business administration 
from USC who took over as the foundation's full-time general manager five 
months ago. "We are trying to legitimize more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Being part of the mainstream was about the last thing on the minds of the 
people who founded the organization in 1962. Walter Tipton was a Methodist 
minister disillusioned by what he perceived as the dogmatic thinking prevalent 
in organized religion. So he and his wife, Lola, placed an ad in a local 
newspaper looking for like-minded individuals.  
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 people responded, and the couple began having meetings for 
philosophical discussion at their home in Orange.  
</P>
<P>
 Caught up in the fervor of the 1960s counterculture and later in on the ground 
floor of the burgeoning human-potential movement, the group founded by the 
Tiptons swelled. In the late 1960s, it began meeting in a rented house. And in 
1972 the foundation moved to its present location, a two-story, 
11,000-square-foot former Church of the Nazarene on East Lincoln Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Almost from the beginning, the old Psynetics Foundation, which at the time was 
one of the few organizations of its kind anywhere, centered its program on a 
series of "power of the mind" courses developed by Tipton. In addition, the 
place soon became a mecca for psychic healers, mind readers, spiritualists and 
various cosmic consciousness aficionados of all kinds. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the very thing that fueled the center's success eventually 
contributed to a downward spiral. As psynetics teachers continued mining their 
specialties, the success of the human potential movement and expanding public 
interest spawned competitors. While others seemed to move with the times, the 
Anaheim foundation, though, settled into sameness, Baucom said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got left behind," Baucom now acknowledges. "We weren't paying attention to 
what was happening in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Under its new banner, she said, the Learning Light Foundation still will offer 
numerology on Monday nights, taping of spirit voices on Tuesday nights and 
dowsing on a future Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it also will offer new goodies, such as teachers who will visit companies 
to help management "tune in" to their inner voices and make better decisions, 
and child day-care where the curriculum includes meditation.  
</P>
<P>
 A few Learning Light teachers have discovered ways to adapt some of the 
foundation's traditional pursuits to more current sensibilities. A class in 
astrology recently devoted several hours analyzing the astrological chart of 
O.J. Simpson.  
</P>
<P>
 But some programs don't easily adapt. For about a year now, the foundation has 
been hosting UFO-related events ranging from regular "UFO nights" featuring 
lectures and discussions to the recently formed UFO abductees' support group. 
</P>
<P>
 That group's first meeting was held in the foundation's main auditorium a few 
Saturdays ago amid almost messianic fervor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of abductees in Orange County wondering where to go," 
explained Melinda Leslie, the Corona del Mar office assistant who formed the 
group with a hypnotherapist friend. 
</P>
<P>
 For the management of the Learning Light Foundation, however, such talk poses 
a dilemma. UFO programs attract big crowds, but the subject doesn't exactly 
jibe with the foundation's new bid for mainstream respectability. And although 
"we are open-minded," Baucom says, "we (also) want to fit in." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few months, she said, foundation managers will evaluate what to 
keep and what to sacrifice on the altar of progress. In the end, though, the 
group's tradition of openness may prove a difficult tendency to buck. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately it's people looking for support," Baucom said of the foundation's 
fringe-like past and open future. "We're about education; this is all part of 
life, and you can't be embarrassed by that."

43 PETS FOUND IN CONDO EUTHANIZED; ANIMALS: SHELTER DIRECTOR SAYS SOME HAD 
FELINE LEUKEMIA, THE REST ANEMIA. THE OWNER, WHO PLEADED GUILTY TO CRUELTY 
CHARGES, REFUTES THAT: 'MY CATS WERE ALL PLUMP AND SASSY.' 
</P>

<P>
 Orange County Animal Shelter officials said Monday they have euthanized 43 of 
the 45 dogs and cats that authorities found alive in a filthy and flea-infested 
Aliso Viejo condominium in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that rampant disease caused by the animals' confinement in the 
condo forced them to put to death all but two cats belonging to Luella 
Kretchman, who last week pleaded guilty to animal cruelty charges. She will be 
sentenced Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the worst situation I've seen in the four years I've been here," said 
Judy Maitlin, the shelter director. "Some of the cats had feline leukemia and 
the rest had severe anemia, probably caused by extreme flea infestation." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 51 animals discovered in the three-bedroom condo, six were already dead 
and another 13 were in such bad condition they were put to sleep almost 
immediately. More were euthanized in the following weeks, animal control 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 18 cats and five dogs were put down by lethal injection last 
week, Maitlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept thinking maybe they would be OK, then two or three would get sicker," 
she said. "Many of them were literally dying." 
</P>
<P>
 A county veterinarian found some of the anemic animals had lost half the 
normal amount of blood because of flea bites, Maitlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the shelter received many offers of adoption from the public, Maitlin 
said the remaining group had communicable diseases that could have been spread 
to other animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very depressing and very scary situation," she said. "I think Mrs. 
Kretchman is very well-meaning, but things got out of hand for her. That's far 
too many animals for one individual to care for." 
</P>
<P>
 The surviving two cats have been adopted by Kretchman's son. 
</P>
<P>
 Kretchman on Monday angrily disputed the shelter's explanation for euthanizing 
her pets. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no excuse for that," she said. "I'm absolutely furious. I don't 
believe they're telling me the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Kretchman said a county veterinarian told her that her cats had tested 
negative for feline leukemia, which shelter officials deny. 
</P>
<P>
 "My cats were all plump and sassy," she said. "I wish I had access to their 
records. If I had enough money I'd sue these people." 
</P>
<P>
 After neighbors complained about fleas and strong odors emanating from the 
condominium on the 23000 block of Via Reposa, animal control officers entering 
Kretchman's home said they found dog and cat feces piled four inches high in 
some places. 
</P>
<P>
 Kretchman said the only piles of animal waste were near litter boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, there were a lot of fleas and my house was a terrible mess," she said. 
"I have been sick lately, but my animals were still well-cared for and none of 
them were near death." 
</P>
<P>
 She faces a potential six months in jail and/or a $1,000 fine. If Kretchman 
receives probation instead, she could be prohibited from owning pets and could 
be required to have psychological counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 County ordinance limits residents to a maximum three dogs and three cats.

NEIGHBORS TAKE FEUDING TO COURT; DISPUTE: JUDGE HEARS FOUR HOURS OF TESTIMONY 
ABOUT TRASH, NOISE AND ODOR AT HUNTINGTON HARBOUR HOME. OWNER CALLS LAWSUITS 
'MALICIOUS,' SAYS SHE HAS CLEANED UP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A steady stream of Huntington Harbour residents told horror stories in 
small-claims court Monday about hoarded rubbish, vermin, loud noises and 
unbearable stenches at the home of their neighbor, nuisances that they say have 
plagued them for two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had recurring nightmares because of the fire hazard. I've spent 
countless sleepless nights listening to her bang around in her trash cans," 
Raymond Goulette told Judge Corey S. Cramin, his voice cracking as he talked 
about his neighbor of 19 years, Elena Zagustin, a civil engineering professor. 
</P>
<P>
 Two dozen Huntington Harbour residents each are seeking a $5,000 judgment 
against Zagustin, the maximum obtainable in small-claims court, in the hopes 
the combined sum will either force her to clean up or move out. 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to four hours of testimony from neighbors who sued Zagustin in 
small-claims court Monday, Cramin took a tour of the neighborhood, peeking over 
a fence into Zagustin's yard, surrounded by immaculately landscaped, $400,000 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's ruling will be announced today, his clerk said. He ruled in favor 
of some plaintiffs but not all, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors Philip and Kathryn Arnold told Cramin that their dog has chronic 
parasites and that they can't allow their 9-month-old baby to crawl around in 
their back yard. Vermin that they contend came from Zagustin's property have 
crawled through their doggy door, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We moved into this home because we thought it was a nice, quiet neighborhood 
where we could raise children. This has not turned out to be the case," Kathryn 
Arnold said. "We feel like we are prisoners in our own home." 
</P>
<P>
 The case has become a key test in Orange County of a tactic called Safe 
Streets Now! pioneered by Bay Area residents to force evictions of drug-selling 
tenants by winning large judgments against the landlords in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents told Cramin on Monday that Zagustin has caused them emotional 
distress by keeping piles of rubbish in and around her house, abusing her cats 
and contributing to unbearable stenches and rat and opossum infestations in the 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 They presented a 380-page file subpoenaed from the Huntington Beach 
code-enforcement office, outlining actions the city has taken against Zagustin 
over the years, including 21 inspections of her property, four criminal 
complaints and a Superior Court civil lawsuit by the city that was settled last 
month.  
</P>
<P>
 Zagustin sought unsuccessfully to have the cases dismissed Monday, saying she 
had not been served with court papers. She then sought to have the case 
transferred to Superior Court, where she could be represented by an attorney, 
because the total claims amount to $120,000. The judge denied both requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Zagustin denied many of their allegations, pointing out that the statute of 
limitations on emotional distress claims is one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is some kind of malicious prosecution, because a lot of the things they 
are saying are absolutely untrue," she told Cramin. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said she had cleaned her house in accordance with last month's court 
settlement, and that she has addressed many of the neighbors' complaints about 
piles of concrete and rubbish at her property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not bothering anybody. All I do is work and come home," Zagustin said 
outside court. "My house is cleaned up." 
</P>
<P>
 Zagustin, 57, a tenured engineering professor for 27 years, is on medical 
leave from Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Safe Streets Now! founder Molly Wetzel has helped Bay Area residents pull in 
more than $760,000 in judgments since 1989, and Long Beach activist Betsy 
Bredau has helped residents win more than $56,000 over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bredau, who is helping Huntington Harbour residents with their case and came 
to court Monday, said the situation on upscale Morse Circle is clearly 
different from one in drug-plagued neighborhoods. But the residents' 
frustration is similar. 
</P>
<P>
 "The testimony was identical to people living next-door to a drug house in the 
frustration, the despair, the distress and the feeling that somebody's going to 
do something illegal soon to get it stopped," Bredau said after the hearing. "I 
was amazed by the depth of despair." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials and frustrated residents in Orange County cities plagued by drug 
dealing are currently researching use of the method and say a success for 
Huntington Harbour residents would be inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is successful, then it clearly shows that citizens can take the law 
into their own hands and win. This is America. This is wonderful!" said Santa 
Ana neighborhood activist Jim Walker, who attended a Safe Streets Now! training 
session in January and has been supporting the Huntington Harbour efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows how due process can work for the people, not against them. We have 
to reassure people that the system works." 
</P>
<P>
 David Flynn, the Huntington Harbour resident who spearheaded the small-claims 
action, said he and his neighbors will continue to refile claims against 
Zagustin until her home is maintained to their satisfaction or they force her 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Flynn and the others concede that Zagustin has cleaned up since the 
city took her to civil court, they say they have seen her fix up her property 
before, only to see it return to its former condition.

HERNANDEZ ASSOCIATE FACES JAIL; COURTS: MORTGAGE BROKER SHAWN G. CASSIDY PLEADS 
GUILTY TO INCOME TAX EVASION ARISING FROM PHONY COMMISSION SCHEME WITH 
SOCIALITE, WHO NOW IS SERVING 71-MONTH PRISON TERM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Convicted socialite Danny Hernandez's criminal dealings have claimed a fresh 
victim: Shawn G. Cassidy, his mortgage broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy and Hernandez struck a deal: Cassidy would lie to the Internal Revenue 
Service and say he paid Hernandez $257,000 in commissions, so that Cassidy 
could deduct that amount from his taxable income and Hernandez could claim it 
as income. 
</P>
<P>
 A former aide to Orange County supervisors Harriett M. Wieder and Roger R. 
Stanton, Cassidy pleaded guilty Monday in U.S. District Court to two counts of 
income tax evasion and faces up to 10 years in a federal prison and $500,000 in 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Hernandez received a 71-month prison sentence after pleading guilty 
to mail fraud and money laundering in connection with the theft of nearly $8 
million from the Santa Fe Springs precious metals company where he worked. His 
wife was sentenced to 16 months for her role in the scheme after pleading 
guilty to income tax evasion. Both are still in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy, 35, who was mortgage broker for the purchase of Hernandez's 
$1-million, 12-room house in Mission Viejo and for a second house Hernandez's 
parents bought in Trabuco Canyon -- admitted in court Monday to income tax 
evasion. He was not involved in the precious-metals theft. 
</P>
<P>
 In tax returns both men filed for 1990 and 1991, Cassidy claimed he paid 
Hernandez the $257,000 in commissions. It gave Hernandez a way to legitimize 
some of the exorbitant income he was making from the theft at his workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court papers, after meeting Hernandez and agreeing to list the 
phony commissions with the IRS, Cassidy reported his 1990 income as $80,389 and 
paid taxes of $26,239. However, his real income was $157,442 and he owed taxes 
of $51,666. His income in 1991 was reported as $52,934 and he paid taxes of 
$19,873 but he really made $246,838 and owed $78,922 in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 IRS investigators say he cheated the government out of nearly $85,000 in 
taxes, which he has since paid by filing amended tax returns. 
</P>
<P>
 In their investigation of Danny and Susie Hernandez, which began in 1991, 
federal authorities scrutinizing the Hernandez family's tax returns discovered 
the phony commissions. When they questioned Cassidy, he first said he had paid 
commissions to Hernandez for referring mortgage business to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then IRS agents said, 'Fine, then you must have the canceled checks for the 
commissions you paid him,' and he said, 'You got me,' " said Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Stephen Wolfe. "In all of Danny's bank accounts, we saw no trace of 
payments to Danny by Shawn Cassidy's company." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe said that although Cassidy was confronted in November, 1992, three 
months before the Hernandezes were arrested, his case is just now coming to an 
end because Cassidy had agreed to cooperate in the government's case against 
Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy, who lives in Encinitas, is scheduled for sentencing on Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe said he is recommending probation because of Cassidy's ready admission 
that he committed the crimes and because he helped with the Hernandez 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy is vice president and regional manager for TCS Mortgage in Mission 
Viejo. The company is based in San Diego. He has also worked for Bayshore 
Financial Corp. in Huntington Beach, where he was executive vice president and 
chief lending officer. 
</P>
<P>
 His conviction means Cassidy will have to surrender his real estate license, 
which is necessary to work as a mortgage broker. It is believed that he has not 
yet informed his employer of the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Between July, 1981, and April, 1984, he worked as an executive aide for Wieder 
and Stanton before going to work for World Savings & Loan Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a simple case of Mr. Cassidy underreporting on his taxes," said 
Vincent J. La Barbera, Cassidy's attorney. "He has paid his income taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy did not return a call for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Mr. Cassidy is a decent guy who was tempted by Danny Hernandez," 
Wolfe said. "This helped Hernandez try and cover his crime. The temptation he 
offered was greed, and Mr. Cassidy accepted. I think that's a shame."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: VILLA PARK; CITY WON'T ACCEPT ANONYMOUS TIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you want action on your complaint to City Hall, don't make an anonymous 
telephone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new policy adopted unanimously by the City Council, callers must give 
their name and address when making complaints about such things as dogs barking 
and the illegal parking of boats. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Fred W. Maley requested the policy change at the council's July 
26 meeting. He said City Hall has an almost impossible task in trying to check 
up on anonymous complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are very reluctant to state their names and addresses," Maley said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Kaysene Miller said the small size of Villa Park's city staff makes 
it difficult to check on the truthfulness of anonymous tips and complaints. "We 
don't have the ability to go out and search and document the incidents," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maley said the city staff attempts to determine the accuracy of complaints by 
telephoning the households alleged to be causing problems. But he said having 
no name or address of the complaining source often "renders us ineffectual" in 
prosecuting a violation of a city ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Leonard Hampel told the council that in its initial investigation 
of a complaint, the city does not need to disclose the name of the person who 
called in. "There's no reason on the front end to give out the name of the 
complaining party," Hampel said. But he added that if matters proceed into 
court, "to get a conviction, you really need the testimony of the complaining 
party." 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members said they could easily understand why residents hesitate 
in giving their names and addresses when calling in complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "We live in an age when people retaliate," Councilman Bob Patchin said. "I can 
understand that wish for anonymity." 
</P>
<P>
 But Patchin and the rest of the council ultimately agreed that anonymous 
complaints simply do not get the job done.BILL BILLITER

<P>
 About $1,300 has been raised over the past three weeks to help pay the medical 
bills of Trent McGee, the 7-year-old boy who was severely hurt in a car 
accident July 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Trent remained in critical condition Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 He cannot breathe without a respirator and is paralyzed from the neck down, 
said Beth Rion, a member of the McGee family. He was moved to the Tustin 
Rehabilitation Hospital last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Trent was hurt when an allegedly stolen sports car broadsided his family's 
station wagon at Irvine Center Drive and Jeffrey Road. The force of the crash 
pushed the station wagon against a traffic divider. 
</P>
<P>
 Trent's mother, Cheryl McGee, and his 10-year-old sister were not hurt. Trent 
suffered multiple head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the allegedly stolen car, 31-year-old John Eric Phelps of Dana 
Point, was arrested on suspicion of felony hit-and-run, evading arrest, grand 
theft auto and reckless driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund was set up at Great Western Bank, 3978 Barranca Parkway, Irvine, CA 
92714. The account number is 1841864192.SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TIPS ON VEHICLE THEFT PREVENTION GIVEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of California's second annual Vehicle Theft Prevention Week next week, 
Orange County law enforcement agencies will remind people to avoid becoming 
easy targets for thieves or carjackers while parking or driving. 
</P>
<P>
 The main precaution drivers can take, said California Highway Patrol spokesman 
Bruce Lian, is to park in a safe place, roll up the windows and lock all the 
doors.Lian suggested looking for a well-lighted space and parking away from the 
exits of large parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 Other good safety measures, he added, are to pay attention to the people who 
are near the parking space and to use some sort of burglar device, such as an 
alarm or steering-wheel locking bar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highway Patrol also says that would-be carjackers can be thwarted if 
drivers keep all their doors locked. 
</P>
<P>
 Lian said 20,214 cars were stolen in the county last year. Throughout the 
state, 313,804 cars were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Drivers are encouraged to etch their car's vehicle identification number into 
a flat surface of the car, a tactic that helps law enforcement agencies track 
stolen cars.LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; MAN GETS LIFE TERM FOR FATAL CARJACKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old Anaheim man was sentenced to life in prison without parole last 
week for his role in the 1992 slaying of a college student during one of the 
first fatal carjackings in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in May convicted Allen Dean Burnett II, who last worked as a 
telemarketer, on charges of first-degree murder, kidnaping, robbery and 
additional allegations in the murder of Joseph Andrew Kondrath, 23, of Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Kondrath, a Rancho Santiago College student, was last seen leaving for his job 
at a supermarket at 4 a.m. on June 10, 1992. Prosecutors said he was grabbed 
from behind the wheel of his car in front of his home, robbed of $1, then shot 
in the head as he lay crouched in the trunk of his car pleading, "Don't hurt 
me." Authorities alleged that he was murdered to eliminate him as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other men were also convicted in connection with the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged triggerman, Shawn Burney, 20, of Tustin, faces the death penalty 
when he is sentenced Sept. 2 by Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald. 
Scott Rembert, 22, of Anaheim was convicted of kidnaping, but jurors deadlocked 
on the other counts, including murder and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 In a court sentencing report, Burnett said he prays every night for the victim 
and his family and wanted the judge to know that he didn't want the victim to 
die. Burnett said he had been drinking heavily the night of the crime and had 
been drinking every day for six months before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really sorry that this whole thing happened," he wrote in a statement to 
the court. "I only wish there was a way I could have prevented it from 
happening. If I wasn't drunk, I know I could have done something to save his 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's father, Joseph Kondrath, said in the report that his anguish is 
even worse knowing that his son was a "perfectly innocent kid who was killed 
for the fun of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's mother, Joanna Kondrath, told authorities that she thought all 
three men should have gotten the death penalty.ANNA CEKOLA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; TRANSPLANT RECIPIENTS TO COMPETE IN GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County residents Travis Finnern and Paul Seville are among the more 
than 1,200 athletes from across the country who will compete in the National 
Kidney Foundation's 1994 U.S. Transplant Games. 
</P>
<P>
 This biennial, Olympic-style event will take place Wednesday through Sunday at 
Emory University in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 All the athletes are former transplant patients who have received donated 
organs such as kidneys, livers, hearts and lungs. Among the sporting events 
they will compete in are track and field, basketball, bicycling, racquetball, 
swimming, tennis and table tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Finnern, a 22-year-old Costa Mesa resident, is an avid tennis player and 
surfer who received a kidney from his father in 1986. Finnern said he and his 
father are doing well eight years after the surgery. "I was on dialysis for 
about a year" before the transplant, and suffered from anemia during that 
period, he said. Finnern said his health improved dramatically after the 
surgery, and he was able to play on the Costa Mesa High School tennis team. 
</P>
<P>
 Finnern is the court director at Seacliff Tennis Lodge in Huntington Beach and 
a music major at Golden West College. He will compete in singles and doubles 
tennis and possibly in basketball at the Transplant Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Seville, a 28-year-old Irvine resident, received a kidney transplant in 1979 
at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles. He is a medical school student planning to 
specialize in kidney diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Seville said he had experienced kidney problems since birth and never knew 
"what it was like to be normal." 
</P>
<P>
 "But once I received my transplant, I felt like Superman, and my 
self-confidence soared," Seville said. 
</P>
<P>
 He will compete in track and field and table tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the National Kidney Foundation, more than 34,000 people are 
currently waiting for organ transplants, including 5,000 in California. Six to 
seven die each day because of a lack of organ donors, the foundation reports.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; CITY MAY LOOK INTO STREET LIGHT BILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council today will consider creating a committee to study street 
lighting and to investigate whether the city is paying Southern California 
Edison Co. twice for some street lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Bruce A. Broadwater, who is pushing for the panel formation, said 
the committee also will look into complaints that some residents are paying 
more for their street lights than others. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Broadwater said, the committee could recommend that the city 
conduct an audit to determine how much the city has lost to double billing over 
the years and how the money could be recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we need an outside auditing firm to do it, we'll do it rather than 
in-house," Broadwater said. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Councilman Ray Littrell said during a meeting last week that the city 
may be paying for some street lights two times -- one on a flat rate and 
another on a metered rate. He added that the city could also be paying for 
street lights located outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Brad Martin, area manager of Southern California Edison Co., said the electric 
company is investigating the reports of double billing, but he said that only 
about nine street lights on Main Street and Garden Grove Boulevard may be 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the street lights appear on Edison maps as without meters. However, he 
said he is certain those street lights have meters. The city has paid $936 a 
year for the lights on a flat rate and $1,440 on the metered rate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin said he could not determine how long the double billing has been going 
on or how much the city has been overbilled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will negotiate a settlement with the city," Martin said. "It's the only 
thing we can do."BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; LITERACY PROGRAM HELPS 'OPEN DOORS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Manuel is 55, and all his life he's wanted to be able to read. 
</P>
<P>
 But during his childhood, he worked as a field laborer and often missed the 
start of the school year. He dropped out of school at 16, and has worked in 
construction for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Manuel never gave up, and like many other adults, he went to the Literacy 
Volunteers of America's Huntington Valley program at the Huntington Beach 
Central Library for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Manuel, one of about 1,400 students involved in the program over the 
past decade, can read. 
</P>
<P>
 His success story is one of many published in "Open Doors," a 60-page book 
produced by students, volunteers and the staff that celebrates the 10th 
anniversary of the local literacy program. In the book, Manuel wrote: "I am 
glad I went to the library for help. They have taught me more than I learned in 
all of my years at school. It's hard for a grown man to admit that he can't 
read, but don't be afraid. I have learned a great deal, and I am still 
learning." 
</P>
<P>
 Duan also wanted to learn to read, write and speak English. "When you are 
unable to read or write and are surrounded by people who can, you feel 
isolated," Duan wrote in her excerpt in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to learn enough to eventually get a good job and a secure 
future, which would not be possible without the ability to read and write." 
</P>
<P>
 "Open Doors" is filled with poignant stories written by adult literacy 
students and their tutors. The book chronicles students' desire to read and the 
obstacles and embarrassment they overcame to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Light, literacy program director, said the book was put together as a 
special memento to recognize students' accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Light said seeing their writings in print was a major achievement for the 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's done unbelievable things for their self-esteem," she said. "The most 
difficult job we have is not teaching them reading, but teaching them to 
believe that they can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Joanna Charleton, who has been a tutor for five years, lauded her student, 
Manuel, for being persistent: "He set his mind on his goals and didn't quit 
until he achieved his goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Light said the literacy program serves people who live in both Huntington 
Beach and Fountain Valley as well as neighboring cities. About 180 students are 
currently involved in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of them have some ability to read and/or write," Light said, adding that 
often these students "can't put pen to paper and express thoughts that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 10 years, about 1,300 volunteers have been trained to assist 
individual learners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like any type of volunteer work, there's just a gratification in helping 
others," Charleton said. "There's a real joy in sharing their achievements." 
</P>
<P>
 "Open Doors" is available for $5 a copy. A book signing will be held Aug. 25 
at 7 p.m. at the library, 7111 Talbert Ave. To buy the book or for information 
about the tutor training program, call (714) 375-5102.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; BUSINESSES NEAR MISSION HURTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The popular Mission San Juan Capistrano reports a 6% increase in visitors for 
the fiscal year ended June 30, but the owners of some downtown shops and 
restaurants that usually benefit from the tourist attraction say that business 
is poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is slow, the worst I've had in 12 years," said Ana M. Tejeda, owner 
of Ana's of Guatemala on Ortega Highway, close to the centuries-old attraction. 
"If you walk around town, you see a lot of empty spaces." 
</P>
<P>
 A task force, recently appointed by the city, has made promoting downtown 
businesses one of its goals, said Richard Hansen, Chamber of Commerce 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we are hearing from the folks in and around the mission whose 
livelihood depends on tourism that they have been impacted," Hansen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force will look into one rumor in downtown circles that the Mission 
San Luis Rey in North San Diego County has drawn tour buses that would have 
normally stopped in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Miller, business manager for the Mission San Juan Capistrano, said more 
tour buses are actually coming here. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who declined to release exact attendance figures for the mission, said 
the annual number of visitors in past years has hovered between 400,000 and 
500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Maggie Jones, gift shop manager at the Mission San Luis Rey, said tour buses 
were up a bit there over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we can't really say that we're taking (Mission San Juan Capistrano's) 
business," Jones said. "Their very worst day would be one of our best." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said downtown San Juan Capistrano businesses must do more than wait for 
mission tourists to walk by their shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been telling the Chamber of Commerce that we need to have something 
to give out to people for things to do in San Juan Capistrano," Miller said. 
"We shouldn't have to do that. We bring (tourists) into town." 
</P>
<P>
 Two employees at the Cafe Capistrano, easily visible across the street from 
the mission, said Monday that tourist-driven business is off considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have really seen a decline, period," said Leigh Jack, whose parents own 
the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is summer. This would normally be our good time," Phylis Frobish said 
between waiting on tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all downtown merchants say they are off from the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Hansen, part owner of Saint Nicholas Inc., said her numbers are up 
slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The business celebrated its 15th anniversary Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for tourists, we wouldn't be here," Hansen said. JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TRABUCO CANYON; WATER DISTRICT WILL GET PANEL'S ADVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid customer criticism of its plans to build a new headquarters in a rural 
area, the Trabuco Canyon Water District has created a community advisory 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials hope the group will improve communication between the 
district's 4,000 customers and its board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "This advisory committee is designed to represent the customers' perspective 
on the key activities and long-term projects that the district undertakes on 
their behalf," said Charles Wall, board president. 
</P>
<P>
 Lack of communication was one of the main complaints leveled against the 
district in a lawsuit filed by a group of homeowners who live near the planned 
construction site. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-building, 13,800-square-foot headquarters complex is to be built 
beside the district's water reclamation plant in the Trabuco Highlands 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 The 660-home Trabuco Highlands Community Assn. claimed that the district 
provided inadequate notice on hearings set to present the project to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said that environmental studies on the construction's impact were 
inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Forming the advisory committee "is like rearranging the deck chairs on the 
Titanic," said Mike Safranski, vice president of the homeowners association. 
</P>
<P>
 "My opinion of the committee is that it's a nonentity. Their scope is very 
limited." 
</P>
<P>
 However, last month an Orange County Superior Court Judge allowed the district 
to move ahead with the headquarters project. 
</P>
<P>
 Project opponents said they have filed an appeal of the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our decision to move ahead reflects the board's belief that this project will 
provide the most benefit to the entire community and to our customers," Wall 
said. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; PONY ALL-STARS TAKE 4TH IN TOURNAMENT

<P>
 The streak is over. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Niguel Pony League baseball all-stars were eliminated from 
post-season play this weekend, taking fourth out of nine teams at the Southern 
California regional tournament in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 That finish wasn't good enough to advance the 14-year-olds to the zone level 
of competition, but the players and coaches said they weren't too disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, this was the best showing of any Laguna Niguel Pony Leagueall-star 
team in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty happy with the success," said team manager Tom Grzecka, who said 
the players are already looking forward to their first high school baseball 
season next spring. "Sure I wish we were still playing, but we had a good run." 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel came out strong in their first game of the regional tournament 
Friday night, soundly defeating El Cajon, 11-5, behind five innings of strong 
pitching by Curt Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 The tables were turned Saturday, though, as Laguna Niguel lost, 20-11, to East 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday morning, Laguna Niguel squeaked by Chula Vista, a San Diego team, 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's second and final loss came Sunday night against Corona, 11-7. LYNN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; BUYER SOUGHT FOR BUSHARD SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 School district officials hope to find a buyer for the vacant Bushard 
Elementary School in Huntington Beach, which has become an eyesore for 
neighbors and a magnet for vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of attempts to develop the site, district officials said they hope 
to sell the property at 19699 Education Lane as soon as this month to a 
developer for single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, I'm sympathetic with their concerns, and we're doing the best we 
can to get the property developed to get rid of the problems," said Robert 
Sedlak, board president of the Fountain Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Ecker, assistant superintendent of administration and business, said 
three developers who are interested in the site will make public presentations 
to trustees on Aug. 10. Trustees could decide to accept an offer from one of 
the developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Stafford, who lives near the closed school, said the property has 
"become a real headache in the neighborhood -- a real problem. It's become a 
gang hangout and drug-dealing area." 
</P>
<P>
 Stafford said he has gathered signatures from more than 50 neighbors to 
petition the city of Huntington Beach and the Police Department to "enforce all 
laws and codes and with whatever action necessary to either demolish or correct 
the unsafe conditions and problems" at the school site. 
</P>
<P>
 Ecker said that the district has responded to community concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We mow the lawns on a regular basis and clean up the graffiti," Ecker said. 
He added that old furniture and appliances that people dump on the site are 
removed, and the parking lot has been chained off. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Sedlak said developers' proposals "look good. They're qualified, 
and they're giving us a fair price." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Huntington Beach City Council voted to allow the school 
site to be developed with houses, despite some opposition from residents. The 
council gave approval for 58 single-family homes on the 10-acre site. That 
approval is transferable to another developer as long as the original plans 
approved by the city are kept, Ecker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a deal fell through because the developer was unable to secure 
financing. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the school sale is important because the money will help the 
cash-strapped district. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need money desperately, and we think we can get a pretty good deal," Ecker 
said.DEBRA CANO

MAN, 30, SHOT TO DEATH AT HOME NEAR THEME PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was shot to death early Monday outside his home near Knott's Berry Farm 
after an argument overheard by neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Arturo Macias, 30, was shot in the head and chest about 2:40 a.m. 
and was later pronounced dead at West Anaheim Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were still investigating Monday afternoon and had made no arrests. 
Witnesses spotted two vehicles -- a white car resembling a Monte Carlo and a 
white van -- leaving the scene in the 7600 block of Crescent Avenue, Lt. Mike 
Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said they awakened to bursts of gunfire and then the screams of the 
victim's wife. Macias lay fatally wounded next to a Knott's Berry Farm parking 
lot, across the street from the couple's apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a big argument going on," neighbor R. O. Davis said. He declined to 
describe the dispute in detail but said the van left shortly before the 
shooting.  
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he heard "a barrage" of about six rapidly fired shots, then a pause 
and two or three more shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Leone, who manages a nearby apartment building, said the area is 
well-lighted and regularly patrolled by the amusement park's security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors said the couple and their two children moved into the apartment 
about two months ago and lived quietly. One neighbor said Macias occasionally 
cleaned carpets in the 12-unit building. 
</P>
<P>
 A strip of earth in front of the couple's apartment lay furrowed where a 
neighbor said Macias planned to plant roses and carnations.

 Capt. Craig Chastain will also explain how neighborhoods can work together

</P>
<P>
 "Most people think that all you have to do in a disaster is call the Fire 
Department," said Mary Reuland, secretary of Speak Up Newport. "But they are 
not going to be able to do that if we are hit really hard. People need to learn 
how to take care of themselves."

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two brothers were wounded early Monday when three members of a neighboring 
family across the street fired 15 to 20 shots, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The volleys, fired just after midnight in the 12800 block of Pearce Avenue, 
left brothers Joseph Erickson, 18, and his brother Matthew, 20, with leg 
wounds, Garden Grove Police Lt. John Woods said.The brothers were taken to UCI 
Medical Center, where they were treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 James Ronald Maxwell, 47, and his sons, John David, 20, and Thomas John, 21, 
were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, authorities said. They were 
being held at Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Police seized a shotgun, a .303-caliber rifle and a SKS assault-type rifle 
from the Maxwell home. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods said the shooting, which stemmed from a long-term neighborhood dispute, 
took place after Joseph Erickson parked his vehicle in front of his house and 
began walking home. Matthew Erickson, who was sitting inside the house, was 
struck by a stray bullet.

WARRANT OUT FOR SUSPECT IN SLAYING OF STORE MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police say they have identified and issued a warrant for a suspect in the July 
18 fatal shooting of an Alpha Beta night manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea police refused to identify the man until today, but said he also might 
have been involved in an attempted homicide and an armed bank robbery in 
October in the same shopping center, in the 17400 block of Yorba Linda 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The market manager, Timothy Eugene McVeigh, 34, of Santa Ana, was shot in the 
chest during the robbery and later died at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police the suspect was wearing a black, shoulder-length wig, 
similar to that worn by the bank robber. He was described as about 45, white, 
medium build, wearing glasses, blue jeans and a purple sweat shirt.

BIG DROP IN GRAFFITI CALLS REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Code enforcement officials reported a 44% decline in calls to the city's 
graffiti hot line during the first half of 1994. Officials interpreted the drop 
as a positive sign their "aggressive program of enforcement, abatement and 
education" is working. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are encouraged by the numbers," said Richard LaRochelle, code enforcement 
supervisor. "Thanks to the volunteer groups who are painting out graffiti in 
their neighborhoods on a regular basis, many of the locations are removed 
before anyone has a chance to call them in. Stepped-up education and 
enforcement efforts have resulted in a drop of graffiti incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 During the first six months in 1993, the hot line logged 1,461 calls, compared 
to 823 for the same period this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-hour bilingual hot line has been in place since 1989. The department's 
education program reaches an estimated 40,000 students in kindergarten through 
12th grade. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, more than 300 volunteers participated in "Paint Outs" sponsored by 
the code enforcement division, using 400 gallons of paint.

ORDINATION OF WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The recent pronouncement by the Pope, which forbids any debate or discussion 
(presumably by Roman Catholics) on the ordination of women to the priesthood, 
carries implications that are deeply disturbing to non-Roman Catholics who now 
are officially in dialogue with Roman Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 When the decree on Papal Infallibility was promulgated by the Vatican Council 
of 1870, it was pointed out that the Pope was infallible only when he spoke ex 
cathedra (that is, officially from his chair as supreme teacher of the Church 
on a subject of faith or morals).The latest pronouncement was not claimed to be 
infallible under these conditions. It is difficult to argue that the ordination 
of women involves any issue in faith or morals. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a member of the delegation from the Episcopal Church in Orange County to 
the Anglican-Roman Catholic Dialogue group. One cannot help but wonder what use 
such a dialogue is if, when we come to any serious difference of opinion 
between the churches, we are informed that our Roman Catholic participants are 
under orders not to discuss such a matter. 
</P>
<P>
 There is much to be said on both sides of this -- and other debates between 
the two churches -- but we are now told that such a dialogue is forbidden. Of 
course it is pleasant to meet and plan occasional demonstrations of our concern 
and respect for one another, but the promise of the dialogue was more serious 
than that. That more serious promise now seems unwarranted.

POSSIBLE JAIL EXPANSION

 * I find it interesting that Orange is so upset about a Theo Lacy (jail) 
expansion.Maybe we should put it on the spring, 1995 ballot. That way all of 
the citizens of Orange County can have a say in an issue that involves our

CLINTON TO TAKE CASE FOR INVASION OF HAITI TO PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON and STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, armed with "very strong coalition" support in the United 
Nations, is preparing to go to the American people with his case for ousting 
Haiti's military dictators by force unless they step down voluntarily, Leon E. 
Panetta, Clinton's chief of staff, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arguments are there," Panetta said. "A military dictatorship in our back 
yard, impacting clearly on our policies . . . . affecting not only U.S. 
citizens but a huge number of Haitian refugees impacting on policies of our 
country. So for all those reasons, it is a matter of national interest in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the President will get that message across to the American people," 
beginning with a news conference scheduled for prime time Wednesday, Panetta 
said in an interview with The Times. A major address to the nation on Haiti 
also is being planned, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Panetta's expression of optimism, Clinton faces growing opposition in 
Congress and continuing defiance from the military government in Haiti, as well 
as public opinion polls showing that most Americans are not convinced that 
sending U.S. troops to intervene in the Caribbean nation is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 In Haiti, the ruling regime defiantly clamped "a state of siege" -- a 
repression of civil rights akin to martial law -- on its people. It was the 
government's first reaction to the U.N. authorization of a possible U.S.-led 
invasion to restore ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Washington, Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) introduced a 
resolution expressing the view that U.N. approval is not enough under the U.S. 
Constitution to permit an American invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before invading Haiti, the United States has checked in with the United 
Nations Security Council, but I would also hope they check in with Congress," 
Dole said. "International support is fine, but it is no substitute for the 
support of Congress and the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole made it clear, however, that the Clinton Administration would get no 
support from him if it did ask for congressional authorization. "There is no 
emergency in Haiti requiring the dispatch of American troops," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, insisted Monday 
that the U.N. resolution, passed by the Security Council only a day earlier, 
had driven home a tough message to Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and his confederates 
in Haiti. Although they may have "some doubt in their minds about the timing," 
she said, they now have "no doubts in their minds about the resolve to solve 
this situation." She derided the Haitian government's declaration of a state of 
siege as evidence that the military leaders "are getting very nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 But Emile Jonassaint, the Haitian president installed by the military three 
months ago over worldwide protests, denounced the U.N. resolution as 
"arbitrary, iniquitous and in violation of international rights." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole world has declared war on Haiti," Jonassaint, an 81-year-old former 
Haitian Supreme Court justice, said in a radio broadcast. "Seventy-nine years 
after the landing of U.S. Marines on our national soil, a threat of invasion 
and occupation of our country is in the works." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Haitian law, a state of siege allows the military government to assume 
all civil powers, with the authority to ban public meetings, close newspapers 
and radio stations, search homes without warrants and impose a curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jonassaint announced the imposition of the state of siege Monday, 
Haiti -- according to human rights monitors from the United Nations and the 
Organization of American States -- has been operating for months with scant 
attention to laws. The monitors, who were expelled three weeks ago, accused the 
Haitian military and its allies of murdering, kidnaping and raping in a reign 
of terror against Aristide supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing Administration policy, Panetta said that "it would serve no 
purpose" for Washington to set a deadline for the dictators to resign, but he 
added: "Obviously the message is pretty clear. The message is that they should 
step down and if they don't, we're going to take action to make sure that they 
do. That's not to say we aren't going to continue to press them with sanctions 
and to press with other options." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has deployed more than 2,000 Marines on amphibious assault 
ships that are part of a flotilla of 14 U.S. warships near the British-governed 
Turks and Caicos Islands just north of Haiti. Argentine President Carlos Saul 
Menem has said that he would ask his Congress to authorize the dispatch of 600 
troops to Central America and the Caribbean for possible use in a U.S.-led 
invasion. Some Caribbean countries are also expected to send small forces. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the United States is making 
requests for other troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to spell these out," he said, "but we have had very productive 
discussions within the hemisphere." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration also asked Israel to send troops, but Deputy 
Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin rejected the idea of offering forces. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry ridiculed Jonassaint and the Haitian military commanders for 
proclaiming the state of siege at 3 a.m. -- "the only time that the de facto 
government apparently can stomach the courage to address the citizens of 
Haiti."

ACCORD REACHED TO END BUS STRIKE; TRANSIT: PROPOSED AGREEMENT BETWEEN MECHANICS 
AND MTA OFFICIALS FACES UNION VOTE TODAY. IF APPROVED, FULL SERVICE MAY NOT 
RESUME UNTIL END OF THE WEEK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an all-night bargaining session, striking transit mechanics forged a 
tentative agreement with MTA officials early Monday that could end their 
eight-day walkout, but normal service for hundreds of thousands of beleaguered 
Los Angeles bus and train riders may not resume until the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board unanimously approved 
the proposed settlement Monday evening, union leaders said the strike that has 
crippled the region's transit system will continue until the 1,900 mechanics 
cast their votes in a closed-door meeting today. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the union ratifies the agreement, MTA officials say, it could take 72 
hours to summon drivers, inspect buses and dispatch the agency's normal fleet 
of 1,900 buses to 200 routes -- only 17% of which have been served during the 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great. I'll be able to get back and forth to work at the speed I want," 
said Victor Woo, a Koreatown sales manager whose round-trip bus commute during 
the strike has taken six hours. "It's been a real big hassle." 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides declined to discuss most details of the preliminary settlement, 
which was reached at 3:55 a.m. Monday over coffee at a Burbank hotel suite. The 
marathon 12-hour negotiating session came on the heels of a bitter breakdown in 
talks Friday afternoon that seemed to derail any hope of early resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will recommend to ratify this contract, that's all I can say," said Mike 
Bujosa, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Bujosa planned to present a summary of the 20-page pact to union members in a 
meeting at the Los Angeles Convention Center at 3 p.m. today. After hashing out 
details of the proposal, the union will pass out ballots and vote on the 
settlement. A simple majority is necessary for ratification and a tally is 
expected by early evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The sticking point in talks had centered on the agency's desire to contract 
out work to non-union companies. Under the proposed agreement, a committee of 
union members and MTA officials will approve any controversial subcontracts to 
private companies, said Manuel Guerra, a union shop steward. The union will 
agree to allow the MTA to do some subcontracting, such as body work on company 
cars, Guerra said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed settlement, dozens of mechanics laid off last month will be 
rehired when current positions become vacant, according to MTA officials. The 
agreement also will allow the agency to hire some new union members at lower 
wages. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA board unanimously approved the agreement after a 55-minute, 
closed-door meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a fair and equitable agreement -- fair to the union members, fair to 
the MTA, fair to our riders and fair to the public and taxpayers," said 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, chairman of the MTA. "It is a good example of 
compromise. We didn't get everything we wanted, and I'm sure the unions didn't 
get everything they wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan said the public will benefit because "what we're going 
to do is have much better and more efficient service, particularly in the 
transit-needy parts of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin White, the MTA's chief executive officer, said he hoped to restore 
full bus service by Friday. "We will be back to 100% by the end of the week," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several picketing drivers and mechanics, who did not know the details of the 
newly crafted settlement, said they had begun to feel the financial pinch of a 
week with no pay and were ready to end the transit strike -- the region's first 
in 12 years and the longest in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad they did it -- we've been ready to get back to work," said Richard 
Danleis, who has driven a bus for 18 years. "I've got four kids and a wife who 
doesn't work, so believe me, it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Payne, a mechanic for 17 years, spent the last week picketing the 
South-Central bus yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it goes through I'll be one of the happiest guys out here," Payne said. "I 
want to get out of this sun." 
</P>
<P>
 When Van Nguyen learned of the joint MTA-union committee that will review 
subcontracting issues, he said he was concerned that it would lead to fewer 
union jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that's a good idea. . . . When you subcontract, people lose 
their jobs," said the 33-year-old El Monte mechanic. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen and other mechanics could return to work as early as tonight if the 
settlement is approved. This would allow agency officials to start up limited 
service on every line by Wednesday afternoon, said MTA spokeswoman Andrea 
Greene. But it will take several days to deploy the MTA's usual fleet because 
each bus will need to be inspected before it can hit the streets, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Expecting the strike to end, about 30 drivers, clerks and mechanics crossed 
the picket line to report to work Monday. "People are getting antsy," Greene 
said. "They want their paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,900 mechanics walked off the job eight days ago after they were unable 
to reach an agreement on a new three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5,000 clerks, bus and train drivers, whose unions had reached 
last-minute tentative agreements, walked out in support -- creating hours of 
delays for about 500,000 bus passengers who struggled to reach destinations 
with the MTA's skeletal bus service. 
</P>
<P>
 For bus riders, the prospect of a settlement meant an end to long waits at 
crowded bus stops. But many passengers were skeptical about the tentative 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't believe it's over until I see more buses out here," said Maria 
Cedillo, 27, waiting for the first of three buses she needed to travel from her 
Northridge home to Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the strike began, Cedillo has walked 45 minutes in the sweltering heat 
each day. "Look at my feet. They're cracking," she said, pointing at her 
sandals. 
</P>
<P>
 At bus stops, most passengers were angry, feeling they had been the victims of 
the complicated wrangling at the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the strike will end, maybe not," said Carmen Cruz, 38, of Pacoima, as 
she waited at a Van Nuys Boulevard bus stop. "I don't think either the bus 
drivers or their bosses were thinking about us. They know we have nowhere else 
to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Others vowed that they would no longer depend on public transit -- a pledge 
that MTA officials had predicted when they warned striking union members that 
ridership would drop after the walkout. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin Stubblefield, a 22-year-old manager of a Van Nuys shoe store, said he 
hoped he had taken his last bus ride. Stubblefield cobbled together a piecemeal 
system of commuting by car-pooling from his Silver Lake home with his 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to ride another bus in my life," he said. "(The strike) showed 
me there were other ways to get around than the ol' bus. And for that, I'm 
thankful." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, on Day 8 of the Los Angeles bus strike: 
</P>
<P>
 * MTA officials reported that 313 buses were on the streets Monday morning, 
but they expected the number to grow to 385 by the end of the day -- a number 
they hoped to deploy today as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * The United Transportation Union and Transportation Clerks Union began 
mailing ballots to their members, apprising them of the details of the 
tentative agreements reached at the end of last month. It was the second 
mailing for the United Transportation Union because the first one contained an 
error. The ballots are due back later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratification is far from assured, some observers say. Last month, union 
leaders for Bay Area Rapid Transit workers reached a tentative agreement only 
to have it soundly rejected by the rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 UTU and TCU officials said their members will return to work once the 
mechanics ratify an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Nicholas Riccardi and Timothy Williams contributed to this 
report. The MTA Strike: Day 8 
</P>
<P>
 The region's first transit strike in 12 years began at 12:01 a.m. July 25. 
Here is a look at Day 8: 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ISSUE: Dispute between the Amalgamated Transit Union, representing 1,900 
mechanics and service attendants, and the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority. About 5,000 bus and train drivers and clerks are honoring picket 
lines. The major sticking point is the MTA's demand to contract out work. Union 
members say they believe that would eliminate jobs and result in poorer quality 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE STATUS: Union leaders and MTA officials hammered out a tentative 
agreement early Monday. Union members are scheduled to vote on the accord 
today. If the union members approve, partial bus service will resume Wednesday 
and full service by Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT'S OPERATING: The transit agency planned to run 385 buses today serving 
portions of the 38 busiest routes, out of the usual 1,900 buses on 200 routes. 
Some routes will use school buses, operated by private drivers, identified by 
"M" logos on the front and back. Service is continuing on the Red Line, Amtrak, 
Metrolink commuter rail and municipal/private operators such as Foothill 
Transit, L.A. city commuter express and DASH. The Blue Line is offering limited 
service.

TOBACCO FIRM SOUGHT TO CULL STUDIES AS 'DEADWOOD'; LITIGATION: LAWYER WROTE 
MEMO AS COMPANY RESISTED EFFORTS IN WRONGFUL DEATH SUITS TO DISCLOSE RESEARCH. 
</P>

<P>
 It was an interesting time to be cleaning house. 
</P>
<P>
 The year was 1985, and tobacco companies, facing a surge in wrongful death 
claims, were being pressed to disclose internal documents on their knowledge of 
the risks of smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as they fought the discovery requests, lawyers at Brown & Williamson 
Tobacco Corp., the third biggest U.S. cigarette maker, sought to clear what 
they called "deadwood" from company files. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo that used the term seven times, B&W corporate counsel J. Kendrick 
Wells said he had advised Earl Kohnhorst, B&W's vice president for research, 
development, and engineering, on the need to prune scientific reports from his 
files. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells said he had marked certain reports "with an X" to designate those that 
"were deadwood in the behavioral and biological studies area." 
</P>
<P>
 These papers, he wrote, should be segregated, boxed and put in the basement 
for possible shipment to B&W's parent firm, BAT Industries, in England. But no 
one "should make any notes, memos or lists" of the documents, Wells said in the 
Jan. 17, 1985, memo, recently leaked to several news organizations and 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether B&W sent scientific reports from its Louisville, Ky., headquarters to 
England is unknown. Company officials have refused to say if they took Wells' 
advice. What is known is that the industry's legal efforts -- including fierce 
resistance to disclosing internal documents -- were a huge success. 
</P>
<P>
 The cigarette makers repulsed about 150 lawsuits in the 1980s, preserving 
their record of never paying a nickel in settlements or judgments to people 
seeking damages for smoking-related illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that a few losses could bring an avalanche of claims, the companies 
assigned platoons of lawyers to fight each suit, sparing no expense to 
overwhelm their opponents. By resisting every motion and appealing every ruling 
that could be appealed, they exploited the cash-flow problems of plaintiff 
lawyers, who worked for contingency fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a handful of cases made it to trial. Some were dismissed by judges, but 
many plaintiffs -- drained by the industry's hardball tactics -- simply gave 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "To paraphrase General Patton, the way we won these cases was not by spending 
all of Reynolds' money, but by making that other son of a bitch spend his," 
crowed a memo by an RJ Reynolds lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the other cigarette makers, Brown & Williamson stubbornly fought requests 
for internal memos and reports on smoking and health. But here the company was 
more successful than its rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris, Lorillard, and Liggett Group, for example, were compelled by 
court orders to surrender reams of internal records in the Cipollone wrongful 
death case in New Jersey. Disclosure of the documents during the 1988 trial 
triggered a flood of bad publicity and a $400,000 damage award against Liggett 
that was reversed on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Williamson, on the other hand, apparently was not forced in any of 
its lawsuits to disclose similar sensitive documents. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some legal experts say the "deadwood" memo puts the firm's resistance 
in a new light. If B&W sought to conceal evidence in the midst of relevant 
litigation or knowing court battles were likely, experts say the firm may have 
violated state criminal laws and standards of legal ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in both Texas and New Jersey, where B&W faced injury claims, it 
was a crime to destroy, conceal or remove any "record, document . . . or thing" 
to impair its availability in an "official proceeding" -- including a civil 
court case. 
</P>
<P>
 The model rules of conduct of the American Bar Assn. held it improper to 
counsel clients to unlawfully destroy or hide "a document or other material 
having potential evidentiary value." Kentucky State Bar rules stated that a 
lawyer should "not suppress any evidence that he or his client has a legal 
obligation to reveal or produce." 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses aren't required to save paperwork forever. Some balance legal and 
housekeeping requirements with formal record retention policies that dictate 
how long to keep records. It is common practice to make opponents work hard in 
lawsuits to get information. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts in legal ethics and procedure say it is improper at best to purge 
documents based on their potential value to legal adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these experts said the deadwood memo raises suspicions that that is 
what B&W was up to. Among other things, they questioned why Wells' memo said to 
keep no lists of the "deadwood" documents -- and how a lawyer could know better 
than B&W's vice president for research what was scientific deadwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Some legal experts also questioned why true deadwood would be parked offshore 
and not merely trucked to a landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Deadwood' sounds like a euphemism," said Geoffrey Hazard, a law professor 
at the University of Pennsylvania and expert in civil procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unethical to disguise evidence to keep it from an opponent who has a 
right to it," said Richard Lempert, a professor of law and sociology at the 
University of Michigan. "I find it suspicious that they were going to keep the 
documents in storage but wanted no 'notes, memos or lists' which might reveal 
to others the documents were there." 
</P>
<P>
 If the documents "genuinely were deadwood . . . there would be no reason not 
to destroy them," added Stephen Bundy, a professor of legal ethics at the UC 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Conspicuous in the memo was a statement that "Janus" studies be among those 
treated as deadwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Janus" -- the two-faced Roman god who is the patron of beginnings and endings 
-- was the name for a secret program of biological research conducted in 
Germany for B&W's parent, BAT, from 1965-78. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Janus" research included numerous animal experiments on the effects of 
smoking. Among other things, they confirmed that mice painted with tars from 
tobacco smoke developed tumors. Other Janus studies compared the toxicity of 
smoke from different cigarettes and types of tobacco. Thus, the "Janus" reports 
would be of great interest to plaintiffs probing what the industry knew and 
when. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, studies are not 'deadwood' at all," said William Townsley, a Texas 
lawyer who filed several unsuccessful claims against B&W and other tobacco 
companies. " 'Deadwood' would be something that no longer had any usefulness," 
he said. "You don't go around destroying research data." 
</P>
<P>
 The deadwood memo is among thousands of pages of B&W documents leaked in May 
to anti-smoking members of Congress and several news organizations, including 
The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 B&W officials say the documents were stolen by a former paralegal for a 
Louisville law firm that represents the company. The paralegal was under a 
court injunction not to disclose the documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Wells, now B&W's assistant general counsel for product litigation, and 
Kohnhorst, now executive vice president and chief operating officer, declined 
comment when reached by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Said company spokesman Tom Fitzgerald: "We cannot discuss this or other stolen 
documents because they are covered by attorney-client privilege." 
</P>
<P>
 Court records indicate that 50 liability claims were filed against B&W during 
the 1980s. The Times contacted the lawyers who filed 49 of these claims; 
lawyers in the other case could not be reached. In the 49 cases, no significant 
discovery was obtained from B&W before the cases were dismissed or abandoned, 
according to interviews and court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical of their efforts was the case in Washington state of lung cancer 
victim Jimmy Newell, a shipyard worker who sued asbestos manufacturers, B&W and 
a second cigarette maker whose brands he had smoked. 
</P>
<P>
 When Newell's lawyers filed interrogatories concerning B&W's involvement in 
research on the health consequences of smoking, B&W responded that it objected 
to questions that used phrases "such as 'the health consequences of cigarette 
smoking'. . . . Such phrases are vague, ambiguous and unintelligible in that 
B&W cannot reasonably ascertain their meaning," the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Newell asked if B&W had destroyed any documents on smoking and health, 
B&W objected that the question was "overly broad and argumentative." 
</P>
<P>
 Given B&W's long-held position that smoking is neither addictive nor a proven 
risk to health, it is clear why the company would not have wanted to disclose 
the internal papers that recently came to light. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them are memos and reports dating to the 1960s in which top officials of 
B&W and BAT, then known as British-American Tobacco, declared that nicotine was 
addictive. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in a July, 1963, memo, B&W general counsel Addison Yeaman said 
the company was "in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug 
effective in the release of stress mechanisms." 
</P>
<P>
 In the memo, written several months before the U.S. Surgeon General's landmark 
1964 report linking smoking and lung cancer, Yeaman also predicted the industry 
would be unable to disprove the cancer connection. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the best," he wrote, "the probabilities are that some combination of 
constituents of smoke will be found conducive to the onset of cancer or to 
create an environment in which cancer is more likely to occur." 
</P>
<P>
 "Holy ----," said an outraged plaintiff's lawyer, whose lawsuits against B&W 
were abandoned, after seeing the Yeaman memo for the first time last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is completely and 100% contra the party line that they've been taking 
that nicotine is not addictive, that anybody can quit smoking who wants to," 
said the lawyer, who would not speak if identified because of concern about 
B&W's assertion that the leaked documents were stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's smoke coming out of these documents," he said. "I've never seen any 
of this stuff before, and had I seen it, I would have used it." 
</P>
<P>
 Another leaked document -- minutes from a 1962 research conference in England 
attended by scientists from B&W -- quoted British-American research director 
James Green's suggestion that "we should adopt the attitude that the causal 
link between smoking and lung cancer was proven, because then at least we could 
not be any worse off." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the minutes, Anthony D. McCormick, a member of British-American's 
board of directors, remarked at the meeting that acknowledging the risks of 
smoking would be irresponsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had not only your own business to consider but the employees throughout 
the industry, retailers, consumers, farmers growing the leaf, and so on, and 
you were in much too responsible a position to get up and say: 'I accept that 
the product which we and all our competitors are putting on the market gives 
you lung cancer,' whatever you might think privately," McCormick was quoted as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
 According to letters and memos, B&W lawyers were particularly worried about 
legal fallout from statements and writings by BAT scientists who were engaged 
in sensitive research and tended toward blunt statements on smoking and health. 
Like an adolescent mortified by clumsy parents, B&W was ever fretful its 
British corporate parent would cause legal embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1970 letter from B&W's outside lawyers to the firm's general counsel was 
almost passionate about the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter, David R. Hardy of Shook, Hardy & Bacon, which represented B&W 
and other tobacco firms, warned that ill-advised statements attributed to B&W's 
parent might be used against B&W in court. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, Hardy cited minutes of British-American's research conference 
in Germany in 1969 that cited "the possibility of distinct adverse health 
reactions to smoke aerosol: (a) Lung Cancer (b) Emphysema and bronchitis." 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," Hardy wrote, "we would make every effort to 'explain' such 
statements if we were confronted with them during a trial, but I seriously 
doubt that the average juror would follow or accept the subtle distinctions and 
explanations that we would be forced to urge." 
</P>
<P>
 It is one thing when "known enemies" claim smoking is dangerous, continued 
Hardy, who died in 1976. "Our problem becomes entirely different and far more 
serious when agents and employees of the defendant cigarette company or its 
parent become the spokesmen against us," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our opinion . . . documentary evidence from the files of either BAT or B&W 
which seems to acknowledge or tacitly admit that cigarettes cause cancer or 
other disease would likely be fatal to the defense . . . in a smoking and 
health case." 
</P>
<P>
 These fears intensified as BAT continued its programs of biological research. 
According to memos, B&W would be unable to distance itself from the research 
because it was helping to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 In two 1979 memos, corporate counsel Wells said B&W should route incoming 
research reports through the company's law department. That way, he wrote, the 
company could claim the reports were produced for litigation purposes. (Under 
the doctrine of "attorney work-product," documents produced for use by a 
company's lawyers usually can be withheld from adversaries.) 
</P>
<P>
 However, B&W remained fearful of being tied to the research in Europe. "The 
problem posed by BAT scientists and frequently used consultants who believe 
cause (that smoking causes disease) is proven is difficult," Wells wrote in a 
memo in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Wells later sought other safeguards against the buildup of sensitive 
documents. In a February, 1986, memo, he said he had asked B&W scientists and 
engineers to stop requesting status reports on all but the most vital research. 
</P>
<P>
 From now on, the memo said, "B&W will receive concise reports, estimated to be 
about one-half page in length, twice each year for each project it wishes to 
follow. While the brevity of the reports will reduce the potential for receipt 
by B&W of information useful to a plaintiff, disadvantageous information could 
be included and the reports could serve as road maps for a plaintiff's lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 These precautions reflected the enormous financial stakes of the cigarette 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Should the lawsuits produce large damage awards, "pressure will develop in the 
Congress for superfund legislation applicable to smoking and health lawsuits," 
Wells warned in a 1985 memo. "Such a fund would be financed by contributions 
from cigarette manufacturers amounting to a large percentage of profits." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing of the sort has happened. But the tobacco companies find themselves 
under renewed legal pressure, and the B&W documents are not helping their 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last few months, the industry has been rocked by several 
developments, including the Food and Drug Administration's announcement that it 
is considering whether to regulate nicotine as a drug. The 'Deadwood' Memo 
</P>
<P>
 Early in 1985, J. Kendrick Wells, a top lawyer for Brown & Williamson Tobacco 
Corp., wrote a memo outlining his directive to clear "deadwood" from the files 
of the cigarette company's research and development department. Wells wrote 
that he advised Earl Kohnhorst, the department's director, to box the documents 
-- including some describing a project called "Janus," which confirmed that 
tobacco smoke causes tumors in animals -- for possible shipment overseas. B & W 
workers were not to make any note of the contents. 
</P>
<P>
 ONE STATE'S LAW 
</P>
<P>
 Several states in which smoking-related lawsuits were filed against Brown & 
Williamson have laws that prohibit the concealment of evidence in court 
proceedings. New Jersey's law is typical: "A person commits a crime of the 
fourth degree if, believing that an official proceeding or investigation is 
pending or about to be instituted, he . . . alters, destroys, conceals or 
removes any article, object, record, document or other thing of physical 
substance with purpose to impair its verity or availability in such proceeding 
or investigation."

GERMANY ASKS FOR POLAND'S FORGIVENESS; EUROPE: APOLOGY ISSUED ON THE 50TH 
ANNIVERSARY OF THE WARSAW UPRISING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 German President Roman Herzog, attending memorial services here marking the 
50th anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, issued an extraordinary public apology 
Monday for the suffering Germany caused Poland in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, I bow down before the fighters of the Warsaw Uprising as before all 
Polish victims of the war," Herzog said after laying a wreath draped in the 
German tricolor at the foot of this city's monument to the failed rebellion. "I 
ask for forgiveness for what has been done to you by Germans." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Polish uprising veterans who had gathered from around the world 
for the late-night commemoration broke into applause, continuing the ovation 
until Herzog returned to his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here to hear him say this. Millions of Poles have been waiting for 
this," said Irena Kwiatkowska, 60, who described herself as a "small child 
living in hell" during the uprising. "It took 50 years, but he said it." 
</P>
<P>
 Herzog's remarks were seen as the most important act of German contrition 
toward Poland since 1970, when Chancellor Willy Brandt knelt at the site of 
Warsaw's Jewish ghetto, the scene of an earlier uprising suppressed by the 
Nazis. Even that event, many Poles believe, was more a gesture toward Jews than 
all Poles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It fills us Germans with shame that the name of our country and people will 
forever be associated with pain and suffering, which was inflicted on Poland a 
million times," Herzog said. "We mourn the dead of the Warsaw Uprising and all 
people who lost their lives in World War II." 
</P>
<P>
 The apology was all the more significant because it came against a backdrop of 
intense controversy over the decision to invite German and Russian leaders to 
the remembrance, which marks one of the bloodiest chapters in Polish history. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of Warsaw rose up against their German occupiers Aug. 1, 1944, but 
the ensuing 63-day rebellion was a military failure. More than 200,000 Poles, 
most of them civilians, were killed, and about 500,000 deported to 
concentration camps. Angry Nazi troops dynamited huge sections of the city, 
leaving it uninhabitable and mostly in ruins when they retreated several months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 While the battle was against the Germans, many Poles hold the Russians largely 
responsible for the debacle because Soviet leader Josef Stalin refused to allow 
his forces, which had advanced to the city's outskirts, to assist the poorly 
armed rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Polish veterans were so outraged by the presence of Herzog and Sergei A. 
Filatov, chief of staff to Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin, at Monday's 
remembrance that they staged alternative ceremonies. The anniversary also 
served to revive feelings of bitterness toward Germany and Russia among the 
general public, with a public opinion poll released Monday showing that only 
30% of Poles believe the two countries would make good allies. 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks Monday evening, Herzog addressed such skepticism, saying he 
understands the sentiment but asking both Poles and Germans to seek a new era 
of reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Polish President Lech Walesa, who invited Herzog and Yeltsin as an act of 
healing, said the time had come for Poles to live in friendship with their 
former enemies and move toward integration in a greater Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not give absolution to the murderers in Warsaw, but we do not pass 
those feelings upon the German nation," Walesa said. "Blood and hatred are a 
curse of the 20th Century; may they disappear in the past along with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Vice President Al Gore, representing the United States at the commemoration, 
called the Warsaw insurgents "noble martyrs" who preserved the dignity of the 
Polish people, but he also said the cycle of hatred in Central Europe should be 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
 The coolest reception of the evening was reserved for Filatov, who was sent to 
represent Yeltsin. Many Poles didn't want any Russian presence at the 
commemoration, but they were offended nonetheless when Yeltsin declined to 
attend himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Filatov spoke only briefly, reading a letter from Yeltsin and emphasizing the 
great losses both Russia and Poland suffered in World War II. He said both 
peoples were victims of Stalinism, and he assured Poles that democratic Russia 
"will not commit the mistakes we committed in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks were greeted with only polite applause, with one woman in the 
audience asking aloud, "Where is the 'We are sorry?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Poles held a more private ceremony at Pilsudski Square, 
the site of the tomb of the unknown soldier and a revered national gathering 
place near Warsaw's oldest quarter. The solemn event, which included a military 
parade and a Mass, was to have been attended by Herzog and Filatov. But 
organizers removed the foreign dignitaries from the guest list after veterans 
groups threatened to protest the gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should have invited young people, not the old ones who were shooting at 
us," said veteran Eugeniusz Rajewski, who traveled from Sweden for the 
remembrance.

<P>
 Dig it. The beats are back. 
</P>
<P>
 The novelists and poets of the Beat Generation, literary rebels who battled 
the alienation and conformity of the 1950s in their own jazz-inflected voice, 
are enjoying a revival. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still the only real rebellion," beat poet and painter Lawrence 
Ferlinghetti, 75, said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time the beats have resurfaced in mainstream culture. 
But this time, the phenomenon is deeper and wider. Beginning in the late 1980s, 
beat-era cultural references began popping up and have continued at an 
increasing pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the beats -- once the consummate outsiders -- are being embraced 
by the same Establishment players that shunned and mocked them: academia, the 
publishing world and the mass media. 
</P>
<P>
 * Scorned for decades by literature professors as semiliterate barbarians, 
beat writers are being added to college curricula. New York University held a 
weeklong conference in May heralding the return of the beats and discussing 
their profound influence on modern art, poetry and prose. Six hundred people 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Berkeley is interested in obtaining Kerouac's papers; Stanford is dickering 
for Ginsberg's. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long considered too obscene, formless or rebellious for students, beat 
poetry is being collected into an anthology for high school students, "Beat and 
Beyond," to be published by Henry Holt. "The beats were interested in protest, 
outrage and nonconformity and those are eternally the concerns of youth," said 
anthology editor David Kherdian. 
</P>
<P>
 Other publishing houses are rushing to release beat works. All of Kerouac's 
major novels are back in print. A number of documentary film projects are under 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ginsberg, 68, whose 1955 poem "Howl" provoked a landmark obscenity trial, is 
drawing standing- room-only audiences this year with readings from his new 
book, "Cosmopolitan Greetings." In June, he recited a poem from the pitcher's 
mound at Candlestick Park before a San Francisco Giants game. 
</P>
<P>
 Booted out of Czechoslovakia as a subversive in 1965, he was treated as a 
conquering cultural hero when he toured the nascent democracies of Eastern 
Europe where beat works, no longer banned, are bestsellers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola is working on a script for a possible movie 
of Kerouac's 1957 novel "On The Road," the seminal work of the beat movement. 
Television, which stereotyped beats as bongo-beating clowns, has rediscovered 
the energy and youthful anger that underpins beat sensibility. An ambitious 
series for the upcoming season, "Rebel Highway," set in the 1950s, has an "On 
The Road" flavor. In one episode of the TV series "Quantum Leap," the hero 
travels back in time to meet Kerouac. 
</P>
<P>
 References to the beats have also popped up in popular songs, advertising 
(Gilbey's Gin and The Gap) and movies ("Field of Dreams," "Matinee," "Peggy Sue 
Got Married"). 
</P>
<P>
 Beat-imitating poets are hot in New York clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several theories about why the beats still resonate. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, writers such as Ginsberg, Kerouac, Ferlinghetti, Michael 
McClure, Gregory Corso, William Burroughs ("Naked Lunch"), Diane DiPrima, Gary 
Snyder, Philip Whalen and others remain forceful and compelling, particularly 
for the young. 
</P>
<P>
 "The music, the ideas, the spiritual seeking still have juice, tremendous 
juice," said Anne Waldman, a poet, confidante of Ginsberg and director of the 
Jack Kerouac School of Disembodied Poetics at the Naropa Institute in Boulder, 
Colo., a college dedicated to Buddhist teachings. 
</P>
<P>
 During a July tribute at Naropa attended by several hundred students, Ginsberg 
was asked why the beats are winning a new audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically," he answered in typically concise beat fashion, "because of the 
sincerity of the works of art, the passion, the feeling of self-empowerment, 
independent of government, media and social conditioning, the breaking out of 
the plastic mass into human flesh and blood, vulnerability and tenderness, 
which is a good model for younger people and which I think they are now being 
attracted to after 20 years of the Reagan-Bush-Nixonian ugly spirit, put-down 
of the human spirit, devastation of the planet, assault on mother Earth, 
desensitization to the ecology, disinterest in expansive consciousness, (and) 
disinterest in the American tradition from Thoreau, Emerson, Whitman and 
expansive heart and awareness. . . ."

 They were young men -- and a few women -- who gathered around Columbia 
University in New York during the World War II era and later in San Francisco's 
North Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Most were middle class, some were veterans, others had resisted military 
service. They were repulsed by militarism, McCarthyism and the seeming forced 
march to suburban respectability. They took drugs and befriended petty 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beats recognized that to be an outsider is not to be sick but to be 
angelic," said Mitchell J. Smith, a Kerouac scholar and editor of the 
Escondido-based Kerouac Connection, a journal devoted to beat criticism and 
remembrances. 
</P>
<P>
 They quickly became emotionally and, in some cases, sexually involved with 
each other. They wrote about each other and their adventures and down-and-out 
times. Twelve of Kerouac's 13 novels are autobiographical. 
</P>
<P>
 The term beat -- later corrupted and trivialized by the press into beat nik -- 
was invented by Kerouac and novelist and essayist John Clellon Holmes ("Go") 
and meant a variety of things: Beat as in discouraged. Beat as in beaten down 
to essentials. Beat as in the beat of jazz music. Beat as in beatific or 
seeking beatitude .  
</P>
<P>
 Kerouac idolized saxophonist Charlie Parker and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie and 
developed a literary aesthetic he called "bop prosody." He believed in 
"spontaneous prose" where sentences take flights of imagination and not even 
the author is sure of the destination at the start, much like a jazz player 
improvising riffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsberg coined the phrase "first thought, best thought." Beat literature 
often rushes forward in great gusts of images and emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Visions of Cody," Kerouac writes of crisscrossing America: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "At the juncture of the state line of Colorado, its arid western one, and the 
state line of Utah I saw in the clouds huge and massed above the fiery golded 
desert of eveningfall the great image of God with forefinger pointed straight 
at me through halos and rolls and gold folds that were like the existence of 
the gleaming spear in His right hand, and sayeth, Go thou across the ground; go 
moan for man; go moan, go groan, go groan alone go roll your bones, alone; go 
thou and be little beneath my sight; go thou, and be minute and as seed in the 
pod, but the pod the pit, world a Pod, universe a Pit: go thou, go thou, die 
hence; and of Cody report well and truly."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey poet Joel Lewis wrote recently in the American Poetry Review that 
the beats "spoke in direct, vibrant speech about previously unvoiced topics 
such as Buddhism, homosexuality, the pain of drug addiction and the monstrous 
suppression of the spirit in Western culture." 
</P>
<P>
 They defied the conventions of poetry that stressed rhyme, meter and 
symbolism. "We saw that the art of poetry was essentially dead -- killed by 
war, by academies, by neglect, by lack of love, and by disinterest," wrote 
McClure. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1959 poem "I Am 25," Corso, the angriest and yet funniest beat poet, 
wrote "I HATE OLD POETMEN!" and said he would like to "rip out their 
apology-tongues and steal their poems." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If there is an apotheosis for the Beat Generation, it occurred on Oct. 7, 
1955, at the Six Gallery in San Francisco when Ginsberg first read "Howl." 
American poetry was forever changed by its rage, raucous cadence and sexual 
candor: "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving 
hysterical naked, dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking 
for an angry fix . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 Ferlinghetti, who was in the audience, published "Howl" and its companion 
poems in a slim volume that hipsters carried in their back pockets. 
Ferlinghetti was charged with distributing obscene material. 
</P>
<P>
 After a UC Berkeley professor testified to the literary merit of "Howl," 
Ferlinghetti was found not guilty. But the beats' legal troubles were not over. 
McClure was arrested repeatedly for obscenity during performances of his play 
"The Beard." 
</P>
<P>
 "The true individual in America," said Cheryl Mueller, a doctoral student at 
Bowling Green University, "is someone who develops a new language that is 
outside the bounds of thinkable thought. That's a perfect description of the 
beats." 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, Venice was the center of the beat scene. Stuart Z. 
Perkoff was the best known of the beat poets here. "His readings are recalled 
with almost religious enthusiasm by survivors of the Venice scene," wrote 
critic Paul Vangelisti. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, some of Perkoff's friends, family and lovers gathered to honor him. 
Philomene Long, a poet who teaches writing at UCLA, stayed with Perkoff during 
the final hours of his battle with cancer and said she "heard the waves of 
poems in his drowning breath and heard his final poem pressed against his 
throat awaiting his surrender to his muse." 
</P>
<P>
 Perkoff's poems have been out of print since his death in 1974. Now, as part 
of the larger beat revival, they will be published by the National Poetry 
Foundation at the University of Maine in Orono. 
</P>
<P>
 As the 1960s wore on, rock 'n' roll replaced poetry and jazz as the vehicle 
for protest, LSD replaced peyote as the mind-expanding drug of choice and the 
polemical divisiveness of Vietnam subsumed the debate on the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1991 book "Venice West: The Beat Generation in Southern California," 
John Arthur Maynard suggests that the symbolic end of the Beat Generation came 
on Jan. 14, 1967, at a "gathering of the tribes" at San Francisco's Golden Gate 
Park; 30,000 people -- including Ginsberg, Snyder, McClure and Timothy Leary -- 
attended. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost literally a torch-passing ceremony," Maynard wrote. "The day 
began with a poetry reading and closed with a free concert by the most exciting 
new properties in the music business, including Quicksilver, Big Brother and 
the Grateful Dead. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later Kerouac died of internal bleeding caused by alcoholism. He was 
47. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Truman Capote, in an oft-repeated put-down, dismissed Kerouac: "Jack's work 
wasn't writing at all, it was typing." One critic sniffed that beat poetry was 
nothing but "shredded prose." 
</P>
<P>
 Now there are signs of a critical re-evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
 Marjorie Perloff, professor of humanities at Stanford and one of the country's 
foremost critics of 20th-Century poetry, has praised Ginsberg, Kerouac and 
Burroughs. She argues that Ginsberg helped liberate poetry from a restrictive, 
conservative outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the push to add the beats to college reading lists may have come less 
from the faculty lounge than from the dormitory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Charters, a Kerouac biographer and editor of the "Portable Beat Reader," 
published by Viking in 1992, sees the beat revival as part of the challenge 
being presented by students to the academic notion of what is good literature. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole questioning of the canon, the Great Tradition, that the feminists 
began, and that the Afro-American studies movement continues, is also true of 
white middle-class students," said Charters, who teaches at the University of 
Connecticut. "White middle-class students are the bulk of the student 
population and they want to read alternative literature too." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the beat revival continues, there are cross-currents of criticism. The 
hottest topic among beat scholars is whether the beats were sexist. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beats, whether gay or straight, were very macho," Perloff said in an 
interview with the Berkeley-based journal Poetry Flash. At the Naropa 
conference, Waldman joked that only recently has she convinced Ginsberg to stop 
referring to women as girls. Charters said that while Kerouac did not rise 
above the male chauvinism of the 1950s, she believes that charges of sexism are 
overstated. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the concern for male bonding, other reasons have been suggested for the 
beat revival: their preoccupation with self-examination, the postmodern "edge," 
their acceptance of homosexuality and bisexuality, and their environmental 
advocacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beats were the literary arm of the environmental movement," said McClure. 
"The beats were stone-age hippies," said Ferlinghetti. 
</P>
<P>
 The same night that Ginsberg read "Howl" at the Six Gallery, McClure read his 
angry "For The Death of 100 Whales" about the U.S. Navy hunting the behemoth 
mammals: "Like sheep or children/Shot from the sea's bore." 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers suggest that the resurgence in beat literature has been fueled 
by the economic and social conflicts of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The 
era's sense of declining opportunities for the middle class, they say, is a 
cracked-mirror reflection of the malaise and political cynicism that gripped 
the country in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for the revival may be more technological: The boom in compact 
discs and cassettes. The beats fervently believed that their poetry should be 
read aloud, preferably to jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor David Carradine read a three-hour version of "On The Road" released last 
year. A primer of beat poetry, "howls, raps & roars," was released by Fantasy 
Records. An anthology of Ginsberg's readings is set to be released by Rhino 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Kherdian, editor of the high school anthology, said the beat revival is part 
of a renewed struggle among poets and poetry lovers to rescue poetry from the 
"language poets" favored by academia. A protest was held to decry the New 
Yorker magazine's preference for poetry about "Greek gods, birdbaths and 
Connecticut angst." 
</P>
<P>
 Maynard, chronicler of the Venice beats, sees signs in the suburban town where 
he lives that the beats are back to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there are poetry readings in coffeehouses in Simi Valley," he said, "it's 
going on everywhere."

NEWS ANALYSIS; PRIVATELY RUN FOOTHILL TRANSIT A STRIKE WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Whether the Metropolitan Transportation Authority or its unions claim to have 
prevailed in their conflict, the fight already has another winner: Foothill 
Transit. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill's name may be unfamiliar outside the Pomona and east San Gabriel 
valleys, where it operates 21 local and express bus routes with about 10.7 
million boardings this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agency's interests -- further privatization of MTA services -- have 
been a major factor in the county's first transit strike in more than a decade. 
And the transit unions' failure to stave off further contracting out of MTA 
services has created new opportunities for Foothill, MTA's largest contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Under agreements struck a week ago with bus drivers and clerks, MTA will turn 
13 more bus lines over to private operators. The terms of the tentative 
agreement with the mechanics, reached early Monday, were sketchy, but MTA 
officials said it would not interfere with plans to privatize the lines. All 
the agreements still must be ratified by union members. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think this strike is over contracting," said one board member, who 
asked not to be identified. "But it's really over contracting with Foothill. 
That's all the pro-contracting-out forces on the board really care about." 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill Transit began operating in 1988, when it took over 14 bus lines from 
the Southern California Rapid Transit District, which since has been merged 
into the MTA. Today, Foothill operates 200 buses as the county's second-largest 
transit agency and has proposed a takeover of additional MTA lines. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who also sits on the MTA board, says he 
would like to see agencies such as Foothill established in the San Fernando 
Valley, on the Eastside and in South-Central Los Angeles. Ultimately, the 
massive MTA would operate a fraction of its current lines and function mainly 
as a contract manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Contracting arrangements such as Foothill's, Antonovich says, work because 
they are "free of the sweetheart contracts of the former RTD, with their 
featherbedding and work rules that are contrary to the interests of the 
taxpayer and rider." 
</P>
<P>
 "Contracting out" is the euphemism that elected officials use to describe the 
increasingly popular practice of allowing private companies to bid on the 
provision of basic services traditionally rendered by public employees. 
Big-ticket items with high labor costs, such as transit and trash collection, 
are favorite targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, Phoenix's competitive system of refuse hauling is one closely 
watched example of this process, which often is called privatization. Foothill 
Transit is another. To many who have watched their progress, these two 
experiments are a window on the future of many traditional public services. 
</P>
<P>
 What you glimpse through that window, however, depends on your angle of view. 
To elected officials struggling to live within ever-tightening budgets, 
Foothill-like entities point the way to a new era of affordable, flexible, 
efficient public services. But to the leaders of organized labor and their 
dwindling number of sympathizers, that era is one in which budgets are balanced 
by pushing an increasing number of public employees down the economic ladder to 
the rung occupied by the working poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill's experience seems to vindicate both views. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill is neither a traditional public transit agency nor quite what the 
libertarian theorists who conceived the privatization movement had in mind. 
Rather, it is a hybrid of the public and private sectors. Its policies are set 
by a "joint powers authority" consisting of 20 small cities in the Pomona and 
east San Gabriel valleys and Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of all the authority's members meet once each year to approve 
a budget and to elect a five-member executive board. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill Transit itself has no employees. All of its work -- from management 
to maintenance -- is done by private contractors. The 30 people who comprise 
Foothill's entire administration all work for Forsythe and Associates Inc., a 
West Covina-based transportation and management firm, which is paid $2 million 
a year by Foothill to run the bus company. The agency leases its buses, which 
are driven and maintained by two other private transit companies, Laidlaw and 
Mayflower. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Neely, now a private transit consultant, was the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission staff member who worked on the formation of Foothill 
in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 She says that, so far, the experiment "has been extremely successful. It has 
caused no layoffs in the public sector. Fares are lower for its riders and it 
has added service in the San Gabriel Valley, which needed it. More important, 
the constituents are happy because they're getting better service." 
</P>
<P>
 Even a cursory look at Foothill's service tends to bear Neely out. The 
agency's buses -- all of them relatively new -- are clean and free of graffiti. 
Surveys have recorded a high degree of rider satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill's economic statistics are even more striking: By its own reckoning, 
it costs the agency $55 per hour to operate its buses, as opposed to $93 for 
MTA. While MTA recovers just 32% of its subsidies by collecting fares, Foothill 
recaptures 48%. Foothill's basic fare still is 85 cents, while MTA's fare is 
scheduled to increase from $1.10 to $1.35. Foothill has an excellent safety 
record, with just 0.3 accidents per 100,000 miles traveled; MTA's rate is 3.3, 
100 times higher. (Some, but not all, of that discrepancy probably is 
attributable to the fact that MTA operates an older fleet of buses over more 
heavily congested local routes.) 
</P>
<P>
 With its relatively tiny staff, Foothill allocates less than 3% of its budget 
to administrative costs. Public sector executives who oversee private 
contractors generally agree that spending 10% or less on administration is an 
excellent economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the foundation of all these economies is a wage structure for drivers and 
mechanics that is roughly half MTA's. The public agency pays its drivers an 
hourly average of $18.45, while Foothill's contractors give their drivers -- 
all of whom are represented by the Teamsters Union -- $11. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, not everyone accepts such comparisons at face value. MTA board 
member Marvin Holen says he believes Foothill's operational statistics are 
"wildly inflated." Holen, who bases his reservations on informal analysis by 
MTA's staff accountants, cannot provide numbers of his own. But he is asking 
for a complete and impartial accounting. 
</P>
<P>
 Such skepticism has dogged Foothill since its inception a decade ago. At that 
time, the RTD simultaneously announced a 50-cent fare increase and a reduction 
of service in the San Gabriel Valley. The county supervisor representing the 
area at the time was Pete Schabarum -- a longtime advocate of privatization and 
an implacable foe of public sector unions. He refused to accept the cuts and 
set in motion the process that created Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
 To assist him in the process, Schabarum brought in transit consultant William 
P. Forsythe, who had directed transportation for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics. 
Today, Forsythe, who is widely regarded as the "architect of Foothill Transit," 
is president of the company that has the contract to manage the district. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Foothill's major contractor, Laidlaw, are consistent players in MTA's 
internal politics. Over the past two years, they have contributed more than 
$10,000 to members of the MTA board. Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, who 
sits on the board and appoints three other members, has received $2,500. The 
mayor, whose former law firm represented Foothill when organized labor 
unsuccessfully challenged its formation in court, is a longtime advocate of 
contracting out. Along with Supervisor Antonovich and Duarte City Council 
member John Fasana, Riordan has emerged as a strong advocate for Foothill on 
the MTA board. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one source familiar with the board's deliberations, the board's 
loyalty to Foothill was a major factor in the contract talks with unions 
representing the drivers and clerks. "We weren't just talking about the MTA and 
its unions," the source said. "We were talking about the MTA, the unions and 
Foothill. Some people mentioned them by name, others talked about 'contracting 
out.' But everybody in the room knew that what they really were talking about 
was Foothill." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Riordan pushed through a motion instructing the board's 
negotiator to return to the drivers union, which already had agreed to cede 13 
more local lines to private contractors, and ask them to give up nine local and 
four express lines. At least one point during discussion of the motion, Fasana 
conferred with Foothill managers by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was understood," the source said, "that all those lines would go to 
Foothill." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Antonovich insists that no decision has been made. 
</P>
<P>
 When the union rejected the new proposal, Riordan -- in hopes of avoiding a 
strike -- backed away from his proposal and voted with the majority to accept 
the original agreement. But five board members -- Antonovich, Fasana, county 
Supervisor Deane Dana, Glendale Mayor Larry Zarian and League of Cities 
representative Raul Perez -- voted to stand firm on the express lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys in the pro-contracting faction were willing to take a strike if it 
helped Foothill," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, performance as well as politics have won Foothill such adherents. The 
question remains: Is that performance based on more than cheap labor? 
</P>
<P>
 Forsythe, who was "present at the creation," argues that economies of all 
sorts were built into Foothill's structure from the start. "We realized 
accountability was the key," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, we decided we'd have the public sector govern this new agency and the 
private sector run it. We'd use the strengths of each. Government doesn't run 
business well. It doesn't force innovation or get rid of what's no longer 
useful. Government does a good job of setting policy. The private sector does a 
terrible job of setting policy for the public good. All it wants is competition 
advantage. But it does a very good job of innovating and saving money and 
getting the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Lewis, formerly Schabarum's chief of staff and for five years a Foothill 
director, believes that the agency's success has something to do with its 
manageable scale. It is, he says, "the optimal size. In transit, there are no 
economies of scale. The bigger you are, the faster you go into the hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials insist that Foothill's apparent gains have been made on the 
backs of workers. And that, they say, raises critical public policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldy Norton, a spokesman for the United Transportation Union, which 
represents MTA's drivers, said Foothill does not pay a living wage to its 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill drivers, he said, "are not making it on what they are being paid. . . 
. And what people don't understand is that the taxpayer ends up paying anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 "Members of our union get good salary and benefits," Norton said. "They're not 
on any government subsidy. But people who work for the subcontractors do on 
many occasions get subsidies. They are the working poor who need social 
assistance. So (the MTA) may be saving transit funds (by contracting out), but 
taxpayers still end up paying the bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Forsythe counters that the $20,000 per year earned by a typical Foothill 
driver "isn't bad for a service industry job. . . . Is our wage fair? Not 
compared to MTA, but they've been overpaying for years." Keeping Things Running 
</P>
<P>
 The Foothill Transit Service Corp. is a nonprofit company contracted by the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority to provide service in the east San 
Gabriel Valley. Foothill buses primarily run on the San Bernardino Freeway.

MITCHELL'S HEALTH CARE BILL TO PARE EMPLOYER MANDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN and PAUL RICHTER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With White House backing, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell on Monday 
prepared to unveil his long-awaited health care reform plan, focusing the 
debate on an element that advocates believe could win crucial moderate support 
for universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 That ingredient is a requirement that large employers pay half of a worker's 
insurance premiums -- instead of the 80% sought by a parallel bill introduced 
last week by the Democratic leadership in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 The big question is whether Mitchell's plan will win converts among the large 
number of lawmakers who now reject such an "employer mandate." 
</P>
<P>
 To most workers, however, the difference between a 50% and an 80% employer 
contribution may be insignificant, experts say. That's because most employers 
already are passing on to employees the cost of health insurance premiums in 
the form of deferred raises and other payroll cutbacks, economists and health 
policy analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of us believe, based on theory and on empirical research, that a mandate 
ultimately is paid for by the worker," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a Princeton 
University health economist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Therefore the lower the percentage paid by an employer, the more honest 
health care policy really is in terms of who ultimately winds up paying for 
this," he said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The likelihood of another consequence of the Mitchell approach also is largely 
discounted: that private employers who now pay 80%, which is common in many 
industries, will cut back to 50% to match the legal requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Companies would really stay away from doing that because the employee 
relations implications would be so negative. I just don't think that's likely," 
said Sharon Canner, assistant vice president and director of employee benefits 
at the National Assn. of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over Mitchell's bill, to be released today, came as President 
Clinton stumped aggressively for health reform, calling it "the opportunity of 
a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't let the fear-mongers, don't let the dividers, don't let the people who 
disseminate false information frighten the United States Congress into walking 
away from the opportunity of a lifetime," he told several thousand union 
members and other reform advocates at Liberty State Park in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mitchell mandate would only be triggered if, by some time in the early 
21st Century, less than 95% of the population is not covered after a variety of 
insurance market reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 That approach got an endorsement Monday from Leon E. Panetta, the White House 
chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 If Congress adopts such a "hard trigger," Panetta said in an interview here, 
"then we are assured of universal coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that, from a policy standpoint, Mitchell's approach of an evenly 
"shared responsibility" between employers and employees may work better than 
the 80-20 division proposed by Clinton last year and by House Majority Leader 
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) last week in a bill to be debated in the House next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 While details of the premium costs in Mitchell's plan are not known, the 
average premium for a family of four in a typical Fortune 500 company health 
plan is $5,000 a year. Under Mitchell's plan, an employer would be required to 
pay half the cost, $2,500, leaving a like amount to the worker. The cost would 
break down to about $208 a month for both employer and employee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maine senator's bill requires employers with 26 workers or more to pay at 
least 50% of an employee's insurance premiums, with the worker paying the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's formula, experts said, would allow more efficient targeting of 
government-provided premium subsidies to needy individuals and families, 
leading to less overall public spending for subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you make employers pay 80%, somehow most of the subsidies have to go to 
them because everyone pretends they are paying it," Reinhardt added, even 
though employers generally pass the costs on to the workers in one form or 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, "the more you shift payment to the employee, the more then 
you can target subsidies to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, could reduce the government outlay for premium subsidies, 
according to a recent study by the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Urban Institute researcher Sheila Zedlewski estimated that an 80% employer 
mandate could require as much as $55 billion a year in subsidies to low-wage 
small businesses. But that could drop to $17 billion under a 50% employer 
mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, she said, the estimated amount of individual and family 
subsidies would increase from $43 billion to $56 billion, creating a potential 
gain of $25 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone shared that optimistic projection. Rep. Sam M. Gibbons 
(D-Fla.), acting chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, predicted that 
every percentage drop from the 80% employer requirement will increase 
government subsidies by $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But more important, Gibbons argued, a less onerous employer mandate will not 
win over critics. "Those who are opposed to employer mandates at 80-20 are 
still opposed when it is 50-50," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Isakowitz, a lobbyist for the National Federation of Independent 
Business, a vocal opponent of mandatory workplace-based coverage, agreed, 
saying that any mandate is a new burden to an employer who does not now provide 
insurance to workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A mandate, whether it's at 80% or 50%, is still an increase in cost for 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Isakowitz said that members of his group also fear that their cost will be 
increased further by an overly generous, government-mandated standard benefits 
package. "The question becomes: '50% of what?' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Clinton's and Gephardt's bills impose an employer-employee mandate, 
requiring businesses to pay at least 80% of a worker's insurance premiums, with 
the employee paying the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The President would have the mandate take effect in 1998 while Gephardt would 
phase it in from 1997 to 1999, starting with large firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Both bills also provide financial assistance, either as subsidies or tax 
credits, to small businesses on a sliding scale, based on firm size and average 
wages.

TREASURY LAWYER TAKES BLAME FOR TESTIMONY; WHITEWATER: HANSON SAYS SHE DIDN'T 
CORRECT ALTMAN'S INFORMATION AT THE TIME. SHE IS CRITICIZED BY SENATE PANEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Treasury's top lawyer admitted Monday that she knew on Feb. 24 that her 
boss, Deputy Treasury Secretary Robert Altman, was giving inaccurate testimony 
to Congress about his Whitewater-related discussions with the White House but 
she did nothing to correct him. 
</P>
<P>
 In testimony before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, 
Treasury General Counsel Jean Hanson appeared to take responsibility for 
Altman's failure to fully inform the panel about his discussions with the White 
House. Nevertheless, her admission only fueled charges that Hanson and Altman 
had acted improperly. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman, an old friend and former classmate of the President's, is scheduled to 
be questioned by the committee today about his failure to testify fully last 
February about the extent of discussions between Treasury and White House 
officials after he learned that President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton had been named as possible witnesses in the investigation of a failed 
Arkansas savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury officials had recognized that word of the investigation by the 
Resolution Trust Corp. was sure to be embarrassing for the Clintons because 
they had been partners with James B. McDougal, owner of the S&L, in an Ozark 
real estate venture called Whitewater Development Corp. The RTC was looking 
into allegations that money from McDougal's Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan had 
been diverted to Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other Administration officials, Hanson insisted that the Treasury did 
nothing wrong when it alerted the White House that the Clintons' names had come 
up in connection with an investigation. She also downplayed as "not 
significant" the differences between her recollections and those of Altman 
about contacts with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrats as well as Republicans criticized the Treasury's decision to 
alert the White House and Hanson's failure to correct Altman's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), who until now has defended 
the Administration's actions, severely admonished Hanson for failing to correct 
Altman's testimony, if not at the Feb. 24 hearing, at least in the days that 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's a plausible explanation why this record wasn't 
corrected very, very promptly," Riegle said. "If information is asked for by a 
senator and (an) incomplete answer is given, getting the information later is 
not the same thing as getting the information in real time. . . . If you're 
sitting there and you have the information and it is withheld, that is 
improper." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, former RTC official William Roelle testified that he told 
Hanson in late 1993 that the President's name was mentioned in letters from the 
RTC to the Justice Department regarding possible criminal conduct by Madison 
owners. He said he warned her that the information was confidential. He told 
the committee that she should not have shared it with the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Senate committee agreed with Roelle. Democratic senators -- as 
well as Republicans -- rejected Hanson's assertion that she needed to tell the 
White House about it because the President's aides needed to be prepared for 
press inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson replied that it never occurred to her that contacts with the White 
House later would be viewed by the President's critics as evidence of a 
possible cover-up. She emphasized that the Administration took no action to 
interfere with the inquiry after learning about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no doubt about the propriety of my actions," Hanson said. "I have no 
reason to doubt the propriety of anyone else's actions." 
</P>
<P>
 After learning about the RTC investigation from Roelle, Hanson said that she 
alerted Altman, who was then serving in the dual role of RTC chief executive 
officer and deputy secretary of the Treasury. At Altman's direction, she said, 
she also told then-White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum that the President had 
been linked to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Altman has said that he does not recall telling Hanson to inform the White 
House. But Hanson said their differing recollections are not significant 
because her call to the White House was entirely proper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take full responsibility for the decision to do so," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Treasury and White House officials had as many as 40 contacts about 
the RTC investigation from September, 1993, to February. Among them was a 
meeting Feb. 2 by Altman and Hanson with White House officials. The deputy 
Treasury secretary discussed his subsequent decision to disqualify himself from 
dealing with the Madison investigation at that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 When Altman was called to testify before the Senate Banking panel about RTC 
matters on Feb. 24, Hanson accompanied him and sat in a chair behind him while 
he fielded questions. 
</P>
<P>
 When the committee asked him whether Treasury officials had discussed the 
Madison case with the White House, Altman mentioned only the Feb. 2 meeting. He 
did not acknowledge any of the other Treasury contacts nor did he tell the 
committee that during the Feb. 2 meeting he had discussed the issue of 
disqualifying himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson said she was aware of the omissions, but she decided to say nothing. 
"Without discussing the matter with Mr. Altman and others at Treasury, I did 
not believe that I could suggest to Mr. Altman on the spot that he change his 
response," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson argued that, while she intended to correct the record at a later date, 
her opportunity to do so was eliminated when she was subpoenaed on March 4 by a 
grand jury investigating the White House-Treasury contacts. The subpoena 
legally prevented her from discussing the case with anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 But members of the Senate committee challenged her explanation, noting that 
Altman wrote four subsequent letters to the panel in the days after Altman's 
testimony and never mentioned that the Feb. 2 White House meeting had dealt 
with the issue of whether he should disqualify himself. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Altman decided on Feb. 25 -- the day after he appeared before the 
panel -- to officially disqualify himself from the Madison matter. Although 
Hanson acknowledged that she assisted him with the disqualification, she said 
she never mentioned to him then that he had testified inaccurately to the 
Senate committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) questioned Hanson about why Altman had not 
been prepared to testify fully about the White House-Treasury contacts. Hanson 
replied that Treasury officials had prepared answers for Altman on a wide range 
of issues but had not been aware that he would be questioned about the White 
House-Treasury contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 But D'Amato disclosed for the first time that he had warned Altman in a 
telephone conversation the night before his testimony that he would be asked 
about the White House contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Democrats were almost as tough in their questioning of Hanson as were 
Republicans, they were careful to emphasize that there is no evidence to 
suggest White House officials made any effort to intervene in the RTC inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials have admitted, however, that Nussbaum tried on Feb. 2 to 
dissuade Altman from disqualifying himself from the Madison Guaranty case and 
that he postponed his decision for nearly a month as a result of Nussbaum's 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats also sought to defend the propriety of the White House-Treasury 
contacts by emphasizing that Republicans, too, had asked the RTC about the 
Madison inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning, Roelle said he was disturbed to learn that then-White House 
Counsel C. Boyden Gray contacted then-RTC Chairman Albert V. Casey during the 
1992 presidential election to inquire about the Madison case and the Clinton 
connection to it. When Casey, a Bush appointee, asked what he could tell Gray, 
Roelle said he told Casey that "it would be inappropriate to discuss it with 
the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Casey said, 'OK, I'll tell them that,' " Roelle recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Democrats noted that D'Amato had contacted the RTC early this 
year, seeking to learn when the legal statute of limitations would expire on 
the Madison case. In response, John E. Ryan, then RTC's acting head, traveled 
to Capitol Hill to brief D'Amato on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials contend that Altman and Hanson briefed the White 
House on the statute of limitations on Feb. 2 because D'Amato had already been 
provided with a similar briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC is continuing to investigate potential civil law violations at Madison 
Guaranty, and special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. is looking into possible 
criminal violations. Congress voted in February to extend the statute of 
limitations in the RTC case until the end of 1995.

MORE THAN 121,000 QUAKES SINCE 1987; GEOLOGY: ABOUT 2,700 SOUTHLAND TEMBLORS 
HAVE BEEN MAGNITUDE 3.0 OR GREATER, SCIENTISTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the most comprehensive earthquake inventories to date, scientists 
from Caltech and the U.S. Geological Survey reported Monday that more than 
121,000 quakes have been recorded in Southern California since the beginning of 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 A little more than 2,700 have been magnitude 3.0 or greater and thus could be 
felt at least by people living in the vicinity where they occurred. This works 
out to an average of about one earthquake felt somewhere in the region every 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 But some areas are more active than others. There have been more than 53,000 
aftershocks from the 1992 Landers-Big Bear earthquakes and nearly 9,000 
aftershocks from the Jan. 17 Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last eight years, the smallest number of quakes recorded in any one 
year was 7,961 in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 When big earthquakes occur, the number rockets upward as thousands of 
aftershocks occur. In 1992, 49,981 earthquakes, including aftershocks, were 
recorded in Southern California -- in an area bounded by the Colorado River on 
the east, the Mexican border on the south, the offshore islands on the west and 
Lone Pine and Coalinga on the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those earthquakes were too weak to feel. But 1,707 earthquakes that 
were at least magnitude 3.0 and could be felt by people living in their 
vicinity were recorded in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures released Monday were compiled from instruments of the Southern 
California Seismographic Network by scientists Kate Hutton and Egill Hauksson 
of Caltech and Lucile M. Jones of the U.S. Geological Survey. 
</P>
<P>
 They said that virtually all detectable earthquakes were included in the data. 
However, no matter how refined the seismological network, some quakes are too 
small to be registered by any station on the network. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists reported that more than 8,750 jolts have stemmed from the 
Northridge quake, including 381 aftershocks registering between 3.0 and 3.9, 48 
between 4.0 and 4.9 and eight -- including the main shock -- 5.0 or stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Landers, now calculated by Hutton, Hauksson and Jones as a magnitude 
7.3 main shock, there have been 53,040 jolts, including 1,458 aftershocks 
registering between 3.0 and 3.9, 156 between 4.0 and 4.9, and 21, including the 
main shock, 5.0 or stronger. A 4.8 Landers aftershock was recorded 28 miles 
northeast of Lucerne Valley at 2:34 p.m. Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists reported 11,684 earthquakes in 1987, 11,295 in 1988, 9,538 in 
1989, 9,311 in 1990, 7,961 in 1991, 49,981 in 1992, including the 1,707 of at 
least 3.0, 19,404 in 1993 and 18,110 thus far in 1994, including 523 of at 
least 3.0. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overall rate at which aftershocks occur depends strongly on the magnitude 
of the main shock, and the Landers sequence is almost exactly average for its 
size," the scientists said. "The Northridge sequence has more aftershocks than 
the average for a main shock of (its size) . . . but still far less than 
Landers because the Northridge main shock was much smaller."

NEIGHBORS MOUNT FLURRY OF SUITS IN BID TO FORCE OUT HOMEOWNER; ACTIVISM: IN 
SMALL CLAIMS COURT, 24 RESIDENTS SEEK $5,000 EACH FROM WOMAN THEY SAY HAS 
CAUSED THEM EMOTIONAL DISTRESS WITH PILES OF RUBBISH AND NIGHTTIME NOISE. WOMAN 
DENIES THE ALLEGATIONS AND SAYS HER HOUSE HAS BEEN CLEANED.

 Two dozen Huntington Harbour residents angry about the condition of a 
neighbor's property took her to small claims court Monday, using a novel 
technique in an effort to force her out or make her clean up her property. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors are relying on a tactic called Safe Streets Now! pioneered by 
San Francisco Bay Area residents to force evictions of drug-selling tenants by 
winning large judgments against the landlords in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the 24 residents is seeking a $5,000 judgment, the maximum obtainable 
in small claims court, in hopes that the combined sum will either force Elena 
Zagustin to clean up her property or move. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents from the upscale enclave approached the bench one after another 
Monday and said that Zagustin has caused them emotional distress by keeping 
piles of rubbish in and around her house, making noises in the night, abusing 
her cats and contributing to an unbearable stench and rat and possum 
infestations in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had recurring nightmares because of the fire hazard. I've spent 
countless sleepless nights listening to her bang around in her trash cans," 
Raymond Goulette told Judge Corey S. Cramin. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents presented a 380-page file subpoenaed from the Huntington Beach code 
enforcement office, outlining actions the city has taken against Zagustin over 
the years, including 21 inspections of her property, four criminal complaints 
and a Superior Court civil lawsuit by the city that was settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Zagustin sought unsuccessfully to have the cases dismissed Monday, saying she 
had not been served with court papers. She then sought to have the cases 
transferred to Superior Court because the total claims amount to $120,000. The 
judge denied both requests. 
</P>
<P>
 She denied many of her neighbors' allegations and said she has cleaned up her 
house in accordance with last month's court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not bothering anybody. All I do is work and come home," Zagustin said 
outside court. "My house is cleaned up." 
</P>
<P>
 Zagustin, 57, a tenured engineering professor for 27 years, is on medical 
leave from Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to four hours of testimony from neighbors, Cramin took a tour 
of the neighborhood Monday, peeking over a fence into Zagustin's yard, 
surrounded by immaculately landscaped $400,000 houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's ruling will be announced today, his clerk said. He ruled in favor 
of some plaintiffs but not all, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's case has emerged as a key test of the Safe Streets Now! technique in 
Orange County. It was first used by Oakland resident Molly Wetzel in 1989 when 
she rallied her neighbors to sue a neighboring landlord whose tenants allegedly 
sold crack cocaine. Wetzel has helped Bay Area residents pull in more than 
$760,000 in judgments since then, and activist Betsy Bredau has headed a 
similar effort in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials and frustrated residents in Orange County cities plagued by 
drug-dealing are researching use of the method and say a success for Huntington 
Harbour residents would be inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is successful then it clearly shows that citizens can take the law 
into their own hands and win. This is America. This is wonderful!" said Santa 
Ana neighborhood activist Jim Walker, who attended a Safe Streets Now! training 
session in January and has been supporting the Huntington Harbour efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows how due process can work for the people, not against them. We have 
to reassure people that the system works." 
</P>
<P>
 David Flynn, the Huntington Harbour resident who spearheaded the small claims 
action, said he and his neighbors will continue to refile claims against 
Zagustin until her home is maintained to their satisfaction or they force her 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "She can't live here anymore and keep harassing people without getting 
harassment back," he said.

SMALL EMPLOYERS WIN VICTORY IN AGE BIAS CASE; LAWSUITS: THE STATE SUPREME COURT 
SAYS AN ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAW DOES NOT APPLY TO BUSINESSES WITH FEWER THAN 
FIVE WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Small businesses in California cannot be sued for age discrimination under 
current law, the California Supreme Court held unanimously Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The court, reviewing an Orange County case, said the only state law that 
prohibits such discrimination, the Fair Employment and Housing Act, exempts 
employers with fewer than five workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We conclude that there presently exists no 'fundamental policy' which 
precludes age discrimination by a small employer," Justice Marvin Baxter wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision means that an estimated 552,800 small employers in the state 
cannot be held legally liable for discriminating against workers because of 
their age. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court ruling overturned a decision by the 4th District Court 
of Appeal in Santa Ana, which held last year that a worker who suffers age 
discrimination could sue the employer. The act also bans discrimination on the 
basis of gender, race, religion or sexual orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court ruling is "the first decision we have seen in a 
long, long time out of any court that has actually recognized the right to 
discriminate," said Orange attorney Bruce W. Hamby, who represented the 
defendant in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Jennings brought the case after losing her job of four years as a 
receptionist and clerical worker for James Marralle, a Newport Beach 
endodontist, a dentist specializing in root canals. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennings, who was in her early 50s, said Marralle told her in 1990 that he 
wanted to replace her with someone younger because her advancing age was 
requiring him to pay too much toward the office pension plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Marralle denied the allegation, contending that Jennings quit "in a huff" 
after her request for a raise was refused. Jennings, now in her late 50s, works 
for a dentist in Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fired because of my age, and it's too bad employers are able to do 
that," she said Monday. "The law as it stands now is not fair to me or anyone 
in my situation. It's been difficult to try to prove a point and have it go 
this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Marralle said he was pleased with the decision, calling his former worker's 
claim "frivolous from the start." The case, he said, has been "vastly 
expensive" for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamby and other lawyers said small employers probably would still be liable 
for discriminating on the basis of race, gender or religion because those 
categories are protected by the state Constitution. But suits charging 
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation -- which like age is not 
protected by the state Constitution -- probably would not be allowed, they 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature exempted small businesses from the anti-discrimination statute 
after they argued that even a single suit without merit could bankrupt a small 
firm. Nonprofit religious organizations also are exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin D. Mayer, another Orange attorney who represented Jennings, called the 
court's decision outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Legislature should do something about it," Mayer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other lawyers noted that workers can still sue small employers for age and 
other kinds of discrimination if the employers actually harass their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law requires all employers, no matter how big or how small, to keep from 
harassing their employees on the basis of age," said Joseph Posner, a member of 
the board of the California Employment Lawyers Assn.

MANY ADULTS LAG IN READING, MATH; LITERACY: STUDY FINDS 50% OF STATE'S

 About half of California's adults cannot read or perform math well enough to 
keep up with today's technologically changing world, and those with the poorest 
literacy skills include a disproportionate number of immigrants, for many of 
whom English is a second language, according to an unreleased U.S. Department 
of Education study. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, titled "Adult Literacy in California," was requested by state 
officials as a follow-up to an ambitious national project that estimated how 
well the country's 191 million adults performed a range of literacy tasks, 
ranging from signing their names on bank deposit slips to synthesizing 
information from long reading passages. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the Department of Education announced that nearly 50% of 
American adults were "at risk" because they could perform only the simplest of 
tasks, a dismal performance that educational officials said served as a 
"wake-up call" to an epidemic of illiteracy and signified a widening society 
"fault line" between winners and losers in the Information Age. 
</P>
<P>
 The California numbers were worse than in other western states but mirrored 
literacy rates for the nation as a whole, according to the new report. Compared 
to the national rates, however, California showed a slightly greater gulf 
between the literacy haves and have-nots, with more registering at both the top 
and bottom of the scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "That means you have more people doing better than the nation and more people 
doing worse," said Andrew Kolstad, project director for the literacy studies 
with the National Center for Education Statistics, a division of the Department 
of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you tend to find is you get a lot of immigrants, a lot of people scoring 
at the bottom," said Kolstad. "Yet California has a very good and advanced 
post-secondary schooling system, so as people . . . get through the system" 
they score higher. 
</P>
<P>
 California officials have yet to officially release results from the follow-up 
report, although federal officials said they sent copies to state 
administrators in May. Gary Strong, the state librarian, agreed to release an 
executive summary of the report after California Literacy Inc., a literacy 
group, leaked the results in a newsletter published last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong, who chairs the state Literacy Coordinating Council -- a six-agency 
consortium that distributes literacy funds and ordered the study -- said the 
group has not officially released the study because member agencies still need 
time to draft their press statements explaining the findings. Council members 
include officials from the state Department of Education, state library system, 
community colleges chancellor's office, employment department, California 
Conservation Corps and the governor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But Juanita Stanley, the nonprofit group's executive director, said she and 
other literacy advocates were upset about the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings are "nothing I didn't expect, but it's nice to say we have a 
problem here," said Stanley, whose group oversees a grass-roots network of 
13,000 volunteer tutors throughout the state. "A quarter of the adults in this 
state can't participate, they can't vote, they can't read the newspaper, they 
can't hold onto a job, they can't take care of their kids properly because they 
can't read." 
</P>
<P>
 California was one of 12 states that paid $345,000 for federal officials to 
perform a follow-up study. Officials randomly tested 2,665 California adults, 
who represented the 22.8 million people 16 years old and older. 
</P>
<P>
 The study rated participants on scales ranging from 1 to 500 in three levels 
of proficiency -- prose, document reading and math. 
</P>
<P>
 Results were tallied on five levels of competency. Those who scored in the 
bottom two levels were considered at risk because they could do no more than 
understand appliance warranties or calculate postage. Both the national and 
state studies intentionally avoided labeling anyone functionally illiterate. 
</P>
<P>
 While 23% of the nation's adults registered in the bottom level for reading 
documents, the follow-up study showed that 26% of Californians were either 
illiterate or able to perform the barest of functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those at the bottom level of the literacy results in California, 59% were 
foreign-born and 41% were native-born residents, the report says. Those results 
were disproportionate to the percentages in the adult population as a whole, 
with immigrants comprising 24% and natives 76%, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley and other literacy advocates, however, stressed that the poor showing 
by immigrants was not an indication of intelligence but was attributable to the 
difficulties of taking the test in English. The special report said that 29% of 
those who took the test said they grew up speaking another language, and those 
who reported having limited English skills scored from 129 to 165 points lower 
than those who write or speak English well. 
</P>
<P>
 The report found that those who scored at the lowest literacy rung came 
disproportionately from three groups -- adults who did not finish high school, 
the elderly and the poor or those who worked in "labor, assembly, fishing or 
farming jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 On the top end, 5% of California adults performed the most sophisticated 
quantitative exercises, compared to 4% nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Other results: 
</P>
<P>
 * California men and women scored the same on reading, but men scored higher 
on quantitative sections. 
</P>
<P>
 * 27% of the state's adults say they watch four or more hours of television a 
day, while 23% said they spent an hour or less in front of the set. Those who 
watched less television had higher literacy scores, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Those who voted, used libraries and read regularly scored higher on the 
test.

PERRY PREDICTS SMALLER U.S. FORCE FOR RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry said Monday on his return from Africa that 
he is more hopeful about an international effort to save millions of Rwandan 
refugees and that only 3,000 U.S. troops will be needed to support the 
humanitarian operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The troop estimate, given to reporters at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, 
was lower than the 4,000 Americans that he earlier predicted would be stationed 
near Rwanda by the end of this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "As we speak, we have 1,200 people involved in that operation," Perry said. 
"The number is going to go beyond 1,200, and I think 3,000 is probably the 
maximum that it is likely to go to." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry visited Rwanda, Zaire and Uganda in a weekend trip on orders from 
President Clinton to inspect a U.S. military-led international aid effort to 
save as many as 4 million Rwandan refugees from malnutrition, thirst and 
disease in the wake of a bloody civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 He repeated his statement a day earlier in Goma, Zaire, that the effort to 
provide fresh water to refugees and end a cholera epidemic at Goma had "turned 
the corner" and begun to reduce cholera deaths, which reached as many as 3,000 
a day last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will, as the leading power in the world, be asked in many instances to 
take the lead" in such humanitarian efforts, said Democratic Rep. Donald Payne 
(D-N.J.), who traveled with Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry visited the Rwandan capital, Kigali, where leaders of that country's new 
government promised to allow refugees to return safely in the aftermath of the 
civil war that has claimed up to half a million lives. 
</P>
<P>
 There are currently about 200 U.S. troops in Kigali setting up a 24-hour 
operation to receive aid shipments by military cargo plane. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Nations is setting up an international peacekeeping force of nearly 
5,000 troops in Rwanda, but Clinton and Perry have stressed that U.S. troops 
will not join in those operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Goma, Perry said the international effort to provide fresh water and food 
for refugees, including up to 1.2 million Rwandans in Goma alone, had made 
major progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe we have truly turned the corner on this tragedy here and will be 
making significant improvements every day," he said, referring to steadily 
improving ability to produce fresh water and Sunday's opening of the airport in 
Kigali for round-the-clock aid operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry will report to Clinton on his trip and make recommendations on whether 
more U.S. troops should be sent to Kigali to further expand the airport 
operation there.

ENVIRONMENT; EPA CHIEF SEEKS TO CLEAR THE AIR ON ANTI-POLLUTION REGULATIONS; 
BROWNER'S 'COMMON SENSE INITIATIVE' WOULD TRY TO END THE 'TOXIC SHELL GAME' OF 
SHUFFLING WASTE PROBLEMS FROM ONE FORM TO ANOTHER. IT IS ALSO MEANT TO SIMPLIFY 
PROCESS FOR BUSINESSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Only in the Byzantine world of regulatory politics could something called the 
"common sense initiative" be called a revolution. But the federal government's 
chief environmental regulator is touting common sense as the newest wrinkle in 
rule-making to protect the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, is 
calling for "a new generation" of rules that "work in tandem rather than at 
cross purposes" to control pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last month, Browner launched a pilot program to devise packages of 
regulations tailored for six industries: metal plating, electronics and 
computers, automobile, petroleum, printing, and iron and steel. 
</P>
<P>
 Those packages would replace a costly and confusing tangle of regulations 
designed to protect air, land and water individually. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always sending the message that your air problem is separate from your 
water problem, which is separate from your waste problem, which is separate 
from your worker safety problem -- the message that environmental protection 
can and should be split apart into different pieces," said Nikki Roy, a former 
EPA regulator and now an analyst at the Environmental Defense Fund in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you're interested in pollution prevention, you need to think of all 
these things at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Adhering to regulations designed to protect and clean the environment now 
costs U.S. industries at least $30 billion a year. And yet, under 
often-conflicting federal regulations, industries are playing what Roy called 
"toxic shell games," where pollutants are shuffled from air to water, or water 
to land, or land to air. 
</P>
<P>
 For most industries, keeping up with the EPA's complex of regulations is 
frustrating and costly. And for regulators lurching from environmental crisis 
to environmental crisis, the rule-making process has become a discouraging 
routine of plugging holes and fighting industries. The result, said Browner 
recently: "Too little environmental protection at too high a cost (and) 
increasing frustration with the process of environmental regulation." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are two of the plentiful examples of the problem: 
</P>
<P>
 * Until recently at steel plants nationwide, clean-water regulations prevented 
the disposal of waste water laden with toxic contaminants into nearby rivers, 
lakes or sewage facilities. But federal regulations appeared to allow plant 
employees to use the waste water to cool superheated coke as it came out of 
huge ovens. That took care of the waste water: It was instantly vaporized, and 
the ammonia, benzene and cyanide it contained passed out into the air through 
the plant's ventilation system. In recent years, the EPA has worked to close 
the regulatory loophole, but similar ones are always cropping up. 
</P>
<P>
 * One large chemical manufacturing facility in New Jersey, following a 
directive issued by the EPA's office of air quality, installed a "wet air 
scrubber" on its smokestack -- a device that washes smog-producing contaminants 
out of the airstream and dissolves them into waste water. A different EPA 
directive -- this one issued by the agency's office of water quality -- 
required the firm to install a device that strips pollutants out of waste water 
and releases them back into the air. Installing this revolving door for 
pollutants cost the company $3 million. But the effect was the same as if no 
anti-pollution devices had been installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new EPA initiative, industry and labor representatives, 
environmental and citizens' groups and federal and state regulators would 
gather together to develop what Browner called "a blueprint for how to achieve 
real environmental protection" in given industries. Everything is on the table, 
including the possibility of new legislation, Browner said. The six industries 
represent 11% of U.S. gross domestic product and employ nearly 4 million 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort at environmental perestroika comes at a time when the EPA is under 
unprecedented attack on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers have cited the agency's history of generating complex and costly 
regulations to oppose a welter of new environmental initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the legislation held up by the congressional opposition is a bill 
setting purity standards for drinking water, another designed to reduce 
pollution in lakes, rivers and streams, and a proposal to elevate EPA to 
Cabinet status. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the complaints we hear are legitimate," Browner acknowledged 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell people to go in five directions at one time. We cannot continue this 
incremental system of regulation."

 Is more money the only way to achieve high-quality schools? An analysis of 
school districts nationwide found many are producing high-achieving students at 
low cost. The study by American Demographics magazine found that student 
performance in other districts lags despite generous school budgets. 
Dollars-and-cents analyses of school performance are rising as employers raise 
doubts about the quality of graduates and taxpayers wonder if money is being 
handled wisely. The Brain Belt

BOSNIA SERB BID TO RENEGOTIATE PEACE PLAN FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnia's Serbs sought Monday to renegotiate part of the peace plan that the 
United States and its allies drafted for Bosnia-Herzegovina, but the major 
powers quickly rejected the move, leaving the peacemaking effort at an impasse. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry dismissed the Serbian proposal as "a 
non-starter," saying that it is "up to the Bosnian Serbs now to agree to the 
plan put forward to them by the (five-power) Contact Group." 
</P>
<P>
 Three other Contact Group members -- France, Britain and Germany -- took 
similar positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's exchange did little to alter the standoff that has prevailed since 
the Bosnian Serbs rebuffed the allies on their latest peace proposal two weeks 
ago. The major powers have threatened to intensify their pressure on the Serbs 
but so far have taken no new steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Sarajevo, lower-level negotiators for the Serbs and the 
Muslim-led Bosnian government continued their talks over reopening roads, 
releasing prisoners and ending sniping, but they apparently made little 
progress. Two more people were wounded by snipers Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, in Belgrade, Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev 
intensified pressure on the government of neighboring Serbia to intervene in 
the process, telling Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic that he must get the 
Bosnian Serbs to accept the allied plan if he wants U.N. sanctions against 
Serbia lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 The added pressure from Russia, the fifth member of the Contact Group and a 
traditional ally of the Serbs, came a day after Milosevic issued his strongest 
warning yet to Bosnian Serbs that if they do not comply, Belgrade may cut off 
the weapons, food, fuel and money they need. Milosevic and Kozyrev met Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serbs' bid to reopen negotiations over the peace plan was 
expected. The proposal, which would partition the country almost evenly between 
Bosnia's Serbs and a Muslim-Croatian federation, has been endorsed by the 
Bosnian government but rejected by the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and its allies vowed last month to take military action if 
the Serbs spurned their plan. But they retreated from that threat in a meeting 
Saturday, warning vaguely of stern consequences without offering specifics. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Monday that it was clear the allies' warning had failed to 
convince the Bosnian Serbs that the major powers are serious about imposing the 
partition plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Clinton Administration officials, distressed by descriptions of the 
allies' action as backtracking, argued Monday that the allies' mild approach 
was intentional, to enable the major powers to lift the arms embargo on the 
Muslims more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 But the officials conceded that not all four other governments in the Contact 
Group had agreed to end the embargo if the Bosnian Serbs continue to reject the 
allied peace plan.

NIGERIAN POLICE BATTLE RIOTERS; OIL WORKERS' STRIKE ENTERS 5TH WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police battled rioters for several hours after thugs looted shops and chased 
officers with machetes Monday, the start of the fifth week of an oil strike 
aimed at toppling the military government. 
</P>
<P>
 Police initially fled the rampage in Lagos' main business district but 
returned with tear gas to take on the rioters.There were no figures available 
on injuries or arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil workers went on strike July 4 to protest the jailing of Moshood K.O. 
Abiola, the apparent winner of the annulled June, 1993, presidential elections. 
Abiola was charged with treason after declaring himself president on the first 
anniversary of the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil strike triggered a series of labor walkouts, and the huge National 
Labor Congress, which represents 5 million workers, plans to join the strike 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal Dutch Shell Group, the nation's biggest oil producer, acknowledged 
Monday in a letter to the government that its production is down 40% and is 
likely to continue to drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials have threatened to carry out a campaign of sabotage against 
the oil companies unless they cease production and support the strike. Nigeria 
gets 90% of its foreign revenues from petroleum exports. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 election was annulled by then-ruler Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. He 
stepped down last August and turned over power to a civilian puppet, Ernest 
Shonekan, who was ousted in a November coup by Gen. Sani Abacha. 
</P>
<P>
 Abacha has proved to be one of Nigeria's most ironfisted and unpopular rulers.

THREAT OF INVASION RAISES MANY QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.N. resolution on Haiti, which was adopted by the Security Council on 
Sunday at the urging of the United States, authorizes an invasion of Haiti to 
depose the military government and restore the elected president, who was 
overthrown in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, many questions remain about the fate of the Caribbean island 
nation. Here are the best answers now available: 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will there actually be an invasion? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Not necessarily. Clinton Administration officials say they still hope 
Haiti's military leaders will step down and leave the country in response to 
economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure. If that doesn't work, an invasion 
will be more likely, but officials say there is no certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When might an invasion occur? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Probably no sooner than early September. Officials say it will take at 
least a month to recruit troops from other countries to join the invasion force 
and to make other arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What countries will join the United States? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Although the invasion, if it comes, will clearly be a U.S. show, the 
Clinton Administration is eager to line up support from other nations to give 
the operation at least the appearance of an international effort. So far, 
Argentina has promised 600 troops. Other Western Hemisphere countries, 
especially tiny Caribbean republics, are expected to send token contingents. 
Israel has announced that it will not commit troops. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does the United States hope to achieve? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The objective of military action, if it comes to that, will be to force 
Haiti's de facto government to make way for the restoration of ousted President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the only democratically elected president in the 
impoverished island republic's history. Aristide was forced into exile in a 
military-backed coup in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why does President Clinton believe an invasion is the right way to do this? 
</P>
<P>
 A: All of the evidence indicates that he does not think that. Haiti's military 
high command, however, led by Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, so far has thwarted all 
attempts to return Aristide to office through peaceful means. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Some countries argue against an invasion. Who are they and what do they 
say? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Mexico, Uruguay, Venezuela and Cuba have expressed strong opposition to an 
invasion. They complain that it would set a dangerous precedent to mount the 
first U.N.-endorsed invasion in the Western Hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many troops might be involved? How many ships? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Pentagon has not said, but the number of troops is expected to be 
15,000 or more, giving the invaders a better than 2-to-1 advantage over the 
7,000-member Haitian army. At the present time, four ships with more than 2,000 
Marines aboard are on maneuvers in the Caribbean, a number that will surely 
grow rapidly if an invasion is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the estimated cost? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are no reliable estimates, but if the operation takes very long, the 
cost will certainly reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are heavy casualties expected? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Pentagon clearly does not expect heavy casualties in a battle between a 
well-trained, well-equipped and numerically superior invasion force and the 
ragtag Haitian army, which has few heavy weapons and is ill-trained for 
warfare. Some casualties are inevitable, however, and the U.S. political system 
has shown very little tolerance for any casualties at all. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What would our troops do once they defeated the Haitian military? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Under the Security Council resolution, the invasion force will be replaced 
by a 6,000-member U.N. peacekeeping force when order is restored and Aristide 
is back in office. The Administration says that the peacekeeping force will be 
led by Americans and will have a large American contingent, although the U.S. 
contribution will be far smaller than in the invasion force. U.N. Ambassador 
Madeleine Albright has said that at least a dozen countries have indicated that 
they will contribute troops to the peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How long might the troops have to stay? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The invasion force can probably complete its work in a brief period, almost 
certainly measured in weeks. But the peacekeeping force may have to remain for 
a long time, perhaps for years. The United Nations envisions keeping the 
peacekeepers in place to maintain law and order until a Haitian police force 
can be trained and deployed -- and that could be a lengthy process.

NEWS ANALYSIS; TIES BETWEEN ISRAEL, JORDAN LEAVE ARAFAT ODD MAN OUT; MIDEAST: 
UNITED FRONT CUTS INTO PLO CHIEF'S ABILITY TO PLAY POLITICS. HE VOWS TO FIGHT 
ANY DEALS ON JERUSALEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel's rapidly improving relations with Jordan are adding to Yasser Arafat's 
woes as he struggles to create a functioning Palestinian government in Gaza and 
the West Bank town of Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, Arafat has survived as leader of the Palestine Liberation 
Organization by deftly picking his way through the sometimes deadly maze of 
inter-Arab politics. Even when he made missteps, he was always able to recover 
by playing one Arab state off another. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, the onetime guerrilla leader faces Jordan's King Hussein and Israeli 
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, two men who share the common goal of ensuring 
that the Palestinian entity will pose neither an economic nor a security threat 
to either of their nations. Arafat, who suspects that the two also are 
determined to prevent the birth of a Palestinian state, is finding it difficult 
either to drive a wedge between the two leaders or to find an Arab partner 
capable of counterbalancing them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week was nightmarish for Arafat. First came the spectacle of a beaming 
Hussein enjoying a hearty handshake on the White House lawn with Rabin before 
the two signed a declaration ending the state of war between Israel and Jordan. 
Arafat publicly praised the move but then expressed alarm over Israel's 
recognition in the declaration of a special role for Jordan in maintaining the 
Muslim holy sites of Arab East Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO leader was so infuriated by the declaration that he subsequently 
allowed his security forces to ban the distribution in Gaza, Jericho and East 
Jerusalem of two pro-Jordanian newspapers, a move that in turn raised a storm 
of protest from Palestinian intellectuals who complained that Arafat and his 
new government are anti-democratic. 
</P>
<P>
 But the PLO leader made it clear Monday that he will not step aside to allow 
Jordan and Israel to cut a deal on Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us, Jerusalem is one issue, one cause. It is not only a political issue, 
it is a sovereignty issue, it is an issue of holy sacred places for Christians 
and Muslims," Arafat said in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat called on Israel to open talks immediately with the PLO on the future 
status of Jerusalem, although Israel and the PLO decided in September's joint 
declaration to put off those negotiations to no later than May, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they have decided to start now, then we are insisting to start now," 
Arafat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel immediately rebuffed the notion of opening talks soon with the PLO on 
Jerusalem's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is agreement that the issue is not discussed at this stage," said 
Police Minister Moshe Shahal, who met Monday in Tel Aviv with Nabil Shaath, 
minister of planning and international cooperation for the Palestinian 
Authority, to discuss the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israeli jails. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jerusalem is under Israeli sovereignty and united. It has been so for 27 
years and will remain so in the future," Shahal said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Israelis did meet Monday with PLO officials in Jerusalem for the first 
time. Negotiators for the two sides held talks on economic issues at a building 
owned by the Roman Catholic Church that lies on the dividing line between West 
and East Jerusalem. Palestinians saw this as a small victory, but Israeli 
officials dismissed the significance of the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel says that Jerusalem is its capital and will remain undivided. The PLO 
says it wants to make mostly Arab East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from 
Jordan in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and later annexed, the capital of a future 
Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
 King Hussein, who traces his lineage back to the prophet Mohammed, claims a 
role in maintaining the Muslim holy sites nestled inside the walls of East 
Jerusalem's ancient Old City. Jordan controls the trust that runs the Temple 
Mount, site of Al Aqsa, Islam's third-holiest mosque. Hussein recently spent $6 
million of his private funds to refurbish the mosque. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Arafat is confronted with further evidence of the warming in 
relations between Israel and Jordan. Peace talks resumed between the two 
nations on their southern border Monday. And next Monday, Hussein and Rabin are 
hoping to meet again, to inaugurate a new border crossing between their nations 
just north of the twin ports of Aqaba and Eilat. U.S. Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher is expected to join them for a ceremony opening a crossing for 
tourists carrying passports from nations other than Israel or Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli and Jordanian sources say they are making quick headway on issues 
ranging from sharing scarce water resources to offering joint tourist packages. 
Some West Bank Palestinians already have been granted licenses by Jordan to 
export to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel and the Palestinians also are immersed in talks, which began Monday in 
Cairo, on extending Palestinian self-government to include the entire West 
Bank. But those negotiations are moving slowly as the two sides haggle over 
taxation, education, health care and other bureaucratic matters. 
</P>
<P>
 And, ominously for Arafat, Gazans are beginning to grumble openly that the PLO 
has yet to make real improvements in their lives. PLO Labor Minister Samir 
Ghoshe said in an interview that unemployment remains at around 45% and 
acknowledged that he has no immediate solution to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Gazans from opposition factions and even within the mainstream PLO also openly 
complain about Arafat's recent decision to appoint a municipal council for Gaza 
City that is heavy on Arafat supporters, light on opposition seats and 
conspicuously lacking independent-minded Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition has boycotted the council and called instead for early 
elections. The PLO says elections, tentatively scheduled for October, will be 
put off at least until the end of December.

SURVIVOR DESCRIBES SHOOTING AT FLORIDA ABORTION CLINIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her first interviews since a protester shotgunned an abortion doctor and 
his escorts arriving at a clinic Friday, the only survivor of the attack, June 
Barrett, recalled the horror of discovering that Dr. John Britton had been 
killed, then getting out of the truck to find the body of her husband, 
74-year-old James Barrett. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Barrett said she ducked to the floor and stayed there as pellets and 
shards of glass blew through the cab.She spoke in an interview with NBC's 
"Today" show and in a later telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband died for the cause of a woman's right to choose," Mrs. Barrett 
said, promising she would return to work as an abortion clinic escort. "I'm not 
going to sit back in a corner and not do anything. Somebody's got to stand." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Barrett, who was wounded in the forearm and breast, and her husband had 
served for the 17 months as escorts at The Ladies Center, volunteering after 
the murder of Pensacola abortion doctor David Gunn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stepped over Jim. He was lying right there beside the car," she recalled, 
"And I realized then my arm was hurting. I had blood running down my legs . . . 
. " 
</P>
<P>
 Police have charged well-known abortion opponent Paul Hill, 40, with two 
counts of murder and one of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Barrett said Hill "was just always an annoyance -- yelling and screaming 
and carrying his posters. I did not believe he would shoot anybody."

FOR GOP, MALADIES LINGER IN DEMOCRATIC HEALTH PLANS; POLITICS: REPUBLICAN 
LEADERS GO ON TV FOR AN HOUR TO DENOUNCE REFORM PROPOSALS. BUT AN INTRAPARTY 
BATTLE RAGES OFF STAGE OVER STRATEGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Republican leaders denounced the Democratic approach to health reform Monday 
night in a nationally televised policy forum amid an intense behind-the-scenes 
debate over what strategy the GOP should pursue on the issue that now dominates 
the national political landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 The hourlong program, carried live by C-SPAN and various satellite links 
around the country, was heralded as an attempt to show Americans that the GOP 
has its own solution to the nation's health care problems. But most of the 
evening was spent depicting what Republicans say the nation has to fear from 
the remedies proposed by Clinton and congressional Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican House Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia and Republican National 
Chairman Haley Barbour spearheaded the assault, contending that 
Democratic-backed reforms would lower the quality of care, limit its 
availability, raise taxes and prices, lower wages and eliminate jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A law that hurts the quality of medical care is a serious risk to your 
health," said Barbour, summing up the theme of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the GOP leaders sought to present a unified picture to the 
television audience, the intraparty argument over strategy raged in cloakrooms 
and caucus rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been more meetings on this issue involving more people and more 
organizations than anything I have seen in all my years in this city," said 
Republican political consultant Eddie Mahe, who came to Washington more than 20 
years ago as executive director of the Republican National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans, fearful of being labeled obstructionists and supportive of 
some reforms, want to stress their willingness to join in a bipartisan package 
of cost controls, though they support a more limited role for government than 
President Clinton and the Democratic congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But others believe that any health care measure that passes will be labeled a 
Clinton achievement, giving Democrats a huge partisan boost in this election 
year. "If health care passes, then gridlock is broken and Clinton wins," said 
GOP pollster Bill McInturff, who has been advising Republican leaders on the 
issue. "But if it doesn't, then Democrats who argue that it will hurt 
Republicans are crazy, because it's their President and their issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who are believed to be determined to resist Democratic pressure to 
act is Gingrich. "If we can't get market-driven reform we will oppose anything 
being done this year," Gingrich told other party leaders at a strategy session 
last week, according to one participant in the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that both public opinion and Republican opinion have been moving in 
the direction of believing that any reform legislation that is likely to come 
out of the Congress is going to be bad for the country," said Bill Kristol, 
head of the Project for the Republican Future, an advocacy and strategy group. 
</P>
<P>
 On the television program, Republicans complained that the Democrats are in 
too much of a hurry to push health care legislation through before Congress 
leaves for its summer recess in two weeks. "You are bound to do very dumb 
things when you legislate in such a hasty manner," Gingrich said. Other 
Republican lawmakers on hand were Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood, and Florida Sen. 
Connie Mack. 
</P>
<P>
 Packwood pointed out that some provisions of Democratic reform proposals would 
not go into effect until the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Mack said that many of the elderly citizens in his state are concerned about 
Democratic proposals to cap spending on Medicare. "What they are afraid about 
is that, when you put a cap on how much can be spent, somebody has to give up 
something. What we are talking about is the potential damage that can be done 
to the best health care system in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans also used the program to tout their own reform proposals, 
principally the "American option" bill, co-sponsored by Packwood and Senate 
Minority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas. Barbour said that the Dole-Packwood measure 
would control costs, expand coverage and guarantee portability of insurance all 
without raising taxes or increasing the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans also complained about the failure of any Democrats to back their 
"American option" plan. "(Senate Majority Leader George J.) Mitchell has been 
leaning hard on Democrats not to commit to us," said Packwood. "They feel that 
if they cannot pass a Democratic bill it will be a disaster in the election." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile on Capitol Hill, some Republicans see the crucial test in health 
care reform facing them in the Senate. They expect Mitchell to try to push 
through legislation that will include at least a watered-down version of a 
mandate for some employers to pay for their workers' insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 With that accomplished, as this scenario goes, Democrat leaders would try to 
prod their members in the more liberal House into adopting a more stringent 
employer mandate provision. That would send the legislation to a joint 
House-Senate conference where Republicans fear the odds would favor the House 
version.

ALTHOUGH WARNED, CIA LEFT AMES ALONE; ESPIONAGE: SENATOR SAYS THE LACK OF 
ACTION POINTS UP THE NEED TO REFORM THE WAY THE AGENCY MONITORS THOSE WHO HOLD 
SENSITIVE POSITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nearly four years before Aldrich H. Ames was arrested, CIA security officers 
received an urgent warning that the now-confessed spy was spending money 
lavishly but they took no effective action against him, according to a 
declassified memo released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.), who released the document as chairman of the 
Senate Intelligence Committee, said that it demonstrates what congressional 
critics have been claiming for months -- that grave reforms are needed in the 
way the intelligence agency monitors those who hold sensitive positions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something big-time wrong with the CIA," DeConcini said in an 
interview. "I don't know that (CIA Director R. James) Woolsey has done anything 
to cure it." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the document, which DeConcini had declassified after months of 
effort, the agency's counterintelligence center advised the office of security 
on Dec. 5, 1990, that Ames was exhibiting "lavish spending habits" at a time 
when operations under his control were being compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo writer, whose name was blacked out in the document made public, noted 
that Ames had paid cash a year earlier for a $540,000 split-level home in 
suburban Virginia, had spent thousands of dollars more on renovating it and had 
purchased a new $49,500 Jaguar automobile -- all on a government salary of less 
than $70,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo noted another danger sign: Ames' sudden wealth had come at a time 
when a number of operations under his control had been compromised. He had been 
chief of the CIA's Soviet-East European division, responsible for several 
valuable foreign sources who abruptly disappeared and were presumed murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 Written when the CIA's hunt for a suspected Soviet "mole" in its midst had 
apparently slowed for lack of investigative manpower, the memo said, "We 
request that the Office of Security open a re-investigation on Aldrich H. Ames 
and review the records" of his banking transactions. It added that "there is a 
degree of urgency involved in our request." 
</P>
<P>
 DeConcini said that the CIA security office "did nothing substantial" with the 
information, and he declared that "the FBI should have been brought in." The 
senator is sponsoring legislation to give the FBI a greater role in hunting for 
domestic moles at the CIA, on the grounds that it has more expertise in this 
field than the CIA and is not hampered by sympathies for the "old-boy network" 
of CIA Cold War veterans like Ames. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames, who spent 31 years with the agency, pleaded guilty last April to 
accepting $2.5 million since 1985 in return for giving the former Soviet Union 
and later Russia the names of their citizens who were valuable sources for the 
CIA, along with other sensitive data. More than 10 sources were summarily 
executed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames' wife, Rosario, pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of assisting his 
espionage. While Ames is serving a life sentence without chance of parole, 
Rosario Ames is expected to receive a term of about four years in prison if her 
husband cooperates with authorities who are questioning him about his past 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 DeConcini said he hoped that "some substantial changes will occur (at the 
CIA). They need some new directions and some new people." The senator said he 
planned to question Ames soon in prison, but was uncertain whether the 
committee would call him as a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Harrington, a top aide to Woolsey, said that the document released by 
DeConcini was one of many the agency has given to Senate and House oversight 
committees looking into the Ames case. He said that several weeks after the 
memo was received in late 1990, the agency formed a joint task force with the 
FBI to investigate Ames and a number of other suspected moles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CIA and FBI shared information fully from the onset of the 
investigation," Harrington insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it was not until May, 1993, that the FBI felt it had sufficient 
evidence to place Ames and his wife under full-time surveillance. It was only 
then that eavesdropping devices were planted in their home and their telephone 
was tapped. Additional evidence obtained in this manner led to the Ameses' 
arrest last February. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolsey has told reporters that financial investigations of suspects like Ames 
have been complicated by the legal necessity to notify suspects that their 
banking records are being examined. He has asked Congress to change this 
requirement and to force banks to cooperate more fully in such investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ames told The Times in a prison interview in May that he was able to finesse 
his way through a polygraph examination in 1991 and that laxity in the agency 
eased his access to secrets that he sold. DeConcini said the polygraph operator 
may not have been given access to all the data on Ames, and thus "did not do a 
decent job."

FDA PANEL CITES POSSIBLE ABUSE OF NICOTINE SPRAY; REGULATION: ADVISORY GROUP 
SAYS THAT FOR SOME PEOPLE, EXPERIMENTAL NASAL THERAPY CAN BE AS ADDICTIVE AS 
CIGARETTES. STRICT CONTROLS ARE URGED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An experimental nicotine nasal spray designed to help smokers quit cigarettes 
can be just as difficult for some to stop using as cigarettes, a federal 
advisory panel said Monday -- a conclusion that likely will weigh heavily in 
the current debate over regulating cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Food and Drug Administration's drug abuse advisory committee, which today 
will directly address the issue of whether nicotine is addictive and at what 
doses, said that the nasal spray has significant potential for abuse. It 
recommended that it be strictly controlled, if approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members urged that the spray be available only by prescription, and 
that the label carry strong warnings about potential abuse. They also 
recommended that there be a limit on the number of refills available to users. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel Monday listened to considerable data about nicotine withdrawal, as 
well as more than a dozen case studies of patients in research studies who were 
able to give up cigarettes by using the spray -- but then did not want to give 
up the spray. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're worried that we have found a new dosage form for an old drug of abuse," 
said Dr. E. Douglas Kramer of the FDA, who examined the histories of patients 
in one study who quit smoking but who could not give up the spray. 
</P>
<P>
 The deliberations were significant because the agency, which has regulatory 
authority over drugs, has been steadily building a case in recent months that 
cigarettes are, essentially, drug delivery systems -- with nicotine as the 
drug. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency already regulates nicotine in smoking cessation products but has 
never before attempted to regulate cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 If the panel Tuesday concludes that nicotine is indeed an addictive drug -- 
and that the levels found in cigarettes are addictive -- this almost certainly 
will open the way for the agency to act against cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last six months, the FDA has waged an intense investigation into 
nicotine, tobacco and the cigarette industry to determine whether companies 
control and manipulate nicotine levels to keep smokers hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials repeatedly have denied they control nicotine in cigarettes 
for this reason. They have said they do adjust levels of nicotine, but only to 
maintain taste and flavor and to achieve consistency in individual brands. 
</P>
<P>
 They also have said they believe nicotine is not an addictive substance. 
</P>
<P>
 Research has associated nicotine with heart disease and has shown that it 
affects the brain and the fetus. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate over nicotine replacement products often has focused on whether 
users simply trade one harmful habit for another. 
</P>
<P>
 The health dangers from cigarettes, however, which include lung cancer, 
emphysema and other respiratory ailments and heart disease, come less from 
nicotine than from inhaling the toxic substances produced by burning the 
tobacco leaf. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Richard Hurt, who runs a smoking cessation program at the Mayo Clinic in 
Rochester, Minn., said the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal can include 
depressed mood, insomnia, irritability, frustration and anger, anxiety, 
difficulty concentrating, restlessness, decreased heart rate and increased 
appetite and weight gain. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA's Kramer told of patients who suffered nosebleeds and nasal ulcers, 
but still resisted stopping the spray and of one woman who "can't bear the 
thought of being without it." After eight months of therapy, she had "no 
temptation to smoke, but (was) hooked on spray," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spray differs from current prescriptive nicotine therapies, such as 
nicotine chewing gum and the nicotine patch. In the spray, nicotine is more 
rapidly absorbed and in greater concentrations -- similar to cigarettes -- 
although individuals metabolize drugs in different ways and at different rates. 
</P>
<P>
 One dose -- two sprays -- of the drug delivers 1 milligram of nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
 The average cigarette, regardless of whether it is a "light" version or a 
regular, contains from 7 to 9 milligrams of nicotine.

 The Citadel may shave Shannon Faulkner's head when she becomes the first woman 
to join the school's corps of cadets, a judge ruled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge C. Weston Houck also ordered Faulkner to stay in a private 
room in the college's infirmary instead of its barracks.And he rejected her 
request for a sexual harassment committee to monitor her progress in the corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner's attorneys argued that she should not be subjected to the 
humiliation of having her head shaved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not talking about anything right now," Faulkner said after the almost 3 
1/2-hour hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Houck ruled last month that the Citadel's all-male admission policy is 
unconstitutional and ordered Faulkner into the corps this fall. The state 
military school is appealing.

 In a move that threatens Los Angeles public schools, the Senate on Monday 
approved an amendment that would cut off federal funds to any school district 
that teaches homosexuality is a "positive lifestyle alternative" through 
classwork, textbooks or counseling programs. The vote was 63 to 36. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban was added to a bill reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act, which provides $12.5 billion in federal funds shared by 
virtually all of the nation's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the Senate Labor and Human 
Resources Committee, who opposes the ban, argued that it would inject the 
government into decision-making by local school boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the ban, including Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Sen. Robert C. 
Smith (R-N.H.), contended that school districts have used federal funds to buy 
books and other materials that are so "graphic and disgusting" that they could 
not be shown on the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The House already has passed its version of the reauthorization bill with a 
milder version of the ban, barring use of federal funds for school programs 
that condone homosexuality. Once the Senate finally approves its 
reauthorization bill, the two pieces of legislation will be sent to a 
House-Senate conference committee to resolve differences -- including the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy will be chairman of Senate conferees. Neither Helms nor Smith is 
likely to be named as a Senate member of the conference committee. 
</P>
<P>
 With a number of gay-friendly programs in place, the Los Angeles Unified 
School District would be a prime target of the proposal. The district, which is 
receiving $574 million in federal funds this fiscal year, long has had a 
counseling program for gay high school students. The district also designated 
June as Gay and Lesbian Pride Month, created a Gay and Lesbian Education 
Commission to advise the school board and recently sponsored its first gay 
student prom. 
</P>
<P>
 California's two Democratic senators, Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein, 
voted against the ban.

MOTHER KILLS 3 CHILDREN, HERSELF AT RESORT CONDO

 A 31-year-old woman, apparently despondent over having to return her children 
to the custody of their father in Long Beach, killed herself and her three 
small daughters this weekend in a $350-a-night resort condominium in posh 
Indian Wells, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of Terri Lynn Esterak, a Rancho Mirage resident, and her children 
-- 9-year-old Erica, 3-year-old Eden and 16-month-old Erin -- were found about 
12:30 p.m. Monday at the Hyatt Grand Champion Villas, said Riverside Deputy 
Coroner Lisa Banasiak. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, Banasiak said, had spent July with their mother, and were 
scheduled to be returned this month to the custody of their father, Michael 
Esterak of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy added that the mother had left a suicide note, but he would not 
divulge the contents. The father could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County Sheriff's Sgt. John Sebastian said the room at the Hyatt had 
been double-locked when hotel housekeepers arrived to clean it Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Security guards opened the door to find the pajama-clad bodies of the three 
little girls piled on the bed with their mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The sergeant said it was unclear what time the shootings occurred because no 
gunshots were reported by hotel guests. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, he said, had checked into one of the hotel's most exclusive 
condominiums on Saturday; hotel employees told police they had not noticed any 
strange behavior on her part. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just terrible," Sebastian said. "We have acts of violence in our area, 
but this hits harder because of the nature of the crime and the kids involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We deal with these things in our careers, but . . . it's really hard," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian Wells is about 110 miles east of Los Angeles.

CRASH THAT KILLED 14 FROM L.A. TIED TO TRUCKER'S FATIGUE

<P>
 The truck-van accident that killed 14 Californians in Texas during the July 4 
holiday weekend resulted from the truck driver's fatigue, the Texas Department 
of Public Safety said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the truck driver disputed the conclusion, with one saying the 
state was under pressure to find a "fall guy" in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen children and two adults, all Los Angeles residents, were killed after 
an 18-wheeler struck the van in which they were riding near Weatherford, 30 
miles west of Ft. Worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, headed to Vicksburg, Miss., for a family reunion, were traveling 
in the van at an estimated 18 to 28 m.p.h. on Interstate 20 at the time of the 
July 3 collision, according to Texas investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The trucker, Richie Darrell Ware, 34, of Arlington, Tex., did not brake or 
take evasive action before the collision, state officials reported. His 
tractor-semitrailer was going between 60 and 65 m.p.h. when it struck the van, 
investigators said. The daytime speed limit for trucks on the highway is 60 
m.p.h.

3 FIRST PENSION PRINCIPALS PLEAD GUILTY TO FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Expressing "incredible remorse" at cheating thousands of investors out of 
$121.5 million in retirement funds, prominent Orange County businessman William 
E. Cooper on Monday acknowledged that the fraud engineered by his company began 
only one year after it was founded in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Losses at First Pension Corp. in Irvine were so substantial, Cooper said, that 
"it was clear we had violated laws and were violating laws and at that point we 
invested in other businesses in an attempt to bring money back into the 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 While exhibiting little emotion after pleading guilty to fraud before U.S. 
District Judge John G. Davies, Cooper, 50, broke down and cried in a courthouse 
hallway after the proceedings. His voice breaking as he removed his glasses to 
clumsily wipe tears from his eyes, "I feel incredibly bad." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something you can't live with," said Cooper, who until recently was a 
politically connected real estate investor and Villa Park resident who was a 
frequent contributor to Republican political campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper and his two longtime business partners, Robert E. Lindley, 51, of 
Laguna Niguel and Valerie Jensen, 47, of San Juan Capistrano, each entered 
guilty pleas to two counts of mail fraud in connection with what has been 
described as one of Southern California's most elaborate and longest running 
investment scams. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were accused of creating a pyramid scheme that bilked many of First 
Pension's 8,000 clients out of $66.7 million in direct investments and $54.8 
million in interest that would have otherwise accrued. Investors were enticed 
into phony second trust deed mortgage funds, which the defendants admitted 
Monday were shams from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Each faces prison terms of up to 10 years and a $500,000 fine. Davies 
scheduled sentencing of the trio for Oct. 6, when he will decide how much 
restitution each must make to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of former clients who came to watch the proceedings were far from 
sympathetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see him dragged away in handcuffs," said Joseph Elia, 63, of 
Redondo Beach, who blames Cooper for the $100,000 he said he lost through First 
Pension. "What I can't understand is how can he live now? These actions must be 
burned into his conscience forever, if he has one." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindley, a former accountant, told the judge that the three principals 
continued to operate the scheme in an attempt to become profitable and return 
money to investors. He said he was pleading guilty "because I was involved in 
this scheme to hide losses from investors. I'm sorry I did it." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge asked Lindley if we was aware he was breaking laws and he replied, 
"Yes, our objective in covering the fraud was to try to repay the debt that had 
been created." 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen said that while she did not initially understand she was participating 
in illegal doings, she became "swept away by events and willingly participated 
in the acts I've been accused of." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper went to such elaborate lengths to try to protect the scam that 
prosecutors allege he hired an actress in 1990 to impersonate a state 
Department of Corporations investigator. She then pretended to review files for 
three weeks and a letter was then drafted on Department of Corporations 
stationery stating that all the files were in order. 
</P>
<P>
 By entering guilty pleas Monday, the three avoid a lengthy and costly trial. 
Prosecutors said the plea bargains have helped win the cooperation of the trio 
in trying to recover some of the lost funds, and said the three are working 
with the government to charge other people involved in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy that each defendant lived up to the plea agreement and pleaded 
guilty today," Assistant U.S. Atty. John F. Libby said. "We will continue to 
work with the defendants to make sure funds are returned to investors." 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing followed an earlier hearing before U.S. District Judge Brian Q. 
Robbins, in which Cooper, Lindley and Jensen were arraigned. They were later 
fingerprinted and booked at the U.S. marshal's office. Cooper and Lindley 
posted bail of $50,000, and Jensen was granted a one-week extension to come up 
with her $50,000 bail bond and was released. Cooper's lawyer said that his 
client had his bail posted by a brother, Terry P. Cooper, who lives in Arizona.

First Pension's Downfall 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based First Pension Corp. is accused of defrauding thousands of 
investors of more than $120 million in what officials described as an elaborate 
Ponzi scheme. A chronology of events: 
</P>
<P>
 1987 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 12: First Pension contends that each of 23 virtually identical real 
estate investment pools are exempt from regulation as a public securities 
offering because they will be offered to no more than 35 sophisticated 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 1994 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 10: Summit Trust Services, a Denver company created by First Pension 
owner William E. Cooper to manage client funds, purportedly holds its annual 
board of directors meeting in Aliso Viejo. Subsequent investigation reveals it 
was actually a location where the company had a registered postal box. 
</P>
<P>
 * April 5: Valerie Jensen, First Pension's president, resigns, citing job 
stress. 
</P>
<P>
 * April 21: Colorado banking regulators seize Summit Trust. Regulators appoint 
Andrew C. Snyder to take charge of the assets. 
</P>
<P>
 * April 22: First Pension files for protection from creditors in an Orange 
County federal bankruptcy court. Stunned investors flood the firm's switchboard 
with calls. 
</P>
<P>
 * May 13: FBI and Securities and Exchange Commission officials allege First 
Pension used a massive pyramid scheme to defraud investors out of an estimated 
$121.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * May 26: Preliminary injunction requested by the SEC is issued to freeze 
First Pension's assets along with assets of its three principals. 
</P>
<P>
 * May 31: About 150 angry investors pack federal bankruptcy court in Santa 
Ana. Court-appointed receiver for Summit Trust tells investors only about 30% 
of investor funds are accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 1: Investigators say principals Cooper, Jensen and Robert E. Lindley 
have signed agreements to cooperate with the U.S. attorney's office in Los 
Angeles while also agreeing to plead guilty to as-yet-unspecified fraud 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 10: SEC officials ask a federal judge to jail Cooper, Jensen and 
Lindley for contempt of court for refusing to turn over financial records under 
a court order. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 28: CommerceBancorp in Newport Beach postpones a stock offering that 
would have brought in desperately needed capital, citing liability concerns 
over its past business dealings with First Pension. The bank is later closed by 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 * July 7: Investor group files a class-action suit against First Pension in a 
Santa Ana court, hoping to regain some of the money lost in dealings with 
failed pension management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 1: Cooper, Lindley and Jensen plead guilty to two counts each of mail 
fraud; could face 10 years in prison and $500,000 in fines.

DENISE HUBER TO REST IN HEARTLAND PEACE; FUNERAL: TO RESIDENTS OF HERREID, 
S.D., THE O.C. MURDER VICTIM'S FATE SYMBOLIZES URBAN ILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a town where speeders are about the biggest menace, where there is barely 
enough work for one part-time cop, a symbol of big-city crime is about to be 
buried. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 485 residents of this rural community, the funeral today of murder 
victim Denise Huber represents the perils of urban life. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of thing just doesn't happen around here," said resident Rita 
Fjeldheim. "We don't even lock our front doors at night. . . . It's 
unbelievable what happened to that poor young girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Clarence O. Fjeldheim, who is mayor of Herreid, said: "We can't 
imagine anyone would do a thing like that. Who would be so rude?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Fjeldheims, like many residents here, will pay their respects to a young 
woman they never knew but whose family name lives on in this agricultural 
community. The 23-year-old Newport Beach woman will be buried next to her 
grandfather, Edward Huber, a farmer who once owned and operated the city's only 
motel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Denise Huber never lived in Herreid, her father, Dennis, grew up in 
these flat, grassy plains where summers are pleasant but winters can be brutal. 
He vividly remembers living in a farmhouse without running water or 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough land," said Dennis Huber, who left the state in 1967 after 
meeting and marrying his wife, Ione, who was a schoolteacher here. "It can be 
tough, but the people are good and honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Denise Huber's handcuffed and bludgeoned body was found three 
weeks ago stuffed in a freezer and stored in a truck in Arizona, Dennis and 
Ione Huber had decided that they wanted to move to Bismarck, N.D., about 100 
miles north of here. 
</P>
<P>
 They said Southern California had lost its appeal after their daughter 
disappeared June 3, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "The memories are too strong" in Southern California, Dennis Huber said Monday 
from his mother's house in nearby Mobridge, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities believe Denise Huber was murdered three years ago in Orange County 
and preserved in the freezer by John J. Famalaro, a 37-year-old handy man. He 
is being held without bail in Arizona pending extradition to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Huber's body was flown from Arizona on Monday and brought to a mortuary 
in Mobridge for today's funeral. The family spent some time at the mortuary 
Monday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real difficult time for us," Dennis Huber said. 
</P>
<P>
 Folks here have been shocked by the news accounts of the young woman's death, 
which they have been reading about in their local paper. Murder, they say, is 
what happens in big cities and on television shows, not in Herreid. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Reinert, the local police officer and city maintenance worker, said he 
can't remember when there's ever been a homicide in Herreid. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really haven't been no violent crimes," Reinert said. "We occasionally 
get a burglary and some thefts, but nothing major." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of his police work is spent patrolling for speeding motorists along 
Highway 83, which stretches from Texas to Canada and serves as Herreid's Main 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinert carries a firearm when on duty, but he has never had to draw it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a friendly town," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friendly -- and slow. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a whole lot to do," said Sue Volk, the city finance director. "If 
you want to go to a movie, you have to drive. If you want to go out to a nice 
dinner, you drive. If you want to shop, you drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn to like it," Volk said. "It's real small time, but you have the 
safety of living in a small town." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Fjeldheim, 64, said Herreid is a "wonderful place to raise children." 
It's about 40 miles south of the late bandleader Lawrence Welk's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Herreid's residents are farmers, who this time of year are busy 
tending to their crops of grain and feeding dairy animals. To fill space, the 
local paper often reports when local people leave town on vacations or when 
relatives come by and visit for supper. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Town Council agenda Monday night, the hottest items were painting fire 
hydrants and fixing the brakes on "the city truck." 
</P>
<P>
 The agenda also showed that even Herreid isn't crime-free. The council was to 
discuss the recent theft of horseshoes from the city park and the unlawful 
dumping of grass clippings in a ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the big issues," Mayor Fjeldheim said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
 If people here want big-city excitement they can drive about 100 miles 
southeast to Alberdeen, where the population is about 25,000, or, 100 miles 
north to Bismarck, with a population of about 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But many residents find that Herreid has all the action they need. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty hard to beat a small town for quality living," Fjeldheim said. 
"It's a good feeling when you can say you know your neighbors. That's why 
everybody around was so upset (about Denise Huber's death). Everybody felt like 
they knew her because they know her family."

THE HUBER MURDER CASE; ARIZONA DROPS FAMALARO CHARGES; COURTS: ACTION COMES AS 
ORANGE COUNTY AUTHORITIES PREPARE TO TAKE OVER THE DENISE HUBER SLAYING CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Hours after John J. Famalaro was arraigned Monday on charges that he killed 
Denise Huber and stored her body in a freezer in a stolen rental truck, Arizona 
prosecutors dropped the murder charge as Orange County authorities prepared to 
take over the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro, a 37-year-old handyman and house painter, is being held without bail 
here in Yavapai County Jail pending his extradition to Orange County, where he 
faces charges of the first-degree murder and kidnaping of Huber, a 23-year-old 
Newport Beach woman who disappeared three years ago after attending a rock 
concert. He could be eligible for the death penalty if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Huber's body was transported Monday from Phoenix to Herreid, S.D., where she 
was to be buried today. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, Famalaro provided court-ordered samples of his blood, saliva, 
hair and handwriting to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Yavapai County Deputy Counsel Thomas B. Lindberg said his office dismissed the 
murder charge without prejudice so it could be refiled in the future, if 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindberg said his office was retaining a felony charge of possession of a 
stolen vehicle against Famalaro so that the defendant would remain in custody 
in the unlikely event that he successfully fights extradition. That felony 
charge carries a maximum sentence of about 11 years, Lindberg said. Famalaro is 
accused of stealing the Ryder rental truck in which the freezer bearing Huber's 
body was being stored. 
</P>
<P>
 Famalaro chose not to appear at his arraignment Monday morning to avoid the 
media attention that has been swirling around the case, according to his 
Arizona defense attorney, Thomas K. Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 In his absence, Yavapai Superior Court Judge Raymond W. Weaver Jr. announced 
that Famalaro had entered a not-guilty plea and waived the reading of the 
indictment against him, then set a trial date for Sept. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 But that Arizona trial is unlikely to occur, since Orange County prosecutors 
have already set the extradition process in motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. John D. Conley said his office will probably 
forward paperwork this week asking Gov. Pete Wilson to request Famalaro's 
extradition. Upon Wilson's request, Arizona Gov. Fife Symington can issue a 
warrant forcing Famalaro's transfer to California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best scenario, if everything is (express mailed) and walked through, we 
could have it done in a month," Conley said. "We're going to shoot for that 
month, but it's not a crisis, it's not do or die. We can't guarantee that Gov. 
Wilson will clean off his desk or that the Arizona governor will clean off his 
desk. It's like the airport, some people get there ahead of you." 
</P>
<P>
 Extradition could occur even sooner if Famalaro chooses not to fight it, a 
decision his attorneys said would be announced within about a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Arraignment on the Orange County charges and other procedural matters will 
begin only upon Famalaro's arrival, Conley said. He added that his office is 
not seeking an indictment by the Orange County Grand Jury against Famalaro but 
has not ruled out that possibility.

 After Famalaro's Arizona arraignment Monday morning, Lindberg expressed some 
regret at saying goodby to the gruesome, bizarre case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be an interesting case to prosecute and a challenging case, and I 
wouldn't mind that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife says she's planning a trip to California about whatever time the 
trial goes on," Lindberg said, adding that Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Chris Evans "said he'd save me a seat."

DYLAN GETS A ROM FOR HIS MONEY; COMPUTERS: AN IRVINE FIRM WILL PRODUCE AN 
INTERACTIVE PROJECT THAT WILL PROBABLY CONCENTRATE ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE 
SINGER-SONGWRITER'S MUSIC. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The times they are a-changin', indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Dylan, who started his career more than 30 years ago with nothing more 
technologically sophisticated than an acoustic guitar and a harmonica, is the 
latest pop star to sign on to the burgeoning field of interactive CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
 The Graphix Zone, an Irvine-based multimedia company, announced this week that 
it has signed an agreement with Columbia Records to produce the project, which 
is scheduled to be in stores by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dylan project is in its early development but Chuck Cortright, Graphix 
Zone president and chief executive officer, said it probably will concentrate 
more on the evolution of the singer-songwriter's music than on biographical 
details of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 It is expected to have a completely different look and feel from the company's 
first interactive music project for another reclusive Minnesota-born pop star: 
Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince's CD-ROM, released in June, features sophisticated computer animation 
and a game-like approach in leading users through aspects of the singer's 
career. Along the way, users can call up video clips of unreleased songs, remix 
the recording of another new tune, play disc jockey in a music club and listen 
to testimonials from such fellow musicians as Eric Clapton and George Clinton. 
The average user will take 10 to 20 hours to navigate through the maze-like 
program and experience everything stored on the disc. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials say sales have gone well. And after the project was 
completed, Prince flew some of the project's principals to his Paisley Park 
studios in Minneapolis to personally express his thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cortright said he instigated the Dylan project and called the singer's 
representatives with a proposal. Cortright, who called himself a lifelong Dylan 
fan, said the project grew out of his personal interest, but he maintains it 
makes business sense as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the demographics are right," he said. "I would think there would be a 
lot of 45-year-olds like myself who would pick up on this." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell Rubinstein of Graphix Zone, who is heading up the Dylan project, said 
Columbia Records is combing its archives for unreleased songs and film footage 
that could be incorporated into the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "They keep calling us with new things they're finding," said Rubinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Dylan's representatives and officials at Columbia Records could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, officials at Graphix Zone, which was formed in 1989 and went public 
in June, say they are in negotiation with other major artists (whom they would 
not name) for future projects. Other pop and rock musicians who have released 
computer-based multimedia products for other firms include Peter Gabriel, Todd 
Rundgren, Heart and David Bowie. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment titles are "our future, in no uncertain terms," said Cortright. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody is finally seeing that this is a powerful new form of 
entertainment.

JAZZ REVIEW; REGULARS SAY BYE-BYE BIRDLAND; THE LONG BEACH NIGHTCLUB'S FAREWELL 
IS ONE BIG JAM SESSION AS THE OWNER, DRUMMER AL WILLIAMS, CALLS IT QUITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like the line in "Lush Life," songwriter Billy Strayhorn's paean to the 
denizens of nightclubs, a neon sign in a second-story window announces "jazz 
and cocktails" -- this one overlooking the downtown corner of Pine Avenue and 
East Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, the drinks and the music are gone from that spot now as Birdland West, 
the heart of the Long Beach jazz scene, has closed. 
</P>
<P>
 After almost eight years in business, owner Al Williams has decided that too 
many demands were being made on his time and that it would be best to close the 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 "We weren't doing great, but we weren't in any (financial) trouble really," 
Williams explained Sunday at the club's closing bash. "It's just that I've got 
so many things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a drummer himself, says he'll spend more time with his music, his 
grandchildren and maybe take a sculpting class. He'll also stay involved with 
his entertainment company, Rainbow Promotions, which sponsors the Long Beach 
Jazz Festival and the Long Beach Carnivale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't play any golf," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 But Birdland wouldn't close without one last party. A group of friends and 
well-wishers climbed the 31 steps to the second-floor location Sunday afternoon 
for the last time. They were treated to performances from some of Birdland's 
regular performers, including singers Ernie Andrews, Barbara Morrison and Lil' 
Joe Dobbins, pianist Gildo Mahones, drummers Ndugu Chancler, Alphonse Mouzon 
and, of course, Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening was one big jam session as musicians rotated on and off the stage 
in mix-and-match sessions that underscored the spontaneous nature of their art. 
</P>
<P>
 While these might not have been the most polished sessions ever to grace the 
club's bandstand, they were, no doubt, some of the most heartfelt as a long 
parade of regulars made their way to the microphone to pay their respects. 
</P>
<P>
 Vocalist Andrews, who appeared early in the show with pianist Mahones, bassist 
Andy Simpkins and Williams, later said, "It's a shame that you have to wait for 
someone to close to get this many people out. This club looks today like it 
should have looked all the time in the city of Long Beach, because jazz is so 
great and there are so many great people in the business. And we dearly love 
Al." 
</P>
<P>
 With Williams at the traps, Andrews brought down the house with his rendition 
of "Kansas City," which he peppered with asides about Jay McShann and 
long-winded raps about the morals of the Midwestern city's women. 
</P>
<P>
 Saxophonist Pat Britt sat in with Mahones and company for a taste of "Don't 
Get Around Much Anymore." Then bassist Louis Spears joined the band as Jeff 
Littleton replaced Williams for a blues led by Mahones' stirring keyboard 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Dobbins, backed by a group that included drummer Chancler, worked through 
Eddie Jefferson's lyric to "Night in Tunisia," in an arrangement that featured 
an ambitious set of rhythm changes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the singer's best moments came when singing the blues, his style more 
emotive than musical. Dobbins delivered a few risque phrases in such raunchy 
fashion that he risked being cited for pandering. His accompaniment, again 
featuring Mahones, was equally as spirited. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Chancler took a long galloping solo on "So What" that had Williams 
shouting jokingly from the audience, "That's enough! No more!" He was followed 
by drummer Mouzon, who opened playing piano on a strong, modal number that 
found him sounding in places like his old boss, McCoy Tyner. Saxophonist George 
Harper added an appropriately Coltrane-influenced tenor improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mouzon then sang "Fly Me to the Moon" in a style that made most karaoke 
aficionados look good. But, thankfully, he finally settled behind the drums, 
rattling away impressively with Williams comically holding cymbals in place. 
</P>
<P>
 After more tributes from Andrews and a request for Williams to "relocate 
himself," vocalist Sandy Graham came up to sing "Alone Together" and "Love for 
Sale" in the company of Mahones. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, some five hours after it began, vocalist Barbara Morrison offered "My 
One and Only Love" before being joined by Andrews for an upbeat number that 
could be heard all the way out on the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Birdland's particular niche as a champion of mainstream and R & B-flavored 
jazz made it indispensable to the Southern California music scene. There are no 
ready replacements, and its loss, part of a discouraging and accelerating trend 
that has seen the such stalwart locations as Newport Beach's Cafe Lido and 
Hollywood's Vine St. Bar & Grill close their doors in the last 12 months, is 
deeply felt. 
</P>
<P>
 At least it went out with a bang.

ART REVIEW; FRESH VISIONS EMERGE FROM A MIX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What do you do with 424 slides of work by 167 Orange County artists? If you're 
juror Mike McGee, you look for stuff that's "quirky, ironic, eccentric or 
funky," and is as likely to have been made by untrained "outsiders" as by art 
school graduates. That's the happy secret of the sixth annual "All Media '94" 
exhibit at the Irvine Fine Arts Center through Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewed as a whole, the work (mostly painting, photography and sculpture) by 
the 65 artists McGee chose has its rough edges. But a few of the entries offer 
fresh visions and innovative approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Startlingly visceral and wryly pathetic, Eeva Crume's fiber piece "Migraine" 
is a literal image of an aching brain. Long, wavering strands of nylon thread 
knit the upper and lower portions of a bulbous fuzzy object permeated with the 
hues of fresh and dried blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristina Dendinger's deliciously deadpan painting "Out of Thin Air" consists 
of a wallpaper-like pattern of literary and pop culture characters famous for 
their sudden appearances and disappearances (the Cheshire Cat, Superman and so 
on). Propped up on supports rising just a few inches above the floor, the 
painting itself has a furtive appearance. It won one of 13 honorable mention 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Marten Euchler's third-place painting, "Ire and Indigence" -- large, 
juxtaposed heads of a man tearing his hair and a bright-eyed woman tilting a 
plate into her mouth -- has the crisp, unemotional and unambiguous look of 
illustrations for a child's alphabet book. In the same way that the child's 
book teaches recognition of the names for common objects, Euchler offers a 
neutral primer of emotional states and actions we may or may not view as 
healthy or socially integrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other works, while less compelling, are nevertheless worth noting. By 
finding just the right size and format for her subject, honorable mention 
award-winner Connie Sasso gave her sequence of small black-and-white 
photographs of a woman's legs dancing on a checkered floor ("Tiny Dancer") a 
piquant allure. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the witty appeal of Linda Cushing's assemblage "Vehicle" -- made 
from an old block of wood, casters, bicycle handlebars and a water meter dial 
-- derives from shrewd scavenger choices and a rare economy of means. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the scale, it probably is fitting that the two top awards 
went to artists attempting to address big issues (alcoholism and gay-bashing) 
in unconventional ways. Yet the bigger the issue, the more difficult it is to 
find metaphors or presentational modes that illuminate rather than simply add 
another layer of moralizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Gayle Gardner won first place for her video "Umbrellas" in which the fate of 
paper cocktail umbrellas planted in the ground (a la Christo) mirror the impact 
of the narrator's father's drinking problem. Unfortunately, portentous music 
and heavy-handed verbiage overwhelm the delicate imagery rather than 
complementing it. And whatever point Gardner may have intended by evoking 
Christo's "Umbrellas" project remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Second-place winner John Breitweiser ("Sure Wish") makes paintings that spell 
out factual statements about gays and hate crimes in brightly colored capital 
letters. Like effective public service announcements, his work attracts 
attention and delivers a clear message at a glance. But the best contemporary 
art digs deeper to locate more of the ambiguity and contradiction of 
contemporary life. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is very encouraging to see socially conscious work that avoids 
cliched histrionic imagery. In addition, the presence of numerous 
individualistic works by seemingly untutored artists enlivens this show in a 
way that the politely traditional entries cannot hope to rival.

 A mother who lost custody of her 3-year-old daughter because she put the child 
in day care while she attended classes at the University of Michigan in Ann 
Arbor asked an appeals court in Detroit to block the judge's order while the 
decision is appealed. Jennifer Ireland's attorney, Julie Field, asked the 
Michigan Court of Appeals to delay the transfer of custody of Maranda ordered 
by Macomb County Circuit Judge Raymond Cashen.Cashen said Ireland must 
surrender the girl on Aug. 11 to the girl's father, Steven Smith. Cashen said 
the girl would be better off with Smith, whose mother is a full-time homemaker 
willing to care for the child. Smith, 20, and Ireland, 19, never married. He 
sued for custody last year. Smith, who has a court date scheduled for Aug. 11 
on charges that he beat Ireland in 1992, is a community college student who 
lives with his parents.

 In the Brady law's first 100 days, about 5% of prospective gun buyers were 
barred from purchasing them after background checks, the Treasury Department 
said. The figures -- based on a survey of gun dealers and police in nine cities 
-- show that the gun control law is working, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
said."The law has punished those it meant to punish: the criminals," he said. 
"It hasn't touched the good and honest gun buyers, not for a minute." The 
department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said 70 licensed firearms 
dealers reported receiving 11,727 applications for guns since the law took 
effect Feb. 28 and denying 624, or 5.3%. The survey was conducted in Abilene 
and Houston, Tex.; Louisville, Ky.; Seattle; Pittsburgh; Providence, R.I.; 
Atlanta; Shreveport, La., and Cleveland.

OXNARD URGED TO MEET ITS HOUSING GOAL; GROWTH: TASK FORCE SAYS CITY SHOULD 
BUILD 900 AFFORDABLE HOMES BY 1996. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard needs to build more than 900 affordable dwellings by 1996 to meet its 
own housing goals, and the homes need to cost much less than the city has 
proposed, a city task force has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Affordable Housing Ad Hoc Committee, made up of local business and 
community leaders, found that the city could -- and should -- build 600 
low-cost homes in the next five years by redirecting federal and redevelopment 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard could meet its housing objectives by giving developers more incentives 
to build affordable homes in the city, according to the task force report 
adopted Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Oxnard officials said the city is already doing its best to promote 
affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to create situations to make it possible for more affordable 
housing to be built," Councilman Andres Herrera said. "We're really trying to 
do everything we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera added that the committee has unrealistic expectations of what can be 
accomplished in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes these committees get full of themselves," Herrera said. "When ad 
hoc committees try to become policy-makers, they get a little out of hand. I'm 
interested to see what their recommendations are." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee was created by the City Council a year ago to draft a five-year 
affordable housing plan. Its members were asked to review city funds available 
for housing, previous attempts to build low-cost homes and sites for such 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The final committee report concluded that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Even after accounting for Housing and Urban Development funds, Oxnard's farm 
workers and other poor residents need city subsidies of up to $50,000 to bridge 
the gap between their incomes and the cost of buying the cheapest house. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city urgently needs to provide a homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oxnard needs to appoint a low-income housing expediter to work with the city 
manager to shepherd projects through the bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 * The production of affordable housing should be reviewed every six months at 
a City Council public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city should change design requirements in low-income housing tracts to 
entice developers, such as allowing narrower streets and more houses per acre. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done our job, now the city needs to do theirs," said committee member 
Barbara Macri-Ortiz, an attorney for Channel Counties Legal Services Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But Councilman Tom Holden said the current City Council has helped push five 
affordable housing developments: Donlon Avenue, the Farmers' Market, the Kojima 
site and two projects in the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are limited funds and incentives to create a truly affordable housing 
development," Holden said. "I don't see a lot of developers rushing to do that. 
I think we've made some advances." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard has made strides in its effort to create moderately priced houses, 
creating 453 of the 600 homes the city had pledged to build in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But it has yet to build any of the 425 dwellings it has pledged for very 
low-income residents and has constructed none of the 403 dwellings planned for 
low-income residents, the committee found. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee wants to report its findings to the City Council and Planning 
Commission in a joint session within a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a problem that has been here a while, and we have to wrestle with 
it," committee Chairman Arthur Joe Lopez said. "Until we do, it won't go away."

ELECTRONIC BRACELETS TO BE TRIED ON JUVENILE OFFENDERS; ADULT MONITORING 
PROGRAM SCRAPPED AFTER JAIL INMATES REFUSED TO VOLUNTEER

<P>
 A Ventura County corrections program to monitor the whereabouts of some adult 
criminals with electronic ankle bracelets has flopped, but will soon be tried 
out on juveniles, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the county pulled the plug on a six-month pilot program -- 
originally seen as a way to reduce jail overcrowding and save money -- because 
adult offenders were not interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had only one taker in the four to five months that this program was in 
operation, and she didn't last a week," Deputy Probation Officer Tom McCarthy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the juvenile program set to begin in September is expected to succeed, 
said Cal Remington, deputy director of the county Correction Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the voluntary adult program was that it did not appeal to 
convicts. They said it was too expensive and did not allow for reduced 
sentences because of good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults were required to pay $12 to $16 a day for the program, and "good time" 
of up to one-third of a County Jail inmate's sentence was not available because 
the prisoner was no longer behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 The adult program was available to drug and alcohol offenders who were not 
considered a threat to public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, few people were eligible. And only one person chose to wear the 
bracelet: a woman inmate doing time for an alcohol-related offense, who was 
found drunk a week after entering the program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But juveniles cannot be charged for the service and are not eligible for good 
time anyway, so they are expected to take part, Remington said. The county 
expects to pay for the juvenile program through federal and state funds. 
Subsidies are not available for adult offenders, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Which juveniles will qualify still is not clear. But they will be the least 
threatening of those now in juvenile hall. The bracelets will be worn by about 
25 juveniles and will reflect an expansion in the current home detention 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program may eventually include more teen-agers to lessen the strain on the 
county's overcrowded juvenile hall, which is meant to hold 84 offenders but 
routinely houses more than 100, Remington said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overwhelming consideration is, do we feel that this person could be on 
electronic monitoring without posing a threat to society?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic monitoring has received a lukewarm response from Ventura County 
judges, some of whom feel it is too lenient. The program has been implemented 
in several Southern California counties, including San Diego, where it has been 
widely successful, McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy won't be able to sneak out of his house and go paint graffiti or hang 
with gangs with this," McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The electronic transmitter is locked onto the offender's ankle, and is worn 
even in the shower. It sends a constant signal to a receiver in the wearer's 
home. Once the person gets out of range, the receiver sends an alarm to a 
computer at the probation department. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the bracelets sometimes fail to operate near refrigerators and household 
appliances, and are far from fail-safe, McCarthy said. 
</P>
<P>
 One concern of probation officers is that teen-agers will be more likely to 
try to foil the electronic surveillance -- and their experiments will cost 
taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think kids are more apt to try and beat a system," McCarthy said. "It's on 
their leg and they want to get it off."

MOTHER HELD FOR INJURING BABY DURING QUARREL; CRIME: WHILE ARGUING WITH CHILD'S 
FATHER, SUSPECT ALLEGEDLY DROPPED INFANT OVER A SIX-FOOT-HIGH FENCE, FRACTURING 
3-MONTH-OLD GIRL'S SKULL.

 A 23-year-old Oxnard woman has been arrested on suspicion of felony child 
endangerment for allegedly dropping her baby over a six-foot-high chain-link 
fence during an argument with her boyfriend, the child's father, authorities 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A half-dozen witnesses told police that Aretha Marcell Chester dangled her 
3-month-old daughter over the fence in Sierra Linda Park on Sunday evening 
while chasing after the man, who had already scaled the fence and was walking 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 The fall fractured the baby's skull, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chester, who is being held in Ventura County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bail, 
told police that the baby, Sara Kimbrough, was hurt when she tumbled out of a 
child's car seat resting on a picnic table at the north Oxnard park. 
</P>
<P>
 After staying overnight in the pediatric intensive care unit at St. John's 
Regional Medical Center, Sara was moved to the hospital's nursery and her 
condition was improving, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Lee Wilcox said he does not believe Chester intended to hurt her 
daughter, but that the baby apparently became a pawn in the argument between 
the couple. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wasn't upset at the baby," Wilcox said. "They were arguing, and the baby 
got in the middle of the argument." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police that Chester was shouting at her companion, asking him 
to return to the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was trying to give him the baby, but he wasn't anywhere near the baby 
when she dropped it." Wilcox said. "She wasn't thinking about what she was 
doing, or she wouldn't have dropped the baby in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had been arguing in the park for some time before the incident 
occurred, according to witnesses. After Chester allegedly dropped Sara over the 
fence, she climbed over, picked up the baby and continued arguing with her 
companion, whose name was not released. 
</P>
<P>
 A short time later, the couple drove away from the park together. 
</P>
<P>
 Several witnesses immediately called police and gave a description of the 
couple's vehicle. Officers stopped Chester and her boyfriend on Lantana Street, 
a short distance from the park. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple told patrol officers they were on the way to the hospital to get 
medical help for the baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very upset that the baby was injured," Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby was then treated by paramedics and taken to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilcox said he planned to meet this morning with representatives of the 
Ventura County district attorney's office to discuss the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Chester is scheduled to be arraigned today at 1:30 in Ventura County Municipal 
Court.

PLAGUE FEARS AGAIN CLOSE CAMPGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Lockwood Valley campground has been closed for the second year in a row 
after biologists found rodents infected with the plague. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chuchupate Campground in Los Padres National Forest was also closed by 
health officials in 1993 after wild animals there were found to be carrying 
plague bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Now officials have renewed the ban after finding plague bacteria in blood 
samples taken from rodents that were trapped as part of an ongoing 
disease-monitoring program, said Randall Smith of the county Environmental 
Health Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ventura County is known as an endemic county for plague in wild rodents," 
said Smith, an environmental health specialist. "We know it's here and we just 
try and monitor it in the areas where people can come in contact with wild 
rodents, such as campgrounds." 
</P>
<P>
 The plague bacteria found at Chuchupate in Lockwood Valley are the same type 
that killed millions of Europeans in the Middle Ages, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 But nowadays, he said, plague-infected people can be cured easily with 
antibiotics -- if the symptoms are recognized and treated in time. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common form, called bubonic plague, is spread by the bites of animals 
or the fleas that infest them. The name comes from the word buboes , for the 
large balls that form on the lymph nodes as the organs try to fight the 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A rarer form known as pneumonic plague, spread by particles in the air such as 
those emitted by a sneeze or cough of an infected animal, kills its victims 
much more rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two people are known to have ever survived pneumonic plague, said Charles 
Myers, supervising biologist of a California Department of Health Services lab 
that studies animal- and insect-borne diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy to get, but you still don't want to get it," Myers said of all 
forms of plague. "As one of the survivors of pneumonic plague told us, 'I'd 
never want to do that again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Plague victims suffer symptoms such as those of a harsh flu -- high fever, 
severe muscle aches, nausea and painful or swollen lymph nodes. 
</P>
<P>
 Common sense is the best defense, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're camping, avoid areas where you see squirrel burrows -- putting 
your sleeping bag out on the ground where you see squirrel burrows is asking 
for a fleabite," Myers said. "And taking your pets camping with you is asking 
for a fleabite. Your dog sticks his nose in a squirrel burrow and the fleas are 
all waiting there, and they'll jump on him." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not unusual for biologists to find plague bacteria in about 20 counties 
across California each year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state health department screens for plague bacteria in thousands of blood 
and tissue samples taken every year in the parks, forests and farms of 
California, said department spokesman Ken Townzen. 
</P>
<P>
 Lab technicians have found about 100 samples that tested positive for plague 
so far this year -- a rate that could surpass 1993's total of about 150 
positive tests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find it as far north as Alpine and Eldorado County, all the way down to 
San Bernardino County in the south," Townzen said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, biologists have focused much of their trapping and testing 
this year on Lockwood Valley. They trapped 56 animals there in June, of which 
two -- a wood rat and a ground squirrel -- were found to be carrying plague 
bacteria, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also trapped and tested animals in the Pine Mountain area, where 
plague-bearing animals were found three years ago. But this year no trace of 
plague was found there, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Budget cuts and busy state labs restrict county biologists to only 100 plague 
sample tests each year, he said. "We try and pick areas that the public will 
possibly come in contact with the wild rodent population," he said, such as 
campgrounds and ranches. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said biologists also have been testing trapped mice for evidence of 
hantavirus, a disease carried in the animals' dried feces and urine that can 
kill its victims in a matter of days. They are still awaiting results from 
those tests, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the plague, Smith said, "It's curable if diagnosed early, but if you 
don't get to the doctor on time or it's not caught in time, it can be a 
life-threatening disease." Avoiding the Plague 
</P>
<P>
 Plague bacteria carried by rats and fleas killed millions of Europeans in the 
Middle Ages. Plague is curable today with antibiotics, but it can be fatal if 
its flu-like symptoms are misdiagnosed. Rural residents and nature lovers 
should follow these rules: 
</P>
<P>
 * STAY AWAY from chipmunks, squirrels and other wild animals. Do not feed 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 * DO NOT camp, rest or sleep near animal burrows, and avoid fleas. 
</P>
<P>
 * PROTECT PETS with flea powder or collars. 
</P>
<P>
 * DO NOT touch sick or dead animals. Report them to park, campground or local 
health authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 * SEE A DOCTOR if you get sick within one week of visiting rural Ventura 
County. The symptoms of plague are high fever, severe muscle aches, nausea and 
painful or swollen lymph nodes.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CALIFORNIA CONDOR DIES AT L.A. ZOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An endangered California condor that once flew free in the wild died at the 
Los Angeles Zoo only weeks after biologists recaptured the curious vulture that 
repeatedly strayed too close to populated areas, officials at the Ventura-based 
condor recovery program said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Known as Y87, the large vulture was captured July 4 after repeatedly visiting 
the San Marco Pass area of southern Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 After being held for several days in the Sespe Condor Sanctuary north of 
Fillmore, the bird was taken to the zoo to become part of the captive breeding 
program on July 13. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials said Monday the death does not seem to be related to the 
capture. The posthumous exam revealed an enlarged liver. 
</P>
<P>
 No specific cause of death had been determined by Tuesday, but Marc Weitzel, 
program leader for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife, said the bird had also eaten 
weather stripping from homes in the area he and another condor visited. 
</P>
<P>
 That condor, known as Y89, died June 24 after colliding with a power pole 
after the two birds had been near a back-yard pool and perching on neighborhood 
fences. 
</P>
<P>
 "These birds are incredibly curious about people," said Jeanne Tinsman, a 
biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service, which runs the recovery 
program based near Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 When the program began in 1992, the young zoo-bred birds were released into 
the Sespe Condor Sanctuary north of Fillmore. But after four deaths due to 
contact in populated areas, the remaining birds were transferred to the remote 
Lion Canyon area of Santa Barbara County, 60 miles northwest of the Sespe 
Condor Sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials speculate that the young birds, only 6 months old at the time of 
their release, may need older birds to act as guides to keep they out of 
trouble. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PHOENIX SUNS' FORWARD STEPS UP FOR YOUTH

<P>
 The children's questions for Phoenix Suns forward Cedric Ceballos came rapid 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you rich?" (No.) 
</P>
<P>
 "What is your shoe size?" (Fifteen.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you have a limo?" (No.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you married?" (No.) 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the highest number of points you ever scored in a game?" (Forty.) 
</P>
<P>
 The exchange between the former Ventura College star and youngsters at the 
Boys & Girls Club of Ventura highlighted a press conference Monday, where 
Ceballos promoted a two-day charity event Aug. 26-27. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boys & Girls Club and Ventura College men's basketball program expect to 
raise at least $40,000 from a dinner, sports auction, basketball clinic and 
alumni game. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceballos, who is donating his time, said the Ventura College program "helped 
me to get where I am. So I want to contribute any way possible."  
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of the morning press conference was when the 6-foot-7 star moved 
to the club's gym floor and was peppered with questions by about 80 youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a kid at heart," Ceballos said afterward, "and I want to keep their life 
expectations in perspective." Ceballos said children need to understand that 
only a few people can be basketball stars, so children should work hard toward 
goals they can reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven-year-old Iresha Lee said she was impressed with Ceballos' dedication to 
the youth club after so many years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that it is special that he comes back to Ventura to help the Boys & 
Girls Club," Iresha said. "I don't know anybody that famous who has done that 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The dinner and sports auction will take place Aug. 26 at the Doubletree Hotel 
in Ventura. Both Ceballos' basketball clinic and the alumni game will be held 
the next day at the college gym.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; MAN ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF STALKING 
</P>

<P>
 A Port Hueneme man convicted of setting his ex-wife's car on fire three years 
ago has been arrested on suspicion of stalking her while armed with a pistol, 
authorities said Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 Jesus Medina Macaulay, 38, was taken into custody Sunday evening at a 
Camarillo fast-food restaurant after he confronted his former wife, Audrey 
Ducharme, and her husband, David, Sheriff's Sgt. Mike Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducharmes had pulled off the Ventura Freeway after their truck overheated. 
They discovered that someone had slashed the vehicle's radiator hose while they 
danced at a Thousand Oaks club, Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting for the truck to cool off, the Ducharmes walked to the fast-food 
restaurant. There, they spotted Macaulay standing inside the restaurant 
watching them. 
</P>
<P>
 David Ducharme asked employees to call police as Macaulay went outside and 
began yelling at his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 When sheriff's deputies arrived, they searched Macaulay's car and found a 
derringer pistol on the front seat and several bullets nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Macaulay was arrested on suspicion of violating a restraining order against 
him, of stalking his ex-wife and of carrying a firearm in violation of his 
probation. Macaulay, who was being held in Ventura County Jail on $100,000 
bail, is scheduled to be arraigned today at 1:30 p.m. in Ventura County 
Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Macaulay told detectives that he did not sabotage the car and that Sunday 
night's encounter was a coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Audrey Ducharme said the incident is nothing new. She said her husband has 
followed her periodically and threatened her since their divorce in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was planning to get rid of us," she said. "He had the derringer 
right there next to him."  
</P>
<P>
 Macaulay was convicted of setting his ex-wife's car on fire as she visited a 
friend in Ventura in October, 1991. He was sentenced to 180 days in jail and 
five years probation. JULIE FIELDS

 A man suspected of stealing an Oxnard woman's car at gunpoint 10 days ago has 
confessed to the crime after being arrested in Los Angeles County, Oxnard 
police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lotonaulalo Taau, 22, of Lawndale was pulled over by Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's deputies in Redondo Beach Sunday for driving erratically.A records 
check revealed the car had been stolen from 41-year-old Debra Zellis. 
</P>
<P>
 Zellis, a secretary at Mary Law Private School in Oxnard, leaped from the 
moving vehicle after being carjacked in the school's parking lot. She was 
bruised but otherwise unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview with an Oxnard detective, Taau admitted taking Zellis' 
car, said Oxnard Police Sgt. Chuck Dunham. He also confessed to stealing 
another car in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 That car had broken down and was found abandoned about 50 feet from the Oxnard 
school where Zellis works. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunham said it appeared that Taau would be tried in Los Angeles County on the 
first carjacking and then transferred to Ventura County to be charged with 
stealing Zellis' vehicle. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 Port Hueneme City Councilman James Daniels has announced that he will step 
down in December after eight years on the council, and community activist Tony 
Volante filed to run for the office Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I have served the city long enough," said Daniels, 68."It has been 
eight years as a councilman and 37 as an active member of the community. It is 
time for me to retire." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels said he plans to spend more time with his wife of 48 years, Ginny, and 
to travel across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Volante, 58, retired from the United States Air Force in 1993. He has since 
participated in community committees and causes, including the Save Our Port 
Hueneme Police Department committee. He was not available for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, Robert E. Turner, president of the Port Hueneme Chamber of 
Commerce, and Jon Sharkey, a music production manager, announced their 
intention to run for City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Daniels' term, those of Ken Hess and Dorill Wright will also 
expire this year. Both council members said they plan to announce this week 
whether they will seek reelection. CHRISTINA LIMA

 An Oxnard policeman has been selected Law Enforcement Officer of the Year by 
the American Legion of California -- the first Ventura County officer to 
receive the award. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very shocking," said Officer Joe Marino, who has patrolled the streets 
of Oxnard for the past 14 years."There are so many officers that deserve 
recognition. I feel very honored to be bestowed with this award." 
</P>
<P>
 Marino, 39, shot and wounded Alan Winterbourne, the frustrated former engineer 
who killed four people and wounded three others during a shooting rampage at an 
Oxnard unemployment office last year. Winterbourne was later killed by Ventura 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I was lucky to get out of there in one piece, but I don't think I did 
anything other officers would not have done," said Marino, who was one of the 
first officers on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino was nominated for the Americal Legion award by Oxnard Police Cmdr. 
Jamie Skeeters. He was previously awarded the Ventura County Peace Officers' 
Medal of Valor. MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; CAR CRASHES INTO MAN'S CONDOMINIUM

 Leland Funk awoke with a jolt from his snooze on the couch when a car crashed 
through his wall early Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I opened the door, there was a car sticking in the house," said Funk, 
still shaken from the impact that rocked his Port Hueneme condominium complex. 
</P>
<P>
 The car hit a spare bedroom, and no one in the building was harmed, Funk said. 
Steven Chavez of Oxnard, who was riding in the car, received cuts on his head 
and face, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme police believe the driver of the older model Chevrolet Camaro 
rounded a corner too quickly, plowed into the condo at the corner of Jill 
Avenue and Bolker Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Police held the car's owner, Greg Tanihara, 31, of Oxnard, Monday morning on 
suspicion of felony hit-and-run, Sgt. Ken Dobbe said. But they later released 
the man without formally charging him and are now investigating the case 
further, Dobbe said. Police believe Tanihara and Chavez were in the car when it 
struck the building shortly after 2 a.m. A bleeding Chavez was found sitting 
half a block away talking to a bystander, according to police reports. 
</P>
<P>
 He was treated at the scene of the accident and then transported to St. John's 
Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "People speed around here a lot," Funk said. "I've always expected a head-on 
collision because people speed and cut the corner. This guy didn't even begin 
to turn." PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SEACLIFF; STATION WAGON SPLIT IN HALF IN ACCIDENT 
</P>

<P>
 A station wagon hit a Ventura Freeway guard rail near Seacliff and was sheared 
in two early Monday morning, leaving a passenger with back injuries and cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Esther Lee, 24, of British Columbia, remained in fair condition at Ventura 
County Medical Center after the accident that police said occurred when the 
driver fell asleep at the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee and Jin Kang, 20, of Riverside were traveling south on the Ventura Freeway 
on a nonstop trip from Seattle, according to California Highway Patrol reports. 
Kang, driving about 65 m.p.h., nodded off at the wheel, and the 1989 Mercury 
Tracer began veering toward the guardrail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kang tried to turn back onto the road, but the car hit the end of the 
guardrail just behind the right front door, police said. That effectively split 
the car into two pieces, which ended up 150 feet apart after the accident. The 
crash occurred shortly after 5 a.m., about half a mile south of Seacliff. 
</P>
<P>
 Kang suffered minor injuries and was not admitted to the hospital. Lee 
suffered a fractured back, as well as lacerations to her face and back. Both 
were wearing seat belts, police said. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; DONORS ASK TO JOIN THEATER COMMISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than a year after appointing seven people to a brand-new theater 
commission, Thousand Oaks council members today will consider altering the 
makeup of the panel to add seats for major donors. 
</P>
<P>
 Convinced that they must give donors more decision-making power to keep the 
money flowing, Civic Arts Plaza fund-raisers will ask the council to set aside 
five seats for donors.Under the proposal, the Alliance for the Arts 
fund-raising cabinet would nominate the donors, and the council would approve 
their appointment to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alliance for the Arts, which now sends a non-voting member to theater 
commission meetings, would also get a formal voice in setting policy for the 
Civic Arts Plaza. So would representatives from the city-appointed Arts 
Commission and the independent Arts Council. 
</P>
<P>
 While some critics have suggested that the restructuring plan amounts to an 
obvious power grab, alliance members say they're simply responding to donors 
who want to steer their investments by overseeing the Civic Arts Plaza budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any way you slice it, it's nine city appointments to six alliance 
appointments, so taxpayers retain control," said Stephen Woodworth, alliance 
chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members have expressed ambivalence about the proposal, which would 
dilute their direct control over the theater commission. STEPHANIE SIMON

 A masked gunman robbed the Thousand Oaks Inn early Monday morning and fled on 
foot, according to sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 1:20 a.m., a man entered the hotel, displayed a gun and demanded 
money, the Ventura County Sheriff's Department said. After receiving the money, 
he left the hotel on West Thousands Oaks Boulevard without harming anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies say they have no suspect in the case and do not know 
whether this crime is related to other recent robberies in the area. Ventura 
County Crime Stoppers are offering up to $1,000 for information leading to the 
arrest of a suspect. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

 Two Moorpark men were arrested Monday on suspicion of burglarizing the Boys & 
Girls Club of Moorpark three times over the past month, Ventura County 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Culminating a monthlong investigation, deputies arrested Juan Gabriel 
Magdeleno, 18, and Francisco Magdeleno, 22, on suspicion of taking more than 
$4,300 worth of computer equipment and donated toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other Moorpark residents, Joseph and Valerie Wittkofski, both 38, were 
arrested July 22 on suspicion of receiving or purchasing stolen goods, deputies 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies are seeking an arrest warrant for a fifth person, William Frank 
Lopez, 42, of Moorpark, who is suspected of acting as a "facilitator" in the 
burglaries and sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said Lopez is "aware he is being sought and apparently hiding."

 The crowded field of potential candidates for three seats on the Thousand Oaks 
City Council continued to grow Monday as the number of residents who have now 
taken out the papers needed to file grew to 16. 
</P>
<P>
 If all 16 residents enter the race, it will be the among the most crowded 
political battles in the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been anticipating this ever since we started receiving inquiries about 
how to run for council a full year before the filing date," said City Clerk 
Nancy Dillon. "It looks like there are going to be a lot of people running." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, nine candidates battled for two open seats. In 1990, nine candidates 
fought for three open spots. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, two incumbents, Elois Zeanah and Judy Lazar, have taken out the papers 
needed to file as a candidate for this year's election. 
</P>
<P>
 The other residents who took out papers are: Community College District 
trustee Greg Cole, retired businessman Marshall Dixon, firefighter Andy Fox, 
real estate broker Michael Friedman, realtor Robert Hughes and retired 
professor Ali Issari. 
</P>
<P>
 Also mechanic Norm Jackson, former Thousand Oaks City Councilman Lee Laxdal, 
Compton homicide Detective Mike Markey, civil engineer David Seagal, community 
activist Ekbal Quidwai, Thousand Oaks Planning Commissioner Irving Wasserman, 
Thousand Oaks resident Bill Williams and mobile carwash owner Lance Winslow. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential candidates have until Aug. 11 to return their filing papers. So 
far, only two candidates, Dixon and Markey, have done so, according to Dillon.

 Assemblyman Nao Takasugi, stressing the importance of small business, will 
walk through Moorpark's Gateway Plaza on Friday to meet some of the companies 
he represents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to understand that whether a business has 100 employees or 
just one, they are essential to California's economy," the Oxnard Republican 
said in a statement."As a small businessman for over 35 years, I understand 
firsthand the needs and concerns of business owners." 
</P>
<P>
 In one of his occasional "business walks" through the 37th district, Takasugi 
has scheduled at least six stops at the center on East Los Angeles Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, he uses contacts he makes on the walks for business advisory boards 
and committees. Local firms, in turn, have an opportunity to discuss the 
problems and changes the state Assembly should address. "We still have a lot of 
work to do in Sacramento for California's businesses," he said. PHYLLIS W.

<P>
 Citing business demands and a desire to spend more time with his family, Simi 
Valley school board member Doug Crosse said he will not seek another term. 
</P>
<P>
 Crosse's announcement last week came just two weeks after the 47-year-old 
businessman told supporters that he planned to launch an aggressive reelection 
campaign emphasizing the need for morals and stricter behavior standards in the 
Simi Valley schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have spent the last two weeks in sincere reflection on my reelection," 
Crosse said in a prepared statement. "Although I am totally confident that I 
can win . . . I must be realistic as to what winning could really mean." 
</P>
<P>
 Crosse said he wants to spend more time with his wife and two daughters, and 
is already strained by the demands of his vending business. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I spread myself too thin, something will be neglected," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seats held by Crosse and board President Carla Kurachi are up for election 
this fall. Kurachi has not said whether she will seek another four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley parents Sharon Hushka and Janice DiFatta have filed official 
papers to qualify for the November ballot. TRACY WILSON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY EXPANDS PAVING WITH RUBBER 
ASPHALT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to road repairs, Thousand Oaks really burns rubber. 
</P>
<P>
 The city sped ahead last week with a program to recycle old tires for use in 
road pavement. 
</P>
<P>
 Since city workers began using the rubber-asphalt blend three years ago, the 
innovative roadwork has helped recycle 350,000 scrap tires and pave more than 
50 miles of streets in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, crediting the program's success, the City Council has agreed to expand 
the program, spending an additional $1.3 million to pave sections of 13 city 
streets in the next 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The money, which comes from state and county transportation grants and from a 
city gasoline tax, will be divided so that 60% is spent on smaller residential 
streets and 40% goes to major arterial roads. Although the rubber asphalt costs 
somewhat more -- $47 per ton, as opposed to $30 per ton for normal asphalt -- 
city officials said it would pay off in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 The paving is expected to last 20 to 25 years compared with 10 to 15 years for 
regular pavement, said Joe Bravo, the city's street supervisor. "And," Bravo 
said, "people are telling us the streets are much quieter. The rubber seems to 
have a deadening effect."  
</P>
<P>
 Adding the rubber to the road requires workers to pulverize the tires into 
tiny pellets and mix them to a hot liquid with crushed stones. The resulting 
blend, which is about 25% rubber and 75% asphalt, is applied just like regular 
asphalt. If the program continues on schedule, Bravo said about 80,000 scrap 
tires will be turned into pavement this year. MATTHEW MOSK

4 FINALISTS SPENT $165,000 TO REACH RUNOFFS; COUNTY: FINANCE REPORTS SHOW TWO 
CANDIDATES FOR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS CONTRIBUTED NEARLY $28,000 TO THEIR OWN 
CAMPAIGNS. 
</P>

<P>
 Four finalists for two seats on the Ventura County Board of Supervisors 
together spent more than $165,000 to qualify for a November runoff, with two of 
the candidates each contributing nearly $28,000 to their own campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 In another key primary race, Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White spent 
more than any other local candidate -- $72,922 -- to defeat defense attorney 
James M. Farley for a seat on the Superior Court, according to campaign finance 
reports filed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports cover the period through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 2nd Supervisorial District, Thousand Oaks City Councilman Frank Schillo 
raised $56,456, and spent $48,548, to secure a runoff position against attorney 
Trudi K. Loh of Thousand Oaks. She spent even more -- nearly $65,000 after 
raising about $61,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are competing for the seat of retiring Supervisor Maria E. VanderKolk. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Schillo and Loh relied heavily on their own money to beat out three other 
candidates in the June 7 primary. Schillo loaned his campaign $27,281, and Loh 
underwrote hers with $27,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Loh, who opposes building a garbage dump in Weldon Canyon near Ojai, received 
nearly $2,500 in contributions from Ojai-area residents, including $500 from 
actor Larry Hagman and $750 each from William and Louise Paxton. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Schillo's largest contributors were Amgen, Inc., which gave $500, and 
the California Real Estate PAC and Pruner Health Services, which each gave 
$750. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Loh and Schillo blamed the economy and the Jan. 17 earthquake for making 
it especially difficult to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to ask people for money when they're out of work," Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two candidates said they expect it to be even more difficult to raise 
money for the November general election, because individual contributions will 
be limited to $250, rather than the $750 allowed in the primary. County laws 
allow individuals to contribute only $1,000 in each four-year election cycle.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While she hopes she will not have to loan her campaign any more money, Loh 
said she is prepared to do just that. "If that's what my opponent continues to 
do, then that's what I'll continue to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 4th Supervisorial District, Simi Valley Councilwoman Judy Mikels raised 
$26,118 and spent $27,345 to qualify for a runoff. Her opponent, Moorpark City 
Councilman Scott Montgomery, raised $16,000 and spent $26,000. Both are 
competing for the seat being vacated by retiring Supervisor Vicky Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates received numerous contributions from developers. The H.F. 
Ahmanson Co., whose controversial 3,050-home Simi Hills project was approved in 
1992 but has not been built, contributed $300 to Mikels and $500 to Montgomery. 
Each also received a $500 contribution from the Building Industry Assn. of 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikels and Montgomery were attending meetings Monday and could not be reached 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In the judge's race, White, who received the endorsement and financial backing 
of Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury, raised a total of $77,866 and spent $72,992 
to gain a nearly 2-to-1 win over her opponent Farley. 
</P>
<P>
 He raised $56,783 and spent $53,783. Of that, $20,600 was in loans to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of Farley's largest contributions came from labor unions, which gave a 
total of $1,750. White got nearly as much from firefighter and peace officer 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 White also received a $2,500 loan from Bradbury's campaign fund, a $2,000 loan 
from her sister, Phyllis J. Miller, and a $1,000 contribution from Ojai rancher 
Donald S. Colvin. 
</P>
<P>
 In other races, appointed Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon raised $30,375 
and spent $31,139 to qualify for a November runoff against Oxnard accountant 
Richard Morrisset, who raised less than $1,000. The two emerged from a field of 
five candidates, with Morrisset edging out Ventura accountant Scott Weiss by 
one vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrisset said he is confident he can raise $15,000 to $20,000 for the general 
election. "That's how much I think we'll need to run a credible campaign," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent County Clerk Richard Dean raised $20,407 and spent $17,994 to beat 
out challenger Daniel J. Schmidt. Dean spent $12,443 of his own money, while 
Schmidt loaned his campaign more than $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any regrets," Schmidt said. "I was running against a three-term 
incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
 And in the race for county tax assessor, acting Assessor Glenn E. Gray raised 
$15,819 and spent $15,689 to defeat Ventura Councilman Jack Tingstrom, whose 
campaign finance report was not available.

TRAFFIC SCHOOL WILL LOSE EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS; COURT: VIOLATORS WILL NOW BE ALLOWED 
TO ATTEND CLASSES AT PLACES OTHER THAN TRI-COUNTY. 
</P>

<P>
 Speeders and others who violate traffic laws in Ventura County will now be 
able to attend any licensed traffic school they please, court officials 
announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, drivers who opt to attend traffic school are sent by Ventura County 
Municipal Court to Thousand Oaks-based Tri-County Traffic School. 
</P>
<P>
 But a recent discovery that Tri-County profits are not going to traffic-safety 
programs as promised has made judges have second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, Tri-County's board of directors persuaded the court to 
give the facility all the county's traffic-school business, court officials 
said, by touting the school's educational programs and saying that the school 
would turn over most of its profits to traffic-safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even in 1986, when state law mandated each Municipal Court to open traffic 
classes to all licensed schools, Ventura County kept its agreement with 
Tri-County, in part because of the school's promise to donate its profits, said 
Municipal Court Presiding Judge John R. Smiley. 
</P>
<P>
 But during an evaluation of Tri-County's financial records in May, judges 
discovered that the school's board of directors was apparently keeping most of 
the profits, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came to our attention that Tri-County was not paying as much as they have 
over the years to traffic safety programs," Smiley said.  
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the judges have decided to allow other traffic schools in the 
county to compete for the court's business, he said. The only stipulation is 
that the school must be licensed by the Department of Motor Vehicles, Smiley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of Tri-County's five board members could be reached for comment late 
Monday afternoon. A manager at one of Tri-County's competitors said the judges' 
decision might lower the price of traffic schools in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tri-County charges $36 for the required eight-hour course. Some other traffic 
schools, such as A-1 The Saturday Class, charge less. Linda Gregory, an A-1 
manager, said the price at her school is $28 for an eight-hour course. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a great thing," Gregory said. "It will allow the students to go to 
any school they choose. Financially, it will allow them to save money because 
we are a little bit cheaper." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, she said, A-1 can barely find enough students to fill one class in 
Ventura County, but she hopes that will change with the decision announced 
Monday.

COCHRAN STREET PROJECT HAS TAKEN STEP TOWARD REALITY; SIMI VALLEY: FOURTEEN OF 
15 PROPERTY OWNERS HAVE AGREED ON A FUNDING PLAN THAT HAS BEEN EIGHT YEARS IN 
MAKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An eight-year effort to link segments of Cochran Street in Simi Valley and 
pave the way for 40 acres of commercial development moved closer to reality 
Monday as all but one of the 15 property owners agreed on a funding plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the city would foot the $4-million estimated cost of 
building the road. As developers purchase the land, property owners would 
reimburse the city for 40% of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is expected to spur development and provide jobs and sales tax 
revenue. But plans for the road extension have stalled repeatedly over the 
years as the city and property owners struggled to devise a payment agreement. 
A city-run committee wrote more than a dozen drafts before the current 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working for a long time to get an agreement everybody could live 
with," said Councilwoman Judy Mikels, who serves on the committee. "In all this 
time, this is the closest we've come, and I am really, really hopeful that this 
is finally going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Still hoping to persuade the last landowner to sign the agreement, the city 
has declined to identify the holdout because they fear it could jeopardize the 
effort. The city could condemn the holdout's property to construct the road, 
but officials were taking a conciliatory tone Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at a sensitive point in the negotiations right now," Deputy City 
Manager Jim Hansen said. "We don't want to alienate anybody, because we'd 
really like to get this agreement finalized and get this road built." 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran, one of the main east-west arteries through Simi Valley, currently 
ends just west of 1st Street and resumes again at Madera Road. In between are 
40 acres of dusty, hilly, undeveloped land, hemmed in on the east and west by 
paved roads, landscaped lawns and business parks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bordered on the north by the Simi Valley Freeway and on the south by railroad 
tracks, the property is considered prime commercial-industrial real estate. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Simi Valley's General Plan, the land is zoned for industrial and 
office use, along with certain commercial uses such as auto dealers and large 
retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hilly terrain and the large number of landowners has made development 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many cases, you'd just build a piece of a road at a time, as developers 
came in who wanted to build," said Bill Golubics, traffic engineer. "But in 
this case you're looking at some pretty major grading, so you really need to 
get the whole thing done at once." 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, Louis and Cynthia Pandolfi bought a one-acre plot on the 
property just east of Madera, hoping eventually to sell it to a developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a little reluctant because we'd heard that the other property owners 
couldn't agree on terms to get a road through," Cynthia Pandolfi said Monday. 
"Now we're relieved to see that we're so close to making it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the final landowner is persuaded to accept the agreement, it will be sent 
to the City Council for consideration. If approved by the council, the project 
would begin within eight months of the date all the landowners sign off on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Russell Takasugi, who represents a landowner with another small chunk 
of the property, said he is heartened by the progress on the agreement but will 
remain cautious until it is finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "They literally marched the football down the field from the opposition's 
20-yard line and are now at the one-yard line," he said. "But until they get 
the ball over the goal and score, they could still fumble."

CONSULTANT TO APPRAISE SCHOOL DISTRICT LAND; SIMI VALLEY: WOOD RANCH PROPERTY 
WAS ACQUIRED WHEN AGREEMENT TO BUILD CAMPUS ON IT WAS NOT MET. ISSUE IS WHETHER 
TO DEVELOP OR SELL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Uncertain as to the most lucrative use of 1,800 acres in Wood Ranch, Simi 
Valley school officials have hired a private consultant to appraise the land 
and recommend development strategies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District acquired the vast hillside property in 
January after the developer failed to meet an agreement to construct an 
elementary school in the 3,000-acre Wood Ranch community. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a committee of residents and public officials recommended selling the 
land outright for $12 million earlier this year, the school board has decided 
to investigate whether it could make more money by developing the Long Canyon 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have become realtors in a sense, and none of us knows what the best way to 
handle this is," school board member Judy Barry said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The district decided to pay VTN West Inc. about $40,000 to evaluate the 
property. Barry said the company should have its study completed in eight to 12 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to be studying the whole Long Canyon area and directing us as 
to what would be the best use of the property in terms of developing it or 
selling it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley residents who have been closely involved with the school 
district's Wood Ranch negotiations praised the school board for hiring a 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The board "wants to get the highest price for it," said Don Otto, who serves 
on the district's surplus property committee. "What everybody would like to see 
is that the school district is utilizing its assets in the best way." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials need about $6 million from at least a partial sale of the 
land to pay for construction of the long-awaited 500-student elementary school 
at Wood Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the developer's failure to build the facility, students living 
in Wood Ranch have had to attend nearby Madera School, which is almost at 
capacity with 700 students, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated by the crowding at Madera, Wood Ranch parents have urged the board 
to swiftly find an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all bought into Wood Ranch on the promise that there would be an 
elementary school," resident Ron Robinson said. "You have a bunch of people who 
in a real sense have paid for a school." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson's wife, Marybeth Jacobsen, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people who are unhappy," she said. "But it does sound to 
me that the district is making a sincere effort to get the school built." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent school board retreat, board members requested that district 
officials study the feasibility of installing portable classrooms until the 
Wood Ranch School can be constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had hoped to use five existing buildings on a piece of their Wood 
Ranch land as a temporary elementary school for about 120 students. But to 
convert the cottages into classrooms would cost nearly $500,000, school 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board really felt that was more than we wanted to sink into a temporary 
facility," Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said portable classrooms would be fine, as long as the district is 
actively working toward building a permanent school site. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the kids could be safe, then I think it's a great idea," he said. 
"The most important thing is to get the permanent school there in a timely and 
rational manner."

CANADA, U.S. OK LIMITS FOR WHEAT IMPORTS; COMMERCE: THE 'UNDERSTANDING' AVERTS 
A TRADE WAR AND CURBS IMPORTS TO 1.45 MILLION METRIC TONS FOR ONE YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and Canada -- the world's biggest trading partners -- 
averted a trade war Monday by agreeing to limit imports of Canadian wheat into 
America for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 The "preliminary understanding" was reached at the last minute as Washington 
was set to begin considering sanctions against Ottawa. Both governments must 
formally confirm the pact today. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement would limit the overall imports of Canadian wheat to 1.45 
million metric tons -- down sharply from the record 2.5 million tons shipped to 
U.S. buyers during the 1993-94 marketing year -- before steep tariffs are 
imposed, the North Dakota Wheat Commission said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration refused to divulge trigger levels in the package. 
It said it wanted to give the Canadian Cabinet a chance to review the package. 
But sources close to the dispute confirmed the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will result in a substantial reduction in wheat imports compared to last 
year," a statement from U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute arose as Canadian wheat imports soared into the United States over 
the past year as a result of a meager U.S. crop and what the United States 
charged were unfair Canadian wheat subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarrel had been simmering for months and threatened to explode into an 
all-out tit-for-tat trade war and disrupt the huge $210 billion worth of trade 
flow between the two neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington had set the Monday deadline for an agreement, and U.S. negotiators 
were set to recommend to the White House whether to take action against 
Canadian wheat imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada had threatened to retaliate if any sanctions were imposed, hitting 
everything from wine to chicken to bourbon and baked goods. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a key part of the pact, both countries agreed to a "peace clause" for 
the next 12 months and promised there would be no additional restrictions or 
countermeasures by either side. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides also agreed to set up a Joint Commission on Grains to examine all 
aspects of each countries' marketing and support systems during that time. 
Kantor said Washington is particularly concerned by the Canadian Wheat Board's 
pricing practices and Canadian subsidy programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this is a satisfactory arrangement for all concerned," said 
Kantor. 
</P>
<P>
 While farm producer groups and wheat-state lawmakers were positive about the 
agreement, other sectors of the food industry were not happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the Canadian wheat that has been surging into the country, more than 
800,000 tons has been durum wheat -- the kind of wheat used to make pasta. As 
recently as the late 1980s, the United States purchased virtually no Canadian 
durum. 
</P>
<P>
 The pasta industry and wheat millers have urged the Administration not to take 
action against Canadian wheat, warning that it could raise food prices and 
damage the $2 billion U.S. pasta industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are disappointed, incensed, angry. We don't like it at all," said Jula 
Kinnaird, president of the National Pasta Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any restrictions at all are a bad deal for the industry. It will mean job 
losses and higher prices to the consumer," said Kinnaird. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinnaird said the association will now demand that the United States stop 
providing export subsidies for durum wheat while the import restrictions are in 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, duties on durum imports above 300,000 tons would be $24 
per metric ton on imports up to 450,000 tons. They would jump to $50 per ton on 
imports that exceed 450,000 tons. 
</P>
<P>
 A $50 per ton duty equals $1.36 per bushel, which translates into more than a 
30% tax on durum, which on Monday was selling for $4 per bushel in northern 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if this was a victory for the United States, Kantor said, "There 
are only winners in trade, there are no losers."

 2 North Carolina Banks to Merge: The $2.2-billion stock deal between BB&T 
Financial Corp. and Southern National Corp., two of the state's best-known 
banks, would create the sixth-largest banking company in the Southeast. About 
1,000 jobs, or 10% of the combined work forces, would be cut and 70 branches

<P>
 Blue chip stocks posted large gains for the second session in a row Monday, 
propelled by more good news about the economy and strength in some economically 
sensitive shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 33.67 points, exactly the same number as 
Friday, to end at 3,798.17. In the broader market, advancing issues beat 
declines 1,416 to 771. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the market was buoyed by good earnings reports and news from the 
National Assn. of Purchasing Management that factory output was increasing more 
than expected. The group also reported a decline in its price index. 
</P>
<P>
 Markets shrugged off news from the Commerce Department that Americans' 
personal income rose a scant 0.1% in June, failing to keep up with a 0.4% 
spending rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very good market on Friday, and it just wasn't ready to cool off 
yet," said George Pirrone, senior trader at Dreyfus Corp. "There's still a 
decent amount of short-covering plus some real buying." 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury bond yields were either unchanged or slightly lower, following a 
decline in the dollar amid U.S.-Japan trade tensions. The Treasury's main 
30-year bond was unchanged at 7.39%. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said a rally in interest-rate-sensitive utility stocks fueled 
sentiment that the Federal Reserve would not raise rates as had been expected 
at this month's meeting of its policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones utility index closed 3.49 points higher at 189.89. 
</P>
<P>
 "The utility stocks are strong again," Pirrone said. "They've been strong over 
the whole past week. The theme is rates are not going to have to be pushed 
higher." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Monday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Crude oil rose to 17-month highs after Nigerian oil unions backed out of 
talks designed to settle a 4-week-old strike that disrupted the country's 
exports. The unions declined to take part in negotiations scheduled for Monday 
with Nigeria's military government and said its members would stay off the job 
until jailed pro-democracy leader Moshood K.O. Abiola, apparent winner of the 
annulled June, 1993, presidential elections, is released. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigerian production, which accounts for 3% of the world's oil, has fallen by 
more than 300,000 barrels a day since the strike began last month, and 
production is nearing a standstill. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, light 
sweet crude for September delivery rose as high as $20.98 a barrel, the highest 
since March 5, 1993. The contract settled at $20.55 a barrel, up 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States imports 700,000 to 800,000 barrels of Nigerian crude daily. 
Along with the Nigerian labor unrest, recent refinery outages in Britain, 
Norway and Russia have caused supply concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar ended modestly lower, recovering partly from a selloff overseas 
after the Clinton Administration reassured the market that it would not 
advocate a lower currency to cut America's trade deficit. The dollar's fall in 
Asia followed the breakdown of talks between Washington and Tokyo on Japan's 
government procurement contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold prices ended slightly higher. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold 
for current delivery rose 20 cents to settle at $383.20 per troy ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although stocks generally rose, the volume leaders on the New York Stock 
Exchange and on the Nasdaq were two of the day's biggest losers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter-Wallace headed the Big Board's list of active issues, tumbling 4 7/8 to 
10 3/4 after the company said it sent letters to 240,000 physicians advising 
that they immediately take their patients off its Felbatol epilepsy treatment 
because of recent cases of adverse reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbridge Networks plunged 13 5/16 to 28 5/8 on Nasdaq after the technology 
company disclosed that its first-quarter earnings will fall short of 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Steel stocks rallied on talk that Chrysler Corp. reached supply contract 
agreements with major steel producers that include price increases of 7% to 
10%. USX-U.S. Steel Group gained 1 7/8 to 39 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Tokyo, stocks ended lower after a day of thin trading, with turnover its 
lowest since May 9. Investors worried by prospects of a higher yen were 
reluctant to buy. The Nikkei average ended down 178.04 points or 0.87% at 
20,271.35. Hong Kong share prices closed sharply higher, but late profit-taking 
pushed them off their peak. The Hang Seng Index ended up 200.87 points, or 
2.12%, at 9,683.68. 
</P>
<P>
 * European markets were quiet, and Swiss markets were closed for a holiday. 
London share prices ended firmer, helped by relief over British authorities' 
leaving interest rates unchanged after concerns about base rates surfaced on 
Friday after a 0.75 percentage point rise in the accepted rate on the U.K. 
Treasury bill tender. The FTSE 100 ended 14.8 points up at 3,097.4. German 
shares closed a lackluster bourse session firmer, with activity dominated by 
U.S. interest in Volkswagen. The DAX index ended at 2,153.79, up 0.33% or 7.15 
points on the day. DAILY DIARY: Aug. 1, 1994
