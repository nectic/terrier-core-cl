CLINTON CAMPAIGN PAID TO SETTLE HARASSMENT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former White House aide David Watkins was the subject of a sexual-harassment 
complaint that the Clinton presidential campaign paid $37,500 to settle, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement was noted in a Federal Election Commission audit of Clinton's 
1992 presidential campaign; auditors scrutinized a $37,500 payment to an 
unidentified worker to settle an employment dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins, former assistant to the President for management and administration, 
was forced to resign earlier this year after using a presidential helicopter 
for a golf outing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyn Utrecht, a lawyer for Clinton's campaign, said the payment went into an 
escrow account to settle an "employment-related matter." She declined further 
comment, saying both parties were bound by a confidentiality agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ty Cobb, an attorney for Watkins, did not return two telephone calls seeking 
comment. But the Wall Street Journal reported that Cobb said Watkins is 
"precluded from commenting on it because of the manner in which it was 
resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials, who spoke on condition that they not be identified, 
confirmed that Watkins, who was chief of administration for the campaign, was 
accused of sexual harassment by a female accountant who worked for the 
campaign, and that the case was resolved with a financial settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no finding of wrongdoing or violation," Utrecht said. "But there 
was a confidentiality agreement among both parties." 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins, who now works for Callaway Golf Co. in Carlsbad, Calif., did not 
return a phone call placed to his office there Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins was forced out of the White House after an incident in which he was 
photographed using a presidential helicopter to fly to a Maryland golf outing 
last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The harassment incident became an issue in the audit because FEC officials 
concluded that the expenditure was largely undocumented -- and thus, subject to 
possible refund. It was noted in campaign records as a payment to "Kathlyn 
Graves, Escrow Agent." Auditors were informed that the payment was made to a 
former employee for consulting services, and that the matter was confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 In completing the audit Thursday, the FEC deadlocked -- and thus rejected -- a 
recommendation that the Clinton campaign repay $3.44 million in federal 
campaign funds to which FEC auditors concluded it was not entitled. The 
repayment figure was expected to be between $1 million and $2 million.

HARRY TOBIAS, 99; POPULAR SONGWRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Tobias, senior member of the songwriting Tobias brothers and a composer 
whose early tunes included the evergreen "Sweet and Lovely," has died. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, 
which Tobias joined in 1922, said Tobias was 99 when he died Thursday in St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 With brothers Charles and Henry among his collaborators, Harry Tobias 
published his first song when he was 16 and working in a department store in 
Worcester, Mass. It was called "National Sports," and he wrote it on the back 
of a packing box. "It was an homage to Ty Cobb and other sports legends," he 
told The Times in a 1989 interview, shortly before he moved from Sherman Oaks 
to Missouri to be with his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 His dozens of other lyrics and songs over the next 70 years included "Miss 
You," "Go to Sleepy Little Baby," "I'll Keep the Lovelight Burning," "Daughter 
of Peggy O'Neill," "Sail Along Silv'ry Moon," "It's a Lonesome Old Town" and 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been recorded by singers ranging from Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby 
to Ella Fitzgerald and Phoebe Snow. Collectively they form an album of American 
song and a lexicon of pop music. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudy Vallee gave Tobias his biggest recorded hit in 1929 in collaboration with 
Henry and Charles. It was "Miss You" with this plaintive chorus: "Miss you, 
since you went away Dear. Miss you, more than I can say Dear. . . ."  
</P>
<P>
 But it fell to Crosby to bring Tobias his greatest overall success. The 
crooner was already singing "Sweet and Lovely" with Paul Whiteman's Rhythm 
Boys, and it was an easy step up to Tobias' newest tune "At Your Command." The 
song proved a hit for Crosby shortly after he first went on the nation's 
airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweet simplicity of Tobias' music suited Crosby's warbling style, and the 
two maintained a professional relationship well into the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Harry Tobias became the second in the Royal Family of Tin Pan Alley, 
as the brothers called themselves, to be welcomed into the Songwriters Hall of 
Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother Charlie made it in 1972 or '73," Tobias said on the eve of the 
honor. "I think we're only the second family ever to have two in the Hall of 
Fame. The first were the Gershwins (George and Ira.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Tobias -- who had written about 1,000 songs -- said he had achieved 
professional longevity by writing "words that are easy to remember and melodies 
that are hard to forget." 
</P>
<P>
 And his favorite songs? "The ones that made the most money," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 He will be buried Tuesday at 2 p.m. at Mt. Sinai Memorial Park.

AIRLINE SAYS DOOMED PLANE WASN'T REPAIRED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 American Eagle was wrong when it said the left engine of a plane that crashed 
had been repaired hours earlier, the company said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Eagle plane with an engine that would not start Tuesday was in 
Nashville, Tenn., airline spokesman Tim Kincaid said.It was not the plane that 
crashed Tuesday night on approach to Raleigh-Durham International Airport, 
killing 15 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The mistake was made because of nearly identical identification numbers 
between the two Jetstream aircraft, Kincaid said. 
</P>
<P>
 The identification number on the plane that crashed was N918AE; the plane that 
had its engine repaired was N919AE. 
</P>
<P>
 American Eagle, through spokesman Marty Heires, told reporters Thursday night 
that the left engine of the doomed plane had been repaired for a flight from 
Raleigh to Greensboro, N.C., just before Flight 3379 made the return trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Hall, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, announced the 
mistake at a briefing Friday.

AU PAIR AGENCIES, HOSTS BLAST REGULATION PLAN; FAMILIES: NEW GUIDELINES SOUGHT 
BY U.S. INFORMATION AGENCY WOULD REQUIRE INCREASED BENEFITS AND SET NEW AGE AND 
OTHER QUALIFICATIONS. CRITICS CALL THEM WELL-MEANING BUT TOO RESTRICTIVE. 
</P>

 Orange County agencies that provide "au pairs" -- young women and men from 
abroad who care for American children -- say proposed government regulations 
could devastate their programs by imposing tough age and training requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many of the agencies support regulation, the requirements proposed 
this week by the United States Information Agency, which oversees the program, 
are restrictive, costly and intrude on the choices families can make regarding 
their au pairs, said representatives of several au pair agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the USIA published regulations that, if put into effect, would 
require that au pairs be paid an allowance of $155 a week -- a 55% increase -- 
receive two weeks of paid vacation and work no more than 45 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, au pairs would not be allowed to work in families with children 
under the age of 2 unless they are 21 years old or older and can show 
documented child-care experience. The regulations are scheduled to go into 
effect on Feb. 15 and would apply to au pairs hired after that. A 30-day public 
comment period began last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they are trying to do is make it into a stringent child-care program," 
said Bill Gustafson, director of eurAuPair, part of the nonprofit American 
Scandinavian Student Exchange in Laguna Beach. "It is well-meaning, but there 
aren't that many 21-year-old au pairs that are professionals in child care, and 
at best they've worked after school at child-care centers." The regulations 
proposed by USIA were formulated to redefine the program's emphasis and to 
respond to recent problems arising from inadequate screening, training and 
supervision of the au pairs, said Jim Morgan, spokesman for the USIA. 
</P>
<P>
 "For USIA, this was always meant to be a cultural exchange program with a 
child-care component," Morgan said. "But over the years, because of the 
popularity of the child care, it flip-flopped and became more of a work 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in regulating the program began more than a year ago, however, 
predating the recent problems with the program, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, a Dutch au pair was charged with involuntary manslaughter in the 
shaking death of an 8-week-old boy she was caring for in Fairfax, Va. Anna 
Peeze, 19, was sponsored by eurAuPair in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Another au pair left letters threatening to kill her young charges, and one 
accidentally burned a 1-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 But some Orange County families hosting au pairs argue that these problems are 
the exception, not the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government should re-evaluate the program and interview us," said Lauren 
Jackson, 38, a full-time sales representative in San Clemente with two 
children, who are supervised by an au pair. "Let's find facts first before you 
think the system is broken because of a few horror stories." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson believes the vast majority of au pairs who come to the United States 
do so with excellent intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 "My au pairs have loved and taken care of my children," said Jackson, who is 
currently with her sixth au pair. "They travel with us, vacation with us, go to 
weddings and even funerals with us. They are integral parts of our family. 
</P>
<P>
 Au pairs are recruited from Western European countries, and must be between 18 
and 26 years old, according to current federal guidelines. They must be 
secondary school graduates and proficient in English. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which began in 1986 as a two-year experiment, has recruited about 
40,000 women and men since then. The eight recruitment agencies are all 
nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustafson said the new regulations would spell the demise of the Laguna Beach 
agency because so few 21-year-old au pairs are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, 63% of his agency's au pairs are between 18 and 20 years of age, 
while only 37% are 21 or older. 
</P>
<P>
 Families often request an au pair younger than 21 to avoid problems with 
alcohol consumption, said Margaret Dent, director of Au Pair Program USA, in 
Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 "This magic number of 21 is completely arbitrary, and it doesn't do a thing to 
protect the children," Dent said. "It should be left to the family to choose 
which au pair best fits their needs." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 60% of eurAuPair's families have children under 2 years old. The 
agency is currently sponsoring 12 au pairs with Orange County families and 100 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned parents have been calling their agencies nonstop since the 
regulations were announced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been flooded with phone calls from families upset with the 
regulations the past couple of days," said Laura Blaskett, program director and 
vice president of EF Au Pair in Cambridge, Mass. "I think families want the 
choice to choose the age of the au pair and not be regulated by the 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 But advocates for children say the new rules would help protect youngsters 
placed in the care of au pairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Regulations will weed out folks who may use the the au pair program as just a 
cultural exchange or a ticket to the United State with housing," said Sharon 
Reuss, communications director at New York City's Child Care Action Campaign, a 
national nonprofit organization working to improve child care. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is important they understand they are undertaking a job to take care of 
children placed in their care, that they are not just here to get the car keys 
and hit the bars." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the main concern agencies is the possibility the new regulations will 
exclude middle-class parents and limit the au pair program to the wealthy who 
can afford the added costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who cannot afford an au pair may turn to illegal markets in Europe and 
Latin America. Often those "nannies" do not have legal visas, and there is no 
recourse in the event of exploitation, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaskett said her agency supports regulation, especially the required child 
care training, but opposes increasing families' costs. In addition to paying au 
pairs a larger weekly allowance, families would be required to contribute $500 
toward each worker's post-secondary studies. They currently contribute $300. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new rules, the au pairs would receive 16 hours of child-safety 
training before arriving in the United States and 24 hours of instruction in 
child care and development upon arriving. 
</P>
<P>
 The agencies would provide the training, but they say the cost will be added 
to the fee families now pay upfront, which averages $3,500 for air fare, 
insurance, orientation and screening fees.

A NEW SENSE OF WINTER'S WONDERS; VISUALLY IMPAIRED CHILDREN GET RIDE OF A 
LIFETIME AT KNOTT'S BEAGLE HILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A few wondered aloud if the snow was real. Others touched the ice-cold flecks 
for the first time as they waited for their turn and talked nervously about the 
ride to come. 
</P>
<P>
 But none of the visually impaired children rejected the chance to slide down 
the human-created mountain of snow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like flying. The wind was blowing on me," said partially sighted 
Michael, huffing his way for the umpteenth time to the top of the slope at 
Knott's Berry Farm's 10th Winter Wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, the amusement park invites a group of Orange County children to 
preview Beagle Hill, their snow-sledding ride, before opening it to the public 
the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the Southern California Blind Children's Learning Center was 
invited, along with a dozen home-school children, to sample the sled ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The ride consists of a slope piled with 45 tons of snow, four runs and dozens 
of plastic sleds. The attraction, which opens today, will provide slipping and 
sliding through school winter vacations, until Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I imagine it's a whole different dimension when you can't see," Knott's 
spokesman Bob Ochsner said. "You have to have a lot of faith that they'll catch 
you at the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Two ride operators sent the kids whooshing down the slope while another two 
caught them at the end of their short journey. 
</P>
<P>
 The children and the center's teachers arrived early Friday morning just as a 
crew clad in bright-red sweat shirts finished grooming the runs. 
</P>
<P>
 The snow had been delivered about 6 a.m. by Orange County Ice which crushed 
blocks of ice in a chipper machine and then blew the snow onto the slope. About 
12 tons are added daily, depending on how much melts. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the kids had never been in snow, much less had the chance to sled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going so fast and I just slid down," 3-year-old Danielle said as she 
listened to Christmas songs over the speakers. "I don't want to go down again 
though -- it's somebody else's turn, and I'm dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 But 3-year-old Michael slid down the slope at least a dozen times, screaming 
with delight each time he went down the eight-second ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he fell going up the steps to the slope, other times he dropped his 
red, tub-shaped sled. Yet, despite the obstacles, Michael always made it back 
to the top. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the kid every other time," said Kevin Norris, supervisor of ride 
operations. "I think he went down more than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who didn't want another turn on the slope were content to throw snow on 
their teachers and attempt to build snowmen. Almost every child described the 
snow with the same word: cold. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids can tell which teacher is which by voice or smell, so with the snow 
it's entirely by touch," teacher Elayne Strong said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know that snow is white even though they don't understand the concept, 
and they don't know what it looks like, but the next time they hear the word 
snow they will think, 'cold and wet.' "

GIRL, 15, HIT AND KILLED ON WAY TO SCHOOL; ACCIDENT: THE VAN DRIVER WHO STRUCK 
HER APPARENTLY FAILED TO SEE THE HUNTINGTON BEACH HIGH STUDENT, WHO HAD RUN 
INTO TRAFFIC TO CATCH A SECOND BUS. 
</P>

<P>
 A 15-year-old high school student was struck and killed Friday as she ran into 
traffic to catch a bus, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Louise White of Los Alamitos was on her way to Huntington Beach High 
School at 6:54 a.m. when she was hit, Sheriff's Lt. Jay Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 White had gotten off a bus at the southeast corner of Beach Boulevard and 
Katella Avenue and was trying to cross Beach against a red light to reach the 
southwest corner to catch a second bus, Mendez said. 
</P>
<P>
 As she crossed, witnesses told police, she tried to wave traffic to slow down. 
Several cars did slow down, but a van driver apparently did not see her. The 
van knocked her about 200 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 She was pronounced dead at the hospital. The van driver was not cited or 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 At Huntington Beach High School, where classes begin at 8:34 a.m., officials 
said they decided against announcing the death of White, a sophomore. Friday 
was the last day before the school's holiday break. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are surmising they will not be learning about it until they have left 
school," said Mary Scott, assistant principal. "We leave it up to the family to 
make the announcement. . . . We want to respect the family's wishes." 
</P>
<P>
 Scott said that school psychologists would be available after the break to 
counsel any students upset about White's death. In such cases, she said, staff 
and teachers are careful to watch for students who appear distraught. 
</P>
<P>
 Because White did not live in the Huntington Beach school district, she would 
have needed a permit to attend the high school, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 White's death was the most recent in a series of traffic accidents that have 
killed or injured at least seven Orange County students on the way to or from 
school this year: 
</P>
<P>
 * On Jan. 11, Marcia White, 11, escaped serious injury while riding home from 
school on her bicycle. She was thrown onto the hood of a car slowing for a stop 
sign and her helmet shattered the car's windshield. 
</P>
<P>
 * On April 22, Thomas E. Lanni, 7, was fatally injured by a pickup truck in 
Laguna Niguel after getting off a school bus. 
</P>
<P>
 * On May 11, 12-year-old Josepha and 11-year-old Roberta Miranda were injured 
in Santa Ana when a car lost control and swerved onto the sidewalk while the 
sisters were waiting to cross the street on their way to school. 
</P>
<P>
 * On July 26, Christopher Schneider, 12, was killed in Seal Beach when a car 
swerved and jumped the curb where he was waiting to cross the street to his 
elementary school.

LAGUNA FIRE CONFESSOR GUILTY OF FULLERTON ARSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a surprise end to a bizarre case, a man who once confessed to setting the 
1993 Laguna Beach fire was sentenced to eight years in prison after 
unexpectedly pleading guilty to setting three small fires in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Saille Higuera, also known as Jose Soto Martinez, was in the middle a 
preliminary hearing Thursday to determine if he should stand trial on arson 
charges when he decided during the lunch break to plead guilty. Municipal Court 
Judge James O. Perez immediately sentenced the 26-year-old man to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Fell said he pushed for a maximum prison term of 
more than 19 years, but is satisfied that the judge's sentence sends the 
message that "arsonists will not be tolerated in our society." 
</P>
<P>
 Higuera, carrying a disposable lighter and a hunting knife, was nabbed by 
witnesses in September after authorities say he set three small fires in one 
day. One ignited a six-foot wooden fence that separates the Hillcrest Glen 
Apartments from the offices of the North Orange County Community College 
District. Another was set in the laundry room trash bin of the 42-unit 
apartment complex, while a third was started in bushes near the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 During questioning after the arrest, Higuera, who identified himself as Jose 
Soto Martinez, told investigators he was also responsible for other "big 
fires," including the October, 1993, firestorm that destroyed or damaged more 
than 400 homes and structures in Laguna Beach and the surrounding area. He also 
led investigators to the fire's point of origin off Laguna Canyon Road and 
appeared to tell them exactly how it started. 
</P>
<P>
 But days after charging Higuera with the Laguna Beach arson, the district 
attorney's office withdrew the charge after learning his confession was bogus 
and that he had been in a Mexican jail during the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the defendant has since told them he guessed about the 
fire's location and how it started. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, prosecution continued in the Fullerton blazes. Fell had already put 
two witnesses on the stand Thursday, including one who helped capture Higuera, 
when the defendant made his surprise plea following the lunch recess. No one 
was injured in the Fullerton fires, which caused less than $1,000 in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Higuera's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Frank Ospino, could not be reached 
for comment Friday.

STILL-LIFE MASTERPIECE; MEMBERS OF CAMARILLO CHURCH POSE TO RE-CREATE FAMED 
NATIVITY PAINTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The painting is perhaps the single canvas that secured a place in art history 
for a little-known Dutch painter. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Gerrit van Honthorst enjoyed the patronage of powerful Italian noblemen 
and studied under the master painter Caravaggio, it was the luminous "Adoration 
of the Shepherds" that lifted him from obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
 The power of the 1620 painting -- a depiction of the birth of Christ using 
subtle yet lustrous tones -- captured the imagination of an eastern Camarillo 
church congregation that wanted to re-create a living Nativity scene based on 
one of the art world's masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We selected it from about five paintings researched from the Renaissance and 
Baroque periods," said Craig Misuradze, production director for Crossroads 
Community Church, which is sponsoring the production. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first saw it, we knew that it was the one," he said. "I think we are 
all moved by it -- you could even say it spoke to us." 
</P>
<P>
 That was last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now some six months later, the evangelical church is presenting a human-scale 
outdoor rendering of the painting -- reproduced down to the color of its rich, 
brown backdrop, the design of the shepherds' clothing and the way light 
radiates from the face of the Christ child. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to do it if we weren't going to be true to the art," Misuradze 
said. "We wanted to do something that was both meaningful in terms of art and 
religion." 
</P>
<P>
 For two hours each evening now through Dec. 23, members of the public can 
witness and compare for themselves the accuracy of the living reproduction. To 
help them, Misuradze said, organizers have placed a framed poster of the 
original painting nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Two sets of costumed church members playing the shepherds, Joseph and Mary 
will each take an hour shift during the nightly production, Misuradze said. 
Overhead, cherubs circle on a painted backdrop. 
</P>
<P>
 A porcelain-crafted Christ child will stand in for a real baby; organizers 
fear exposing a child to the evening cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Misuradze said more than 200 members of the church will take part in the 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have gone so far as to even dye fabric so it would match the colors of the 
painting," he said. "It's been a very painstaking process, but it's also been a 
labor of love." 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Harcourt, an assistant professor of art history at the University of 
Southern California, said Crossroads picked an interesting painter's canvas to 
re-create. 
</P>
<P>
 Harcourt, a specialist in Northern European Renaissance and Baroque painting, 
said many of van Honthorst's canvases involved images of secular, earthy scenes 
that detailed day-to-day human existence. 
</P>
<P>
 A student of the famed Italian painter Caravaggio, van Honthorst became expert 
in his use of his master's trademark chiaroscuro: the partial illumination of 
figures against a painting's dark background, Harcourt said. He even assumed an 
Italian nickname: Gherardo delle Notti. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his expertise in the manipulation of light that made his religious 
works stand out among the rest of his portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that 'Adoration of the Shepherds' is arguably one of his most 
powerful works," Harcourt said. "Through his control of the light, he was able 
to make it appear that the sole source of light is coming from the Christ child 
himself. It's really quite remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the painting that helped lift van Honthorst from the shadows of 
his masters was destroyed in 1993 when a terrorist's car bomb damaged a section 
of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy, where it was on display. 
</P>
<P>
 While Crossroads Pastor Tom Brewer called the painting's destruction a 
tragedy, he said that he and members of the church take comfort in the fact 
that through their living display, more people will come to know van 
Honthorst's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The painting captures the phenomenal sense of the event," Brewer said. "It 
has both a sense of the celestial and the earthly. I don't think our people 
could have picked a better painting to make come alive." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Crossroads Community Church will re-create a living version of 
Gerrit van Honthorst's famous Nativity painting, "Adoration of the Shepherds." 
The free presentation, which began Friday, will run nightly from 6:30 p.m. to 
8:30 p.m. through Dec. 23. The church is at 1221 Calle Suerte, Camarillo. 
Information: 484-8586.

CITYSCAPES / FRANK B. WILLIAMS: FROM BILLS BOOSTERS TO BROWNS BACKERS, FANS 
FLOCK TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 If you're not a Cleveland Browns fan, you might want to steer clear of the 
Pier 52 sports bar in Hermosa Beach when that football team is on the tube. 
Unless, that is, you'd like to join in the head-butting that sometimes is the 
celebration of choice after a Browns touchdown. Or unless you'd like to join 
Larry Zill, the guy with the "N2BRWNS" license plate around his neck, in 
ceremonial pounding on the bar when a key play is under way. Or unless you'd 
like to see the "Bleacher Creature," another native Clevelander, scrunch up his 
face to demonstrate how he got his nickname. 
</P>
<P>
 Or unless you'd like to meet Bob (Rumble) Helman, the fellow who founded the 
Southern California Browns Backers Assn., which now claims 2,000 members. 
Helman is an expert at a certain knuckles-to-the-skull greeting -- a 
professional "noogie giver," in other words. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it all comes down to is tradition," Helman says. "In L.A., people don't 
understand what football means in Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
 And so on game days, those who do understand gather with their own kind at 
Pier 52, and barmaids Sasha Collins and Basia Maczka -- yep, that's Sasha and 
Basia -- sell drinks as fast as they can pour them as Rumble and 75 of his 
buddies soak in pumpkin orange and brown memories, wipe potato chip crumbs off 
their Dockers, flap high fives and noogie away to their hearts' content . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the Clevelanders have Pier 52, their rivals on this particular afternoon -- 
the Dallas Cowboys folks -- have Mr. Pockets, a sports bar located just a few 
first downs up the coast in Manhattan Beach. The Dallas Cowboys being the 
Dallas Cowboys, this fraternity includes more than hometowners, embracing fans 
from Georgia to Montana. But for these few hours, at least, even those not born 
with Southern drawls seem to take on the classic twang of Dallas native Curt 
Junker, who clutches his beer, tugs at his Cowboys hat and exclaims how "that's 
got to be the biggest chin strap I've ever seen," as the bar's giant screen 
shows a close-up of quarterback Troy Aikman. 
</P>
<P>
 Drawls are out, though, at Bobby McGee's on 1st Street in Burbank. That's 
headquarters for the Buffalo Bills fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask the sports bar regulars and they'll tell you who rules the roost elsewhere 
on game days: The Green Bay Packers people at Besties in Hermosa Beach; the New 
England Patriots crowd at the Poop Deck in Hermosa, and the Miami Dolphins nuts 
at the appropriately named Endless Summer in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 The list goes on, this scattering of drinking palaces and hole-in-the-wall 
joints that have been anointed, for one reason or the other, as reunion 
centrals for clusters of displaced fans who may have gone to high school 
together, or on prom dates together, or may simply share, across all the miles, 
a childhood affiliation for the old hometown team: the Stove Piper in 
Northridge for Pittsburgh Steelers tough guys, for instance, or the Pineapple 
Hill in Sherman Oaks, across the San Fernando Valley, for Chicago Bears 
die-hards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the parking lot outside Bobby McGee's, tattered nerf footballs are flung 
through the air by grown men in red, white and blue Bills jerseys and leather 
jackets, each pass carrying the fantasy of a game-winning play. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the bar, 150 rowdy fans are chomping down on -- what else? -- Buffalo 
chicken wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Bills boosters took over here, they hung out at a bar called 
Scotland Yard in Canoga Park. Then Keith Norris, who hails from Niagara Falls 
and is president of the Bills Backers Club, rallied the dues-paying ($10 per 
year) fans and moved them to Burbank. The old joint was too small, he explains, 
and there was another problem, as well: "I didn't want to get stuck in a place 
where there were fans of other teams." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Buffalo fans visiting L.A. often hear about the crowd at Bobby 
McGee's and make a point of stopping by on game day, Norris says. 
</P>
<P>
 Three women -- Joy Ammann, Maria Richardson and Susannah Jeffers, all from 
upstate New York -- have become good friends after meeting for Bills games 
here. Indeed, side benefits have evolved from their football friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do my laundry at Maria's house every weekend," Ammann said. "Because of 
her, I have clean underwear." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffers drives an hour on game days from Hermosa Beach to hang out with her 
chums. 
</P>
<P>
 If you listen hard enough during commercials here, you can hear DJ and Bills 
fan C. Scott McCausland play "God Bless the Bills," as sung by Snorton Norton 
and the Moving Circus Band. And if you're really tipsy, "The Leader of the 
Sack," a song about Bills defensive end Bruce Smith, might start to sound like 
a classic.

ITO DELAYS RULING ON DISCLOSING JAILHOUSE TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a heated courtroom debate -- enlivened when one of O.J. Simpson's 
lawyers accused Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito of mishandling Simpson's 
security arrangements in jail -- Ito delayed a ruling until Monday on whether 
prosecutors may learn the contents of a jailhouse conversation between Simpson 
and the Rev. Rosey Grier. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay leaves alive for at least a few more days a debate that has tugged 
at the margins of the case for nearly a month, as prosecutors have sought to 
learn what Simpson told Grier, an ordained minister, during an emotional 
jailhouse visit in November. In their final arguments on the subject Friday, 
prosecutors said Grier was acting more as a counselor than a minister and also 
maintained that by raising his voice, Simpson waived whatever confidentiality 
might apply to the remarks, even if made to a clergyman. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Jeff Stuart said he overheard a snippet of that conversation and 
informed his superiors of it, but Simpson's attorneys have fought to keep 
prosecutors from learning what was said, arguing that the conversation was 
protected by the privilege that protects ministers from having to disclose 
their private talks. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Simpson's attorneys have said that even if the deputy did hear a 
short comment or two, the remarks had to have been taken out of context because 
Stuart testified that he could not hear what came just before or after the 
comments by Simpson and the brief response from Grier. Simpson is accused of 
killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman 
on June 12; he has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, defense attorney Gerald F. Uelmen offered a hypothetical example of 
how a seemingly incriminating comment could be misunderstood out of context. 
"We can imagine a situation where Mr. Simpson would say, 'I am so depressed. I 
can't imagine a situation where people I know would go on television and say I 
did it; I killed two people,' " Uelmen said. If the deputy only heard the words 
"I did it; I killed two people," that would not accurately depict the 
conversation, Uelmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen was backed up Friday by defense lawyer Robert L. Shapiro, who 
complained that the confidentiality issue is complicated by the fact that the 
visitation area where Simpson and his attorneys meet on weekends is inadequate. 
According to Shapiro, deputies can look over the lawyers' shoulders at their 
papers and can hear conversations between the attorneys and their client even 
when no voices are raised. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were guaranteed that we would have privacy," Shapiro said. "We did not." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro went on to accuse Ito, who supervised the jailhouse arrangements, of 
bungling that job and of disingenuously suggesting in court that they were 
adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 That prompted a rare flash of anger from the judge, who at first cautioned 
Shapiro to watch his step. When Shapiro ignored him, Ito sharply advised him to 
"take a deep breath" and reconsider his line of argument. Then Ito recessed 
court for a long lunch break. 
</P>
<P>
 When court resumed, a chastened Shapiro apologized for his comments, saying he 
had been overcome by his zealousness in advocating his client's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Ito is a professional," Shapiro said later, outside court. "He knows I 
respect him. He respects me. It was something that was said in the heat of 
advocacy." 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Ito accepted that apology but still did not rule on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will hopefully issue the court's ruling on this Monday morning," Ito said. 
"Sorry to the people who expected to be out of town." 
</P>
<P>
 The jailhouse exclamation has lingered as an intriguing sideshow to the trial 
since late November, when Ito and the attorneys mysteriously toured the Men's 
Central Jail, inspecting the area where Simpson meets with his attorneys and 
others on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 But with that issue apparently near resolution, the judge and lawyers turned 
late Friday to a topic at the case's core, the DNA test results that the 
prosecution believes will link Simpson to the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers, who originally had indicated that they were prepared to 
wage a major pretrial battle to contest the prosecution's DNA tests, this week 
shifted gears, saying instead that they preferred to hold that debate in front 
of the jury. On Friday, Uelmen argued that their proposed approach would save 
both sides time and would keep Simpson from having to pay for a hearing that 
could last two months or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearings over the admissibility of scientific evidence typically take place 
outside the presence of the jury because their purpose is to allow the judge to 
decide what evidence jurors should hear. Prosecutors opposed the defense 
motion, saying Friday that the unorthodox proposal would present jurors with 
mountains of evidence, much of which would be highly technical and could 
distract the panel from the other issues in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 George W. Clarke, a deputy district attorney from San Diego who is assisting 
the prosecution team on DNA issues, said the defense proposal could extend the 
period for which jurors need to be sequestered and would create a "substantial 
and dangerous possibility of forgetting evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito met privately with the lawyers in an effort to reach a compromise 
on the DNA issue, they emerged without an agreement. As a result, Ito said he 
would consider the various suggestions and issue a ruling by the end of the day 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 No court hearings are scheduled until Jan. 4, when the two sides will return 
with a host of issues to confront. In addition to the DNA evidence, defense 
attorneys are battling to keep out references to what they call "marital 
discord" between Simpson and his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say that evidence is relevant and prepared an 85-page legal 
pleading that urges Ito to allow jurors to hear it. Although that motion was 
filed under seal, sources who have read it say it lays out in detailed and 
highly charged language the couple's volatile history. 
</P>
<P>
 According to those sources, the allegations extend beyond three incidents that 
have been most widely reported: a 1985 fracas in which Simpson was found by 
police wielding a baseball bat after having shattered the window of his wife's 
car; a 1989 fight that ended with Simpson pleading no contest to charges of 
spousal abuse, and a 1993 incident in which Nicole Simpson called police for 
help while a man she identified as her ex-husband was smashing in a door and 
screaming at her. 
</P>
<P>
 Those incidents are documented in police files, but prosecutors also have 
canvassed friends of Nicole Simpson for details about Simpson's behavior on 
other occasions. Candace Garvey, for instance, recalled a verbal altercation at 
a Christmas party last year, and other acquaintances described incidents that 
they either witnessed or that were described to them by Nicole Simpson, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 How much of that information will be ruled relevant in the murder trial is a 
decision for Ito. He has not yet indicated when he will hear arguments on that 
issue, but both sides expect that it will be sometime in early January. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito also continues to wrestle with accusations that at least one member of the 
jury may have committed misconduct by failing to disclose a past contact with 
Simpson. The juror, an employee of the Hertz Corp., has acknowledged he may 
have attended a company-sponsored event at which Simpson, a longtime celebrity 
spokesman for the firm, also was present. The judge and lawyers met in chambers 
for more than two hours Friday, but did not disclose what was discussed or 
whether any resolution had been reached.

BASE DELEGATION HAS MEETING AT WHITE HOUSE; NAVY: OFFICIALS TALK WITH CHIEF OF 
STAFF PANETTA ABOUT FACILITIES' FISCAL IMPORTANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Although the White House is attempting to remain at the periphery of the base 
closure process, a local group seeking to spare Ventura County's Navy bases 
scored a coup on the final day of its lobbying trip here Friday by meeting 
briefly with White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower-ranking aides to President Clinton had canceled meetings with the 
delegation earlier this week, concerned about a White House counsel's 
recommendation that Clinton aides not meet with the crush of groups lobbying to 
keep their bases off the closure list. 
</P>
<P>
 But early Friday, Panetta and an adviser agreed to meet briefly with the 
so-called BRAC '95 Task Force as long as the session dealt with Ventura 
County's economy in general and not specifically the bases at Port Hueneme and 
Point Mugu. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told them about the contributions of the Navy bases," said County 
Supervisor John K. Flynn, describing the 10-minute session. "But we didn't tie 
it into pleading on BRAC. . . . They knew we were there because our economy was 
hurting for a lot of factors." 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in the session said they also thanked the Clinton Administration 
for its help after the Northridge earthquake, described the work that Ventura 
County has done to reform the welfare system and cautioned that the economy in 
California has yet to rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 By inference, County Supervisor Maggie Kildee said, the group was telling 
Panetta: "Don't throw us another double whammy" by allowing the two critical 
bases to close. 
</P>
<P>
 While the White House will not have a direct role in compiling the list of 
base closures, the local delegates said they were pushing their message to as 
many people as possible -- and the top aide to the nation's commander in chief 
certainly could not hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you talk to as many people as you can talk to and you hope they 
remember what you say," said defense contractor Bob Conroy, who accompanied the 
group. "By talking to them, we learn a lot about the process. We're smarter 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House meeting, arranged by the group's Washington lobbying firm, 
came after a morning session with staffers from the Base Closure and 
Realignment Commission, the group at the center of the effort to scale back the 
military. The staffers answered questions but did not give the delegation any 
sense of the bases' future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know the fate of any bases now and we certainly don't speculate," 
said commission spokesman Wade Nelson. "These are informational meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the base closure commission is not even in place. Former U.S. Sen. 
Alan Dixon has been named commission chairman, but Clinton and congressional 
leaders must still appoint seven more commissioners in coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 After Defense Secretary William J. Perry releases his recommended base 
closures in March, the Clinton appointees will review the list and come up with 
their own set of recommended consolidations. In a move to insulate the process 
from politics, Clinton and the Congress can reject the entire set of closures, 
but cannot remove individual bases from the final list. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, officials hope to cut 15% of the nation's bases during this fourth 
round of closures, which began in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 As they prepared to fly home Friday night, the Ventura County delegation 
agreed that it must continue exerting pressure in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's one thing we do know, we have a lot of work ahead of us," Flynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially important, members said, will be contacting more top officials in 
the Pentagon, where the initial base closure list will emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've only just begun," Kildee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the delegation met with more than a dozen government officials during 
its three-day lobbying blitz, ranging from rear admirals in the Pentagon to 
congressional staffers to the afternoon session with Panetta in the White House

JOYOUS SEASON FOR MERCHANTS; BUSINESS: SHOPPERS IN THOUSAND OAKS MAY BE GIVING 
THE OAKS ITS BEST SALES YEAR EVER, AND HOLIDAY PURCHASES AT VENTURA'S 
BUENAVENTURA MALL ARE UP OVER '93.

<P>
 The Oaks mall in Thousand Oaks is approaching record sales this holiday season 
with the San Buenaventura Mall in Ventura not far behind, merchants said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 With nine days left before Christmas, shoppers were snapping up piles of sale 
items at The Oaks along with pricier gifts at such upscale shops at Ann Taylor, 
Baby Gap and Eddie Bauer. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures for November and December are not available, but sales in October were 
up 25% over the same time last year and merchants say the surge is continuing, 
said Barbara Teuscher, manager of The Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that trend holds up, we'll be thrilled," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchases have been so brisk that Teuscher predicts this will be The Oaks' 
best year ever in total sales volume, topping even the frenzied retail market 
of the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall's four major department stores do not release sales figures, but the 
140 smaller stores and specialty boutiques have reported a combined increase of 
$1 million in sales each month since February, Teuscher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That can jump to several million dollars in the month of December," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although merchants at the Buenaventura Mall are not expecting similar 
record-topping sales, the season is progressing at an encouraging pace, mall 
manager Cayse Osterlund said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably one of the best Christmases we've had in a few years," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales figures for the holiday season are not yet available, but Osterlund said 
merchants have told him purchases have risen significantly over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The strong sales indicate a promising rebound from the three years of 
recession that affected Christmas shopping, along with the rest of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rare is the shop owner who hasn't been beating last year's figures," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many shoppers Friday said they ventured out on a weekday to beat the Christmas 
rush. Their strategy appeared to be successful: Parking spaces could be found 
in a few minutes, and lines at most shops moved quickly at both malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Margie Gallagher, 28, said she spent more than she intended when she began 
cruising the Buenaventura Mall Friday morning. Although her husband lost his 
job at a manufacturing plant earlier this year, she is going all-out to provide 
a generous Christmas for their two children, the Ventura homemaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many sales, I just couldn't resist," Gallagher said, loaded down 
with six large bags of goodies. "And I'm tired of watching every penny I 
spend." 
</P>
<P>
 At Wal-Mart in Oxnard, parents are plunking down more than $100 for such items 
as an oversized Barbie doll, interactive video games and plastic playhouses, 
assistant manager Jon Otterbacher said. 
</P>
<P>
 And going just as quickly are an assortment of electronic gifts, such as color 
televisions, camcorders, stereos and appliances, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bread ovens are real popular this year," Otterbacher said. "You're talking 
$100 a clip for one of those things. People are spending money this year, no 
doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart expects its holiday sales to run about 25% higher than last year, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kit Cameron, a Simi Valley mother who was shopping for three children and her 
husband at The Oaks, said she came Friday to avoid most of the Christmas rush. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a madhouse tonight and this weekend," she said. "And forget about 
trying to shop next week." 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron juggled bags from four shops while paying for another purchase at a 
children's store. She does the books for her husband's construction business, 
Cameron said, but took the afternoon off to finish her Christmas shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 She is spending about $1,500 on Christmas gifts this year, up significantly 
from last year, Cameron said. Her family is able to spend more because the 
construction business has picked up, particularly after the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most shoppers seemed cheerful and upbeat, 51-year-old Rich Arnold of 
Moorpark was one of a few who appeared to be having a less jolly time. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold was leaning on a stroller jammed with gift bags while waiting in a long 
line with his daughter so his 1-year-old grandson, Christopher Govoruhk, could 
sit on Santa's lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this mall six hours," Arnold grumbled. "I think Christmas is too 
commercialized." 
</P>
<P>
 But a few minutes later, his grandson climbed up on Santa's lap and gave the 
bearded man a quizzical look. Arnold started grinning, then broke into chuckles 
as Christopher squirmed on Santa's lap while his picture was taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, he was asked if the hassle and wait had been worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, for him," said Arnold, embracing his tow-headed grandson. "But only for 
him."

THORNTON JURY HEARS CLOSING ARGUMENT; COURTS: PROSECUTORS URGE PANEL TO CONVICT 
DEFENDANT OF FIRST-DEGREE MURDER AND SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCE. DELIBERATIONS BEGIN 
MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After seven weeks of testimony, the jury in the Mark Scott Thornton trial 
heard its final argument Friday and next week will begin deliberating the fate 
of the man charged with murdering Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath ordered deliberations 
to start Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-hour session, the jurors listened as prosecutors made one last 
attempt to persuade them to convict the 20-year-old defendant of first-degree 
murder and a special circumstance that could send him to the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris appealed to the jurors' sense of 
indignation, arguing that Thornton went to a tattoo parlor shortly after firing 
three bullets into the victim in the Santa Monica Mountains on Sept. 14, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you imagine a guy kidnaping a woman, taking her up there, shooting her 
twice in the back and once in the chest and going to get a tattoo with his 
girlfriend's name on it?" Kossoris asked. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Sullivan, he said, "was executed in the most cold-hearted, cowardly way. 
She's left there . . . and her body isn't discovered for 12 days." 
</P>
<P>
 Kossoris' rebuttal argument came one day after defense attorneys admitted 
their client killed the 33-year-old nurse. Thornton's lawyers argued that the 
slaying was unintentional and perhaps caused by O'Sullivan, who they said might 
have lunged at the defendant. They characterized Thornton as immature, 
impulsive and a slow learner. 
</P>
<P>
 Kossoris called the defense theory of the murder "absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 Around the time of the slaying, Thornton was a "one-man crime wave," Kossoris 
argued, noting that the defendant is also charged with forging checks, stealing 
the murder weapon and later using O'Sullivan's stolen truck to kidnap his 
former girlfriend and shoot at her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense tried to pick apart the prosecution's case in part by saying no 
credible witnesses ever saw Thornton harm O'Sullivan. But Kossoris noted wryly, 
"Most murders are not committed before any audiences." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the only one who knows precisely what happened to O'Sullivan is 
Thornton, who had denied strongly to authorities that he killed the nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Thornton should be convicted of the special circumstance because he 
murdered O'Sullivan while committing a robbery. Thornton, Kossoris argued, 
kidnaped O'Sullivan around 2 in the afternoon to steal her Ford Explorer truck. 
He then killed the woman so she would not report the crime because he needed 
time later that night to kidnap his former girlfriend when she got off work, 
Kossoris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case, escape and avoiding detection is very important," Kossoris 
said. "Remember, this guy has a warrant out for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't take a Harvard Phi Beta Kappa (to realize) that if he just left 
her somewhere, she's going to go to the road and flag someone down." 
</P>
<P>
 If the jury finds the defendant guilty of the special circumstance, it would 
then hear a second trial to decide his penalty: either death in the gas chamber 
or life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 During his argument, Kossoris often pointed at Thornton and called him a liar. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can swear on the Bible something he knows is a total falsehood," the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also criticized the defense for attacking prosecution witnesses, including 
17-year-old Stephanie Campbell, Thornton's ex-girlfriend. After the nurse's 
murder, Thornton allegedly kidnaped Campbell and drove around Northern 
California with her for five days before going to Reno, where he was arrested. 
The defense contended Campbell was with him willingly and lied in her testimony 
when she said he threatened to kill her if she tried to leave him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stephanie was as credible a witness as you will ever see," Kossoris said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Campbell is "a nice, clean-cut, honest girl who made only one 
big mistake in her life -- and that was to get involved with this coldblooded 
killer you see at the defense table."

BALLOT VOTE ON ADVENTIST PROJECT URGED; NEWBURY PARK: BEFORE THE SHOPPING 
CENTER PLAN COULD PROCEED, CITY'S OPEN SPACE RESTRICTIONS WOULD HAVE TO BE 
LOOSENED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Concerned that approval of a $100-million shopping center would undermine city 
open-space policies, Thousand Oaks Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said Friday that 
she wants the Seventh-day Adventist project to be placed on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's put this to the people," Zeanah said, referring to policy shifts that 
would be required to allow the giant Newbury Park project. "I don't want to see 
the council go over the heads of the residents when this decision could go 
against everything the residents have asked us to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah said she will ask the City Council to put the initiative on the spring 
ballot because she believes the project could seriously erode regulations that 
have preserved much of the city in its natural state. 
</P>
<P>
 For the project to be approved, open space restrictions would have to be 
loosened even though a 1994 residents' survey lists saving open space as a top 
priority, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh-day Adventist representatives said a ballot initiative would be 
expensive, time-consuming and unnecessary considering the scant opposition to 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, forcing the 179-acre Wendy Drive project to face a lengthy initiative 
campaign could scare away interested retailers, said Chuck Cohen, the attorney 
representing the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would make the city totally non-competitive with every other neighboring 
city," Cohen said. "It's, frankly, a terrible idea." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Zeanah, Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski said she would probably 
favor the measure, which would have to be supported by three of the four 
council members to make the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Judy Lazar could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But newly elected Councilman Andy Fox said he opposes an election because he 
believes General Plan decisions are the council's responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't start putting every project that's controversial on the ballot," 
Fox said. "The public just doesn't have enough information in front of them to 
make the decision. That's why they elect council members in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Zeanah said the ballot proposal stems from her fear that approval could 
unravel the city's efforts to sustain a semirural atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The open space policy will be a thing of the past," Zeanah said. "They want 
to cut up land preserved for the public, and that's not something I want to 
encourage." 
</P>
<P>
 The project would destroy 74 acres of wildlife habitat with a school campus 
and would also bring a Target store, 12-screen movie theater and two 
restaurants to Newbury Park just north of the Ventura Freeway. It would require 
cutting into hillsides and grading on steep slopes -- activities generally 
prohibited by the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But project supporters say the grading will help the project blend into the 
hillside and enable the church to preserve 279 of its 458 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah said she decided to call for an initiative after watching Thursday 
night's Planning Commission meeting, where the project was debated for five 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 At that meeting, commissioners approved the development's environmental report 
on a 3-2 vote. They delayed a vote on the full project until the commission 
reconvenes Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah's announcement Friday was one of several potential setbacks facing 
Seventh-day Adventist developers. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council's decision this week to hold a special election to fill the 
vacant fifth council seat also could work to paralyze the project, church 
representatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't be certain how the council members are going to vote, but based on 
experience there is a concern that with a four-person council we wouldn't get 
the requisite three votes," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Zeanah and Zukowski have indicated that they oppose the project. 
</P>
<P>
 As with a ballot initiative, the church could suffer long delays if it chooses 
to wait for a full council. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said such a delay would last at least until July if the developer 
intends to avoid a 2-2 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay could mean the loss of the Target store, which developers count on 
to anchor the project, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The significant delays could certainly hurt us," Cohen said. "It puts us at a 
competitive disadvantage with other cities that are vying for the same major 
retailers." 
</P>
<P>
 Those cities include Camarillo, Westlake Village and Calabasas, he said.

FIVE WITNESSES TO JET CRASH SUE, CLAIMING DISTRESS; COURTS: ALL WERE WORKING AT 
A CAR DEALERSHIP IN SANTA ANA WHEN THE TWIN-ENGINE PLANE WENT DOWN LAST YEAR IN 
A NEARBY VACANT LOT, KILLING FIVE ON BOARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Five people who were working at a car dealership in Santa Ana last December 
when a twin-engine jet crashed into a nearby empty lot have filed suit against 
the jet's owner and the charter company, claiming that the grisly scene has 
left them emotionally scarred. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had some weird dreams," said Jim Lawson, 35, of Yorba Linda, one of 
the plaintiffs, who worked in the service department at Honda Santa Ana. "And 
if I hear a plane, I have to stop what I am doing to track it so I know exactly 
where it is going and what it is doing. I imagine what it would look like 
crashing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed Thursday in Orange County Superior Court by Lawson and four 
of his former co-workers at Honda Santa Ana claims that as spectators of the 
fiery crash they suffered long-term emotional harm, were unable to work and had 
to seek medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Defendants named in the suit included Management Activities Inc., the company 
to which the jet was registered, Dr. Robert Gumbiner, who is owner of 
Management Activities and founder of FHP International Corp., and Martin 
Aviation, the firm that chartered the jet. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the defendants said their clients had not yet been served with the 
lawsuit and therefore they had no comment on the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa R. Geraurd, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, said they haven't 
been able to recover from the close call of nearly being hit by the nose-diving 
plane and the trauma of seeing the explosions and the body parts strewn on the 
ground. The two crew members on the plane and all three passengers, including 
the president and two other executives of the In-N-Out Burger chain, were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the five spectators to the tragedy who have filed suit, Lawson, Mike Lara, 
Thomas L. Anderson, John Mezurecky and Miguel Orona, only Orona still works at 
the dealership. Lawson said because of emotional illness he was unemployed for 
seven months and only two weeks ago took a job at another dealership. He said 
he can no longer work directly with customers because constant anxiety has made 
him short-tempered. 
</P>
<P>
 Geraurd said her clients have been diagnosed with post traumatic stress 
disorder, the same complaint claimed by some returning Vietnam veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference is they went to war knowing that what they would see would not 
be pleasant," Lawson said. "But I was unprepared for what I saw."

HEADWAY MADE IN REVIVING QUAKE 'GHOST TOWNS'; QUAKE: CITY, FEDERAL, PRIVATE 
AGENCIES ARE EXPECTED TO FUND REPAIRS OF 80% OF THE POCKETS OF DAMAGED HOUSING. 
PROGRESS IS PARTLY ATTRIBUTED TO ONE-OF-A-KIND LOAN PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly a year after the Northridge earthquake created pockets of vacant, 
heavily damaged "ghost towns," city and federal agencies have provided enough 
loans to repair about 60% of the empty units and approximately 20% are expected 
to be repaired with private insurance, according to housing officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The 80% funding level is a signal that significant steps have been taken to 
clear away a problem that many experts predicted would be one of the most 
stubborn legacies of the Jan. 17 quake, according to the officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Progress is really being made," said Councilman Hal Bernson, whose northwest 
San Fernando Valley district includes five of the city's 15 ghost towns. "It's 
not as fast as I would like, but we've had a lot of obstacles to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Housing officials attribute part of the progress to a one-of-a-kind city loan 
program that offers zero-interest funds to financially troubled landlords who 
are rejected by the Small Business Administration or other lending 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bud Goldshine is one of the building owners to benefit from the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months ago, he had given up on his 35-unit apartment building in Granada 
Hills that had been turned into an empty, crumbling shell by the Northridge 
quake and then stripped of all valuables by marauding scavengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejected for a loan by the SBA, Goldshine had resolved to let his bank 
foreclose on the building. "There was nothing we could do at that point," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But things turned around when the city offered him a zero-interest, 
$1.2-million loan. "Things are looking up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the 15 ghost towns in the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and the 
Mid-City areas, 315 buildings with 7,510 units were left vacant by the quake, 
according to housing officials. 
</P>
<P>
 City and SBA loans will repair 163 buildings with 4,651 units, or 62% of all 
the vacant units. Another 58 buildings with 1,618 units, or 21% of all the 
vacant units, are expected to be repaired with private insurance funds, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ghost towns became an immediate problem for city officials as the vacant 
buildings began to decay and provide havens for drug dealers, transients, 
prostitutes and gang members. Rats and cockroaches began to multiply as they 
fed off rotting food left behind in abandoned kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearful that the ghost towns would create a festering urban nightmare, city 
housing officials formed the Ghost Town Task Force in July to broker deals 
between lenders and landlords to help financially troubled owners get a break 
on mortgage payments so they can rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 When banks are willing, the city has offered zero-interest repair loans from a 
$310-million pool of federal disaster aid. So far, the city has committed $61.3 
million in loans for ghost town properties. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for a city loan, landlords must first be rejected by the SBA and 
traditional lending institutions. Once a city loan is approved, however, no 
payments are due for five years and if the building is sold, part of the loan 
is forgiven, depending on how long the landlord made payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The SBA moved in June to do its part by vowing to quickly process loan 
requests from ghost town property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 But the work is far from over. With most of the funding in place, city 
officials must now begin in earnest to process permits to let owners make 
repairs. Housing officials have yet to calculate how many owners have already 
begun. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real job now is to get them rebuilt and reoccupied," said Robert 
Moncrief, who heads the Ghost Town Task Force. 
</P>
<P>
 An even greater dilemma for city officials will be getting owners to repair 
the remaining 20% of the empty units -- those hard-hit structures whose owners 
are still trying to obtain funding or have given up entirely on their 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Borris Tsurif is in the latter category. He owns a six-unit apartment building 
on Zelzah Avenue in Northridge that suffered $80,000 worth of damage and was 
"yellow tagged" by city inspectors, meaning entry was limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the SBA offered him a loan, Tsurif said he rejected it because he 
could not be sure that his tenants would ever return. He decided to let his 
bank repossess the structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody knows if I can fill it up again," he said. "What can I do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Such buildings are likely to sit idle for months as foreclosure proceedings 
drag on and banks try to find new owners. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to quickly move new owners into such buildings, Moncrief said the 
city has another program that provides low-interest loans for investors 
interested in buying and repairing ghost town buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he said the city will hold a meeting Jan. 12 at USC to provide 
developers with listings of quake-damaged properties in hopes of encouraging 
them to buy and rebuild the structures. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the city's multi-pronged approach, officials have also used federal 
disaster aid to fence and board up about 100 vacant buildings and hire private 
security guards to patrol the ghost towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and city officials believe such efforts have helped reduce the crime 
problem that plagued ghost towns in the months immediately after the quake by 
keeping trespassers out of the empty units. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burglaries and vandalism have substantially decreased," said Los Angeles 
Police Capt. Vance Proctor, commanding officer of the LAPD's Devonshire 
Division, which patrols several ghost towns. 
</P>
<P>
 He attributes the decline to the city's security measures as well as extra 
patrols by police and beefed-up surveillance by volunteer citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Moncrief believes the 80% funding level and the drop in crime will provide a 
powerful combined force toward getting other owners to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the momentum that has been generated will encourage owners that have 
not participated to make the decision to reinvest," he said.

MISSION ACCOMPLISHED; MILITARY: ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT WHO HAS BEEN A U.S. MARINE 
FOR 11 YEARS GETS HIS GREEN CARD IN AN EMOTIONAL CEREMONY. HE IS HAPPY, BUT 
WORRIES ABOUT THE STATUS OF HIS WIFE AND TWO OF HIS CHILDREN.

<P>
 For more than a decade, Danny Lightfoot inhabited the shadow world of illegal 
immigrants, dodging questions about his nationality and carrying a forged birth 
certificate just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 In that sense, his story was not unusual, except for one fact: Lightfoot, a 
citizen of the Bahamas, was a U.S. Marine, enlisted by an aggressive recruiter 
who, Lightfoot says, went so far as to secure the false birth document for him. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Sgt. Lightfoot, in a uniform bedecked with a rainbow of service 
ribbons, finally won the right to live permanently in the United States and 
work here. 
</P>
<P>
 That once-distant goal accomplished, Lightfoot's hope is that the same 
privileges will soon be conferred on his wife, who now has only limited legal 
status, and his two youngest children, Danny Jr., 5, and Demetrius, 2, who 
remain undocumented. (His oldest, Dominic, 8, is a U.S. citizen, born in North 
Carolina while Lightfoot was stationed at Camp Lejeune.) 
</P>
<P>
 "If I happen to die for my country, I want to die knowing that my kids can 
call that country home," Lightfoot, 30, said after an emotional ceremony at the 
U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service headquarters in Downtown Los 
Angeles, where he stood next to a replica of the Statue of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Raquel, 25, also from the Bahamas, burst into tears before a throng 
of news cameras as her husband held up his new green card. 
</P>
<P>
 The sergeant's experience is clearly an unusual one: A distinguished service 
record -- and the support of the Marine Corps, U.S. Rep. Jerry Lewis 
(R-Redlands) and Carl Shusterman, a prominent Los Angeles immigration attorney 
-- greatly aided him. The millions of other illegal immigrants who also live 
under the threat of deportation and separation from their families seldom enjoy 
such advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Proposition 187 era, Lightfoot's saga serves as a cautionary tale, 
underscoring how the undocumented defy generalization. Even INS officials -- 
not known for their humanitarian impulses toward potential deportees -- 
acknowledged that this Marine had earned the opportunity to remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people who are coming into the United States who are dedicated and 
want to make a contribution," said Richard K. Rogers, district director of the 
INS in Los Angeles, who personally presented Lightfoot with his green card. 
</P>
<P>
 The sergeant's two youngest children, technically subject to arrest, cavorted 
through the INS corridors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine's battle for legal status also stands as a dramatic illustration of 
how Proposition 187 glides over the labyrinthine complexity of the immigration 
process and the often-arcane laws governing it, which were shaped by decades of 
legislation and litigation. That shortcoming is one of the key arguments that 
persuaded a federal judge this week to slap a temporary injunction on most of 
the ballot measure's key provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Most illegal immigrants, experts say, are members of families, not unlike 
Lightfoot's, that include hodgepodges of the lawful and undocumented. Returning 
to their homeland is often not a viable option, especially for those with 
children who are U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightfoot's is "the classic case of a divided family," said Shusterman, who 
shepherded it through the dense immigration bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Lightfoot now has a green card, Proposition 187 would still bar 
his two youngest from attending public schools and receiving other 
taxpayer-supported benefits, including non-emergency health care. With his 
limited military salary, Lightfoot says, he couldn't afford to send his 
children to private school. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Proposition 187 would also mandate that educators, social service 
workers, health providers and law enforcement officials report illegal 
immigrants such as his sons for possible deportation. And Raquel Lightfoot, 
while currently holding temporary legal status, would be barred from receiving 
state-funded services because the proposition's eligibility definitions are 
much narrower than those found in federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightfoot enlisted in the Marines in 1983, while he was a high school student 
in Miami. Naval investigators later declined to prosecute Lightfoot and the 
recruiter he says provided the fake birth certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 The young Marine's lack of status did not become a major obstacle until 1991, 
when, while on a tour of duty in Okinawa, he was informed of a pending 
reassignment to the Marine Corps Logistics Base in Barstow. With his military 
identification, Lightfoot could have come to California easily enough. But his 
wife and children needed passports. Lightfoot made the difficult decision: He 
turned himself in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I fully expected I would be taken into custody," said Lightfoot, who was 
recently approved for a promotion to staff sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, military officials decided to help him, sending the Marine on a path 
that eventually led Friday to the INS office. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Lightfoot is seeking U.S. citizenship, which, once achieved, should enable 
his wife and children to obtain the legal papers that he finally possesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "What good does it do me if I'm able to eat lobster and steak," Lightfoot 
asked, "if my kids are eating ground beef? I don't want them to go through what 
I had to go through."

 Jose Reyes' eyes lit up with surprise and happiness Friday when boxes of food, 
clothes and Christmas gifts were delivered to his home by high school students. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose, 9, and his six brothers and sisters were not expecting to have any kind 
of Christmas this year after their mother, Carmen, told them she had no money 
for the gifts they longed to get. 
</P>
<P>
 But the children's hope was not destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of about 25 La Habra High School students visited them with bundles 
filled with donations they had gathered at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," Jose said as he clutched a gift. "I'm so happy. I'm 
going to wait until Christmas . . . so I'll have something to open." 
</P>
<P>
 His neighbor Cecilia Romero, 5, simply couldn't hold back. 
</P>
<P>
 She tore into a box and pulled out toys and clothes. "Clothes! Belts! Socks! 
Monkeys! Lots of clothes," she yelled. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, members of MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano Aztlan), each 
year organize the gift-giving to help some of La Habra's neediest families. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such a great feeling of warmth and kindness," said Paula Agras, 17, 
president of MEChA. "I just love doing this. I get a good feeling that makes me 
feel happy." 
</P>
<P>
 MEChA adviser and history teacher Frank Thompson said the project teaches the 
students a lesson in charity. The lesson "makes the students feel good about 
themselves, and that affects their self-esteem, and that produces a ripple 
effect that extends beyond the perceivable." 
</P>
<P>
 Caleb Smith, 17, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me want to help even more," Smith said. "And it makes me want to 
work harder in life so I can succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 The food and gifts were given to families served by ESA Anaheim Community 
Service. The food, gifts and certificates -- to buy trees and Christmas dinner 
items -- were delivered to the ESA center this week. MIMI KO and DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SOUTH COUNTY; AFTER LONG AND BITTER FIGHT, DEVELOPER 
PROCEEDS ON LAS FLORES PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After winning a long, bitter and expensive fight with environmentalists, the 
Santa Margarita Co. moved ahead with the Las Flores planned community this week 
and sold development rights to four builders. 
</P>
<P>
 A company spokesman said construction will start on the first phase of the 
1,005-acre project within a few months and the first homes should be erected by 
next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Margarita Co. expects to build 2,500 homes by 1998 in Las Flores. 
Architecture and planning will mirror in some ways the early California styles 
of the company's larger planned community, neighboring Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the architecture of Las Flores will help reflect the heritage of land, 
as it does in Rancho Santa Margarita, the overall feel of Las Flores will be 
different," said spokeswoman Diane Gaynor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the community will share a ZIP code with Rancho Santa Margarita, 
Gaynor said the future 4,000 to 6,000 residents will be able to list a Las 
Flores address. The first phase will see 619 homes built directly south of 
Rancho Santa Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Margarita Co. chose to work with the San Juan Group, Standard 
Pacific Corp., Warmington Homes and SeaCounty Homes Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Local environmentalists battled for two years to stop Las Flores in court and 
hoped to force the county Board of Supervisors to protect dwindling wilderness 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 They argued that environmental studies were inadequate and that endangered 
species such as the California gnatcatcher live on the development site. The 
final appeal was turned down in 1992, clearing the way for the new planned 
community. FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ANAHEIM; 32 SIXTH-GRADERS LEAVE IMPRESSIVE MARK ON CITY

<P>
 The sixth-grade students at Adelaide Price Elementary School have spent months 
cleaning up graffiti in the neighborhood surrounding their school. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the 32 students are ready to put their own mark on the city, in the form 
of a free-standing, 5-by-8-foot mural they recently completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since classes at the year-round school started in August, Pam Krey's students 
have spent their lunchtime picking up trash and wiping away graffiti in a 
one-mile radius of their school. 
</P>
<P>
 To celebrate their efforts, students painted a mural featuring six students of 
different ethnic heritage and a handprint from each student. The mural was 
unveiled Friday at the school, where the students were honored for their 
ongoing project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students told me this mural would inform the public of their efforts, 
beautify the community and show other kids a better way to use their talents," 
said Mike Howard, director of a local anti-graffiti organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Krey's class is the youngest group of volunteers to participate in the city's 
Adopt-a-Block program. The class was divided into five groups, with each group 
responsible for canvassing the neighborhood one day a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bring a rolling cart with a special a solvent to remove graffiti, paint 
and trash bags," Krey said. "Some days we clean up three 'tags,' other days 
it's more than 20." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lattimore, 11, said he didn't want to give up his lunchtime to pick up 
trash at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "But who wants to go to school with trash and graffiti everywhere you look?" 
he said. "Now I don't mind 'cause it makes me feel good inside and it makes 
Anaheim a better place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 The mural will be displayed from Monday through Jan. 1 at Anaheim Plaza, Jan. 
2-6 at City Hall, then at the Anaheim Central Library Jan. 9-20. 
</P>
<P>
 It then returns to the school, where it will be permanently displayed.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; RAPIST FAILS 
PSYCHIATRIC EXAM, WON'T BE PAROLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rapist Carnot Andrew Lyles, whose pending parole created a storm of protest in 
Pasadena, has failed a psychiatric exam and will not be released from state 
prison as scheduled, state corrections officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyles, 38, took the exam Thursday.He is the seventh sex offender in Southern 
California since March to fail the last-minute test, which corrections 
officials administer to dangerous felons whose parole otherwise cannot be 
denied. Under the state's 1977 determinate sentencing law, prisoners are 
released on set dates rather than going before a parole board. 
</P>
<P>
 State corrections officials had said that Lyles would be paroled somewhere in 
south Los Angeles County, but a final decision had not been made, said 
Department of Corrections spokesman Tip Kindel. Lyles had requested parole in 
Pasadena, where his ailing father lives. But that was blocked when six women 
who said they were his victims protested. Under state law, felons cannot be 
released within 35 miles of the residence of victims who register protests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Prison Terms will hold a hearing within 30 days to decide whether 
Lyles should have his parole revoked and be kept in prison for up to a year of 
psychiatric treatment. The hearings are generally formalities that confirm the 
decision to revoke parole. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Lyles was convicted of committing a sex act with a 9-year-old girl in 
Pasadena. Lyles, who is being held at the R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility in 
San Diego, was also convicted of raping and sodomizing a Pasadena woman in 
1978.

 Where bad hair days are an official crisis: After taking up residence in 
affluent San Marino, Lori Levi received a welcome note from a dentist as well 
as a sticker for emergency numbers. There were spaces for "physician," 
"veterinarian" -- and "hair salon." 
</P>
<P>
 We're surprised there was no space for "pool man." 
</P>
<P>
 Levi's letter reminded us of an emergency number listing we came upon in a 
dormitory at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. That sticker had phone numbers for 
"campus police," "campus fire," and "pizza delivery."

 Fly the (extremely) friendly skies: Mile High Adventures is offering this 
Christmas package: For $279, a couple can frolic in bed for an hour in the back

And afterward, they can celebrate with champagne and chocolate-covered 
strawberries.

 "A lot of people have fantasies about making love in an airplane," said Nick 
Edgar, the proprietor and pilot of the Santa Monica service. "But you have to 
be pretty daring to do it on an airliner with 400 other people. This is more 
intimate. We have a wooden partition between the two pilots and the passenger 
cabin." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the bed, the cabin also has two seats that must be occupied by the 
seat-belted passengers during takeoffs and landings. Otherwise they're "free to 
move about," as Edgar puts it. Fortunately, there have been no instances of 
turbulence in which passengers were asked to climb out of bed and back into 
their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere is informal. One customer asked for, and was granted, some 
bonus mileage -- an extra half hour of flight time. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, about two-thirds of the reservations for Mile High are made by 
women for their husbands and boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, by the way, turned down a request for a threesome. "I told them," 
Edgar said, "we didn't have enough seats."

 "I'd like women to appreciate the genius of the Three Stooges," he said. "If I

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; SCHOOL TAKES A GLOBAL LOOK AT CHRISTMAS

 As sisters Kaylene and Lauryn Hernandez strolled through the hallways of 
Christa McAuliffe School in Oxnard, they learned about the many ways various 
cultures celebrate Christmas and the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting that the American way is not the only way to have 
Christmas," said 8-year-old Kaylene. "It helps us to understand other people 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters were two of nearly 400 parents, students and friends who attended 
the school's second annual Winter Festival on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, teachers and students worked to display something depicting 
Christmas and New Year's celebrations around the world in the school's 
corridors and cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
 There were Merry Christmas signs in Spanish, Russian, French and Japanese; 
signs explaining that Hanukkah is the feast of lights in remembrance of a war 
won by the Jews; and signs reminding passers-by that New Year's Day is the most 
important holiday celebration in China. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside one of the classrooms, a handwritten note near the Holland flag 
related that Santa come to Holland by boat, while drawings and ornaments on a 
table explained that many African Americans celebrate Kwanzaa from Dec. 26 to 
Jan. 1. The holiday was created in 1966 to remind African Americans of their 
heritage and customs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at this and marvel to know that my 5-year-old daughter will come home 
aware that her race is not the only race that exists," said Louie Gonzalez, who 
had brought his entire family to the celebrations. "They have everything for 
everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 But that was not quite the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Shahida Chaudhry and daughters Mariam, 9, and Amna, 4, could not find anything 
from their home country: Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't celebrate Christmas, but we do have several celebrations throughout 
the year," Chaudhry said. "It's great for the kids, though, to be exposed to 
all of these different celebrations." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, which lasted from 6 to 8 p.m., also featured children singing 
Christmas carols and a small shop where youngsters could do their Christmas 
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop, which had been open for three days, sold items ranging from 15 cents 
to $9, including sewing kits, clocks, rings, potholders and mugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great way for the kids to do their Christmas shopping," said 
volunteer Virginia Urango. "The price is really low, and they can actually shop 
without having their parents around." CHRISTINA LIMA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: HOLIDAY JOBS OFFSET BY DROP IN FARM WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county's unemployment rate rose only slightly from October to November, as 
a modest increase in retail jobs was offset by a sharp decline in agricultural 
positions, according to a report released Friday by the state employment 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists said the unemployment rate of 7.7%, up from 7.6% in October, was a 
sign that Ventura County is continuing to recover from the recession that has 
plagued Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're seeing a picture of a county that's recovering from recession 
at a moderate pace," said Bruce DeVine, chief economist for the Southern 
California Assn. of Governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year Ventura County seems to be doing better than Southern California as 
a whole," DeVine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists attributed a 10% increase in retail jobs to the onset in November 
of the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 They blamed a 30% decline in farm work to slow citrus and avocado harvesting 
that is expected during winter months. 
</P>
<P>
 Agriculture is a seasonal industry and cannot be expected to remain steady 
year around, said Rex Laird, director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unusual to see a decline at this time of year," Laird said. "Most of 
those workers will be employed for about 10 months out of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 November's unemployment rate is down from 8.5% last year, a drop that 
employment officials attribute in part to gains caused by new-home 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a lot of new jobs open up in the construction industry," said 
Patricia Baldoni, job services adviser for the state employment office in Simi 
Valley. "We're glad to see those jobs are up, but they're still not at levels 
that we'd like to see them." MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; SCHOOL TRUSTEES TO MEET ON CAMPUSES

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to increase parents' involvement in school issues, the Oxnard 
School District Board of Trustees has agreed to hold four of its next 12 
meetings at school sites across the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, which voted unanimously for the project Wednesday, will have its 
first meeting at a school as early as February, said district Supt.Bernard 
Korenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it will cost $160 each time they move microphones and other 
electronic equipment from the district office in downtown Oxnard to the school 
sites, the effort is worthwhile, Korenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A large number of people have shown an interest in knowing what is going on 
in the district and the schools. However, it's not always convenient for them 
to come to our office," he said. "So we thought, 'Why not bring the meeting to 
the community?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Korenstein said the goal is to have the meetings at schools in different parts 
of the city. The schools will notify parents when the meetings are scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 To facilitate parents' attendance, the district plans to offer baby-sitting 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who need baby sitters must sign up in advance. CHRISTINA LIMA

<P>
 A 38-year-old woman transient whose body was found in the Ventura River bottom 
Friday died of meningitis, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics declared Debbie Cayton dead about 11:45 a.m. after she was 
discovered by another transient about a quarter-mile north of the Main Street 
overpass, Ventura County Deputy Coroner Craig Stevens said.Meningitis is an 
inflammation of membranes near the brain, brought on by bacterial infection. 
Symptoms include severe headaches and fever. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is most commonly contracted from having a poor immune system," he said. 
"It is nothing contagious." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens said Cayton made her home on the river bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living in the river bottom is not the healthiest lifestyle," Stevens said. He 
said Cayton is survived by two daughters who live with their grandmother in 
Ventura. PAUL ELIAS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; 'SANDBAG' GUN USED TO SUBDUE PATIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL ELIAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura police used a newly acquired "sandbag shotgun" to subdue a mental 
patient menacingly wielding a four-foot metal rod, officers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 33-year-old man was committing himself voluntarily to the county's 
inpatient psychiatric center about 2:30 p.m. when he suddenly grabbed a fire 
extinguisher and climbed atop the two-story building adjacent to Ventura County 
Medical Center on Loma Vista Road, Officer Mark Stadler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stadler said when police arrived, the man grabbed the rod and then climbed 
down from the roof. He was shot in the abdomen with a silver-dollar-sized 
sandbag as he stood in the facility's courtyard and waved the rod at officers, 
Stadler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shotgun blast knocked the wind out of the man and left him with a bruise, 
but otherwise did not injure him, Stadler said. He said it was only the third 
or fourth time Ventura police used the sandbag shotgun, purchased earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time last year we probably would have had to use batons," Stadler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was examined at the medical center and returned to the psychiatric 
unit. Because he is a mental health patient, police refused to release his 
name. He was described as a transient frequently seen in downtown Ventura. PAUL 
ELIAS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PLEA BARGAIN STRUCK IN VOTER FRAUD CASE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Ventura County women have pleaded guilty to voter fraud for, among other 
charges, submitting dead people's names as newly registered Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Robinson-Adams of Ventura and Lisa Marie Krueger of Oxnard were 
promised probation in exchange for their guilty pleas to six felony charges, 
Deputy Dist. Atty.Robert D. Meyers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 They are scheduled to be sentenced Jan. 20 by Superior Court Judge Allan L. 
Steele. 
</P>
<P>
 The women were arrested in October and charged with more than 20 counts each 
of voter fraud. In her guilty plea, Robinson-Adams admitting to submitting dead 
people's names on voter registration cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Krueger pleaded guilty to submitting the names of people she had registered 
without their consent, Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair were hired to register Republican voters by a campaign consultant 
working for the Brooks Firestone Assembly campaign. Neither Firestone nor the 
consulting firm was implicated in the scam, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Robinson-Adams and Krueger worked for about two weeks and 
turned in between 100 and 150 cards each. The two were paid about $3 per card. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers said that without the promise of probation, the defendants could have 
been sentenced to six years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought that it would not be appropriate to send these people to state 
prison," Meyers said. BARBARA MURPHY

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; FATHER WHO 
TOOK BOY TO IRAQ ARRAIGNED AFTER EXTRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man accused of snatching his 2-year-old son and stealing him away to Iraq 
was arraigned Friday, a day after he was extradited from England. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitham Khalid Al-Nasseri, 33, was charged with illegally taking his son, 
Laith, to Iraq in July.Al-Nasseri, who was brought back to Southern California 
on Thursday, was ordered held on $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy and his mother, Michelle Al-Nasseri, were reunited in September, 
moments after Scotland Yard authorities arrested his father at London's 
Heathrow Airport. Michelle Al-Nasseri had lured her ex-husband to the airport 
with promises of reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitham Al-Nasseri, a citizen of the United States and Iraq, disappeared with 
the child in July after his wife began divorce proceedings. He called from Iraq 
and demanded that she come there if she wanted to see Laith again. Al-Nasseri's 
motive was to force his wife to reconcile and join him in Iraq, said her 
attorney, Michael Oddenino. 
</P>
<P>
 Al-Nasseri had threatened to steal the boy, prompting his wife to get a court 
order prohibiting him from taking the child out of California. He continued to 
have joint custody pending the divorce, and was able to take the child on 
weekend trips. Al-Nasseri claimed to be taking the boy camping when he flew him 
to Iraq, Oddenino said. 
</P>
<P>
 Al-Nasseri is charged with detention or concealment of a child with intent to 
deprive custody. That offense carries a maximum sentence of three years, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Robert Budman said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; EVIDENCE 
AGAINST EX-OFFICER IN PORNO CASE THROWN OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge threw out evidence Friday against a retired Los Angeles 
police officer accused of taking child pornography from police evidence lockers 
for personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Robert J. Perry's ruling undercuts the charges against Walter Ray 
Bentley Jr., whose lawyer argued that police failed to explain why they needed 
to search his client's Granada Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are now re-examining the case, saying they may have to drop the 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the search was to look for evidence that Bentley had been 
leaking confidential criminal records to two private investigators, including 
retired Deputy Los Angeles Police Chief Daniel R. Sullivan. Sullivan pleaded no 
contest in September to possessing the confidential files and was fined $5,000 
and placed on a year's probation. Bentley, 47, is also accused of illegally 
accessing police computer files.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; PHOTO OPPORTUNITY WITH SURFIN' SANTA

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are a multitude of photo opportunities with St. Nick, but where other 
than San Clemente can Surfin' Santa be found? 
</P>
<P>
 In a city that is one of Southern California's surfing hot spots, people can 
have their picture taken with Santa and a surfboard against a rolling ocean 
background today from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a jolly and slightly rotund teacher who has enthusiastically 
volunteered to be Santa," said Christopher Cairns, principal of San Clemente 
High."He's dressed as Santa with sunglasses and a surfboard." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa will be at a Lucky's grocery store, 804 Avenida Pico. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost is $2.50 and proceeds will benefit the San Clemente High School pep 
squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfin' Santa has visited the San Clemente High School campus this week, 
taking photos with students. 
</P>
<P>
 Cairns said response from the student body has been enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 The surfing theme makes sense, he said, because "we live in Southern 
California and San Clemente High School is a perennial powerhouse in surfing. 
And it's fun." FRANK MESSINA

<P>
 Police Sgt. Michael A. Shanahan has been presented with the Medal of Merit -- 
the second highest award issued by the Tustin Police Department -- for his 
rescue of an injured motorcyclist. 
</P>
<P>
 The rescue occurred in February on the southbound Costa Mesa after a 
motorcyclist had been pinned under a car in a collision.Bystanders had 
attempted to lift the car off the victim's chest, but the effort was halted by 
Shanahan when he realized it was increasing the man's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanahan used a jack to lift the vehicle, then crawled under the car and freed 
the man. Shanahan then administered first aid until paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin Police Chief W. Douglas Franks said, "It is highly probable that the 
injured motorist would have incurred more serious injuries and possibly died," 
if it were not for Shanahan's actions. Shanahan was honored last weekend at the 
department's annual awards ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Also honored at the awards ceremony was Officer Michael S. Velko. He received 
the inaugural Chief's Award of Excellence for his promotion of community-based 
policing. 
</P>
<P>
 Velko's accomplishments include helping organize an apartment managers 
association, leading children in a neighborhood cleanup, working with community 
groups, and helping create a coloring book for grade school students that has 
an anti-gang and anti-drug message. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's done quite a bit," Franks said, "and a lot of it on his own time." ALAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; NEW COLLEGE BOARD PRESIDENT PLEDGES TO 
MAINTAIN QUALITY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The new board president of the Coast Community College District, the largest 
in the county with more than 56,000 students, said maintaining quality 
instruction in the face of a shortfall in funding will be among her priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherry L. Baum, a trustee in the district for nine years and a self-described 
community activist, was elected president of the board at Wednesday night's 
Board of Trustees meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maintaining quality instruction in the classroom, while making cutbacks that 
are caused by the shortfall of funding at the state and county level, are one 
of my priorities," Baum said in a post-meeting interview. "Things are getting a 
little tougher, but I think we can get by if a good team is in place." 
</P>
<P>
 Baum, past president of the West Orange County League of Women Voters and 
former high school board member for the Huntington Beach Unified School 
District, ran unopposed in the last election for Area 1, which encompasses the 
northern part of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to thank my colleagues," said Baum, a resident of Seal Beach. "But I 
also want to remind you that I'm first among equals and my duties are to 
preside and speak for the board. But our task first and foremost will always be 
to serve the students." 
</P>
<P>
 Board Trustee Armando R. Ruiz said he nominated Baum for the job because of 
her long line of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she's going to provide the leadership that we need for the coming 
college year," he said. "She's been a board member for a few years and she was 
just reelected. She was unopposed in Area 1, which shows people respect and 
admire her." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Ruiz rejected trustees' attempt to make him vice president. He 
said he had other commitments, among them tending to the business of the 
California Community College Trustees, where he serves as as second vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Former board president Walter G. Howald was elected vice president during the 
meeting. TOM RAGAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; TEACHING PARENTS TO TEACH THEIR KIDS

<P>
 Fidel Ayala, 26, and Maria Salazar, 27, want to learn English to get better 
jobs and also to help the couple's three children with homework. 
</P>
<P>
 Herlinda Tarelo, 28, said she, too, hopes that by being in the Family Literacy 
Program she can help her three children succeed in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayala, Salazar and Tarelo are among 50 who enrolled in the literacy program 
that started a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The program targets parents with young children in the primarily Latino 
community known as Oak View, near Oak View School. The program is supported by 
federal grant money and volunteer tutors, said Carolyn Healy, family literacy 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to teach basic English skills needed to read and write so they 
can read to their kids," Healy said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has 35 volunteer tutors, but Healy said more are needed because of 
the program's growing popularity. "I have a waiting list of 30 families waiting 
for tutors," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutor Mary Lorge of Fountain Valley, the office manager at at her husband's 
accounting firm, said she became involved as a program volunteer in May because 
of her Latino roots and her desire to give back to her community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt akin to the Mexican people and I feel I can do something to 
help them get a better living in this country," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Healy said volunteers must tutor two hours a week. They do not have to speak 
Spanish. She said tutors will learn skills during a training workshop to 
communicate with Spanish-speaking students by using techniques such as visual 
aids. 
</P>
<P>
 A tutor-training session is scheduled for next month at Central Library, 7111 
Talbert Ave. The 15-hour workshop will be on Monday and Wednesday evenings from 
6 to 9 on Jan. 16, 18, 23, 25 and 30.

<P>
 The land that Los Alamitos occupies today was home to a group of Native 
Americans called the Puvu when Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo spotted the Southern 
California coast in 1542 while sailing under the Spanish flag. In 1784, Manuel 
Nieto, a soldier, was given a huge land grant, part of which was Rancho Los 
Alamitos, named after the abundant cottonwoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The area boomed during the sugar beet bonanza from 1896 to 1925. But when the 
Bixby Sugar factory closed in 1926, Los Alamitos returned to being a small town 
surrounded by small farms. It became a city in 1960, but with a current 
population of just over 12,000, Los Alamitos retains a small-town feel. Today 
</P>
<P>
 An old-fashioned Christmas celebration will be held from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
today and Sunday at the Discovery Museum of Orange County's historic Kellogg 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 Activities at this turn-of-the-century Victorian house will include caroling 
by local choral groups, holiday crafts, prize drawings and refreshments. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is $5 for the general public and free for children 2 and younger. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is at 3101 W. Harvard St. in Santa Ana. Information: (714)

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SIXTH-GRADERS BRING CHEER TO ELDERLY 
SHUT-INS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For some students, school field trips entail visits to zoos or museums, mere 
excuses to goof off and get out of class. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sixth-graders at Good Shepherd Lutheran School in Simi Valley took a 
different sort of trip Friday as they spent the day bringing gifts and 
Christmas cheer to shut-in elderly residents in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by their guitar-strumming teacher Richard Ferrin, 14 boys and one girl 
belted out such holiday classics as "Joy to the World," "We Wish You a Merry 
Christmas" and "Silent Night" at a dozen stops around town. 
</P>
<P>
 At Beverly Residence Home Care Center, elf-designate Karl Rossman, 12, handed 
out red felt stockings stuffed with candy, gloves, soap and toothpaste. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun to be able to come and sing for people who can't get out," Karl 
said. "They might not get too many presents, so this way at least they get 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Carpenter, 70, said she was delighted with the carolers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell my children I got a sock," Carpenter said as she inspected the 
contents of her stocking. "I think they'll get a kick out of that." 
</P>
<P>
 The troupe was accompanied by Simi Valley Police Officer Sterling Johnson and 
his prize-winning German shepherd Charly, who patiently endured a jingle bell 
collar around his neck, antlers strapped on his head and the eager affection of 
carolers and audience alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's used to it," Johnson said of his canine partner. "It's all in a day's 
work." SARA CATANIA

HEAD OF CHINATOWN SOCIAL CLUB SLAIN AFTER MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER Y. HONG and BRETT MAHONEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The president of a Chinatown social club was shot and killed after the group's 
meeting Thursday night, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Toy Lieu, 44, of Baldwin Park was leaving a meeting of the Hop Sing 
Tong, a private club that has been in Chinatown since 1876, when he was shot 
repeatedly in the head by another member about 9:30 p.m., police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Danny Lee, also known as Danny Kit Li Chi, 34, followed Lieu down 
the stairs of the group's three-story building and fired at least seven shots 
from a .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol, striking Lieu as he walked through the 
second floor of the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, of Rosemead, fled and is at large, according to Detective Jim Tiambo of 
the Los Angeles Police Department's Asian crime investigation section. Tiambo 
said a motive has not been determined for the shooting, and that Lee was 
driving a 1989 yellow Isuzu Amigo, with California plates 2RWP156. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieu had worked at the Eldorado casino in Gardena until September, and was a 
well-known gambler who may have been in debt, according to a police source. 
Known in Chinatown for his flashy appearance, Lieu was wearing a four-carat 
diamond ring, a diamond bracelet and a gold Rolex watch and had several 
thousand dollars in his pocket when he was slain, the police source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvin Fong Chao, a member of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Assn., an 
umbrella group for the social clubs, said Lieu came to the United States from 
China more than 30 years ago and once owned a Chinese restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said it is not known whether the shooting was related to events at 
Thursday's meeting. About 20 people attended the meeting to elect new officers, 
at which Lieu won another term as president. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee was not an active member of the group, but occasionally attended meetings, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hop Sing Tong is one of many tongs, also called benevolent associations, 
founded by Chinese immigrants in the second half of the 19th Century. Hop Sing 
Tong began in San Francisco in 1870 and opened its Los Angeles chapter six 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
 During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Chinese immigrants relied 
heavily on groups formed along family or hometown ties to find jobs or places 
to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Tongs served those who did not belong to groups formed by extended families or 
immigrants from a specific part of China. 
</P>
<P>
 The membership and influence of tongs declined by the 1950s as immigrants 
became more settled and discriminatory laws were overturned, transforming the 
groups into largely social clubs.

STATE HELPS COUNTY COLLECT $29 MILLION IN CHILD SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RESPERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A red-tape-slashing partnership between state and Los Angeles County officials 
has netted about $29 million in delinquent child support payments and attracted 
the attention of the President, officials announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, six counties in California have joined a pilot program utilizing the 
state tax agency's database to collect monies from "deadbeat" parents. In those 
counties, a total of $32 million has been collected from more than 100,000 
parents. The amount far exceeds the $14 million officials had predicted at the 
beginning of the one-year program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The absent parents who do not support their children got a rude awakening," 
said Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, whose office enforces child support laws. "The 
children of Los Angeles are $29 million richer because of that rude awakening." 
</P>
<P>
 A bill authored by Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame) helped create 
the program by allowing district attorneys and the state tax board to share 
previously confidential financial information. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said the state can 
collect debts by freezing bank accounts, attaching wages and seizing the assets 
of people who owe child support without having to obtain a court order. "That's 
why the (tax board) can get you so fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Parents who fall behind in child support payments receive letters from the 
state warning them that their assets and property may be seized, state 
Controller Gray Davis said. The $32-million figure does not include money that 
parents paid voluntarily, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state controller plans to meet with President Clinton in Washington early 
next week. White House officials have been following the program's success, he 
said, and are considering launching a similar nationwide program using the 
Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the money collected went to reimburse agencies that provided public 
assistance for children when parents failed to make support payments. The first 
$50 collected from a delinquent parent each month goes to the family caring for 
the children, as does any money collected over the amount owed welfare 
agencies, said Wayne Doss, director of the Bureau of Family Support in the 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Some families have received checks for thousands of dollars because of 
interest accrued on unpaid child support payments, Doss said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only Los Angeles, Fresno, Nevada, Ventura, Santa Clara and Solano 
counties have participated in the program. But there are plans to begin 
integrating more counties next year, officials said.

CONTROLLER URGES CHARGES IN OVERTIME CASE; COURTS: TUTTLE SHARPLY CRITICIZES 
DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR DECISION NOT TO PROSECUTE FORMER CITY OFFICIAL ACCUSED OF 
OVERPAYING HIMSELF $95,000. HE URGES GARCETTI TO PURSUE FORGERY ALLEGATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Controller Rick Tuttle described as "outrageous" a decision by the 
district attorney's office not to file criminal charges against a former top 
city employee who was accused of paying himself nearly $95,000 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle said he will ask Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti to pursue forgery or fraud 
charges against James D. Bisetti, the former chief management analyst in the 
city's General Services Department, which oversees facilities, equipment and 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is quite a bit at stake, including a material amount of money 
and the public trust," Tuttle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bisetti resigned under pressure two years ago after it was disclosed that he 
was paid for 2,376 hours of overtime over 28 months that city officials 
believed he did not work. 
</P>
<P>
 After a protracted review, Garcetti's office concluded that Bisetti had signed 
a subordinate's name to authorize many of the improper payments. That "suggests 
that (Bisetti) intended to defraud the city of overtime pay to which he was not 
entitled," the district attorney's office concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors decided that it would be hard to make the accusations stick 
because one of Bisetti's subordinates told investigators that he believed 
Bisetti was working the extra hours at home, according to a memo describing the 
decision not to pursue the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Bisetti could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The case also led to the suspension last year of Roger Huseby, the subordinate 
who authorized many of the overtime payments and whose signature Bisetti was 
also suspected of forging. 
</P>
<P>
 The case also helped propel a citywide review of overtime payments to city 
employees, which found that 6% of the work force collected more than $15,000 a 
year in payments. Controls on the payments were often lax. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuttle asked department heads to keep a tighter rein on the payments. To 
prevent a recurrence of the Bisetti case -- in which General Manager Randall 
Bacon said he knew nothing about the payments -- Tuttle reports to all 
department heads on employees who receive more than $5,000 in overtime a year.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; JUDGE RESTRICTS DOCTOR'S PRACTICE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley cardiologist accused of having sex with a patient to whom he had 
illegally prescribed drugs was ordered Friday to stop treating women younger 
than 45 and to stop treating any patients for drug addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The prohibitions issued by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Joseph R. Kalin 
were the first disciplinary actions to take effect on Don Alan Lee, who also 
has an office in Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee's lawyer, Rex Beaber, said his client was pleased with the judge's 
decision because it allows the doctor to continue treating the elderly heart 
patients with whom he now works. 
</P>
<P>
 The state medical board, which investigated Lee, ruled in September that the 
doctor's license should be revoked effective Dec. 21. A judge Thursday 
postponed the revocation until Dec. 30, and Friday Kalin granted Lee another 
month's reprieve, until Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 On that date, Kalin will consider whether Lee's license should be revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 The state medical board found that Lee had sex with Ellen A. Cleary and 
illegally prescribed her drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleary was slain in 1990 after her boyfriend, Timothy J. Velasco, found her in 
bed with Lee. Velasco was later convicted of first-degree murder. IRA E. STOLL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; BINGE NO CAUSE FOR LENIENCY, JUDGE 
RULES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Newbury Park man with a 10-year history of alcohol-related crimes was 
sentenced Friday to five years in prison for trying to rape two elderly women 
while on a drinking binge. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. brushed aside defense suggestions 
that David Paul Stewart be treated leniently because he cannot control his 
drinking.While Stewart, 33, is no threat to others when he is sober, he chose 
to drink even though he knew it would get him into trouble, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He decided whether he would drink alcohol or not," Campbell said. "No one 
made him drink those drinks. No one ordered those drinks for him. . . . He made 
that decision and he's responsible for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart pleaded guilty in September to two counts of assault with intent to 
commit rape in connection with attacks on two women, ages 87 and 73, after 
breaking into their Thousand Oaks apartments in May. 
</P>
<P>
 At a June 30 preliminary hearing, the older victim said she fought Stewart off 
by hitting him repeatedly with a telephone. The 73-year-old woman said the 
defendant came into her bedroom about 2:30 a.m., touched her and tried to kiss 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 At the sentencing, several people spoke on Stewart's behalf and said his 
problems were the result of his drinking. Defense attorney Barry Post told 
Campbell that Stewart "needs treatment, not punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 But Campbell noted that Stewart did not get treatment when he was placed on 
probation in 1989 after his third drunk-driving conviction. Stewart was sent to 
prison for violating the terms of his probation, and when he got out he began 
drinking again, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an adult -- he's been an adult for a long time," Campbell said. "He has 
to take responsibility for his actions." BARBARA MURPHY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MOLESTATION VICTIM'S FEAR CITED BY 
MOTHER 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Christmas wish for a door alarm, written on a list of what otherwise were 
toys, is evidence of the fear a mentally disabled Simi Valley woman feels after 
being molested by a nurse's aide while in the hospital, her mother told a judge 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother, speaking on behalf of her 31-year-old daughter who has the mental 
capacity of an 8-year-old, asked that Victor E. Sumner be sentenced to the 
maximum term for molesting three female patients at Simi Valley Hospital on his 
first day of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Also addressing Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. 
was a 73-year-old victim, who says she now stays in her mobile home with the 
curtains closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before this ordeal I was a very independent person," said the elderly woman, 
speaking from a wheelchair. "After this experience, I am intimidated at the 
sight of strangers and no longer open my door." 
</P>
<P>
 Sumner was scheduled to be sentenced Friday for his conviction on two counts 
of sexual battery and one charge of penetrating the disabled woman with his 
finger. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing was postponed because Sumner, who acted as his own attorney at 
trial, said he had hired a lawyer who could not be in court Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressing irritation at the delay, Campbell offered to hear the victims' 
statements so they would not have to return to court for the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Representing two of the three victims at the hearing was attorney Gloria 
Allred, who told Campbell that "the hospital system failed to protect them from 
a criminal in their midst." 
</P>
<P>
 The disabled woman's mother said her daughter has changed since the attack 
from happy and outgoing to angry and fearful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even her Christmas list reflects her fears," the mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My heart fell when I read the words 'door alarm' in the midst of requests 
such as the Muppet Christmas tape, and a music box." BARBARA MURPHY

 Tired of paying $300 for a $125 answering machine and $24.45 for computer 
diskettes that retail at $6.59, the Los Angeles City Council on Friday took the 
first step to becoming a smarter buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 12 to 0 to place a measure on the April ballot to sweep 
away a series of costly and cumbersome City Charter restrictions on the city's 
system for purchasing supplies and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The reformers, led by Councilman Joel Wachs and encouraged by Mayor Richard 
Riordan, contend that the overhaul of the purchasing system -- which will also 
require a series of mayoral directives and council-approved ordinances to 
implement -- will save the city about $70 million a year. The city currently 
spends about $750 million a year on supplies and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will dramatically reform the city's antiquated purchasing system," Wachs 
promised at a news conference Friday where he unveiled the highly technical 
charter amendment plan. 
</P>
<P>
 To enliven the subject, Wachs brandished a giant 750-watt light bulb and 
asked: "How many city employees does it take to screw in a light bulb?" The 
answer, he said: "One to screw it in; 29 to purchase it." 
</P>
<P>
 More than two dozen sections of the City Charter would be affected by the 
measure. The amendments would, for example, permit the city to negotiate the 
bid price on purchases, remove the panoply of bureaucratic approvals now 
required for a department to enter into any contract of $500 or more and, in 
recognition of the computer age, allow the city to eliminate the paper trail 
and electronically pay its invoices and advertise for bids on computer bulletin 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 One big saving would come by enabling the city to piggyback its purchases with 
those of other government agencies to get volume discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the city currently buys its gasoline from petroleum distributors 
and pays the middleman's markup. However, if the city and county of Los Angeles 
joined forces, they could buy gasoline directly from refineries, saving money 
in the process, said Bob Jenson, a management analyst in the city's Department 
of General Services. 
</P>
<P>
 But the charter now forbids the city to participate in such a joint bid 
because the county contracts are negotiated, not competitively bid, Jenson 
said. The proposed charter amendments would change that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is believed that, by consolidating its purchasing power with other 
governmental agencies, the city will save at least 1.5% of our total purchases, 
or $10.5 million," according to a recent city report signed by city purchasing 
agent Randall Bacon. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also expects to save $8.5 million by paying its vendors more quickly. 
Now it may take weeks for the city to pay a vendor because of a cumbersome and 
often duplicative accounting process. By being slow to pay, the city cannot get 
the discounts many vendors offer to customers who pay their bills early, 
usually by electronic transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, if the city gained a reputation of paying quickly, it would induce more 
vendors to compete for city business. The increased competition alone would 
save the city $9.5 million, according Bacon's report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our system makes vendors jump through so many hoops that they don't want to 
do business with the city," Riordan said. The loser is finally the city, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the reform package would enable the city to do some after-bid price 
negotiations with vendors to replace its present rigid competitive bid method 
of buying. "Now when we open the sealed bids, it's over," Jenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be able to throw the three best bidders in a room and say 'Here's 
what you guys bid, now really give us your best price," Jenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the reforms will do away with controls originally erected to protect 
the city against fraud and favoritism in the awarding of purchase contracts. 
Still, Rick Tuttle, the city's controller, said Friday he was satisfied that 
enough controls would remain to keep the system honest.

A PIPE DREAM COMES TRUE IN FULLERTON; PRESERVATION: A TEAM OF VOLUNTEERS IS 
RESTORING AND INTRODUCING COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY TO A WURLITZER ORGAN AT PLUMMER 
AUDITORIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to old movie theater organs, Bob Trousdale's passion for music, 
technology and nostalgia combine like notes in a resounding chord. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's not surprising that when Trousdale finished a yearlong contract in 
1993 to electronically upgrade the powerful Wurlitzer at historic Plummer 
Auditorium, he decided to work for free on other aspects of the pipe organ's 
restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 This volunteer effort is in its 16th month. And Trousdale, who heads a team of 
16 fellow volunteers, shows no signs of abandoning the exacting task of fully 
restoring the historic organ owned by the Fullerton Joint Union High School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous job," he said, "and it was obvious the school couldn't 
afford it. That's when we decided to go volunteer. We're just having a ball." 
</P>
<P>
 George West, the school district's assistant superintendent of business 
services, said that without Trousdale, the complete restoration would not 
happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the district's point of view, we were able to save what we consider a 
national treasure -- there are only one or two organs like it operating in the 
United States," West said. "We wouldn't have been able to do it without 
Trousdale's love for the organ." 
</P>
<P>
 Trousdale's bid of roughly $42,000 to restore the Wurlitzer was about $200,000 
below the other bids, West said. And after the contract was completed, 
Trousdale and other members of the Orange County Theatre Organ Society have put 
in "hundreds and hundreds of hours" of volunteer work, West said, with the only 
expense to the district being $10,000 for parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like a child to them," West said. 
</P>
<P>
 The organ made its concert premiere in 1930, the same year the auditorium was 
dedicated. But this "rather clumsy instrument" was hampered by ineffective pipe 
work, Trousdale said, and a poor overall design that kept it from being either 
a true theater organ or a classic church organ. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its limitations, the instrument was rarely played at public 
gatherings over the years, with the exception of school commencements and 
similar activities. However, new life was finally pumped into the organ with 
the 1992-93 renovation of Plummer Auditorium, which is owned by the school 
district and listed in the National Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton Redevelopment Agency paid $2.6 million to expand, air-condition 
and modernize the 1,313-seat auditorium at Chapman Avenue and Lemon Street. 
Funding to revamp the organ's electronics was provided by the school district's 
Educational Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 70-year-old Santa Ana resident, who has a master's degree in electrical 
engineering, retired from the aerospace industry in 1976 to pursue his love of 
pipe organs on a full-time basis. Through his Trousdale Organ Co., he designs 
and builds electronic systems for the instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Trousdale and his volunteers are immersed in the Herculean effort of 
putting new leather on hundreds of the Wurlitzer's pneumatic devices, and 
disassembling, cleaning, reassembling and sometimes shortening many of the 
2,400 pipes, which range from half an inch to 16 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers are also adjusting the pitch, tone and volume of the pipes, and 
adding new sounds -- many of them electronically synthesized -- to expand the 
organ's versatility. Properly tuning the pipes requires a lot of experience, 
Trousdale said, but not many tools. He routinely uses a table knife to make the 
delicate adjustments. 
</P>
<P>
 Built to re-create all the sounds of a pit orchestra, Plummer's organ has four 
manuals (keyboards), about 260 stop keys, and 29 ranks (sets) of pipes. The 
wood and metal pipes, housed in three chambers built into the auditorium's 
walls and ceiling, can produce everything from piercing high notes to 
room-rattling bass. 
</P>
<P>
 "This organ's got a lot of sock to it," Trousdale said, as the auditorium 
rumbled from the sound of a tuba horn. "You can go from extremely soft to 
ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can almost get any sound you could imagine," Trousdale added, as he 
showed off the organ's intimidating array of features. "You have to be an 
airline pilot to play this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing his briefing, Trousdale opened a cabinet in back and revealed a 
piece of equipment unheard of in the 1930s -- a personal computer with a color 
monitor. On the screen was a representation of the organ's manuals and pedals. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a software program designed by Trousdale, the organ can now be played 
"just like a tape recorder" to re-create previous concerts, note for note. 
There is also a "jukebox" mode for playing individual songs in any sequence. 
The music can even be played backward, for reasons that are probably clear only 
to techno-types such as Trousdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to explain his intense devotion to pipe organs, Trousdale chuckled, then 
told of being psychologically addicted to the marvelous instruments that were 
swept aside decades ago when the "talkies" took hold in movie theaters and 
there was no longer a need for musical accompaniment for silent films. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a fascination for Harley-Davidson motorcycles," he said, "there's a 
fascination for old cars, for historical stuff, for steam trains, model trains, 
etc., etc. And there's a fascination for theater organs. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it is a disease," he said. "Once you catch it, you can't get rid of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it is an incredible challenge technically. This is where my real 
interest is, in taking an instrument like this and making it perform." 
</P>
<P>
 Trousdale predicts the renovation will be completed by April. But, of course, 
there's always routine maintenance to be performed, and minor improvements to 
be made as he and the other volunteers "add a cymbal here, a gizmo there." 
</P>
<P>
 "We will probably never really finish it," Trousdale said. "It's like 
Disneyland."

 The Christmas season brings unconventional, as well as traditional, 
expressions of good will toward men. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the pastor, congregants and friends of Crescent Heights United 
Methodist Church will go bar-hopping Dec. 24 to recruit participants for a 
11:59 p.m. Christmas Eve service. 
</P>
<P>
 Located at the corner of Fairfax and Fountain avenues since 1914, Crescent 
Heights United Methodist is the last remaining mainline Protestant church in 
West Hollywood. The Rev. Tom Griffith, the church's pastor since 1988, said, 
"Christmas is a very lonely time for a lot of people in this town. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a community with a concentration of single people, some of whom are 
homosexual," he said. "Often, they are far from their families, or even shunned 
by them." 
</P>
<P>
 And so, for the sixth consecutive year, Griffith will lead a band of people 
down Santa Monica Boulevard, where bars and restaurants are open on Christmas 
Eve. "We go in and quickly pass out 'complimentary tickets' to our service and 
personally invite each person we meet. No one is pressured. If they want to 
come, they come. If they don't, they don't." 
</P>
<P>
 The church also will host around-the-clock meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous 
from 3 p.m. Dec. 24, to 10 p.m. Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each year, at least one person tells me that the only reason he or she went 
to a bar that night was to avoid being home alone," Griffith said. Last year, 
he said, 60 people came to worship at midnight -- "a phenomenal turnout for 
West Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who would like to join the group in "bar-hopping" and at the midnight 
worship may come to the church at 7866 W. Fountain Ave., at 8:30 p.m. on 
Christmas Eve. Wear a warm jacket and comfortable walking shoes. For more 
information, phone (213) 656-5336. 
</P>
<P>
 * About a mile away from the church, at the Jewish Community Building, the 
Jewish Federation Council is organizing volunteers to help those who would 
otherwise be alone on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Volunteer Day is the brainchild of two organizations of the Jewish 
Federation -- its community relations committee, which works with various 
ethnic communities, and Access, a program for Jewish adults between the ages of 
25 and 40. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since Christmas is a national holiday, many Jews find themselves with an 
extra day off," said event co-chairwoman Irene Weibel. "Rather than just go to 
the movies, we wanted a way to be involved in this national day of giving, by 
doing something productive for our city and fellow citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will meet at 9 a.m. Dec. 25, share a light breakfast and pick up 
their assignments -- which will include delivering food to AIDS patients for 
Project Angel Food, painting and landscaping a retirement home and food pantry, 
and working on crafts projects with runaway teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone will return to headquarters by 2 p.m. for snacks and socializing. All 
volunteers will receive a two-for-one movie coupon from the Laemmle Theaters. 
Anyone is welcome to participate in Community Volunteer Day. Register for a job 
assignment by phoning (213) 683-3433 no later than Wednesday. PERFORMANCES

HOLIDAY GIVING NOT KEEPING PACE WITH NEED, CHARITIES SAY; AID: THIS IS 
TRADITIONALLY THE PEAK SEASON FOR DONATIONS, BUT GROUPS ARE CAUGHT BETWEEN A 
RISING DEMAND FOR SERVICES AND THE ECONOMIC WORRIES OF MIDDLE-CLASS 
CONTRIBUTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With Christmas only one week away, charitable groups from Virginia to 
California are feeling the familiar pressures of the holiday season: a 
reluctance among donors to open their wallets, coupled with an increase in 
demand among the needy for services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have gone into the holidays in the worst shape we've been in for years," 
said Stephen Burger, executive director of the International Union of Gospel 
Missions, the umbrella organization of inner-city rescue missions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the missions we've heard from are going into the holidays with 
donations down 15 to 20%," Burger said. ". . . Last year, the holiday season 
did save us. This year, the jury is still out." 
</P>
<P>
 The period between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day traditionally is when many 
charities receive most of their donations. But officials from large and small 
agencies -- from the Salvation Army to local family shelters -- are reporting 
concern over their ability to balance rising demands with the level of 
charitable giving. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been some good signs during this holiday period: More businesses 
are adopting schools, preparing holiday baskets or collecting toys and canned 
goods. And more individuals are donating money and time now that they believe 
the economy is improving. 
</P>
<P>
 But around the country, it is not clear whether the recovery can keep pace 
with the increasing need. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Southern California, the Lutheran Social Service's Refugee and 
Immigration Service had to shut down its immigrant counseling service for lack 
of funds because contributions have been diverted to earthquake and other 
natural-disaster relief. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Grand Rapids, Mich., Salvation Army Col. William Roberts reports that all 
initiatives his group funds -- from emergency shelters to substance-abuse 
programs -- will "take a small hit" next year because collections are not 
keeping pace with needs. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Alexandria, Va., the national Salvation Army reported a 5.6% drop in mall 
and street corner cash donations in the first week of its annual kettle drive. 
Meanwhile, the group has seen a 6% increase in the number of people seeking 
help over the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are at a point in the Christmas season where we can see a downward trend 
in the giving pattern," said Col. Leon Ferraez, the Salvation Army's national 
communications secretary. "This year we anticipate helping 7.4 million people. 
There is a real concern we may not meet the needs of the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferraez said that while non-holiday giving has risen for the Salvation Army, 
cash donations since Thanksgiving have suffered. He believes the reason is 
economic uncertainty among the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, the economy is good," he said, "but many people, average working people, 
are not keeping up. There're a lot of new jobs, but they're all at minimum 
wage. Both people have to work and that makes it hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Independent Sector, a national alliance of philanthropic 
groups, blamed Americans' sense of economic insecurity for an estimated 11% 
drop in giving over the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 In Grand Rapids, the Salvation Army's Roberts said the main reason for the 
decline in holiday cash donations was a decision by a major retailer to bar 
bell-ringing volunteers from its store properties. Despite an increase in mail 
contributions, Roberts expects need to outstrip donations. 
</P>
<P>
 One group that claims an increase in donations is United Way of America, the 
Alexandria, Va.-based umbrella group for local United Ways across the country. 
The national group is recovering from a widely publicized management scandal 
that had reduced giving in many locales.

POPE MOVES TO RESOLVE HOLOCAUST BLAME

<P>
 As Pope John Paul II charts the course for the Catholic Church in the coming 
millennium, he is preparing to resolve a painful but significant chapter of 
this century -- the Church's conduct toward Jews during the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past seven years, the Pope and the Vatican have consulted with 
scholars from around the world to address what remains one of the most 
troubling events of modern times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope, who witnessed the Holocaust in Poland and has characterized it as a 
personal tragedy, is expected to make a final determination next year on the 
controversial and complicated relationship between the Church and European 
Jews, 50 years after the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 By most accounts, the task will not be easy. What's more, even a definitive 
word will surely not be the last on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to resolve the volatile question comes as the relationship between 
Jews and the Church is improving. A year ago, diplomatic ties were established 
between the Vatican and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite what they consider some questionable diplomatic moves by the Vatican, 
many Jewish leaders have expressed fondness for the Pope, who refers to Jews in 
his recently published book, "Crossing the Threshold of Hope," as "our elder 
brothers in the faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Tullia Zevi, president of Italy's Jewish Community, called the Pope 
"courageous" for undertaking the study and said, "In my opinion, he has been 
very positive for our improved relations. He's a Pole and you feel like he has 
seen it all." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Karol Wojtyla and reared in Wadowice, near the Czech border -- where 
2,000 of the 9,000 residents were Jewish -- he witnessed deportations and the 
death of friends. He lived in the shadow of Auschwitz, which, he wrote, "To 
this day . . . does not cease to admonish, reminding us that anti-Semitism is a 
great sin against humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 He has expressed revulsion over the genocide and acknowledged the "sinfulness" 
among some Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Pope has remained silent on the red-hot question -- whether the Roman 
Catholic Church was responsible for sowing an atmosphere of hate against the 
Jews, in which its followers and servants found comfort and justification. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of which way the Pope will turn is playing out among church 
leaders who are deeply divided over how, or even whether, to address this 
issue. At the center of the vast and polarized landscape of opinion stands Pope 
John Paul II, whose personal views and experiences are clear but for whom the 
epoch will require passing judgment on the church he leads. 
</P>
<P>
 Many German and Polish clerics, who, like the Polish-born Pope, witnessed the 
Holocaust, strongly promote a confession of guilt. Other Europeans and 
officials in the Vatican bureaucracy known as the curia, oppose a blanket 
condemnation. They say there is no proof that the Church actively supported or 
sympathized with the Nazis and contend that the Vatican worked to halt the 
genocide. 
</P>
<P>
 Agreement can be found on one point -- untold numbers of Catholics risked 
their livelihood and their lives to save Jewish friends, neighbors and 
strangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that Catholics risked their lives," said Norbert 
Greinacher, a leading German Catholic theologian. "But for the official church 
in the mainstream this was not true." 
</P>
<P>
 Greinacher said anti-Semitic sermons were a mainstay in churches during the 
war and prayers against the Jews for the killing of Jesus often fed the flames 
of hatred. He noted that Catholic bishops in Germany and Poland were openly 
hostile to Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 But Robert Graham, a Jesuit priest in Rome who has studied the Church's 
behavior during the war years, contends that time has blurred reality. The 
Vatican was responsive to requests by Jewish groups to help end persecution, he 
said. It sought visas for Jews and helped to plan escape routes and hiding 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the big Jewish organizations were involved with the Vatican and were 
greatly appreciative," he said. "I find it unfair that there's a systematic 
blindness to the Vatican's role during that time. There was a lot of goodwill 
toward the Vatican then." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, some of the most vocal critics of the Church's behavior during the war 
are not Jewish groups but Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 A working paper on the subject prepared by a German theologian said the Church 
was partly responsible for the Holocaust. The paper was undertaken at church 
request, but caused a sensation when it was leaked to the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepared by Hans Herman Henrix, of the Catholic Theological Institute in 
Aachen, Germany, the paper said: "Despite the exemplary behavior of some 
individuals and groups, we were nevertheless as a whole a church community who 
kept on living their lives in turning their back too often on the fate of this 
persecuted Jewish people . . . and who remained silent about the crimes 
committed against the Jews and Judaism." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vatican immediately distanced itself from the study, saying it was a 
project of the German Bishops' Conference and the Polish Bishops' Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 But Henrix said the Pope has been supportive of the project, which is expected 
to be completed in 1995. "I have not lost confidence that the result of this 
process will be helpful to the relationship of the Church and the Jewish 
community," he said.

'WHO'S WHO' STAYS HEAVILY PROTESTANT; OTHER GROUPS GAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite gains by Jews and Catholics, mainline Protestants still make up a far 
larger share of the elite of American social, business and political circles 
than their percentage in the population at large, a study shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Episcopalians, Presbyterians and United Church of Christ members -- together 
less than 5% of Americans -- account for more than a third of the people in 
"Who's Who in America" who listed a religious affiliation, the Purdue 
University study found. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers compared religious affiliation and secular eminence from 1930 
to 1992, finding that Jews and Roman Catholics have made gains. 
</P>
<P>
 "But contrary to popular opinion, the change is relatively small," said 
sociologist James Davidson, who led the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you stepped into a board meeting of a business giant, our research shows 
that you still would find several Episcopalians, a few Presbyterians, probably 
a Jew and a Catholic, and no Baptists." 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers Ralph Pyle, David Reyes and Davidson compared information from a 
1930 study of individuals reporting their religious affiliation in "Who's Who" 
with their own study of religious affiliation reported in the 1992-1993 
edition. The 1930 study covered all the people listed; the 1992 study randomly 
selected one of every 20. From that group of 4,018 people, 1,380 reported a 
religious affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
 There are significant limits to the research, including the fact that only 34% 
of the people listed in 1992 reported a religious affiliation, compared to 56% 
in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pyle, noting that nearly 100 scholarly analyses have used "Who's Who" to 
create a profile of America's leaders in politics, the arts, business, 
education and other influential professions, said it is "probably the best 
source we have that looks at the religious affiliation of elites." 
</P>
<P>
 Jews, who in 1930 accounted for about 1% of the nation's leading figures, now 
make up more than 12% of those who gave a religious affiliation, despite being 
only 2% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
 Lutherans jumped from 2% of the elite to 6%. And Catholics, who in 1930 were 
4% of "Who's Who" profiles with a religious identification, now occupy 23%, 
only slightly less than their percentage of the U.S. population. 
</P>
<P>
 But Episcopalians, Presbyterians and members of the United Church of Christ -- 
all leading denominations of the old Protestant establishment -- retained 
disproportionate representation among the nation's elite, despite the fact that 
membership in those denominations has declined in recent decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means that these groups continue to influence the way of life in 
America," Davidson said. "Denominational and religious family boundaries 
continue to be important factors in people's life chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Others observers said the findings appeared accurate, but place greater 
emphasis on the growing influence of other religious bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 America today would not blink twice at a Jewish anchorman or a Jewish person 
holding high public office, said sociologist Steven Bayme of the American 
Jewish Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The story of the last 40 years is, I think, the opening up of America," Bayme 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologist William McKinney of Hartford Seminary in Connecticut said the 
study reveals a long-term change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mainline Protestants still exercise disproportionate power, but they do so 
much less than they used to," McKinney said. "The long-term pattern is one of a 
good deal more variety."

FOOD DRIVE TO HELP NEEDY ALL YEAR; VENTURA: THE INCREASING SUCCESS OF CHEERS 
FOR CHILDREN ALLOWS THE EXPRESSION OF GOODWILL TO GO ON AFTER THE HOLIDAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Separating canned beans from beets and setting packaged noodles apart from 
rice, dozens of volunteers worked Friday to continue a 42-year-old Ventura 
school district tradition of preparing holiday food baskets for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year will be a little different: The charity will continue after 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 With the amount of food and money donated by district students and staff 
growing every year, organizers of the annual Cheers for Children drive have 
decided to extend the goodwill effort year round. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the drive began in 1952, the number of food items collected by children 
from all 24 schools has grown to about 55,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And Cheers for Children's bank account is bulging with a reserve of about 
$5,000, sponsors say. 
</P>
<P>
 All that is more than is needed for the 350 food baskets volunteers are 
putting together this weekend to deliver Christmas Eve to some of the poorer 
families in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 So this year, leftover groceries will go into storage and the extra money will 
be set aside for making food baskets for students who are victims of house 
fires, financial setbacks or other emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a school knows a family is in need in November or in April for whatever 
reason, if there's a crisis . . . it is an extra resource to give to parents," 
said Sheridan Way School Principal Trudy Arriaga, who has headed the drive for 
years. "That money is doing nobody any good sitting in a bank account." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and other school employees donate money to buy hams for each food 
basket. But most of the food comes from the children. And for many students, 
the charity drive has grown into a good-natured competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Collecting jars of applesauce, cans of peas and other foods from neighbors or 
their own pantries, children vie for their classes or schools to be the best at 
bringing in the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Balboa Middle School was No. 1, with students there collecting 
10,504 items of food, more than nine items per student and a record for any 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 The really difficult part of the food drive may not be in gathering the goods, 
but sorting them. 
</P>
<P>
 As volunteers worked Friday, separating foods by type to prepare for packing 
the charity baskets today, some had trouble deciding where to put what. 
</P>
<P>
 While most donations are staples like noodles, beans and rice, many others 
defy categorization: a large box of powdered diet drink, a jar of Oriental plum 
sauce and cans of sardines. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are these?" 11-year-old Tyler Harris asked, as he held up a small can to 
an older volunteer. The food turned out to be stuffed vine leaves, apparently 
imported from Greece. But that didn't help Tyler, who still didn't know which 
table to put it on. 
</P>
<P>
 So he put the can back where he found it, and turned his attention to peanut 
butter and Cheerios.

MAN IS SHOT TO DEATH IN HIS BALBOA COVES HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 55-year-old retiree was shot and killed in his home in the Balboa Coves 
gated community, investigators said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 William Francis McLaughlin died of several gunshot wounds about 9 p.m. 
Thursday, Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police had no suspects. No other information was being released because it 
might jeopardize the investigation, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the last time they saw 
McLaughlin was at a Christmas party last weekend, when he appeared in good 
spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 A next-door neighbor of 20 years described McLaughlin as someone who took very 
good care of himself and his family. He often jogged around the boardwalk, and 
neighbors often saw him with his arm around his son, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before retiring, McLaughlin operated a lucrative medical supply company, 
selling it several years ago, a neighbor said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I talked to him, he had asked me what I wanted for Christmas," 
he said. "He was a very nice person, and very strong." ORANGE COUNTY

MAN TAPED BEATING DOG GETS PROBATION; COURTS: THE CHARGE IS REDUCED TO A 
MISDEMEANOR AND A FINE IS IMPOSED. HE WOULD HAVE LOST HIS JOB IF CONVICTED OF A 
FELONY.

 A Fountain Valley man who was captured on videotape abusing a young dog was 
sentenced Friday to three years' probation and ordered to pay $850 in 
restitution and a donation to a local animal shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Luis A. Cardenas also reduced Richard 
Eugene Griffith Jr.'s felony conviction on an animal abuse charge to a 
misdemeanor, after learning the defendant, who has a child with a kidney 
ailment, would lose his job and medical insurance if convicted of a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith, 36, was arrested in May after a neighbor's videotape allegedly 
showed Griffith beating the dog, whose mouth was taped shut, with a garden 
tool. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Mark N. Phillips had contended that his client taped the 
dog's mouth shut after it nipped his child and that he was striking the dog to 
discipline it. He also said the dog did not suffer serious injuries. Phillips 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1-year-old dog, named Jazzy, has since been placed with another family 
that wants to adopt it, said Deputy Dist. Atty. James Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said he wanted Griffith sentenced to community service. But the 
judge had a variety of circumstances to consider in the case, including 
Griffith's lack of a criminal record, the recommendations of friends in the 
community and his child's illness, Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at the videotape and the behavior is horrific, but it seemed like 
everyone who knew him thought he was the greatest guy in the world," Hicks 
said. "Even the neighbor (who videotaped him) didn't want him to go to jail." 
</P>
<P>
 "(The defense) said this was just an aberration, so the judge is giving him 
the chance to prove this was just a onetime thing," Hicks said. He added that 
the provision of Griffith's sentence will require frequent checks with the 
Orange County Probation Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith must also pay a $500 donation to an animal shelter and about $350 to 
pay for the costs of removing the animal from the home and caring for it.

I'LL SEE YOUR TAX CUT, RAISE YOU A TAX CUT; BUT DOES TRANSPARENT POLITICS MAKE 
FOR GOOD ECONOMICS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tax cuts have become the rage in Washington since the November elections. Now 
there's even dueling tax cuts. First it was the Republicans with their 
"contract with America." Then, on Thursday, President Clinton put forth his 
version in a brisk but chockablock address to the nation. Now Rep. Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.), the next House minority leader, and Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.), 
a presidential contender, each have put out tax cut proposals of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely looks like America is going to wind up with some kind of tax cut, even 
though a lot of economic experts -- even some in the Clinton Administration -- 
question whether this is what the nation needs now. Clinton's "middle-class 
bill of rights," the Republicans' "contract" and the other plans all raise a 
common question: How can the proposed tax cuts, spread over five years, be 
offset by real reductions in federal spending? The worry is that in the 
partisan competition to cut taxes, deficit reduction will be shoved to the 
side. Deficit reduction should remain a top priority; after all, it's working. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid Washington's fever, a number of concerns must be addressed. Here are a 
few of them: 
</P>
<P>
 FINANCING THE CUTS: Clinton's plan would cost $60 billion in lost revenues 
over its first five years, compared to $147 billion over five years for the 
Republican plan, which includes a capital gains tax cut. These must be made up 
by comparable excisions elsewhere in the discretionary portion of the budget. 
Good luck. 
</P>
<P>
 THE ECONOMIC TIMING: With the economy recovering rather nicely, do we need a 
tax cut now? A Wall Street Journal/NBC poll found 58% to 38% think reducing the 
deficit is more important than cutting taxes. Why not simply cut spending and 
apply those savings to reduce the deficit? 
</P>
<P>
 THE INFLATION FACTOR: Might a tax cut, assuming taxes are reduced more than a 
few hundred dollars per family, fuel spending and thus inflation? That in turn 
might prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term interest rates yet again. 
Oh please, no. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT MIDDLE CLASS?: What precisely is the middle class these days? Clinton's 
child credit would apply to families with incomes up to $75,000. The Republican 
child credit would apply to families with incomes of up to $200,000. This may 
be too high in some regions, or not high enough in others, such as in 
California or New York. 
</P>
<P>
 THE NUMBERS GAME: Is this just about creative math? Are tax cuts the same old 
Washington political game with merely a new theme? The President insisted in 
his Thursday night address, "This is not about politics as usual." Clinton's 
campaign promises were threefold: deficit reduction, tax cuts and investment in 
education and training. He delivered on the first and he now wants to do the 
same on the other two, especially with the reelection showdown only two years 
down the road. The Republicans too have their eye on the White House; their 
"contract with America" helped them take over Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The public is skeptical and angry. It wants to get the American house in 
order, but it is sick and tired of phony promises. With both sides of the 
political aisle offering the elixir of tax cuts, wise voters should pause and 
ask the hard question: Is all this tax cut stuff too good to be true? If the 
answer is yes, maybe it's the wrong move at the wrong time.

CHECHNYA: YES, IT'S AN INTERNAL MATTER; WASHINGTON NEEDS TO HOPE FOR A QUICK 
AND HUMANE END TO THIS UGLY LITTLE CONFLICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wars of 19th-Century imperial Russia go on. In the northern Caucasus, 
Russian tanks and troops are besieging tiny, mountainous Chechnya, home to 
perhaps 1.2 million Sunni Muslims who speak their own language, cherish their 
own culture, and -- despite frightful oppression in the past -- keep alive a 
fierce determination to be independent of Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 That hope is probably not realizable. It's the fate of the Chechens to have 
settled a thousand years ago in an area that proved to be rich in oil. That oil 
and the pipelines that have been built to carry it to market make Chechnya an 
economic plum that no Russian government would be prepared willingly to give 
up. Further, no Russian government would likely agree to accept Chechenya's 
independence out of a well-justified fear that the precedent could inspire half 
a dozen other non-Russian areas to similarly demand separation from the 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this, President Boris N. Yeltsin has come under strong domestic 
criticism for his handling of the crisis. And Friday, after nearly a week of 
fighting, he was faced with the threat from one of his generals of a mutiny in 
the field. At this remove it's hard to say whether the showdown precipitated by 
the 1991 declaration of independence by the local Chechen leader, Dzokhar 
Dudayev, could have been handled with greater finesse and effectiveness. 
Yeltsin has given the Chechen rebels a deadline for surrendering that expires 
today. But the evident reluctance of at least some of the Russian army to 
continue fighting raises questions about what Yeltsin could do if his deadline 
is ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Moscow has turned up the volume on its propaganda war against 
Chechenya. Chechens are one among many distinct ethnic groups visibly 
identified with the crime wave that has been running all but out of control 
across Russia since communism's collapse. Now the government has issued a 
catalogue of felonies attributing to Chechens terrorism, hostage-taking, 
hijacking, swindling and counterfeiting. At the same time the government has 
tried to assure concerned Muslim states that there's nothing anti-Islamic in 
its effort to quash the rebellion. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's line has been to say almost nothing about the Chechnya conflict, 
referring to it as an internal matter. In this case it won't criticize Moscow 
nor will it -- as it certainly would have in earlier years -- praise the fight 
for self-determination by a valiant small people. Unhappily, in light of the 
geopolitical stakes involved and especially the U.S. interest in keeping Russia 
stable and Yeltsin in office, Washington is probably right. About the best that 
can be hoped for now is a quick and humane end to this ugly little conflict.

NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your editorial (Dec. 4) was an excellent survey of the continued threat of 
additional states obtaining nuclear weapons and the role of the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in preventing this. But your statement that the 
NPT "seeks to freeze at five the number of states that have nuclear weapons" 
may lead some readers to believe that the treaty authorizes indefinite 
possession of nuclear weapons by the five original nuclear weapons states. A 
subsequent reference to "full nuclear disarmament" only implies that the five 
countries must give up their nuclear weapons. Indeed the NPT clearly calls for 
nuclear disarmament by all states. 
</P>
<P>
 But during the 30 years of the treaty there has been virtually no discussion 
of nuclear disarmament. The irrational nuclear arms race occurred and so many 
nuclear bombs were built that even after the bilateral U.S.-Russian START I and 
II and the INF agreements to reduce nuclear weapons are completed there will 
still be more strategic nuclear bombs than before the NPT. The recently 
announced conclusions of the U.S. nuclear policy review include keeping 6,000 
nuclear bombs and finding new uses for them. 
</P>
<P>
 It would not be surprising if many readers believe that the 164 countries that 
have signed the NPT approve of our continued possession of nuclear weapons. 
Your editorial notes that even most experts feel we should keep a "light 
missile shield" to deter nuclear weapons proliferation despite their 
near-unanimous support of the NPT. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important for U.S. citizens to know that top U.S. generals have stated 
that nuclear weapons have no military usefulness, even as a deterrent against 
those of other nations; our overwhelming non-nuclear military superiority makes 
them unnecessary. An important action we should take is to affirm our 
compliance with the NPT by announcing a date for initiating negotiations for 
international nuclear disarmament. This would help dissuade other nations from 
obtaining nuclear weapons.

SCHOOL VANDALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over Thanksgiving weekend, 11 classrooms at my school were broken into. As I 
was cleaning up splattered paint, strewn papers and the water from my emergency 
kit, it seemed too familiar.In the eight years I have worked at Valerio Street 
School my classroom has been broken into five times. If this was someone's home 
would it be tolerated? Besides home, school is where children spend most of 
their time. How should they feel if their classroom is violated? It makes me 
feel very angry. There are so many things that are making teachers angry these 
days. Burglaries are just another straw on the back of overburdened teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time I worked after school helping students across the crosswalk. I 
also encouraged parents not to stop in the middle of the street, push their car 
doors open and yell for their kids to run into the street. At least weekly, I 
would be given the middle finger by parents, even told to "F------ mind my own 
business." Even after a fatal accident, this is still a struggle. Why can't 
parents pull over to pick up their kids? 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in all my years of teaching, not more than four parents have actually 
thanked me for their child's education. It is so important to be acknowledged. 
A little appreciation goes a long way. Teachers might feel better about the 
extra things we do, the extra money we spend, the special things that make a 
classroom feel like a second home, if once in a while someone said, "Thank 
you."

CLINTON'S AIDS DAY MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was quite disappointed and somewhat surprised by your characterization of 
President Clinton's World AIDS Day meeting with six young Americans living with 
HIV (Dec. 2). 
</P>
<P>
 To commemorate World AIDS Day, the President chose to meet for 35 minutes with 
six people who are living with HIV. He wanted to hear their perspective on the 
epidemic and seek their advice on ways to combat the spread of HIV, 
particularly among young people. This was one of more than two dozen separate 
World AIDS Day events involving Administration officials. 
</P>
<P>
 This meeting was well-publicized and was followed by a press conference 
featuring those who had met with the President. Yet The Times described the 
meeting as "low-key" and "virtually secret." Neither characterization is true. 
The meeting was on the President's calendar and the press conference was placed 
on the Associated Press "Daybook" for Dec. 1. In addition, on Nov. 29, my 
office informed a Times reporter of the meeting and the press conference and 
offered an opportunity to profile the two individuals from the Los Angeles 
area. A Times reporter was present at the press conference and talked with the 
young people and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's meeting was, indeed, a private one. This allowed each of these 
remarkable young people to share their personal experiences with the President 
in a candid manner. The information they provided will be invaluable to the 
President and his Administration as we seek ways to stem the spread of HIV 
among adolescents. The President recently directed me to prepare a report for 
him on that topic. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when 200 Americans are being diagnosed with AIDS every day and 100 
Americans are dying of this insidious disease each day, it is imperative that 
the President hear directly from people who are affected by this epidemic. It 
is also important that the American public know that the President is actively 
involved in the effort to combat AIDS and HIV. World AIDS day was just one 
element of this response.

PRESIDENT FIRES JOYCELYN ELDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a Clinton supporter, I am very disappointed that the President fired 
Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders for speaking on masturbation (Dec. 10), while 
Ronald Reagan let Surgeon General C. Everett Koop speak his mind on AIDS, birth 
control and condom use -- all positions with which Reagan disagreed -- for both 
of the former President's terms. Perhaps Reagan recognized that doctors speak 
of things, in clear, uncensored language, in a way that politicians cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 I have never seen such sore winners as the Republicans are this year. Their 
call for Elders' head heralds some very dark days to come. Clinton needs to 
learn a lesson from this, a lesson he seems loath to learn: You cannot appease 
your enemies by sacrificing your friends. You will lose your friends and your 
enemies will call you a coward. 
</P>
<P>

 It is good to see Clinton moving to the right. He may not have, as yet, fully 
embraced "Three strikes and you're out" but at least "Three faux pas and you're 
out" is a start.

<P>
 "She Pulled No Punches" (editorial, Dec. 10) is surprisingly acute and on 
target, both as to the rationale for Elders' dismissal as surgeon general and 
as to the lamentable restraint on public discourse in our country -- suffered 
by those who do their homework well and let us know what they think. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it cheeky of you to offer kind words at all for one who frequently 
shoots from the lip. She is the Jesse Helms of the left, though with far kinder 
heart and broader perspective. I will miss her in the way one misses sitting on 
the edge of the chair when someone rises to speak, half-afraid yet hoping some 
truth will out. 
</P>
<P>
 On the masturbation comment that got her canned, the practice needs no 
encouragement from the classroom. Bravo, Dr. Elders, and keep talking straight. 
You are in the grand tradition of free speech.

 Being outspoken is not a virtue worth defending when what you have to say is 
just plain dumb. Which is why I can't believe you would write an editorial 
supporting Elders. This woman has embarrassed herself virtually every time she 
has opened her inarticulate mouth. Have you not been listening? 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever has kept Clinton from firing her before this is a mystery. The number 
of mind-numbing statements made by this surgeon general over the last two years 
is far too extensive to list here but to me, her most classic remark had to do 
with violence in America: "We need safer weapons and safer bullets," said she. 
No further comment.

 It fascinates me that we will accept political babble and allow ourselves to 
go into denial, and when we are confronted with the truth as given to us by 
Elders we rebuke the truth and the messenger.

CON MAN GETS ALMOST FULL PRISON SENTENCE; COURTS: THE USED-CAR SALESMAN 
PROMISED MARRIAGE BUT TOOK WOMEN FOR THEIR MONEY. THE FORMER LAGUNA NIGUEL MAN 
WAS GUILTY OF GRAND THEFT AND 'EXCESSIVE TAKING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A used-car salesman convicted of romancing three women and then swindling them 
out of $87,000 was sentenced Friday to four years and eight months in prison, 
just short of the maximum punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking in court for the first time, James Borzynski apologized for the harm 
he caused and asked for a probation term allowing him to work to repay "every 
dime" to the women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there was a lot of pain that was caused," Borzynski, 46, told Superior 
Court Commissioner Walter D. Posey. "God only knows how sorry I am for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Borzynski said he made a lot of mistakes after his third wife died in 1988, 
but that with the help of his family he has changed much in the past 14 to 15 
months. His statement brought tears from some of his relatives in the 
courtroom. Earlier, his nephew, Steve Ashley, asked the commissioner to 
consider that "there's also another side to this case." 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were not present in the courtroom for the sentencing hearing, but 
through Deputy Dist. Atty. Joseph D'Agostino they urged the maximum prison term 
so that other women would not be harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 While the commissioner said he believes Borzynski is remorseful, he sentenced 
him to prison rather than probation. Posey noted Borzynski's previous criminal 
record, including a fraud conviction, and his inability to follow a previous 
probation term. He also cited a pre-sentencing report that said Borzynski had 
used 18 aliases, five birth dates, six Social Security numbers and two 
California driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Posey said he hoped Borzynski had learned his lesson, but in pronouncing the 
sentence said: "The bottom line, weighing all this out, I find nothing in 
mitigation and a lot in aggravation." 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury deliberated two hours last month before finding the 
former Laguna Niguel resident guilty of three counts of grand theft and a 
felony enhancement charge of "excessive taking." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors said they had little difficulty because they believed the five women 
who testified against him. The women described how Borzynski posed as a Newport 
Beach lawyer in trouble with the Internal Revenue Service and promised them 
love and marriage to wheedle them out of their money. Some had met him when he 
responded to personal ads they had placed in newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three of the women, all Orange County residents, pressed charges. 
However, the other two came from Northern California to testify as witnesses 
during the weeklong trial. One woman said she had broken off an engagement with 
her boyfriend and gave up a 19-year career with Delta Airlines after Borzynski 
started romancing her. 
</P>
<P>
 Borzynski's lawyer, Dennis O'Connell, contended during the trial that his 
client did nothing wrong because he was always honest about having financial 
difficulties and that the emotional nature of the case made it difficult for 
his client "to prevail." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connell argued Friday that justice would be better served if Borzynski were 
placed on probation and allowed to continue working to repay his victims. 
O'Connell said his client had the chance to continue working for a Newark, 
Calif., auto dealership that pays him $80,000 to $100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But D'Agostino said the victims were more interested in seeing Borzynski 
punished and urged a maximum term of five years and four months. He said the 
case was not just about money, it involved "emotional crippling." He likened 
Borzynski's scheme to a rape. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wormed his way into their emotional livelihood," D'Agostino said. "He 
convinced them he would marry them. . . . He convinced them he would live 
happily ever after with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Borzynski was arrested in Tiburon, Calif., in 1993 after 10 women alleged he 
swindled them out of as much as $150,000. His arrest came just one day after he 
had reconciled with his fourth wife, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the sentence, the commissioner opened the way for two of the three 
women in the case to seek restitution from Borzynski in civil court.

WOMAN KILLED, 2 CHILDREN INJURED IN CRASH ON BASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman was killed and two children were injured Friday when their car rolled 
over on Basilone Road, base officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who was pronounced dead at the scene shortly before 7:45 a.m., 
will not be publicly identified until family members are notified, according to 
Sgt. William Crews. 
</P>
<P>
 The two children were treated by base ambulance and fire crews, assisted by 
emergency personnel from San Clemente. They were taken to the trauma center at 
Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said no other vehicles were involved, and the cause of the crash 
is under investigation.

POLITICIANS ARE HIRED HELP, LIKE A GARDENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Negative campaigns guarantee that potential statesmen and voters are the real 
losers. But you haven't seen anything yet. Wait until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Negative campaigns get so much attention, they appear to work. And until the 
voters look past things like "Nannygate" and focus on the real issues, the 
airways will be polluted with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters have to get past the idea that personality is more important than how 
the candidate will vote. Folks, I don't care how a candidate handles his or her 
personal life. He or she can be sexually indiscreet, an alcoholic, bad driver, 
physically ugly or extremely obnoxious. I'm not hiring a runway model or a role 
model. I want a hired gun to vote the way I want: less government control, 
thank you very much. 
</P>
<P>
 In my never-to-be-humble opinion, voters should focus on what direction a 
candidate will move the government. This must take precedence over what 
personal devils haunt them. The pols are not invited to family dinner or hired 
to read stories to our children. Think of our representatives as gardeners we 
have hired to maintain our landscapes to our specifications. Failure to perform 
as agreed results in termination. 
</P>
<P>
 Only if we demand and enforce this kind of contract will negative campaigning 
stop, and more normal people run for public office. By the way, normal people 
aren't perfect, and if they have any common sense they won't subject themselves 
and their families to having every mistake they ever made exaggerated out of 
all proportion and spread over every conceivable media surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Positive campaigning could drop spending to a point that normal people could 
afford to run for office. I don't know about you, but I am really dreading 
another election where I have to choose from a field of arrogant attorneys, 
oddball millionaires, their wives, or some twisted politicians.

NO NEW LEADS IN BEATING OF KNOTT KIN, DESPITE REWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite a $10,000 reward, police said Friday they have no new leads in the 
brutal beating of the 17-year-old great-granddaughter of the founder of Knott's 
Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 Desire Anderson remains in critical but stable condition at Palomar Memorial 
Hospital in Escondido, nearly three weeks after an intruder entered her bedroom 
in the San Diego County community of Fallbrook and severely beat her. 
</P>
<P>
 The reward, offered by members of the Knott family, "generated some calls," 
according to San Diego County Sheriff's Lt. Doug Clements. 
</P>
<P>
 The reward "may be a good tool," Clements said, but to date "the most 
promising calls didn't come as a result of the reward offer." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still pursuing the leads and moving forward on the investigation," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier suspect, a parolee who lives in the semi-rural area where the Nov. 
28 attack took place, has been ruled out, Clements said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson is still on life-support systems, Clements said, and has not been 
able to aid in the investigation.

<P>
 You failed to point out the major issues and complaints expressed by the motel 
owners, their lawyers and those persons (myself included) who testified on 
their behalf: 
</P>
<P>
 * The zoning administration deleted from the public records a portion of the 
zoning analyst's staff report which indicated that the motels were "victims" 
and not public nuisances. 
</P>
<P>
 * The motel owners had evidence in connection with these proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 * All three of the motel files already contained the City Council's 
"resolution" days before the hearing even took place! 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to what Councilman Marvin Braude stated, the real issue is whether 
the city has a right to deprive legitimate businesses of their constitutional 
rights and then force them to take on the role of the police. As an attorney 
and fellow resident of the San Fernando Valley, I think not.

ASSESSMENTS TODAY ARE JUST TAXES IN DISGUISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the enactment of Proposition 13, opponents have found a variety of ways 
to circumvent the will of the voters. The new method of increasing taxes is 
through assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 Assessments are in addition to your property tax, which is limited by 
Proposition 13. There are at least 19 different types of assessment districts. 
What is common to most is that those who pay do not always have the opportunity 
to vote on the assessment or to register a meaningful protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Assessments were once for capital improvements (such as sidewalks), which are 
a direct benefit to a particular parcel of property. However, assessments now 
have come to mean that property owners pay for services that do not directly 
benefit their property. 
</P>
<P>
 Assessments today are nothing more than thinly disguised property taxes. 
Taxpayers generally first learn they have been "assessed" when they see it on 
their property tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no wonder that the government spenders prefer assessment districts. Once 
an assessment district is in place, the money "assessed" frees up revenue that 
is frequently used by local officials for their pet projects. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 30, the county Board of Supervisors voted 3-2 to set up a "community 
facilities benefit assessment district." This will impose a $28.50 fee on all 
property owners in both unincorporated areas and cities that join the 
assessment district. This may not sound like a lot of money, but when it is 
added to others, it can add up to hundreds of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing to stop the future creation of unlimited new and overlapping 
assessment districts. Any present or future local agency can tag property 
owners with additional assessments. During the 1991-1992 year, California had 
nearly 5,000 assessment districts. Look at your property tax bill. You probably 
have five or six special "assessments" tacked on to it. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill recently passed both houses of the Legislature and is on the governor's 
desk which would allow any city or county to set up a benefit assessment 
district with majority voter approval. This contradicts the two-thirds vote 
requirement mandated by Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Our country is strapped for funds because the state transferred billions of 
dollars from the counties to Sacramento; taxes have increased on business so 
tax revenue has decreased in our community, and taxpayers are leaving the state 
in droves while welfare recipients increase. More taxes are not the answer. The 
answer is in ending this fiscal lunacy.

ENCINO HANUKKAH SHOW WAS WELL DISCIPLINED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We don't know what program your reporter saw on Friday night, ("Lighthearted 
Celebration of Hanukkah," Valley Focus, Dec. 3) but apparently it was different 
from the one we attended at Valley Beth Shalom in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 We take strong exception to the statement that the children "fidgeted with 
their costumes, fumbled their choreography and dissolved into chaos at the end 
of each song."On the contrary, our observation and comments immediately 
following the program were how wonderfully well they (the 6- and 7-year-olds) 
knew all the words of the various songs and how well-disciplined their 
performance was throughout the program. We saw no chaos; keep in mind, this was 
not a professional Las Vegas production number. 
</P>
<P>
 This is another example of how and why we have become cynics and skeptics of 
reporting on any and all subjects by the media. 
</P>
<P>
 One more positive note, we would very much like to thank you for covering this 
event, and for conveying to the community the basic message of Hanukkah.

WHY NO QUESTIONS ABOUT HIGH SEWER FEE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One day after reading Alice Muller's letter Dec. 4 regarding Department of 
Water and Power bills, I received my DWP bill. I examined the charges on the 
bill and noted that there was a subtotal for water and a subtotal for 
electricity, yet there was no subtotal for non-DWP charges. A quick calculation 
yielded a surprising fact. Non-DWP charges were 31% of my total bill! Another 
calculation produced the fact that the non-DWP sewer charge was 77% of the 
water portion of my bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Why are the citizens of Los Angeles complaining about the high price of 
receiving and using DWP water, when they should be complaining about the cost 
of disposing of it in city sewers? Valley dwellers should be particularly upset 
with the sewer service portion of their bill, because most of their water 
probably goes back into the ground when used for landscaping. Why isn't the 
City Council questioned about the exorbitant sewer charge? Because it is made 
to look like part of the DWP bill! 
</P>
<P>
 I think it is safe to say that a big chunk of my DWP bill goes to the city, 
not DWP, to pay for city sewers, garbage pickup and a 10% city utility tax. 
Additionally, the city annually receives 5% of DWP's revenues ($100 
million-plus) to use any way it likes. Now it wants to take more than the usual 
5% for more police. Isn't this a hidden tax? It might not come out of our 
pocketbooks directly, but after the next "big one" we had better be prepared to 
survive for three weeks, not three days, without water and power. The days of 
reliable, inexpensive water and power in the city of Los Angeles are destined 
to go the way of the city sewers if our civic leaders have their way.

CONSERVANCY'S PLAN WARRANTS NAME CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading the L.A. Times article "Ecologist Criticizes Park Tree Planting" 
(Oct. 22), I propose that the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy change its 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that it plans to spend more than $2 million planting non-native 
trees and then spend unlimited amounts of money pumping endless quantities of 
water to sustain them, I think the conservancy's name should be changed to the 
Santa Monica Mountains Spendservancy.

USE EXISTING RAIL LINES FOR VALLEY RAPID TRANSIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that I've read about the Metropolitan Transit Authority's decision for a 
subway system in the Valley, I must express my views. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic has steadily become worse along the Valley's east-west routes. 
Everyone travels one to a car, and there are no great incentives for motorists 
to car-pool. A mass transit system serving this route is the right step to 
solving this congestion problem. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure you are familiar with the dormant railway lines along Oxnard Street 
in the West Valley that continue on to Chandler Boulevard to the east. As a 
matter of fact, prospective home buyers within 10 miles of the tracks are 
informed by their real estate agents that their homes would be near a railway 
(as well as a fault zone). 
</P>
<P>
 Every time I get a jolt from my car's suspension or I'm driving behind a 
school bus that redundantly stops at the tracks to check for trains (which 
haven't used the tracks in years), I remember that herein lies a solution to 
our traffic problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Why create a subway? 
</P>
<P>
 Subway construction creates many problems, as we discovered recently on 
Hollywood Boulevard. It also takes longer to build and reap the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Solution: Refurbish the existing railroad tracks. Build above-ground stations. 
Use electric trains like the Blue Line in Long Beach, quieter and less 
polluting than diesel-fuel engines. 
</P>
<P>
 This type of railway could be completed and operational in one or two years. 
</P>
<P>
 If the residents say it will be too noisy, tell them that an electric train is 
much quieter. Tell them that their proximity to mass transit will increase 
their property values, not decrease them. That there will be less stress in 
their lives not having to sit in bumper-to-bumper traffic twice a day. And, as 
a last resort, that they knew they were near a railway system when they 
purchased their residence. 
</P>
<P>
 I would love to have the opportunity to use mass transit in the Valley, but 
the subway is not the way to go.

NEWPORT BEACH SEX ATTACK MAY BE TIED TO OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who may have been involved in two other attacks tried to rob and 
sexually assault a woman early Friday but fled when her roommate came home, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man entered the woman's Colton Street residence through an unlocked front 
door about 3:45 a.m., Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said.He was armed with a gun and 
threatened to rob and rape the woman, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the assailant could carry out his threats, the woman's roommate 
entered the residence and surprised him, Gonis said. The man fled. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was similar to two previous attacks, one that occurred Nov. 29 on 
38th Street in Newport Beach and another Dec. 3 at an undisclosed address in 
Costa Mesa, Gonis said. Police in both cities are advising residents to keep 
their doors and windows locked at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant was described by police as an African American, 5 feet, 8 inches 
tall and about 190 pounds. He is stocky with short, black hair and may have a 
small mustache, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information should call (800) 550-NBPD or (714) 754-5255.

HIGH SCHOOLS MAY BAN TOY GUNS AND KNIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Toy guns and knives, as well as the real things, would be banned from the 
campuses of high schools in Huntington Beach, Westminster and Fountain Valley 
under a revised policy being considered by the Huntington Beach Union High 
School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board, without debate, unanimously approved the first reading of 
the policy and scheduled it for second reading and final passage at the board's 
Jan. 17 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The revised policy on "weapons and dangerous instruments" cites that state law 
already requires a school system "to immediately suspend and recommend for 
expulsion any student who brings a firearm to school." 
</P>
<P>
 The school board, in its action Tuesday night, included toy guns and knives as 
grounds for suspension or expulsion. The proposed policy reads: "Students also 
may be suspended or expelled if they threaten others or disrupt school 
activities by exhibiting a replica of a weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 The revised policy also says students may not possess "weapons, replicas of 
weapons or dangerous instruments of any kind in school buildings, on school 
grounds or buses or at any school-related or school-sponsored activity away 
from school." 
</P>
<P>
 The revision would give "any school employee" the right to confiscate a real 
or toy weapon from a student. 
</P>
<P>

schools in Huntington Beach, Westminster and Fountain Valley. BILL BILLITER

TOLLWAY FOES SEE BANKRUPTCY AS STOP SIGN; PROTEST: THE 125 PEOPLE IN SUNSET 
OBSERVANCE SAY THE PLANNED ROUTE THROUGH LAGUNA CANYON SHOULD SCRAPPED BECAUSE 
OF COUNTY'S FISCAL WOES. 
</P>

 About 125 people lit candles at sunset Friday in hopes that the county's 
bankruptcy means the end of the day also is near for plans to build a toll road 
through the scenic Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor gathered about 5:30 
p.m. at Pacific Coast Highway and Broadway for a vigil to send a message to the 
County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The road "was a preposterous idea to begin with," said Joy Borzellino of Aliso 
Viejo, "but now, (the bankruptcy) makes it even more ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
 But authorities from the Transportation Corridor Agencies, which is in charge 
of building three Orange County toll roads including the San Joaquin Hills 
corridor, said earlier this week that work will begin as planned in the first 
week of January. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-mile corridor that will link Newport Beach and San Juan Capistrano is 
needed, Agency spokeswoman Lisa Telles said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're committed to completing the project," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the toll road say they believe that commitment will wane as money 
is needed elsewhere in the county. About a third of the agency's funding, or 
$311.4 million, is tied up in the county's frozen investment portfolio. As of 
Friday, it was still unclear who will pay for the estimated $2.02-billion loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the bankruptcy) gives them a chance to re-evaluate priorities," said 
Julie Garner of Garden Grove, "and the toll road should be at the bottom." 
</P>
<P>
 Toll road opponents contend it is only logical for schools and other public 
services to be funded before money is allocated for the controversial roadway, 
which cuts through Laguna Canyon and the Laguna Coast Wilderness Park. And 
although they didn't want to see the county become the largest municipal 
district to declare bankruptcy, they're glad to see the prospect of a toll road 
dim a little. 
</P>
<P>
 Said opponent Max Brown, "This is the only positive side effect."

YOUNG FAN SAW ANOTHER SIDE OF COBB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite Jim Murray's recent article on Ty Cobb, where he supports the alliance 
of Hollywood and journalism in the character assassination of arguably 
baseball's greatest player, I would like to offer one story in defense of this 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 In August of 1956, when I was a 9-year-old boy in the San Francisco Bay Area, 
my friends found Ty Cobb's phone number listed in the Atherton phone book.We 
dialed the number and found the voice on the line kind and receptive. Mr. Cobb 
invited us to his house, greeted us at the door and gave us a tour of his 
Southern-style mansion. He then wrote out detailed autographs for all four of 
us and presented them, along with miniature bats with his name inscribed. As he 
said goodby to us two hours after our arrival, he kissed the little girl and 
gave the boys a handshake.  
</P>
<P>
 While the recent film and Al Stump's biography may be well researched and the 
rumors about Mr. Cobb's racism, misogyny and repressed anger over his mother's 
shooting of his father may have merit, wouldn't it be better to adhere to Leo 
Tolstoy's maxim about all men, namely that they are like rivers, deep in some 
areas, shallow in others. Undoubtedly, I met Ty Cobb on one of his deeper days.

 Mike Downey's article on Dennis Rodman (Dec. 14) was a clever defense of a 
nonconformist. Unfortunately, a truly free spirit is a guy who emphatically 
tells the game where to go when he's ready to go (such as Michael Jordan), not 
someone who holds his teammates hostage while he's trying to figure out whether 
he'd rather be banging the boards or just be a "pre-Madonna."

HAROLD MINER DESERVES MUCH BETTER THAN THIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having just read Mark Heisler's article on Harold Miner (Dec. 13), I am filled 
with disgust for Kevin Loughery and the management of the Miami Heat.Harold 
Miner is a tremendous offensive player and, contrary to your article, now plays 
pretty good defense. It is unfortunate that he has to play with such a 
lame-brained coach. 
</P>
<P>
 In a time when reporters complain about all the arrogant young stars, Harold 
is an example of what happens to the nice guys. He should ask politely to be 
traded and get the hell away from Loughery. Let's hope it happens soon.

penalties while getting their butts kicked. The Rams couldn't stop Tampa Bay 
before halftime but wanted to pound their chests and point their fingers as if 
they were the second coming of the Fearsome Foursome. 
</P>
<P>
 They are now officially the St. Loser Rams.

MCNALL'S ATTORNEY DEFENDING HIS CLIENT AGAINST NEW CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your readers should know my bias before reading this letter -- I represent 
Bruce McNall. But what is Helene Elliott's bias, that she would write a 
personally scathing attack on Bruce's career (Dec. 15) based on nothing more 
than her misinformed musings?  
</P>
<P>
 Not only is Ms. Elliott given the power of the pulpit, but, in her 
mean-spirited view of Bruce's career, she purports to speak on behalf of "us." 
Ms. Elliott does not speak on behalf of me, nor on behalf of the hundreds of 
supporters of Bruce, who have stood by him, despite the charges, because they 
know Bruce as a decent, caring and generous man whom they love and respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Elliott's characterization of Bruce's career misses what Bruce is all 
about. Bruce enjoys making people happy, making people's lives better. Bruce 
relished making hockey an exciting and popular sport in Los Angeles, not to 
make a fortune, but for the sheer fun of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce McNall has his flaws and has made mistakes. While Bruce's actions were 
motivated not by greed but by a misguided effort to buy time while trying to 
pay off a staggering debt, the mistakes he made were still serious. Contrary to 
Ms. Elliott's assertion that Bruce has not shown remorse, he pled guilty and 
then told the world that none of his many accomplishments made up for "the 
remorse I feel for the misguided actions that brought me to this point today." 
</P>
<P>
 Tough, hard, honest journalism is one thing. A poison-pen letter based on 
fantasy and free-floating anger is another. Your readers deserve information 
and insight, not uninformed venting.

<P>
 Thank you, Helene Elliott. Finally, someone with the courage and wisdom to 
print an editorial that reflects what I'm sure are the sentiments of countless 
hockey fans in Los Angeles and around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 We are so tired of hearing what a good guy McNall is from the current Kings' 
regime, from some of our TV sportscasters, from his attorney and from McNall 
himself. He is not a good guy. He is a thief, a scam artist and a liar.  
</P>
<P>
 Even in jail, McNall is going to make more money from the Kings than most of 
us will see in our lifetime. For being what he terms a "poor businessman," he 
sure cut himself a hefty deal, didn't he? 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on you, Bruce. Go directly to jail.

 Bruce McNall has committed serious crimes for which he will be punished 
accordingly. However, McNall's contributions to hockey in Southern California 
should not be diminished. Before McNall purchased the Kings, there was no Wayne 
Gretzky, few Forum sellouts, no Stanley Cup finals and no Mighty Ducks.

 Here's how the Buffalo Bills will win the Super Bowl: They will beat New 
England this weekend and Indianapolis next weekend to qualify for the playoffs. 
Then they travel to San Diego and beat the fast-fading Chargers the first 
week.Next they travel back to Miami (whom they own) and beat the Dolphins the 
second week. Now they get a beat-up Pittsburgh team that just outlasted the 
Raiders the week before and beat them to go to the Super Bowl. Have you stopped 
laughing yet? 
</P>
<P>
 Since everyone knows the real Super Bowl is between the Cowboys and 49ers, 
whichever team wins will suffer an emotional letdown and the Buffalo Bills will 
administer the coup de grace and finally win their first Super Bowl!

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DIVISION I-AA CHAMPIONSHIP; BOISE STATE CLOSE TO THE 
IMPROBABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boise State is only a victory away from a remarkable turnaround that even 
Coach Pokey Allen figured was unlikely during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos (13-1) of the Big Sky Conference play independent Youngstown State 
(13-0-1) today for the NCAA Division I-AA football championship at Marshall 
University Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 This time last year, Boise State was trying to forget its 3-8 record in 
Allen's first season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players thought we were going to reach the national championship (this 
year)," Allen said. "I had a lot of doubts. . . . We've had a magical season. 
That we're here is amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 The magic started with Allen's recruiting efforts last winter. He brought in 
several junior college transfers, all who "really contributed." 
</P>
<P>
 Youngstown State is trying to repeat after beating Marshall for the title in 
1991 and 1993 and losing to the Herd in the 1992 title game. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the only surprise is that they are playing Boise instead of Marshall, 
a 28-24 loser to Boise.

O.C. JOBLESS RATE FALLS TO 4.8% IN NOVEMBER; EMPLOYMENT: IT'S LOWER THAN 
OCTOBER'S 5.1%, BUT MORE IMPORTANT, ANALYSTS SAY, IT IS ALSO LOWER THAN THE 
SAME 1993 PERIOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's unemployment rate for November fell to 4.8%, the lowest level 
for the key economic indicator since December, 1991, and substantially below 
the statewide average. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the improvement since October, when the county's jobless rate was 
5.1%, came from seasonal hiring as retailers geared up for holiday shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 But a separate tally of employment at businesses in Orange County showed that 
a substantial number of permanent jobs have been added to local payrolls since 
November, 1993, when the jobless rate hit 6%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to see growth, and it's a hefty increase" after almost four years 
of recession, said Anil Puri, head of the economics department at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's jobless rate last month was the second-lowest in the state, 
trailing only the 4.1% figure reported for Marin and San Mateo counties in 
Northern California. For the state as whole, the rate was 7.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the staggering investment losses disclosed recently by Orange County 
officials, the jobs picture is not likely to change significantly in coming 
months, Puri and other economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some layoffs of existing employees, but we expect the main 
impact on government will be to stop new hiring," said Esmael Adibi, director 
of the Center for Economic Research at Chapman University. "Nothing much should 
show up until early next year" in unemployment statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Adibi predicted another decline in Orange County's jobless rate for this 
month, too, as merchants make last-minute holiday hires. 
</P>
<P>
 For November, the state Employment Development Department reported Friday, 
Orange County employers added 4,900 jobs to their payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Total non-farm employment rose to 1.126 million from 1.121 million for 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the increase came from the addition of 4,400 retail jobs -- a 
combination of seasonal employment and the openings in late October and early 
November of two Super K mart stores in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 With four consecutive months of job growth, the county is having its longest 
growth spurt since the recession began in July, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists generally give less weight to month-to-month jobless rate changes 
than to year-to-year comparisons, which reflect seasonal factors. 
</P>
<P>
 But in that area, too, November was significant. "It's the first time we've 
seen three consecutive months of year-to-year gains since 1990," Puri said. 
</P>
<P>
 November's employment tally was up by 3,700 jobs from a year earlier, EDD 
figures showed. Even better, most of those jobs were permanent positions in the 
business services and transportation industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in service-related jobs has a down side, though, analysts said. 
They typically pay less than the aerospace and defense manufacturing positions 
that were once a mainstay of the county's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manufacturing is still depressed," Adibi said, "and we think that will be the 
case through 1995 as well. Still, Orange County is doing better than Los 
Angeles County," where the November unemployment rate was 8%. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Orange County's unemployment rate for November was the lowest in almost three 
years. It was also substantially below the state and nationwide figures. Here 
is the county's 13-month trend:

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SELLING OFF ANOTHER CHUNK; SALOMON BROS. UNLOADS 
$1 BILLION FROM BANKRUPT FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Salomon Bros. unloaded $1 billion in securities from Orange County's bankrupt 
investment fund on Friday -- double Thursday's pace -- while cautioning that 
the hardest sales lie ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second day of the court-approved liquidation process, Salomon auctioned 
longer-term conventional bonds with a principal value of $566 million, and also 
sold the first of the portfolio's complex "derivative" securities: $440 million 
in foreign bank-issued "structured" certificates of deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond auction fetched $4.8 billion in bids and what bond dealers said were 
good prices. The U.S. government agency bonds, maturing in 4 1/2 to 10 years, 
were sold for 96 cents to 98.75 cents per dollar of face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were higher prices than what Salomon received on the $483 million of 
shorter-term bonds sold Thursday. Salomon said the bonds sold Friday were 
issued more recently and thus paid interest rates closer to market yields -- 
reducing the need to discount their prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers of Friday's batch of bonds garnered yields between 7.7% and 8.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 With Friday's auction, the bulk of the county fund's conventional bonds are 
gone, leaving mostly derivative bonds. The latter will be much tougher to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund began the week with a market value estimated by Salomon at $7.96 
billion. But that included $2.56 billion in bonds held as collateral for loans 
still outstanding to the fund, which had borrowed massively in a wrong-way bet 
on interest rates this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding the collateral bonds -- most of which are held by Merrill Lynch & 
Co., which has not said when it might sell -- the remaining portfolio was worth 
$5.4 billion at the start of the week. The sales Thursday and Friday have 
reduced that to less than $3.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of what remains are so-called structured notes issued by U.S. government 
agencies. Such notes are set up to pay fluctuating interest returns depending 
on changes in market rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Because former county treasurer Robert L. Citron believed that market interest 
rates would fall this year, he invested heavily in notes that would pay more 
interest if rates declined -- but less if rates rose. The surge in rates since 
February has slashed the interest earnings on many of the notes and sharply 
devalued them. 
</P>
<P>
 While Salomon officials were encouraged that they were able to sell $440 
million in structured CDs on Friday, they cautioned that Wall Street's 
expectations that the rest of the notes will be unloaded next week may be too 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 With the holidays thinning investors' ranks, "The county is going to have to 
decide whether the market environment is appropriate to proceed" with the 
liquidation, a Salomon executive said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he noted that there are "perhaps as few as 25" major financial firms 
that have the sophistication needed to evaluate and bid for the fund's 
derivative notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The risk to the county in delaying sale of the notes is that any new rise in 
market interest rates would further devalue them, deepening fund losses. 
Salomon early this week estimated that fund participants would get back 73 
cents on the dollar, overall, if the investments were sold at current market 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts believe that, rather than sell the notes in the market, Salomon 
will restructure them with the U.S. government agencies that issued them -- a 
solution that could be slightly less costly to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations with all of the agencies involved, including the Student Loan 
Marketing Assn. and the Federal Home Loan Bank System, are continuing, but it 
isn't clear that deals can be struck before Christmas, sources say.

 Granted, 1994 hasn't been a great year for investors. But the performance of 
Orange County's investment pool, which bet big -- and wrong -- on lower 
interest rates, nonetheless looks devastatingly bad in comparison with other 
investment programs. The Orange County fund has lost 27% of its value since

SANTA MONICA HOSPITAL, UCLA MEDICAL CENTER DISCUSS MERGER; HEALTH CARE: MOVE IS 
SEEN AS A BLOW TO RIVAL ST. JOHN'S FACILITY, WHICH HAD BEEN PURSUING A 
PARTNERSHIP FOR NEARLY A YEAR. 
</P>

<P>
 In a move that could accelerate hospital consolidation in Southern California, 
Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center said it is in exclusive merger talks with 
UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure is a blow to St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa 
Monica, which had been wooing its Santa Monica rival for nearly a year.  
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Lamoureux, St. John's chief operating officer, said the hospital was 
"disappointed" by Santa Monica Hospital's decision to break off talks. "We felt 
it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to build a strong health care community 
for the 21st Century," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Medical Center, like most U.S. teaching hospitals, has a medical staff 
dominated by specialists. Thus, UCLA has been trying to cope with health care 
changes that place more emphasis on the role of primary-care doctors rather 
than specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Hospital, which is owned by Burbank-based UniHealth America, a 
large nonprofit health care system, has a reputation as a cost-efficient 
community hospital with a strong program in primary-care medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Laret, deputy director of UCLA Medical Center in Westwood, said the key 
goal of the merger would be to combine Santa Monica Hospital's strength in 
primary-care medicine, especially pediatrics and obstetrics, with UCLA's 
strength as an internationally renowned major surgical hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals have been under intense economic pressure from health maintenance 
organizations and other managed-care companies. Responding to demands by 
employers to cut medical costs, managed care companies have been negotiating 
deep discounts in hospital fees. Moreover, many Southland hospitals are 
suffering from a glut of empty beds as an increasing number of medical 
procedures are performed outside the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the area's hospitals are in the red, and the only way to get into the 
black is to acquire or network with other institutions to get economies of 
scale or negotiating clout" with managed care firms, said David Langness, a 
spokesman for the Hospital Council of Southern California. "The pressure to get 
bigger is intense." 
</P>
<P>
 Langness said a merger between UCLA and Santa Monica Hospital would have a big 
impact in the "intensely competitive" Westside hospital market. He said other 
Westside hospitals would face greater pressure to merge or form affiliations to 
increase their cost-competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The outcome of these negotiations . . . will influence health care delivery 
on the Westside for years to come," Langness said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laret said he expects the two hospitals will reach an agreement under which 
Santa Monica Hospital would become part of the University of California 
hospital system. Any proposal would have to go to the University of California 
Board of Regents for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to initially operate the facilities independently," Laret said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Santa Monica Hospital official declined to say why talks with St. John's 
were ended. Discussions between the two nonprofit hospitals began in February 
after the Northridge earthquake, during which both hospitals suffered heavy 
structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Inpatient services at St. John's were shut down for nine months, reopening in 
October with its number of beds cut almost in half, from 501 to 260. Santa 
Monica Hospital remained open, but temporarily reduced its operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake damage prompted both hospitals to take a hard look at the 
overlap in their services and the need for two hospitals in Santa Monica.

U.S.-CHINA TRADE TALKS STALL OVER COPYRIGHTS; PIRACY: WASHINGTON WARNS OF 
SANCTIONS, CITING GROWING NUMBER OF COUNTERFEIT CD FACTORIES. BEIJING THREATENS 
COUNTERMEASURES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two weeks before a Dec. 30 deadline, Washington broke off key trade talks with 
Beijing, warning that trade sanctions are inevitable if China doesn't make 
"serious offers" to improve intellectual property rights enforcement soon. 
</P>
<P>
 American trade officials declared the latest round of talks at a dead end 
after three days of intense wrangling in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is China's treatment of international copyrights, patents and 
trademarks. Piracy of compact discs, software, movies, pharmaceutical products 
and even food has become rampant in China's free-for-all economy -- even though 
Beijing promised two years ago to curb such violations. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. trade official said China has not only failed to live up to 
those promises but permitted the number of factories making pirate CDs to jump 
from 15 to 29 in the 18 months since America and China began negotiations on 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The capacity of those factories is about 75 million discs, the official said, 
15 times China's legitimate domestic demand for CDs. The remainder are smuggled 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has demanded that those plants be shut as a sign of China's 
commitment to protect intellectual property. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Washington gave Beijing six months to demonstrate its commitment or 
face sanctions under the Special 301 provision of U.S. trade law. That 
provision permits Washington to impose sanctions commensurate with damage done 
to American producers by illicit trade practices in another country. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry groups estimate their annual lost sales from copyright infringement 
in China alone at $827 million, the U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Dec. 30 deadline, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor can extend 
the talks for 30 days, if a resolution seems near, or he must order retaliatory 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 China responded angrily to Friday's threat of retaliation. Wu Yi, the 
country's trade minister, said sanctions would provoke a counter-strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big-stick policy can only lead to a trade war," the official China Daily 
quoted Wu as saying. "In that case, the feeling and economic benefits of both 
sides will be hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the intellectual-property rights dispute is awkward for China, 
which is seeking to re-enter the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 It wants to become a founding member of the new World Trade Organization, 
which replaces the GATT on Jan. 1, 1995. China considers it a matter of 
prestige to be a founding member of the WTO and accuses the United States of 
trying to scuttle its chances. 
</P>
<P>
 In Geneva next week, GATT members will consider a draft protocol offering 
concessions to China, which has requested special exemptions as a developing 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 America and other members, however, have argued that China, one of the world's 
fastest-growing economies, should be considered a developed trading power and 
held to higher standards.  
</P>
<P>
 If denied founding member status, China has threatened to disregard bilateral 
trade agreements. "If the U.S. should block our re-entry by way of pressure, 
it's not China that will bear the consequent responsibility," Wu was quoted as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials have said they support China's membership, just as they say 
they believe some Chinese officials want to correct intellectual-property 
rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "China has laws on the books to fight these practices, but has failed to 
enforce them," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last round of talks in Beijing, hawkers sold bootleg CDs on the 
sidewalk in front of the American negotiators' hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, officials brought representatives from the U.S. Justice Department, 
the Customs Service and the FBI to offer seminars on enforcement to their 
Chinese counterparts. America is asking China to create a customs service to 
seize and destroy contraband, to modify its court structure to prosecute 
offenders and to open the market to legitimate American products to satisfy 
consumer demand.  
</P>
<P>
 But China has offered American officials a few lessons in capitalism, Chinese 
style: Some of the factories are owned by local governments and military 
organizations in politically and economically powerful southern China; they are 
resisting their shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a question of will," said one official. "It suggests (the government) 
can't do anything."

INTEL'S TROUBLES GREETED IN JAPAN WITH QUIET GLEE; COMPUTERS: WIDELY REPORTED 
FLAW IN THE U.S. COMPANY'S PENTIUM CHIP MAY CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
COMPETITORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The disclosure of a flaw in Intel Corp.'s top-of-the-line Pentium computer 
chip may have caused some headaches for Japan's technology community, but 
mostly it has created opportunities. And some here can barely contain their 
glee at mighty Intel's stumble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan would probably love to see Intel fall into a crack," said Chuck Goto, 
an electronics industry analyst with Smith Barney International Inc. in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers here feel the troubles with the Pentium -- widely reported across 
Japan -- may undercut Intel's dominance of the microprocessor market as the 
computer industry makes the transition to the next generation of chips -- 
creating market openings for Japan's premier semiconductor makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Occurring at a time when the U.S.-Japanese technology rivalry has been tilting 
in Uncle Sam's favor, the Pentium flap has made for open season on Intel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to say we're pleased at someone else's misfortune, but this 
does present opportunities," said an executive at a Japanese electronics firm 
who requested anonymity. "There has been a sense that Intel has had a very 
powerful position that is not necessarily deserved. They have excellent 
technology, but have also been very good at using the law and the courts to 
make sure other companies can't advance in the microprocessor market. . . . The 
general feeling is it's a case of hubris on Intel's part, and they really need 
to be taken down a peg or two." 
</P>
<P>
 NEC Corp., Fujitsu Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. have all announced that they will 
replace flawed Pentium microprocessors in their personal computers without 
charge. It remains unclear who will pay for it, Intel or these Japanese 
corporate customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the future, when they (Intel) announce a new next-generation 
microprocessor, the next generation after Pentium, they're going to have to 
work very hard to convince customers this is not going to cause problems for 
us," said the Japanese executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Intel claims that the defect in its Pentium chip should show up only once in 9 
billion computer operations. But IBM alleged Monday that it appears far more 
frequently, and announced a suspension of shipments of IBM personal computers 
containing the Pentium microprocessor. IBM promised to replace, free of charge, 
the flawed chip in the nearly 100,000 Pentium PCs it has shipped so far. 
</P>
<P>
 In both the United States and Japan, however, some have questioned IBM's 
motives, because its PowerPC chip, developed together with Apple Computer Inc., 
will compete with the Pentium. Japanese firms have generally remained skeptical 
of IBM's claim of how frequently the Intel chip produces an error. 
</P>
<P>
 "IBM claims (the error frequency) is something like once in 100 million, and 
Intel claims one in 9 billion," said Chris Shimizu, a spokesman for NEC. "We 
are using some kind of spreadsheet and did our own testing and came out with 
the figure one in 5 billion. We believe it is something between that and 9 
billion." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, says analyst Goto, "a lot of people are kind of grinning. 
Techno-nationalism between Japan and the U.S. has been going on for some time, 
and both sides have bones of contention." 
</P>
<P>
 NEC, which controls about half the Japanese personal computer market, has 
shipped 75,000 personal computers containing the Pentium chip, while the firm's 
total PC shipments this year will exceed 1.7 million, Shimizu said. Fujitsu has 
shipped 11,000 desktop computers with the Pentium and Toshiba has sold fewer 
than 2,000, they said.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; COMPUTERIZED TRADING DRIVES MARKET FRENZY; STOCKS: VOLUME 
SOARS TO 483.2 MILLION SHARES, THE THIRD HIGHEST EVER. THE DOW AVERAGE CLOSES 
UP 41.72. 
</P>

<P>
 A frenzy of computerized trading tied to the quarterly expiration of index 
futures and options sent stock prices sprinting higher on the heaviest volume 
since the day after the 1987 market crash. 
</P>
<P>
 But both bonds and the dollar had a dull day, with activity slowing down as 
the end of the year approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 A flood of computer-driven trades sent the Dow Jones average up 41.72 points, 
or 1.1%, to close at 3,807.19, although in the broader market, advancing issues 
led decliners by about 13 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Volume on the NYSE soared to 483.2 million shares. That was the third-largest 
volume ever, topped only by the Oct. 19, 1987 market crash and the day after. 
On Thursday, 337.08 million shares changed hands. Traders attributed the day's 
advances largely to the so-called "triple witching" expirations, which often 
lead to heavy buying. 
</P>
<P>
 It spurred an explosive round of computerized purchases at the opening bell 
that accounted for a record 183.27 million shares changing hands in the first 
30 minutes. The volume also set a weekly record, the NYSE said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks also firmed on optimism that the Federal Reserve will not elect to 
raise short-term interest rates at its policy-making meeting next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're moving to a point where perceptions about the interest rate outlook are 
improving," said Eugene Peroni, technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors do not like higher interest rates because they make 
fixed-income investments a more attractive alternative, and they can cut into 
corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks also got support from long-term bonds, which gained despite a report 
that housing starts shot up 6.9% in November. The housing data surprised 
analysts, who expected rising mortgage rates to put a damper on housing 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The data might have encouraged the Fed to tighten credit in an effort to hold 
back inflation. But investors chose instead to focus on the favorable inflation 
data put out earlier this week, including modest increases in wholesale and 
retail prices, and a favorable report from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve 
released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's main 30-year bond yield fell to 7.85% from 7.87% on Thursday. 
Its price, which rises when yields fall, rose 7/32 point, or $2.19 per $1,000 
in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Friday's highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * General Electric rose 1 1/4 to 50 1/4 in heavy volume after the company 
raised its quarterly dividend to 41 cents per share from 36 cents, and 
announced a company repurchase of up to $5 billion of common shares over a 
period of years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other components of the Dow average also rose, including Alcoa, up 1 7/8 at 
83 1/2, and United Technologies, up 1 1/4 at 62 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel rose 7/8 to 59 1/2. The stock was recovering from earlier declines on 
problems with its Pentium chip. But Compaq, which said it would continue to 
sell Pentium products, fell 7/8 to 38 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Community Health Systems gained 1 1/4 to 25 5/8 following a buy 
recommendation from Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 * Funco Inc. tumbled 5 to 5 3/4 after the company said its third-quarter 
earnings will be below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign trading, the Mexican Bolsa closed with another big loss Friday as 
investors continued to shy away from what has become a very nervous market. The 
key stock index fell 51.07 points to 2,327.59. 
</P>
<P>
 Other overseas markets were higher. Late futures-related buying boosted 
London's Financial Times 100-share average 40.2 points to 3,013.6. Germany's 
DAX 30-share average ended at 2,070.06, up 17.47 points, while Tokyo's 
225-share Nikkei average ended 42.31 points higher at 19,163.43.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; L.A. TRANSIT AGENCY DROPS MERRILL LYNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch & Co., catching further fallout from its role in Orange County's 
financial mess, was temporarily removed Friday from the list of underwriters 
used by the Los Angeles Metropolitan Transit Authority, which operates bus and 
rail service in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA's budget, finance and efficiency committee took the action pending 
further review of Merrill's handling of high-risk securities deals for Orange 
County, according to the committee's chairman, Larry Zarian. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports that Orange County is preparing to sue Merrill, alleging that it 
failed to properly disclose the risks of those transactions, contributed to the 
MTA's decision to distance itself from Merrill, the nation's largest investment 
firm, Zarian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill has said it will fight any such suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension will likely last at least a month, according to Zarian. During 
the year ended June 30, Merrill served as co-manager on two MTA bond issues 
totaling $226 million, but officials said the firm has not been a senior player 
in the agency's borrowings over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt the public would want us to be prudent," said Zarian, who is also a 
member of the Glendale City Council. "We're not pointing fingers, we're not 
accusing anyone," but the agency wants to wait "until it is safe to go back and 
deal with them again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the U.S. Trustee overseeing Orange County's bankruptcy 
proceeding said Merrill could not join a committee of the county's creditors 
even though Merrill is one of the county's largest lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill spokesman James Wiggins said the MTA's action was "understandable" 
because of the publicity surrounding Orange County's financial debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, "when all the shouting dies down and the facts are sorted out, 
our business dealings with Orange County will be found to be professional and 
proper in every respect."

GE REPORTEDLY DISCUSSES TURNER DEAL, BUT NO ACTION IS TAKEN 
</P>

 A possible partnership between Turner Broadcasting and General Electric was 
discussed Friday at a regularly scheduled GE board meeting, but no deal was on 
the table and the GE board took no action, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner Broadcasting Chairman Ted Turner, GE Chairman John F. (Jack) Welch Jr. 
and NBC President Robert C. Wright have been in exploratory talks regarding a 
possible merger or other partnership between the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC and Turner executives see synergies between NBC News and Turner's CNN, for 
example, as well as between NBC Entertainment and Turner's TNT, TBS and Cartoon 
Network. But while Turner has made no secret of his desire to acquire a 
network, sources say that GE will require 51% ownership of any combined 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 One possible scenario would be for Turner to issue stock in a merger that 
would leave GE a significant shareholder in the combined company. Time Warner 
and Tele-Communications Inc., Turner's two biggest shareholders, might remain 
investors with voting shares reduced below 5%. Turner is said to have the 
support of TCI Chief Executive John C. Malone in his talks with GE, but he also 
would need the approval of Time Warner in the event of a deal. JANE HALL and

 Housing Starts Up 6.9% in November: It was the largest increase in eight 
months, as new construction rebounded from the previous month's decline. The 
surprising surge was attributed by analysts to warm weather in the Northeast 
and Midwest.They said they still expect rising mortgage rates to restrain 
single-family construction. "There may be a December pay-back for the temporary 
spike in November housing starts," said economist Jose Rasco of Merrill Lynch & 
Co. in New York. "In any case, the outlook is for a decline in residential 
construction in 1995." The Commerce Department said builders broke ground on 
1.54 million units at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, up from 1.44 million 
in October. Starts are 14.2% higher than they were in the first 11 months of 
1993.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; JOBLESS RATE CONTINUES TO FALL IN ORANGE COUNTY; 
EMPLOYMENT: NOVEMBER'S 4.8% IS THE LOWEST SINCE 1991. FISCAL CRISIS HAS NOT YET 
HAD IMPACT.

<P>
 Orange County's unemployment rate for November fell to 4.8%, the lowest level 
for the key economic indicator since December, 1991, and substantially below 
the statewide average of 7.5% last month. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite the staggering investment losses disclosed by Orange County 
officials earlier this month, the jobs picture is not likely to change 
significantly in coming months, economists said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some layoffs . . . but we expect the main impact on government 
will be to stop new hiring," said Esmael Adibi, director of the Center for 
Economic Research at Chapman University in Orange. "Nothing much should show up 
until early next year" in unemployment statistics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adibi predicted Orange County's unemployment rate will decline for this month, 
too, as merchants make last-minute holiday hires. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the employment improvement since October, when the county's jobless 
rate was 5.1%, came from retailers hiring help for the holiday shopping season. 
</P>
<P>
 But a separate tally of employment at businesses in Orange County showed a 
substantial number of permanent jobs added to local payrolls since November, 
1993, when the jobless rate hit a nine-year high of 7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's jobless rate last month was the second lowest in the state, 
trailing only the 4.1% figure reported for Marin and San Mateo counties in 
Northern California.

TECHNOLOGY; OPENING BELL SOUNDS IN FIGHT TO SET VIDEO DISC STANDARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quiet maneuvering over industry standards for a digital successor to the 
videocassette recorder erupted into open battle Friday as Sony Corp. and 
Philips made public their long-awaited video disc standard, only to have 
Toshiba Corp. brusquely assert that its own upcoming technology is better. 
</P>
<P>
 The new technologies, expected to hit the market late next year, will offer 
high-quality home movies on digital discs similar to audio compact discs. Movie 
studios and electronics companies say discs have major advantages over VCR 
tapes, though some question whether consumers will want to invest in yet 
another new entertainment format. 
</P>
<P>
 The unfolding standards fight pits Sony and Philips against a Toshiba-led 
group that also includes Time Warner, Pioneer Electronic Corp. and Thomson of 
France. It is reminiscent of an earlier industry battle when VCRs were first 
developed, which pitted Sony's Betamax technology against Matsushita Electric's 
VHS format. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsushita won that contest even though many observers said Sony's technology 
was superior. This time Toshiba claims to be proposing a higher-quality 
standard, but Sony says its idea makes more sense overall if production costs 
and compatibility with existing systems are also considered. 
</P>
<P>
 A nasty fight over standards could also delay takeoff for the digital video 
disc industry as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Toshiba spokesman Tetsuo Kadoya said Sony's action appears to mark "the end of 
collaboration" in industry attempts to agree on a single standard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sony proposal is for a high-density disc capable of holding 3.7 gigabytes 
of data, more than five times that of ordinary compact discs. Data would be 
held on only one side, but research is under way on "dual-layer" technology 
aimed at doubling that one-side capacity to about 7.4 gigabytes, Sony said. 
</P>
<P>
 This disc would be able to play 135 minutes of high-quality video, long enough 
for most full-length movies, plus audio and subtitling tracks.

 Japan's Trade Surplus Growing: Despite signs that the Japanese are buying more 
U.S. goods in many consumer categories, the nation's trade surplus with the 
United States grew to $5.17 billion in November, compared to $4.29 billion a 
year earlier, the Finance Ministry reported. The bad news for bilateral trade 
relations came on the same day a major economic daily published a study 
suggesting a longer-term tendency in the opposite direction. According to the 
Nihon Keizai Shimbun, imports in 22 of 30 highly visible consumer categories 
studied have increased their market share in Japan over the past year.

 Lockheed Corp. Wins $1.3-Billion British Contract: The British government 
contract is for 25 military transport aircraft, overcoming opposition that had 
split Britain's Cabinet.Minister of Defense Malcolm Rifkind announced the award 
to Lockheed, which will deliver a new version of the popular Hercules transport 
jet it began making in 1954. Rifkind also said Britain was ready to rejoin the 
Future Large Aircraft project, which will develop a European rival to the 
Hercules early next century. Trade Minister Michael Heseltine was reportedly 
angry with plans to buy the Hercules rather than refurbishing existing 
transport aircraft.

ABBEY HEALTHCARE STOCK FALLS 7.4% AMID JITTERS; MANAGEMENT: SECOND RESHUFFLING 
OF EXECUTIVES IN A YEAR IS BELIEVED TO HAVE AFFECTED PRICE OF SHARES.

 Abbey Healthcare Group Inc.'s stock fell 7.4% Friday as investors grew nervous 
over the second management crisis in a year at one of the nation's leading home 
health-care providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey said that its president, Jerilyn P. Asher, has disagreed with the 
direction being set for the Costa Mesa company. 
</P>
<P>
 She met Friday with Abbey Chairman Timothy M. Aitken in Denver, where he is 
vacationing, to discuss their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation should be resolved over the weekend, according to executives. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's Nasdaq trading, Abbey's stock fell $1.69 a share to close at 
$21.06. 
</P>
<P>
 One report Friday alleged that Asher had uncovered "accounting irregularities" 
at the company, but executives vehemently denied that. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Asher, who works out of the company's Boston office, said she knew 
nothing about such problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The aide did acknowledge that Asher and Aitken differed over what course Abbey 
should take to expand and add more business to its home services and infusion 
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher was the founder of Protocare Inc. in Waltham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 After engineering its sale to Abbey in March, she became president of Abbey 
and has worked since on developing new business. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbey said Wednesday that it had asked Asher to step down and "take a leave of 
absence," partly because of her daughter's and her mother's illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher, however, never asked to be relieved, and the company withdrew its 
request Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the company ousted Victor M.G. Chaltiel as president and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaltiel, who had come from a company acquired by Abbey only months earlier, 
has filed a wrongful-termination suit against Abbey.

IT'S A BULLISH BEAR MARKET FOR THE NATION'S RETAILERS; TOYS: COLLECTORS ACCOUNT 
FOR A LARGE SHARE OF THE TEDDY BEAR MARKET. AND THE PRICES OF SOME VARIETIES 
ARE SOARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 One of the hottest toys this Christmas is one of the oldest. 
</P>
<P>
 The teddy bear -- from shrink-wrapped $2.95 dime-store miniatures to dress-up 
society models with hundreds of dollars worth of accessories -- will have no 
trouble finding a friendly home. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider this: 
</P>
<P>
 * By the end of 1994, shoppers in the United States alone will have spent more 
than $93 million on stuffed plush animals, a huge chunk of that being bears of 
all shapes and attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Harrod's, London's famed department store, reported in early December it had 
already sold out of Christmas teddy bears. About 22,000 of them at $31.25 each 
had been purchased at the up-market retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 * A small brown teddy bear recently went for $171,500 at Christie's in London. 
Made in 1904 and bought by a Japanese manufacturer, the toy brought a record 
price, nearly double the old mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The market is growing "by leaps and bounds," said Chris Revi, editor at large 
of Teddy Bear Review, a bimonthly magazine with a circulation of more than 
45,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a convention in Virginia earlier this year that drew 6,000 people," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 His readers are collectors, and they account for a sizable slice of this 
bullish bear market. But there's also the little girl or little boy living with 
CD-ROMs and virtual reality who still needs a cuddly companion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The intensity of the demand energizes the eighth floor of an old loft building 
just south of downtown Chicago where, high above a railroad switching yard and 
a snow-banked Chicago River, bears are being turned out by the hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
 North American Bear Co., a relatively small but prominent player in the bear 
business, is the home of Muffy VanderBear and her companions. Ten years old 
this year, Muffy is the star on this production line, a tiny dress-up bear who 
gets -- and answers -- fan mail scrawled and printed by tiny hands from all 
over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Isenberg of New York and her brother Paul Levy of Chicago jumped on 
the bear wagon in 1978 with Albert the Running Bear, followed by a long line of 
tongue-in-cheek costumed creations with names like Chef Bearnaise, Scarlett 
O'Beara, Queen Elizabear, Albeart Einstein, Dr. Kilbear and Elvis Bearsley. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them are produced for only a few years or less and then "retired," 
entering an active after-market where prices immediately start to climb, Levy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the celebrities whose names have been borrowed over the years, he said, 
only one created a problem. Kareen Abdul Jabear was retired after about 18 
months following indications that the basketball star might object, Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, that only made the bear in question all the more pricey and 
sought-after among collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the real success story may be Muffy, a small, champagne-colored bear 
reissued periodically in designer duds. The collector's edition this year 
features Muffy in a Eskimo-style fur-lined white parka with blue trim and a 
companion baby seal. The price tag is in excess of $50. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a Muffy travel trunk, dresses, a sled, tea set, furniture and other 
accessories that can cost almost as much as the bear. They, too, are retired 
from production after a time to titillate collectors further. 
</P>
<P>
 Revi of Teddy Bear Review said nostalgia gets a lot of collectors into bear 
mania. He says the original teddy bear is thought to have been made by Steiff 
Co. of Germany in 1903 or 1904. The same company made the record-priced bear 
sold recently at Christie's. 
</P>
<P>
 It was inspired by a nephew of one of the founders of that company who 
sketched trained bears, he said.

 Statordyne Corp.: The Anaheim firm said Friday that it has won approval to 
resume production on a $5.1-million equipment order for Cray Research Inc. 
Statordyne is a subcontractor for Eagan, Minn.-based Cray on a project for the 
Army. A work-stop order was issued in November by the General Accounting Office 
when competitors complained about the contract award. The protests have not yet 
been resolved. If the protests are upheld, the company will be compensated for 
all work completed to the date that a new work-stop order is issued.

GOING MOBILE; NO ONE EVER SAID A TRAILER HAS TO LOOK UNSETTLED. THE FACT IS, 
ONCE IN PLACE, MOST NEVER MOVE AGAIN. SOME PEOPLE GIVE A FINAL-DESTINATION LOOK 
TO HOMES THAT ARE ONLY TECHNICALLY STILL ON WHEELS.; THE CUSTOM-HOME LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Madine and Rolly Pulaski haven't been shy about making architectural changes 
to their mobile home: They wanted to take advantage of its oceanfront location 
and give it the personality of a custom home. 
</P>
<P>
 It did help to have an architect in the house. 
</P>
<P>
 From top to bottom, Rolly -- an architect with P/A + Inc. in Newport Beach -- 
has devised ways to give the home a look of permanence and style. 
</P>
<P>
 By visually and physically opening space with windows and by removing walls, 
the Pulaskis gave the home in the El Morro Beach Mobile Home Park in Laguna 
Beach a spacious feeling that is the antithesis of claustrophobic "trailer" 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 The home, which the Pulaskis bought a year ago, is basically two 12-foot-wide 
coaches joined by a 60-square-foot room addition to create a 1,700-square-foot 
living space. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the basics stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I embellished the ceiling with soffits, recessed lighting and crown 
moldings," he said. "Those details take away from the flat, 'blah' ceiling 
look, define the spaces better and make the original ceiling seem higher." 
</P>
<P>
 On the floor, Mexican pavers and coir carpeting were installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the home is on a hill with a panoramic ocean view, Pulaski added large 
plate-glass windows coated to repel the sun and keep the house cool. 
</P>
<P>
 He says the kitchen is the heart of a home and the place where everyone 
congregates, so the wall that boxed in the kitchen and separated it from the 
living room/dining room area came down. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulaski drywalled the whole house -- including the long, narrow room addition 
made by a previous owner. He added both drywall pilasters and ledges beneath 
the windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where the pilasters are were once small structural posts, but I enlarged them 
with drywall to add architectural interest and dimension. They frame the view; 
they don't obstruct it." 
</P>
<P>
 The pilasters and ledges are strictly aesthetic, but they do give the feeling 
of thick walls and a heavy ceiling. In fact, the ceiling is the original metal 
one -- just embellished. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes to the exterior included painting it dark gray, adding window boxes to 
scale and putting white lattice work around the bottom. The changes create a 
sharp, visual contrast and take away from the boxy look of the home. 
</P>
<P>
 The entrance was moved from the front to the side, and exterior pilasters were 
added along the side wall to give a feeling of depth. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these changes, the Pulaskis' home could theoretically still be hauled 
off the lot, because the tongue to tow it is intact. You won't spot it easily, 
though -- it is out of sight and mind, resting under a small sitting area with 
an ocean view.

GOING MOBILE; NO ONE EVER SAID A TRAILER HAS TO LOOK UNSETTLED. THE FACT IS, 
ONCE IN PLACE, MOST NEVER MOVE AGAIN. SOME PEOPLE GIVE A FINAL-DESTINATION LOOK 
TO HOMES THAT ARE ONLY TECHNICALLY STILL ON WHEELS.; THE MOBILE-HOME LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Royal Radtke and Mark Nacker wanted their home to have a distinctive look, but 
they didn't want it to lose its mobileness.  
</P>
<P>
 "We deliberately left the paneled walls and the ceiling the way they were 
originally," said Radtke, manager of the Corona del Mar branch of Bank of 
America. "We picked the walls to go with our furniture, and we like to be 
reminded that we live in a mobile home because we enjoy living here." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years ago, Radtke bought the home new and had it installed on a lot in a 
Newport Beach mobile home park. He found the double-wide unit a more affordable 
way to get the living space he wanted: At 1,100 square feet, the home is 200 
square feet larger than the townhouse he'd been living in. 
</P>
<P>
 Through furnishings, art objects and cosmetic changes, Radtke and Nacker have 
created a sophisticated, urban look. The decor plays on geometric contrasts in 
black, brown, silver and beige. 
</P>
<P>
 Sticking to a color scheme and using all available space (often for two 
purposes) have helped create a home that flows practically and aesthetically. 
</P>
<P>
 Radtke and Nacker installed Berber carpeting and used black linoleum in the 
entry and areas that are heavily walked on. The two flooring styles meet in a 
curving line that visually ties together the rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 In the kitchen they added a stainless steel sink and silver lighting fixtures 
and painted the cabinets white. A collection of stainless steel Italian Alessi 
ware gleams on the stove and on the built-in desk in the kitchen. To add color, 
individually framed pages of Andy Warhol prints from a book act as accents 
along the top of the kitchen cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 The small den area off the kitchen was turned into a media/guest room through 
the addition of a futon. A small bedroom in the back of the home was enlarged 
by taking out windows and adding sliding glass doors and a wood deck. 
</P>
<P>
 Because plumbing and electrical wiring are under the house and easily 
accessible through a crawl space, repairs are often simpler -- and cheaper -- 
than in a conventional home. The access also made it easy to hook up an 
extensive stereo system, Radtke said. Instead of stringing speaker wire all 
over the house, they drilled holes in the floor and ran the wires underneath. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire mobile home is as self-contained and compact as a large yacht, and 
just as shipshape. 
</P>
<P>
 "This mobile home is perfect for our lifestyles because it is easy to clean, 
it's open and airy," Radtke said. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of all that, he points out, there is one more bonus to mobile home 
living: "In case of an earthquake it may fall off its foundation, but I'm not 
going to be hit by any heavy beams."

COMMUNITY FEELING ANCHORS PARKS

<P>
 There are about 200 mobile home parks -- with 53,000 residents -- in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 In most parks, residents buy the coach and lease the land.The value in buying 
over renting the coach comes with the eligibility to deduct mortgage interest 
payments. Usually when a home is sold, it remains on the same lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices vary widely, according to Barbara Humphreys, a real estate agent with 
Cole of Newport who lives in a mobile home and specializes in selling them. 
They can range from $10,000 for a single-wide unit (12 feet) on an inland lot 
to as much as $300,000 for a double-wide one with a view overlooking the ocean 
in San Clemente or the bay in Newport Beach, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of living in a mobile home depends on the size and condition of the 
unit -- the county average resale price is about $40,000 -- and the rent for 
the space on which it rests. Rents average $400 to $500 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 While affordability is often a primary reason for living in a mobile home 
park, many owners say the sense of community and other amenities -- such as 
pools, spas and clubhouses -- add to their desirability. And, in some cases, 
the parks offer spectacular views without the spectacular price that would come 
with a conventional home. 
</P>
<P>
 Because state laws governing mobile homes are different from those that govern 
traditional housing, there are limits on the changes owners can make. Mobile 
homes must officially remain that -- mobile. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the same, in some mobile home parks you can see how a house has gradually 
been built around an original trailer -- sometimes one as small as a silver jet 
stream. KATHY BRYANT

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; TO MATCH A PATCH, USE A 'PRE-STAIN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Q Although labels on most wood fillers say that they're "stainable," I've 
never found one that blends into wood after staining. Is there a way to make 
stain attach to a filler? 
</P>
<P>
 W.O. Garden Grove * 
</P>
<P>
 A You'll never find a filler that will perfectly match wood, says Joe Ragsdale 
of Color Center in La Mirada. However, there is a way to make it look better. 
Mix some of the filler putty with a little of the stain before you apply the 
filler. This "pre-stains" the patch and makes a better blend with the wood. 
This also makes your job messier, but you should get a better finished product. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q We have a small tiled bathroom. Although the tile is in good shape, it's old 
and makes the room look outdated. I'd like to paper the room, since re-tiling 
would be too expensive, but can I paper over tile? 
</P>
<P>
 S.S. Anaheim * 
</P>
<P>
 A It can be done with the right preparation, says Jim Grant of Dutch Boy Home 
Decorating Center in Santa Ana. Blank stock, which is blank wallpaper that's 
used to cover uneven surfaces, can be used over ceramic tile. You have to be 
extra careful to make sure the tile is free of mildew and hard-water deposits 
before applying the paper. On especially slick tile, a primer may have to be 
used to create a surface tacky enough for the wallpaper paste to adhere to. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q I'd like to put a mantel above my fireplace, but in making the measurements, 
I've found the wall is bowed, up to one-quarter inch in places. In the areas 
where there's a slight difference, I can always caulk the gap between the 
mantel and the wall, but what do I do about the wider gaps? 
</P>
<P>
 F.T. Buena Park * 
</P>
<P>
 A You'll probably want to put a piece of molding along the wall across the 
mantel, says Jim Gorman of Rancho Lumber in Westminster. You can either use a 
small rounded molding, such as quarter-round, cove or shoe, or a flat piece 
that would blend into the wall, depending on the look you're trying to get. If 
that's unacceptable, you can have a mantel made that will follow the contour of 
the wall, although it would be more expensive than the kind you can buy off the 
shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q We have a decorative brass hose bib we'd like to put on the outside garden 
faucet near the front door. However, the old hose bib appears to be locked on, 
and I've had no success making it budge with a wrench. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
 W.O. Placentia * 
</P>
<P>
 A Although it's described as "locked," it's most likely been soldered on, says 
Manny Gwartz of B.J. Discount Plumbing & Heating Supply in Garden Grove. You'll 
have to drain the water out of the system at that point and unsolder the valve. 
Decorative bibs are usually threaded, which means an adapter will have to be 
soldered on to the line, giving you the threads that will allow you to screw on 
your new bib. Keep in mind that plumbing solder is different from the kind used 
by hobbyists. It's self-fluxing, which means you need a little more heat to use 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q We're going to put up paneling in our den soon, and from my experience with 
finish carpentry work, I remember how difficult it is to hit the paneling nails 
in without denting the molding or the paneling. Is there a trick to getting 
them in there easily? 
</P>
<P>
 C.C. Irvine * 
</P>
<P>
 A There is a tool that's designed to "push" the nail through the molding or 
paneling and set it in the wood, says Frank Eckert of Arrow True Value Hardware 
in Orange. It's basically a six-inch tube with a wood handle, and it allows you 
to press the nail into the wood surface. This keeps you from making mistakes 
while holding the nail with your fingers and tapping it in. After it's been 
pushed in and it's holding, you can use a nail-set to hammer the nail into 
place.

DISCOVERIES: INSIDE & OUT; BRIGHT IDEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you want to decorate the house for the holidays but find it difficult to 
come up with affordable ideas, author and interior designer Leslie Linsley can 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leslie Linsley's Weekend Decorating: 1,001 Quick Home Decorating Ideas, Tips 
and How-Tos" (about $10, Warner Books) is chock-full of ways to add cheer and 
fa-la-la to your home. 
</P>
<P>
 Linsley uses household items for her creations. 
</P>
<P>
 To gussy up your plants, she suggests spray-painting ordinary plastic pots 
with faux finishes, such as Formby's Granite Finish, then tying a wide red 
ribbon around the pot. Group the pots together around the fireplace hearth, 
going up stairs, in a hall or lining a windowsill for a festive touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Linsley also suggests polishing red and green apples, then cutting a hole in 
the top of each large enough to hold a taper. And voila -- instant 
candleholder! Hot Seat 
</P>
<P>
 Gathering around the fire takes on a new dimension with hearth seating 
arrangements by the Fireplace Man. 
</P>
<P>
 "The benches enable families and their friends to experience intimacy in an 
atypical manner," said Marty Weiss, president of the Cerritos-based company. 
"We have several stock sizes and also do custom work for any style room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do everything for the fireplace from consultation to installation." 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of hearth benches originated in England, where grand, ornate 
mantels and fireplaces are commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular style is a brass base with deep burgundy leather seats, which 
works well in traditional settings. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to those that wrap around the mantel, there are benches that go 
directly in front of the fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 For information on the benches ($800 and up), visit the Fireplace Man's 
showroom, 11239 183rd St., Cerritos, or call (310) 865-6666. Tight Fit 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it's the little things that make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the premise behind the Problem Solvers, a collection of small sinks by 
Bates and Bates of Lakewood, made especially for hard-to-fit areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last couple of years, the need for small-type sinks has grown," said 
Steven Bates, company president, who lives in Newport Beach. "Small sinks are 
especially needed when converting antiques to vanities or if you want to put a 
vanity in a small corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Several styles in ceramic and metal (the sinks start at $145) are available, 
including the popular Jane model. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Jane, you get a sink with lots of width and narrow depth, so it works 
well when the depth is limited," said Bates, whose family started the company 
in 1972 making medicine chests in the garage. "And with a straighter back, you 
have more room to mount faucets and center the spout. With other sinks you have 
to cram them in." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jane sink is 21 inches wide and 15 inches from front to back. 
</P>
<P>
 The line comes in several colors, and they match those offered by 
manufacturers of standard-size products. 
</P>
<P>
 The Problem Solvers can be purchased at Familian Pipe and Supply in Anaheim 
and Costa Mesa, B&C Custom Hardware in Laguna Hills, Bath & Kitchen West in 
Huntington Beach, Bath Co. in Mission Viejo, Eurobath and Tile in Costa Mesa, 
Faucets N' Fixtures in Orange, Golden West Pipe in San Juan Capistrano and 
Stanton, Pacific Sales in Irvine and West End West in Laguna Beach.

COLLECTIBLES: 1,000 MINIATURE CHAIRS IN MANY FORMS SIT WELL WITH DESIGN 
CONSULTANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No one would dare to make a chair from beads, theater ticket stubs, plastic 
forks or wheat stalks -- unless it's a miniature chair such as those in George 
Beylerian's collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Beylerian is a design and marketing consultant in the home and office 
furnishings industry in New York. His first miniature came by way of a trade 
promotion during a trip to Italy in the mid-'80s. It sat alone on a shelf in 
his beach house for a couple of years until, when browsing in a curiosity shop, 
he bought a tiny love seat made of twigs. 
</P>
<P>
 He's added about 1,000 chairs since, all carefully documented and displayed on 
custom shelves that line a room in his New York townhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main idea behind my years of collecting is my interest in exploring the 
tremendous variations in the design of a chair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection ranges from finely crafted early salesman's samples to salt and 
pepper shakers, key chains, pincushions and souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairs in miniature have been made for centuries, said David McFadden, curator 
of decorative arts at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Design in New York. McFadden 
wrote the text for "Chairmania: Fantastic Miniatures," (Abrams, $19.95), a book 
that shows and tells the story of Beylerian's collection. 
</P>
<P>
 A few of the extant miniatures date to the 17th Century, but most are from the 
19th Century or later. In addition to salesman's samples, there are dollhouse 
chairs and toys and models submitted to the U.S. Patent Office between 1836 and 
1880 to support applications for patents, McFadden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beylerian has some 19th-Century miniatures in his collection, but most are of 
more recent vintage. He no longer recalls exactly when he acquired his first 
miniature, but he remembers the circumstances: 
</P>
<P>
 "It was given to me as a trade promotion gift during a trip to Udine, Italy, 
the chair manufacturing capital of the world."  
</P>
<P>
 Although he was slow to start collecting, it ultimately added focus to his 
travels. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave me an excuse to enter any shop, antiques or otherwise, in pursuit of 
my new hobby," Beylerian said. "I had been in chairs all these years, but I had 
never realized that there were so many miniatures. Now, I found them in 
abundant supply, and each find brought a sense of great fulfillment. I became 
passionate about it, and I bought recklessly." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually he drew his family and friends to the hunt, and artists and 
craftsmen began sending chairs as gifts because they wanted their works to be 
part of the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We treat each chair very seriously," Beylerian said. "We give each a number 
and fill in a form indicating condition, materials, where bought and so on." 
</P>
<P>
 He knows about 10 other collectors who, like him, haunt antiques shops and 
junk shops. To some, he said, the thrill of the hunt exceeds the concern for 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, "The moment of gratification comes when the seller asks for a 
ridiculously low price, and I know that I am getting a great bargain."

SAFETY; GUESTS, GLITTER CAN WREAK HAVOC WITH PET'S HOLIDAY CELEBRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This year, try imagining the holidays from your pet's point of view: parties, 
neighbors and friends stopping by, trees, decorations and lights everywhere -- 
even strangers singing carols outside your window. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterinarians tell us dogs and cats crave routine. That means almost 
everything we love about the season creates stress for pets. In addition, the 
holidays can bring special hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterinarians offer a variety of advice to help ensure a safe, happy holiday 
for the family pet. 
</P>
<P>
 Be careful with all that glitters. Cats love playing with tree tinsel. But if 
your pet swallows a strand or two, internal injuries may result. Switch to a 
different decoration if you have rambunctious cats. 
</P>
<P>
 Both dogs and cats may try nibbling on tree lights. To protect everyone from 
electrical shock, install a circuit breaker (sold in hardware stores) at the 
outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday visitors to your house can unleash deep insecurities in your dog. 
"Dogs are pack animals," says Loren Will, who teaches veterinary medicine at 
Iowa State University. "They're continually attempting to understand their 
place in the pack." 
</P>
<P>
 When Aunt Ruth shows up for a few days, Fido tries to figure out how his place 
in the pack (your family) changes. Some dogs snarl or bark before guests even 
reach the front door. You can help curb this behavior by properly introducing 
each newcomer to your pet. 
</P>
<P>
 One way, Will says, is simply to hold your guest's arm as he or she pets your 
dog. To Fido that signals your acceptance of the new arrival. As a loyal member 
of your pack, your dog is likely to accept the newcomer too. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard that garbage. Holiday cooking can prove an irresistible temptation to 
your dog or cat. Around the holidays, veterinarians treat pets that have 
swallowed everything from string used to tie roasts to the foil that tops 
turkeys in the oven. 
</P>
<P>
 When you have finished cooking, take out the trash right away, he advises, and 
batten down the container to ward off neighborhood scavengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pets also can be very accomplished beggars, and feeding from the table 
typically encourages bad habits. But be sure you don't reward your pet's 
persistence with chocolate. It can be deadly to dogs, which can't eliminate one 
of the active ingredients in chocolate from their kidneys. If your dog 
"overdoses," he will become hyperactive and his heart rate will increase in 
about three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Know problem plants. Recent research confirms that poinsettias aren't 
poisonous to dogs or cats, as once was believed. But pets can become seriously 
ill if they nibble on holly or mistletoe. Keep both out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Respect your pet's privacy. Sometimes, all the commotion can be too much, 
particularly for older pets. Visiting youngsters who play rough with your pets 
add to the problem. When your dog or cat heads for his "den" beneath the bed or 
in the basement, it's important to respect his privacy, veterinarians say. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want your cat to seek a safe spot that you -- not the cat -- choose, 
veterinarians advise placing a blanket and a couple of toys in an 
out-of-the-way location, such as a closet. Your cat will get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Give gifts to pets, but don't give pets as gifts. Present a new toy to your 
pet, and he is likely to act as excited as a child. But the reason, most 
veterinarians agree, probably is because of the attention he's getting, rather 
than the gift itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterinarians emphasize that the holidays are a bad time to get or give a new 
pet. Pets acclimate themselves better to new surroundings during a less harried 
time of year, when you'll also have more time to devote to a new pet's needs.

DECOR; COMPANY COMING? YOU'RE COVERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When company is coming and the place is not looking its best, noticeable 
improvements can be made with a little time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tools for quick fixes include ready-made slipcovers, wallpaper borders, even 
seasonal greenery. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest challenge is often the upholstery. Casual slipcovers or throws are 
a quick and inexpensive way to rehabilitate worn or stained pieces of 
furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Throws come in sizes to fit sofas, love seats and easy chairs. Essentially, a 
throw is a large piece of fabric that is tossed over the upholstered piece and 
tucked in around the cushions. It doesn't have the look of a custom cover, but 
the price is right, ranging from $40-$160 depending on size and fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ready-made covers have elastic skirts that slip over the piece at the 
bottom to form a decorative ruffle and hold the cover in place. Tailored skirts 
are also available. Fabrics include damask and chenille, and designs range from 
checks and stripes to florals and geometric prints. Coordinated accessories 
such as pillows, table rounds and valances are also available. 
</P>
<P>
 A large assortment of ready-made covers are available by mail, says Liana 
Toscanini, marketing director for Sure Fit in New York. Also, look for them in 
the domestics sections of retail stores and on TV shopping networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the sofa is covered, what do you do with those scratched tabletops? 
Donna Lang, author of "Decorating With Paper," (Clarkson Potter, $24.95), says 
skirting is the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't even have to sew, because you can cover the table with a sheet and 
puff up the extra material along the floor," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 For coffee tables and small lamp tables that don't lend themselves to such 
treatment, use a table runner. Buy one or make your own. To make one, put right 
sides together on two equal size pieces of fabric. Stitch both sides and one 
end. Turn the runner right-side out and press. Then hand-stitch the open end 
and sew tassels at each of the four corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to cover blemishes is to cut out motifs from greeting cards, 
posters, wrapping paper or magazines and lay them on the table. Then cover this 
collage with a piece of glass cut to fit. 
</P>
<P>
 A dining table with a generous cloth that falls to the floor looks fine no 
matter what its condition beneath the fabric. For holiday decorating, if the 
right size cloth isn't handy, Carl D'Aquino, a decorator in New York, suggests 
making a striped tablecloth of inexpensive white muslin and red cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 He recommends cutting the fabric into 18-inch widths and stitching them 
together. Alternate red and white napkins when setting the table and add a 
centerpiece such as a potted plant and tall red candles. Using a table liner or 
a soft piece of cotton under the tablecloth accentuates the attractiveness of a 
full-length tablecloth. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallpaper borders are rarely thought of as a quick fix, but D'Aquino says a 
colorful border can make a major difference. He suggests a border at least six 
inches wide. Attach it quickly with double-faced tape. Running the border 
around the room creates the best effect, but bordering the living room or 
dining room doorway will set a festive tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, wrap some garlands on the mantel and stair rail, turn down the lights 
and light the candles. The soft glow of candlelight will turn almost any 
interior into a magical environment.

MISTLETOE HAS 1,000 KISSING COUSINS AND REALLY DOES GROW ON TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Peslak of Abilene, Tex., tells why he believes there's more to mistletoe 
than meets the eye -- or the lips: 
</P>
<P>
 Mistletoe. My first memory of it is probably similar to yours. Yes, it 
involves kissing. I was a boy, and my dad was kissed at a neighbor's Christmas 
party. I was surprised, but my mom chuckled and explained that dad was standing 
under a mistletoe sprig. I learned there was more to Christmas tradition than 
Santa Claus! 
</P>
<P>
 After becoming a teacher in Texas, I learned there is much more to learn about 
mistletoe. 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide, there are more than a thousand species of mistletoe, and most are 
found in the tropics. All mistletoe are parasites, taking water and minerals 
from a host plant, usually a tree. Biologists believe mistletoe evolved in 
areas where water was scarce or the soil lacked minerals. 
</P>
<P>
 Many mistletoe are quite different from those used for decorations here in the 
United States. In the Holy Land, mistletoe growing on acacia trees has such 
brilliant red flowers that the tree seems aflame. Some people have thought this 
was Moses' burning bush. Australia has a mistletoe that is treelike and can 
grow to 35 feet. It blooms around the holidays and is Australia's Christmas 
mistletoe. 
</P>
<P>
 My favorite is the juniper mistletoe. It grows on juniper and cypress trees 
from northern Mexico into Texas' trans-Pecos region and on to Oregon. I like it 
because it's beautiful. It has pendulous, leafless clumps and many thin 
branches that remind me of something from a coral reef. 
</P>
<P>
 American mistletoe, also called Christmas mistletoe, grows on trees such as 
oaks, elms, maples, cottonwoods and mesquites from central New Jersey south to 
the Gulf Coast, west to New Mexico and into California. Their broad-leafed 
branches form spherical clumps. One of the largest reported was the size of a 
cow and weighed 50 pounds. Most of the clumps I have seen were the size of 
beach balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Because mistletoe grows on trees, during the 17th and 18th centuries it was 
thought to grow from within the tree. Even today, some folks think it is a 
fungus. It isn't; it's just a lovely plant. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall, mistletoe produces spikes of berries. Within each berry is a seed 
coated with a sticky substance. The berries of American mistletoe are eaten by 
songbirds such as bluebirds and mockingbirds. Some of the seeds stick to the 
birds' bills, but birds are tidy eaters -- they wipe the seed off on a nearby 
branch where it can sprout. Seeds are also deposited in bird droppings. 
</P>
<P>
 For 5,000 years, mistletoe was revered around the world for having special, 
even magical, powers. Why? Probably because in winter, when other plants looked 
dead, the mistletoe, above the ground between heaven and earth, was green and 
bearing fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the wonders attributed to mistletoe were the abilities to find buried 
treasure, keep witches away and prevent trolls from souring milk. 
</P>
<P>
 All that and kissing, too!

DECORATING; ROSE TARLOW SEES BEAUTY IN HOW THINGS WERE, HOW THEY WILL BE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rose Tarlow has become almost a cult figure in the world of interior design. 
Not for decades has a West Coast designer had such a broad impact on interior 
decoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Long in advance of the '90s trend toward simplicity and character, Tarlow 
moved away from highly polished pieces in favor of well-worn but noble 
antiques. 
</P>
<P>
 She anticipated the current preference for monochromatic, off-white rooms and 
has helped make overscaled, traditionally inspired wood furniture -- which she 
designs and manufactures -- into a national trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment mogul David Geffen entrusted her with the multimillion-dollar 
redo of the former Jack Warner mansion he bought for $47.5 million in 1990. 
Barbara Walters lived in a Tarlow-furnished Bel Air house during her marriage 
to television producer Merv Adelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarlow insists she is not a decorator, just an acquisitor of beautiful objects 
who then has to figure out where to put them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rooms that I like the most are the ones in old houses in England and 
France that have been there for centuries," Tarlow said. "What makes a house 
interesting is the way people live in it, how they treat themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarlow was born Rose Khedouri in Shanghai in 1946. Her Sephardic Jewish 
family, originally from Iraq, had flourished in the Far East since the late 
19th Century, part of a wealthy dynasty with diversified business holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents moved into a Fifth Avenue apartment they owned in New York City 
when Rose was 6 months old. The family also owned a summerhouse in Deal, N.J.  
</P>
<P>
 "Even at 6 years old I was very definite about how I wanted my room to be," 
she said. "I painted it pink -- I don't know where I got pink -- and one year I 
insisted that we paint all the furniture pink, too. I don't know why my mother 
let me do that. It was beautiful old furniture." 
</P>
<P>
 During her first marriage, Tarlow had studied at Parsons and the New York 
School of Interior Design. In the late 1960s she and a designer friend opened 
an interior design shop in Englewood, N.J. She moved to Los Angeles in the 
early '70s with her second husband, a California criminal lawyer, from whom she 
is divorced. With $55,000 in seed money, Tarlow opened an antiques shop on 
Melrose Place in the Los Angeles interior design district. 
</P>
<P>
 When, by the late 1980s, prices for high-quality objects became too steep to 
be profitable, she began making original designs and top-of-the-line 
adaptations of antiques. The new furniture became the bulk of her 
multimillion-dollar-a-year business. Her Lord Byron chaise goes for $6,600, for 
instance, and her Louis XVI desk for $16,200. 
</P>
<P>
 For smaller budgets, she is working on new tableware to be introduced next 
year -- cream china edged with a black wreath. Her flatware will be just that 
-- perfectly horizontal cutlery. The fabrics she designed for Scalamandre, also 
available in 1995, reflect her distaste for new-looking things -- she likes 
abraded velvets, muted brocades and tea-dipped linens. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarlow said she wants to be in business only a few more years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to retire so I can spend more time at home, painting and drawing," 
she said. "I want to learn how to blow glass, how to make pottery. It's not for 
any goal -- it's because I want to do it for myself."

ETIQUETTE; WHEN IN DOUBT, SAY SEND A THANK YOU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The holiday season brings up a flurry of etiquette questions ranging from when 
to give a Christmas party to how much to tip service providers. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the Yuletide decorations going up at Thanksgiving or even before," says 
etiquette expert Elizabeth L. Post, "how soon is too soon for a Christmas 
party? It's a question I'm often asked by hostesses eager to avoid conflicts 
with other holiday invitations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no real rule, but unless there is a specific reason for an earlier 
date, I recommend starting the Christmas party season no sooner than Dec. 15." 
</P>
<P>
 If you are new in the neighborhood, inviting the neighbors in for a casual 
gathering and a Christmas open house would be a fine way to start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd avoid more formal dinner invitations, though, until you know people 
better, or they have entertained you," Post says. 
</P>
<P>
 Other questions she has been asked involve the sending of Christmas postcards 
and the use of fancy gift bags instead of traditional Christmas gift wrap. 
</P>
<P>
 Post gave her stamp of approval to both, saying that although the postcards 
"don't quite have the charm of traditional cards, they are an acceptable 
alternative." She found the gift bags very attractive wrappings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank-you" responses for gifts can be a problem. There are, for instance, the 
business gifts from business associates that are essentially thanks for 
services provided during the year. Do they, in turn, require a thank you? The 
answer is yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "An extra thank you never hurts," Post says, "and it is courteous to let the 
senders know that the gifts arrived." 
</P>
<P>
 The same logic applies when you get early delivery of a gift purchased from a 
mail-order catalogue. Thank the sender right away so he or she will know it 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, when your toddler receives gifts, you might write a note, read 
it to your child, then have him or her sign it with an X. 
</P>
<P>
 "This practice will be good training . . . when it comes to writing future 
thank yous," Post says. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday tipping can be a problem, but Post offers these suggestions as 
guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 Postal regulations forbid mail deliverers from accepting tips, but whether you 
wish to offer a gift is up to you -- and to them whether to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 The going rate for tips for baby-sitters, paper carriers, hairstylists and 
others who give you personal service varies according to where you live and the 
extent of service given. Most will genuinely appreciate your generosity.  
</P>
<P>
 Some people, instead of exchanging gifts, prefer to give money to charity. If 
you receive such a message, you are not bound to reciprocate in kind and are 
free to act as you wish -- after you assure them that you think what they are 
doing is admirable. 
</P>
<P>
 If your gift list is getting too long and you want to stop the neighbors from 
sending you fruit or whatever and being obliged to reciprocate, speak up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell your neighbors you have enjoyed their gifts but would like to cut down 
on both giving and receiving," Post says. "Suggest that in the future you just 
exchange cards."

PLANTS; HYBRID GARDENING BRINGS EAST AND WEST TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE REICH, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet," wrote 
Kipling a hundred years ago. Not so, when it comes to gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 Though distance, water and culture kept the gardening worlds of the East and 
the West separate for millennia, the gap began to narrow just over 200 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The first plants to trickle out of China were those that were most accessible 
to foreigners -- cultivated plants growing in and around seaport towns. It was 
not until the middle of the 19th Century that explorers pressed inland to open 
wide the treasure chest of wild and cultivated plants. 
</P>
<P>
 These plant explorers are honored in plants that bear their names: Fortunella 
spp., or kumquats, named for Robert Fortune; Citrus meyerei, the Meyer lemon, 
named for Frank Meyer, and Sinowilsonia spp., named for E.H. (Chinese) Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Far East came plants for which there were no Western counterparts, 
such as the gingko tree. There also came plants that were more, or at least 
equally, valuable as those in the same genera found in the West. Whereas we 
have species of juniper, called red cedar (Juniperus virginiana), from China 
comes the Chinese juniper (J. chinensis). Our juniper turns drab brown in 
winter, but the Chinese species maintains its lush green color throughout the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Common witch hazel (Hamamelis virginiana) and the vernal witch hazel (H. 
vernalis) are shrubs of American forests, and Oriental forests likewise are 
home to Oriental species: the Chinese (H. mollis) and the Japanese (H. 
japonica). The Oriental species blossom at different times than do the American 
species, so they are useful for extending the period of witch hazel bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 Where East really does meet West in gardening is in hybrids of Oriental and 
Occidental species. The hybrid tea rose, grown in American gardens, is one 
example. "Tea" in the name traces back to a tea-scented rose (Rosa odorata) 
from China. 
</P>
<P>
 For centuries, the Chinese hybridized this summer-flowering climber having 
huge yellow flowers with a dwarf form of another species, R. chinensis. In the 
19th Century, these hybrids were further hybridized with European roses to make 
hybrid tea roses. 
</P>
<P>
 American plant breeders sometimes have had to look across the Pacific to find 
plants with resistance to diseases originally brought to America from the 
Orient. 
</P>
<P>
 Chestnut blight turned up at New York's Bronx Zoo in 1906, and within 50 years 
the American chestnut (Castanea dentata) was dead or dying in 7 million acres 
of Appalachian forests. Japanese chestnut (C. crenata) and Chinese chestnut (C. 
mollisima) have evolved with the blight, and so have some resistance to it. 
They have been hybridized with the American species to produce blight-resistant 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Plants of the Orient have even been useful in providing resistance to diseases 
not originating in the Orient. Fire blight disease of pears was first noted in 
New York's Hudson Valley at the end of the 18th Century. Some Oriental pear 
species are resistant to fire blight. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 years ago, hybrids between Oriental and European pears were 
produced -- at first by accident -- which showed some resistance to blight. 
These original hybrids did not taste very good but did make pear-growing 
possible in the blight-prone southeastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is not yet over. Especially in recent decades, the West has sent 
technical expertise in horticulture across the Pacific, while the East 
continues to yield "new" plant treasures.

COLUMN ONE; PROFITING OFF THE FRIGHTENED; PREOCCUPATION WITH SAFETY HAS FUELED

OF MANIPULATING EMOTIONS AS OFTEN AS THEY ARE PRAISED FOR DEVISING SOLUTIONS.

<P>
 For James E. Winner Jr., crime -- and the fear it spawns -- most assuredly 
pays. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Winner has sold women's clothing, chemicals and keyboard 
organs. But it took a steel steering-wheel lock, designed to prevent car theft, 
to make his fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 The lock -- shaped something like a police nightstick and called, 
appropriately, the Club -- first came on the market in 1986. It was distributed 
by Winner and a secretary from this fraying steel town in the hills north of 
Pittsburgh. Now, 14 million Clubs and what seems like an equal number of "I'm- 
not- an- actor- I'm- a- police- officer" ads later, he conducts business from 
the highest floor of a four-story building with a huge rooftop sign that reads 
"The Winner." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, he employs 250. His firm, Winner International, was named to Inc. 
magazine's latest list of the fastest-growing companies in America. And his 
core product is so well-known that David Letterman drew hoots and applause when 
he drove off in a Club-equipped golf cart during a TV skit last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf carts, in fact, may be the only vehicles for which Winner doesn't try to 
sell protection. He offers the Truck Club, the Boat Club, even the Bike Club. 
And with the FBI reporting more random murders than ever and with fright 
growing faster than violence itself, Winner is moving into the personal safety 
field: Pepper spray. Carry-along alarms. An electronic device aimed at 
carjackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Winner is an expert at reading a national psyche preoccupied with crime. 
While he is an acknowledged master, many others are mining the same surge of 
emotion that has Americans scrambling for safety in a society on the edge. From 
bulletproof wall treatments to Doberman-In-A-Can chemical sprays, the security 
industry is booming: about $300 million annually in sales of non-lethal weapons 
and $6 billion for alarms. Some estimates of the total spent by the frightened 
go as high as $50 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's also no doubt that this is a big untapped market," says Rosemarie 
Kitchin, an automotive public relations expert, in the trade journal 
Aftermarket Business. Analysts expect growth of 30% to 50% over the next 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Even cellular phones and pagers are being touted as safety devices (just call 
for help if attacked). Mortgage companies include circulars about alarm systems 
in the envelope with the monthly payment coupon. Drugstore chains hold 
protection-theme sales. 
</P>
<P>
 At the intersection of fear and commerce, cause and effect are difficult to 
separate. As do politicians and the media, businesses that deal in the fallout 
from crime stand accused of manipulating emotions as often as they are praised 
for putting forth solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The cautionary voices come from academics and consumer advocates. The majority 
of offerings on the crowded market, priced anywhere from $30 to $3,000, are 
"largely a waste of money," says USC criminologist Marcus Felson. He believes 
that the most effective crime prevention is building design and neighborliness. 
Another free weapon is common sense: locking doors, strengthening your fist by 
gripping your keys between each finger, requesting a parking lot escort at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he knows the public is responding to the entrepreneurs' pitches. 
"Salesmen aren't going to bother selling something if nobody's going to buy 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such receptivity is relatively new. Fred Benford can recall the 1980s when he 
was executive vice president for an auto-alarm company whose ads showed police 
arresting a car thief. Informal surveys and the reaction of buyers for national 
store chains quickly turned up "a negative reaction," Benford said. "They were 
saying 'I don't believe it.' 'It's not going to happen to me.' 'You're trying 
to scare me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Benford is general manager of 100+ Motoring Accessories, a new security 
products division of Anaheim-based Coyote Enterprises -- which until recent 
years was devoted to the sale of lugs and lug nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Benford has discovered that "Fear sells. They say, 'I am scared.' " The 
packaging for one of his company's alarms shows a thief running away from a 
car. Another box, he said, pictures "a man -- it probably should be a woman -- 
pressing a panic alarm that sounds to scare away somebody standing near the 
car." 
</P>
<P>
 Sensing riches to be reaped, inventors are besieging Dewey Stokes, the 
national president of the Fraternal Order of Police, to review their creations 
for endorsement. Stokes often finds himself at once appalled and amused. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy," he said, laughing, "wanted us to endorse an electric field he could 
put around a car. If someone got too close, they'd get a shock." (Thumbs down 
from Stokes.) 
</P>
<P>
 Winner's son and vice president of sales, James B. Winner, worries that the 
respectability of the industry as a whole could be endangered by the rush. 
"There are a lot of inferior products out there," he said, "and a lot of patent 
infringement." 
</P>
<P>
 The usefulness of the Club itself has been a controversial question. Company 
spokesman Tom McCartney noted that the product has undergone several design 
changes as thieves find its vulnerabilities. The steel is now tempered to a 
higher standard, for example, to better withstand an assault by Freon, a gas 
that made the metal brittle enough to shatter. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Consumer Reports magazine notes "we could easily slice through the 
steering wheel and slip the lock off like a ring from a finger." Consumer 
reporter David Horowitz calls the Club "useful as a deterrent," though he adds 
that "if a professional really wants your car, if he's filling an order, it 
won't stop him. Nothing will." 
</P>
<P>
 What is not in question is the elder Winner's talent for tapping into fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio broadcaster Paul Harvey "did so much for us" as a spokesman, Winner 
said, "because he would say, 'You may live in an area that's safe but I bet you 
drive to the city sometime. I bet you go to the ballgame sometime.' " In 
essence, he gave people something to be afraid of. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner's ads for the Door Club -- a removable barrier said to withstand more 
than a ton of force -- do not feature a burglar attempting to enter an empty 
house, by far the most common trespassing situation. Instead, a family cowers 
in the living room as an attacker slams against the door. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a local dairy farmer, Jim Winner, 65, grew up six miles from here 
in a valley far removed from the urban hotbeds of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, his Cadillac was stolen from the lot of the small hotel he owned. 
Winner says the theft reminded him of his days as a soldier in Korea, when he 
was ordered to secure Jeeps with a padlock and chain every time he parked. 
Based on that memory, he says, an Ohio mechanic named Charles Johnson built 
prototypes of various Club concepts until one worked. 
</P>
<P>
 In federal court in Akron last year, Johnson told a different story, claiming 
that he was the true inventor of the Club. After a jury sided with Johnson but 
before a judgment was reached, Winner agreed to pay a settlement of $10.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Winner is free to continue his marketing barrage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody told me, 'Jim, you ought to get ahold of Connie Francis,' " he said 
recently, hands clasped together prayerfully as he sat at the head of a 
conference table. "Remember the Connie Francis case?" The actress won a 
settlement of nearly $1.5 million from the Long Island motel where she was 
raped in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a great idea," Winner mused. "Connie Francis for the Door Club." 
</P>
<P>
 If stimulating fear is one key part of the equation, cultivating a reputation 
for expertise and authority is the flip side. Winner, recalling the old Bayer 
aspirin commercials that boasted "Nine out of 10 doctors agree . . . ," decided 
he would use police to sell the Club. His first recruit, Sharon policeman Jack 
Klaric, became a star of sorts and got stopped on the street for autographs. 
Klaric's testimonial was scripted and he was paid a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The national Fraternal Order of Police also endorsed the Club. Winner has made 
donations to the organization but says they were unrelated to the testimonial. 
A Los Angeles police officer who endorsed the Club was given "a small 
distributorship" after his retirement, Winner said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 cities also have started Community CarWatch campaigns -- 
coordinated by CarWatch of America out of Winner's Sharon address. Police hold 
seminars to raise awareness about auto theft and the Club is sold at a discount 
by community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The project began in 1992 when Othal Brand, the mayor of McAllen, Tex., wrote 
to Winner requesting Clubs to sell in his city of 90,000, which had been hit by 
a 73% increase in car thefts. "I heard about the Club through their people; I'm 
not sure what they were doing here," Brand said. "We worked out a deal with 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Winner sold 21,000 Clubs in McAllen in 1993. Auto theft dropped by 50%. "We 
worked on law enforcement as well, but we can attribute most of it to (the 
Club)," Brand said. "It is not absolutely theft-proof, but it is effective. The 
Club makes it a little bit harder." He added an unsolicited comment: "I didn't 
get paid." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The project's success inspired Winner to survey 1,000 police criminal 
prevention officers to see if they would be interested in an education program 
that is, in the words of company spokesman McCartney, "built around the Club." 
Cities from Irondequoit, N.Y., to Huntington Park have signed on. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon, population 20,000, is not involved in CarWatch. But here on the banks 
of the Shenango River, the town is a showcase for Winner's marketing savvy. 
</P>
<P>
 Six cars, including a bright-red 1977 Corvette, hang upside down in the Quaker 
Steak and Lube restaurant on Chestnut Street. They all sport Clubs, courtesy of 
Winner. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ground floor of The Winner Building is a women's clothing store -- a 
Winner-owned venture that donates its profits to charity. Near the pianist, by 
a rack of velvet and rhinestone cocktail dresses, stands a display of Clubs in 
designer colors and a rack of Club pepper spray. 
</P>
<P>
 Each guest room of the local Winner-owned Radisson Hotel is protected by a 
Door Club. Ditto at Tara, an antebellum-themed resort nearby which he also 
owns. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner's ambitions, of course, extend far beyond his hometown. He can see it 
all: Door Clubs in the Chicago Housing Authority's crime-wracked high-rise 
housing projects. A device to protect car stereos ("We really worked on this 
but have found nothing that's aesthetically acceptable. We could activate a 
pepper spray that would stop 'em cold."). Clubs on rental cars. Clubs at 
new-car lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "In five years," Winner said, "I want to be a $1-billion company" -- up from 
$150 million today. "And it's doable," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary markets for the Club have been in California and in the East Coast 
megalopolises. But as crime and awareness of crime spread to the second-tier 
cities, the Winners see great potential for sales surges across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years, Jim Winner had his eye on the newspaper accounts and 
television attention devoted to carjackings. Now, he's come up with a way, he 
thinks, to combat this new breed of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Winner plans to 
introduce the Wizard, which will cost several hundred dollars and need 
professional installation. 
</P>
<P>
 He had a hard time containing his glee when he described it. "It's electronic, 
you carry it with you away from your keys," Winner said. "If you get carjacked, 
your car is running and you just get out. It requires no effort on your part. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get 20 feet away, and the car goes a mile or two down the road, and then 
starts shutting down, like it's running out of gas. You're not around when it 
happens. We can make the doors lock, so the carjacker's in there." 
</P>
<P>
 His face reddened and he leaned forward. "We can make the lights start 
blinking on and off! We can make the horn start honking!" 
</P>
<P>
 Voila. Jim Winner smiled proudly.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; ACCOUNTING FIRM FAILED TO DETECT FUND'S PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 KPMG Peat Marwick -- one of the giant accounting firms that got into trouble 
for failing to flag the problems that led to the nation's savings and loan 
debacle -- had been asked for the past two years to pay special attention to 
the Orange County treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But a December, 1993, letter accompanying last year's audit said the firm 
detected only one problem -- one that already had been spotted years earlier, 
involving wire transfers on behalf of county departments. 
</P>
<P>
 There was not a word about Treasurer Robert L. Citron's investment practices, 
which a year later led the county into the nation's biggest municipal 
bankruptcy filing ever. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's audit, which normally would have been made public by this time, 
has been held up at the request of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Peat Marwick spokesman Kevin Kelly said Friday that the firm stands by its 
work for the county. He said Peat Marwick was asked only to look at the 
county's investment portfolio -- not Citron's policies. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kelly acknowledged that as part of the firm's regular audit of the county, 
"when you conduct an overall audit, you do look for weaknesses in controls." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Board of Accountancy, which regulates accountants and auditors, 
may look into Peat Marwick's county audits, board executive officer Carol 
Sigmann said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we're gathering facts. If the facts indicate that it's 
appropriate to investigate them, we will investigate," Sigmann said. "I would 
say any firm, auditor or accountant involved in this process is going to be 
under scrutiny until this whole matter is resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Although none have actually filed suit, lawyers for investors in the county's 
bankrupt pool and for buyers of county bonds are beginning to talk about Peat 
Marwick as partly responsible for the county's financial calamity and a 
potential "deep pocket" defendant in a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In its capacity as the county's independent auditor for the past three years, 
they argue, Peat Marwick should have paid greater attention to the treasurer's 
investment operations, which previous internal audits had found to be marred by 
violations of state laws and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 And by the time Peat Marwick began its latest audit, a political rival of 
Citron had publicly claimed that the treasurer's investment strategies had lost 
$1.2 billion of taxpayers' money. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can bet that we will be examining this . . . and the extent that problems 
were ignored," said Mel Weiss, an attorney who has filed a class-action suit on 
behalf of bondholders who purchased a series of Orange County bonds sold last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the worldwide accounting firm have contributed more than $9,000 
to the campaigns of incumbents and candidates for the Board of Supervisors over 
the last 15 years. Those donations -- calculated in a review by The Times of 
campaign finance reports -- raised questions among independent analysts about 
whether the auditors had kept at arm's length from county officials whose 
operations they were auditing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Independent auditors are supposed to be independent -- in fact and 
appearance," said John Larsen, a USC professor of accounting. "This appears to 
be a monetary form of schmoozing." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Herb Finkston, director of professional ethics for the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants, said there are no professional 
guidelines prohibiting such contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't exclude an auditor from the political process simply because he's 
an auditor," Finkston said. "In any event, we're talking about appearances. 
It's really nothing more than some evidence of a relationship which is 
inconclusive." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly declined to say whether the firm had a critical internal audit of the 
treasurer's office for 1991 in hand as it conducted its audit in 1993, the year 
that the internal audit was issued. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not engaged to do an investigation into internal controls of the 
treasurer's office," he said. "We stand by our management letters issued for 
fiscal years 1992 and 1993. They're appropriate and consistent with an 
independent accountant's professional obligations." 
</P>
<P>
 County Auditor Steven A. Lewis said he made a "special request" that Peat 
Marwick take a closer look at the investment portfolio in its 1993 and 1994 
county audits. Despite the request, Lewis said, the auditors' findings do not 
contain a thorough analysis of the investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't contract with them to make a detailed analysis of the portfolio. On 
the other hand, because there had been concerns, you just say, 'Look at this 
particular area'; then they spend a couple of extra hours on it," he said. "For 
the last two audits, that has been a special request." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis said he wanted "to be fair" to Peat Marwick, but noted that independent 
auditors are supposed to assess internal controls.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just like I do in my audit, they have to assess internal controls," he said. 
". . . They have professional standards that they have to go on, just like I 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time the thoroughness of Peat Marwick's audits has been 
questioned in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm paid $200,000 in October to settle a claim that it failed to discover 
a multimillion-dollar embezzlement by Stephen Wagner, the former finance 
director of the Newport-Mesa Unified School District. Under Peat Marwick's 
watch -- or that of firms it later bought -- more than $1.7 million 
disappeared, said Michael Fine, district director of fiscal services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The audit wasn't adequately planned, and the sample size wasn't adequate" to 
catch the problems, Fine said. Peat Marwick -- which acted as the district's 
outside auditor from June, 1982, to July, 1988 -- settled with Newport-Mesa 
before a suit was filed, admitting no wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 After discrepancies in the district's books were discovered, Wagner was 
arrested and ultimately convicted of embezzling a total of $3.7 million. He is 
still in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-based firm, one of the "Big Six" accounting practices, also has 
repeatedly been taken to task for failing to catch problems as the nation's 
savings and loan scandal unfolded. 
</P>
<P>
 Peat Marwick agreed to pay the federal government $185.6 million in August to 
settle allegations that its work played a role in the failure of several 
savings institutions dating back to the 1980s. Two of the failed financial 
institutions were in Orange County: Costa Mesa-based Pacific Savings Bank, 
seized by regulators in 1989, and Orange-based Ramona Savings & Loan, taken 
over in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Accounting and legal experts say Peat Marwick, one of the world's largest 
accounting firms, should have spotted the problems in Citron's office in the 
course of normal auditing practices. 
</P>
<P>
 While they agree that no auditor is expected to act as an investment adviser, 
they say part of an auditor's responsibility is to look at the potential risks 
for an organization's major assets -- in Orange County's case, its 
multibillion-dollar investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Auditors should, as a matter of practice, take into account every bit of 
internal documentation that would point to problems, including previous 
internal audits, these experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think they would take a look at what the risks were," said Larsen, 
who specializes in ethics and professional standards for accountants. 
</P>
<P>
 Some accounting experts said the competition for clients has caused auditors 
in general to go easy on their clients in hopes of keeping them happy -- and 
getting their contracts renewed, though none had a basis for raising such 
allegations against Peat Marwick for its work in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the environment hasn't been so good," said Don Kirk, former 
chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board and recently the chairman 
of a panel that looked into the independence of auditors for the American 
Institute of Certified Public Accountants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The competition for clients sometimes causes them to maybe lose sight of 
their public responsibility," Kirk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, the securities lawyer, said that it would be unconscionable for an 
auditing firm not to review internal controls or violations of investment 
rules, regulations and policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The import here is that the auditors say that they don't have the 
responsibility that the rest of us think they have," Weiss said.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SEC COULD HAVE AVERTED CRISIS, SUPERVISORS SAY; 
BANKRUPTCY: ORANGE COUNTY OFFICIALS BLAME FEDERAL AGENCY FOR NOT SOUNDING ALARM 
AFTER APRIL MEETING WITH EX-TREASURER, AND FOR REFUSING TO FREEZE TROUBLED 
FUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Orange County supervisors, blindsided this week by a slew of subpoenas from 
the Securities and Exchange Commission, struck back at the federal agency 
Friday, charging that the SEC could have prevented the county's financial 
debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Some board members questioned why the SEC failed to step in last spring, after 
questioning the county's treasurer. And they are angry that the agency refused 
to freeze the county's investment fund earlier this month before the county was 
forced into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We asked them for help and they said, 'No, hands off, we're not going to do 
anything,' " said Supervisor Roger R. Stanton. "Now the only thing they have 
done, from the lips of the chairman, is to start throwing rocks." 
</P>
<P>
 SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. criticized the board this week in a Los Angeles 
speech, suggesting that Orange County taxpayers "throw out the whole bunch" for 
placing the public's savings in such speculative investments. SEC officials 
have launched a broad investigation of county leaders and the brokerages that 
underwrote county bonds and sold investments to the now-bankrupt fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors complained that SEC investigators met with then-Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron earlier this year to discuss the once-$20-billion 
fund's high-risk investment strategy -- which involved short-term borrowing to 
buy long-term bonds and complex "derivative" securities -- but failed to alert 
the board to any trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the fact that they were looking at Citron's investments in April, what 
responsibility do they, as a regulatory agency, have to make the public aware?" 
asked Supervisor William G. Steiner. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Supervisors approved a plan to start distributing cash to schools, cities 
and other agencies in danger of not making payroll and other crucial payments. 
The board's action, subject to approval by a bankruptcy judge, would release up 
to $153 million in now-frozen funds for "urgent and essential needs" among 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Santa Ana city officials lobbied furiously for the right to withdraw $9.8 
million from the fund, one day after defaulting on a debt service payment for 
the city's massive jail construction project. City Manager David N. Ream said 
that if the city does not get the $5.3 million it was supposed to pay Thursday, 
plus $4.5 million to pay December contractors' fees, officials will be forced 
to halt the project. 
</P>
<P>
 * San Diego County's treasurer announced a $357-million "paper loss" in that 
county's investment fund, blaming risky investments similar to those Citron 
purchased. The treasurer asked local agencies not to pull money out of the fund 
for fear of starting a run. 
</P>
<P>
 * Salomon Bros., the investment house now assisting Orange County, auctioned 
another $1 billion in fund-owned securities on the market, part of the 
court-approved liquidation of the county's remaining portfolio, which stood at 
$7.96 billion early in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Citron has been called to testify at an SEC hearing in Los Angeles on Jan. 
20, sources said. He is expected to be quizzed about his relationship with 
various brokers who did business with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * The family of Laura Small -- a 13-year-old-girl who received a $1.6-million 
settlement from the county after she was mauled by a mountain lion in a 
much-publicized attack at a county park in 1986 -- sued county officials 
Friday. The Smalls had $90,000 in the county fund. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Tustin Unified School District board approved $1 million in cutbacks -- 
the amount the district has frozen in the county pool. The board imposed a 
hiring freeze on substitute teachers and teacher aides and delayed buying new 
textbooks and other instructional materials until June.  
</P>
<P>
 * School officials said Foothill Ranch Elementary would open as scheduled Jan. 
3, despite an announcement earlier in the week that the bankruptcy had put the 
school's opening on indefinite hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Other good news came as the supervisors announced that money would be made 
available as soon as Monday for public agencies that have been struggling since 
Dec. 6, when the county became the nation's largest municipality ever to file 
for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, fund investors initially would receive up to 30% of their 
original investment in the county fund for emergency needs. That allotment 
eventually would be deducted from their total share, which will depend on the 
money recovered from the fund's ill-fated investments, said Bruce Bennett, the 
county's bankruptcy attorney. Emergency Funds 
</P>
<P>
 According to the agreement -- which must be approved by a federal judge -- 
agencies would each receive a designated amount to cover specific expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools would receive the largest amount, $115 million, to meet payroll and 
pay vendors. The Transportation Corridor Agency would get $20.6 million by Dec. 
22 for contract work on the Foothill and San Joaquin Hills toll roads. The 
county intends to withdraw $25.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Other creditors also would be given funds to meet payroll and bills, with the 
city of Anaheim receiving $8.5 million, the Orange County Water District $4.6 
million, the Orange County Transportation Authority $3 million and the Orange 
County Sanitation District $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Paul Possemato of the Laguna Beach Unified School District said Friday 
he was "very pleased" to hear that the supervisors had taken action toward 
meeting the pressing needs of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Local superintendents "have been waiting for a cash flow response (from the 
county) for about a week now," Possemato said. "This will give more assurance 
to our employees that while the solutions are difficult, there's an attempt to 
meet our needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Some attorneys representing cities, schools and special districts have 
suggested that state law defines the county pool as a simple trust fund, 
requiring the county to repay investing agencies in full before withdrawing any 
money for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fund itself was essentially a bank account," said Ronald Rus, who 
represents three cities and three water districts in the case.  
</P>
<P>
 The trust fund provision of the law states that "when any public entity or any 
public official . . . who is required or authorized by law to deposit funds in 
the county treasury, makes a deposit, those funds shall be deemed to be held in 
trust. . . . The funds shall not be deemed funds or assets of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Trustee Marcy J.K. Tiffany acknowledged Friday that state law describes 
the county treasury as a trust fund, but dismissed as "shortsighted" and "very 
dangerous" the idea that this law means other investors should get 100% before 
the county takes a penny. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is certainly a California code section that provides that these are 
trust funds," said Tiffany, who is overseeing the case for the federal 
Bankruptcy Court. "That's all it does. It says nothing about recovering money 
first. This is an argument that somebody's been throwing out there, and I think 
it's a terrible idea. It's self-defeating and contrary to the whole goal of 
what we're doing here." 
</P>
<P>
 If all other investors were repaid in full, the county could lose about 
three-quarters of the nearly $3 billion it has tied up in the fund. The market 
value of the fund's remaining investments, minus loans yet to be repaid, was 
estimated at $5.4 billion this week -- a 27% decline from what investors 
originally put in. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it would amount to is suicide. It's like choking yourself with your own 
hand," Tiffany said. "How can entities within the county (survive) if the 
county isn't functioning? The county has to be viable. The county has to be 
able to sell bonds. The county has to be able to raise money. If the county 
can't do that, the county will wither and die." 
</P>
<P>
 While a plan was put in place to distribute the money, Orange County continued 
its efforts Friday to sell off its troubled portfolio and garner cash for its 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The county on Friday sold longer-term U.S. government agency bonds with a 
principal value of $566 million at prices ranging from 96 cents to 98.75 cents 
on the dollar. Salomon also sold $440 million in foreign bank-issued 
"derivative" securities -- the first of the more complex securities that are to 
be liquidated. 
</P>
<P>
 Including the $483 million in bonds sold on Thursday, Salomon now has unloaded 
$1.49 billion in securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon executives concede that they are racing the clock to sell the rest of 
the portfolio, as the holidays thin the ranks of investment professionals 
willing to take time to look at the securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokerage's ability to unload the derivatives at fair prices is key to 
assuring that fund investors get back 73 cents for each $1 they invested -- the 
recovery estimate Salomon gave earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased with the results" of the auctions, said Thomas W. Hayes, the 
former state treasurer who is advising the county. "However, we are still in a 
very risky position and will move prudently to continue to remove those risks." 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors were optimistic about the sales, but they smoldered Friday 
over the SEC's handling of the county's fiscal crisis. SEC Involvement 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC first looked at the Orange County pool last April, when Citron's 
investment practices became an issue in his reelection campaign. At the time, 
Citron was locked in a contentious battle and his opponent accused him of 
unwisely gambling with the public's money as interest rates shot up. 
</P>
<P>
 After speaking with Citron, SEC officials reported that they found his 
strategies risky, though not illegal, sources told The Times this week. But the 
officials also said they had assurances that there was government oversight of 
the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, when Citron announced the initial "paper loss" to his 
fund, SEC investigators were back at the Hall of Administration, spending the 
weekend before the county declared bankruptcy poring over documents relating to 
the portfolio. In the days since the bankruptcy, the SEC has widened its probe 
of the county's financial dealings, serving subpoenas on all five supervisors 
Wednesday, seeking bank statements, diaries and other personal records. Citron 
also was subpoenaed.  
</P>
<P>
 The relationship has been contentious from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Steiner accused the SEC of refusing the county's pleas for help so 
it could use the fund's failure as a lobbying argument to increase its 
regulatory powers. The SEC's William McLucas decried the allegation as 
"absolutely absurd," saying: "Somebody must have been smoking something or 
dropped in from planet Mars." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley was still upset Friday after hearing 
about Levitt's speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I read this I felt maybe we should challenge his qualifications for what 
he is doing," Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley lashed out about implications that board members may have taken 
kickbacks from bond dealers. "It's a complete insult," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Jodi Wilgoren, Dan Weikel, Chris Woodyard, Greg Johnson, 
Julie Marquis, Lee Romney and Tom Petruno, and correspondents Jeff Bean and 
Hope Hamashige in Orange County, contributed to this report.

<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission, which has launched a broad inquiry 
into possible influence peddling in Orange County government, is a powerful 
regulatory agency. It was established in 1934, with origins traceable to the 
stock market crash of 1929. SEC COURSES OF ACTION 
</P>
<P>
 SEC probes are fact-finding missions that can eventually lead to civil or 
criminal prosecution. Here's how: 
</P>
<P>
 INVESTIGATION 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation includes interviews and examinations of brokerage data and 
other documents. If possible fraud or other violation of law is found, the law 
provides for the three possible courses below. 
</P>
<P>
 CIVIL INJUNCTION 
</P>
<P>
 The commission may ask a U.S. district court for an order stopping practices 
that the SEC says violate the law or commission rules. 
</P>
<P>
 CRIMINAL PROSECUTION 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC may refer the facts to the Justice Department, recommending 
prosecution. Local U.S. attorneys then present evidence to a grand jury for an

U.S. MILITARY COPTER DOWN IN NORTH KOREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A U.S. helicopter crashed in North Korean territory this morning, and 
Pyongyang immediately said its troops had shot it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial reports from Seoul indicated that the two crew members survived the 
crash. It was not immediately clear whether they were in North Korean hands. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. military spokesman in Seoul said the U.S. Army OH-58 scout helicopter 
landed three miles north of the Demilitarized Zone near Wontong in the North's 
Kangwon province. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe there were two crew members on board. It seems they landed not of 
their own will but due to aviational error," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter was on a "check ride" flight from a base in South Korea, a 
routine flight that can involve crew proficiency training or maintenance, a 
Pentagon spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said he had no confirmation of 
North Korea's claim that it had shot down the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are listing it as an emergency landing. Our information is preliminary and 
partial," Bacon said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he had no immediate information about the two crew members aboard the 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reports are obviously preliminary, and we are investigating to find more 
information as fast as possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. official said American forces lost radar contact with the helicopter at 
11:15 a.m. today local time. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to provide details of any possible U.S. response but said there 
had been no movement of U.S. troops or ships to the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The North's official Korean Central News Agency, in a report monitored in 
Tokyo, declared that "the helicopter was brought down at one shot in the area 
of our side in a self-defensive measure of the anti-air gunners of the Korean 
People's Army, who were vigilantly guarding the air space of our socialist 
Motherland." 
</P>
<P>
 The South Korean Defense Ministry said the helicopter had been flying near the 
border when it entered northern air space for reasons that were not immediately 
clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Pyongyang's KCNA reported that "a helicopter of the enemy illegally flew deep 
into the air above the Ipho-ri area of Kumgang County in Kangwon province at 
10:45 a.m., crossing the military demarcation line in the eastern sector of the 
front." 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea's Yonhap news agency quoted an unidentified military source as 
saying that apparently neither of the two crewmen were injured. It did not say, 
however, where the crewmen were. 
</P>
<P>
 Yonhap said the helicopter crash-landed about three miles north of the 
northern sector of the 2.5-mile-wide DMZ that has separated the capitalist 
South and the Communist North since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
 The OH-58 is a light helicopter that can be used for reconnaissance or attack 
purposes. The two-seater craft was on a routine reconnaissance mission, Yonhap 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 37,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense 
treaty.

RUSSIA GENERAL TELLS CHECHENS: WE WON'T SHOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG and RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The commander of one of three Russian tank columns sent to subdue the 
breakaway Chechnya republic said Friday that his men will not advance further 
or open fire on civilians regardless of what orders he receives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our bosses may curse us, but we won't shoot," Maj. Gen. Ivan Babichev told 
hundreds of unarmed villagers who blocked their way 20 miles west of this rebel 
capital. "And please, don't let (the rebels) shoot either. . . . We really want 
everything to be peaceful so the tanks will leave with flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 Babichev's emotional speech was the most dramatic sign of wavering and dissent 
in Moscow's largest military operation since the disastrous Soviet war in 
Afghanistan -- one aimed at crushing the self-declared independence of a tiny 
ethnic republic of 1.2 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (operation) contradicts the constitution," the general added. "It is 
forbidden to use the army against peaceful civilians. It is not our fault. We 
did not want this."  
</P>
<P>
 The army's sluggish, hesitant advance on Grozny prompted Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin on Thursday to extend to midnight tonight a deadline for 
Chechen secessionist fighters to surrender their weapons.  
</P>
<P>
 Fighting all but stopped Friday as Chechnya's Muslim secessionist leader 
ordered his warriors to pull back to this capital and joined Yeltsin in calling 
a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was unclear whether a new round of peace talks proposed by both leaders 
would materialize before the midnight deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin said Yeltsin authorized him to meet with 
Chechnya's separatist president, Gen. Dzhokar M. Dudayev, but added that 
thousands of Russian troops closing in on Grozny, the rebel capital, "will go 
to the end" to enforce the ultimatum -- a mission for which the troops appeared 
unenthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudayev announced that he was ready to hold "high-level talks without 
preconditions" but demanded that Russia withdraw the troops, who entered 
Chechnya on Sunday. Lower-level peace talks broke down Wednesday when Moscow 
refused to pull the soldiers out. 
</P>
<P>
 Chernomyrdin summoned Russia's defense, interior and counterintelligence 
chiefs to an evening session of the Security Council to plot the next move. 
</P>
<P>
 This decaying industrial city awoke Friday to a 30-minute barrage of artillery 
fire on its northern outskirts, then experienced a tense lull. About half of 
Grozny's 400,000 residents have fled, leaving thousands of hard-core resisters 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Freedom or death! Chechnya is a subject of Allah," declared a giant chalk 
marker on the road into Grozny from the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's Interior Ministry, in an estimate that appears conservative, said 
13,000 Chechens were armed for the fight -- with 100 tanks and armored 
personnel carriers, 40 big antiaircraft guns and 50,000 firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 While portraying Chechnya as an internal Russian problem, the Clinton 
Administration has expressed concern about its explosive potential here in 
Russia's Caucasus Mountains, a volatile, ethnically mixed area close to Turkey 
and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Vice President Al Gore and Defense Secretary William J. Perry met in 
Moscow with Russian leaders Friday and said the Kremlin was trying to resolve 
the conflict with a minimum of bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I got the clear impression that they very much prefer a negotiated outcome 
there, if it is possible," Gore said after talks with Chernomyrdin and Yeltsin. 
"We have urged negotiations. We are following it carefully. It's immensely 
complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry said Russian defense officials briefed him on their tactics in Chechnya, 
but he declined to talk about them. 
</P>
<P>
 The occupation of Chechnya has set off a storm of protest in Russia, isolating 
Yeltsin with a small circle of hard-liners. Calls for peace swelled Friday, 
joined by the Russian Orthodox patriarch and Chechnya's Muslim religious 
leader, who met in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps to give peace a chance, or perhaps to give his troops time to position 
themselves for war, Yeltsin on Thursday extended the disarmament deadline by 48 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian field commanders, while waging sporadic combat against Chechens 
resisting their advance, have been saying all week that they do not intend to 
attack the city. 
</P>
<P>
 While aimed at winning goodwill in a hostile place, such comments raise doubts 
about how much force Russia's troops and commanders would be willing to use if 
peace efforts fail and they were ordered to enter the rebel capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Russian soldiers taking part in the occupation have expressed outright 
opposition to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mood among the (Russian) soldiers is despondent," one tank commander told 
the newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda. "Once again, the army is being used to cover 
the sins of politicians. It is like Afghanistan for us here." 
</P>
<P>
 At least 15 Russian soldiers have been killed in Chechnya this week, and 20 
more are being held prisoner. Reporters have counted scores of civilian 
casualties in Russian shelling and air attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian government moved Friday to tighten its control on information from 
Chechnya. It ordered Russian media to carry official accounts of fighting along 
with their own, and warned foreigners to stay out of Chechnya for their own 
safety.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; BROKER HANDLED 3 OTHER FAILED BOND DEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZI; JODI WILGOREN, REAUX, ; MARK ARAX, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The broker who persuaded Orange County schools and cities to borrow millions 
to funnel into risky investments also played a key role in at least three other 
bond deals in California that collapsed, one of which is being investigated by 
the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment banker Kenneth D. Ough, 42, has handled hundreds of routine deals 
for schools and cities up and down the state that have met with success. But 
public records and interviews show that on occasion, Ough has exhibited a knack 
for finding new financial approaches and testing the untried. And while he and 
the firms he has worked for have earned six-figure fees, he has encouraged some 
schools and municipalities to assume high risks. For example: 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1990, Ough negotiated a $30-million bond issued by five public entities 
in the San Joaquin Valley. Two years later, two of the five failed to meet the 
financial terms of the deal, prompting an SEC investigation into whether 
investors received adequate disclosure of potential risk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Four years before that, Lassen Community College District became the first 
community college district in the nation to declare bankruptcy after it was 
unable to meet the obligations of a $7.1-million bond deal handled by Ough. The 
value of the bond exceeded that of the school district's annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city of Arvin faces a declaration of bankruptcy and unincorporation 
after the city's finances crumbled in part because of the weight of an 
$8-million bond put together by Ough. Proceeds from the bond were to have gone 
toward the construction of a golf course, but the low-income farm town has been 
unable to attract enough golfers to pay day-to-day expenses of the course, let 
alone the debt service on the bond. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is, I asked Kenneth Ough repeatedly if any of the things that 
eventually happened could happen, and I got repeated assurances that they 
couldn't," said one source involved in the San Joaquin Valley transaction who 
requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the Orange County school districts and cities that Ough directed into 
the investment pool have accused him of committing any wrongdoing. In addition, 
Ough has a clean record with the SEC and the National Assn. of Securities 
Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many officials from agencies Ough has worked with, including several in Orange 
County, speak highly of his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were with Ken for 10 years, since his days at Merrill Lynch," said Terry 
Bradley, an administrator with Clovis schools near Fresno. "He did a good job 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior vice president at his current firm, Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, Ough did 
not return numerous telephone messages seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ken has been an investment banker in Southern California for the past 17 
years," said Rauscher Pierce Executive Vice President Leslie Lynch. "He has a 
very, very large client following. . . . Ken's history speaks for itself." Firm 
Subpoenaed 
</P>
<P>
 Rauscher Pierce is one of two Wall Street investment houses that have been 
served with subpoenas by the SEC in the wake of the stunning drainage of Orange 
County's $7.5-billion investment pool. Lynch said he has been told that the 
firm is not the target of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 While working for three investment firms over 15 years, Ough has maintained a 
long business rapport with recently resigned Orange County Treasurer Robert L. 
Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, 133 of the 420 new issues by Orange County agencies in Citron's 
investment pool have been handled, at least in part, by brokerages at which 
Ough was working at the time, according to Securities Data Co., a New 
Jersey-based firm that compiles information on municipal bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how much money Ough has made in any of his broker arrangements. 
A Los Angeles native, he and his wife, Marilyn, live in a four-bedroom, 
three-bathroom house valued at $600,000 in Canyon Country near Santa Clarita. 
He majored in political science at Cal State Northridge and received a master's 
degree in public policy and administration from Cal State Long Beach in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 He is described by colleagues as industrious to a fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never knew Ken Ough to be anything but a hard-working professional," said 
former co-worker Chriss Street of Newport Beach. "He was a head-down, 
14-hours-a-day guy." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Ough has emerged from the shards of the shattered Orange 
County investment scheme as the architect of the high-risk deals through which 
two cities and four school districts have borrowed roughly $750 million over 
the past two years and invested it, hoping to reap better-than-average returns. 
Reputation as Standout 
</P>
<P>
 In a room full of blue suits pitching their financial wares, Ough is said to 
have stood out from the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 As he made his presentations to school and city officials throughout the state 
-- a Wall Street Johnny Appleseed of sorts -- Ough had an ability to make 
complicated financial transactions sound simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just extremely confident in what he was doing and what he was 
selling," said Ronald Moore, superintendent of Chowchilla Unified School 
District, which invested $2.5 million in Orange County's pool. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview in 1993, Ough credited Citron's business acumen and said 
borrowing to invest for public entities probably would not be advisable 
anywhere else: "It's very limited. . . . It would not work in another county." 
</P>
<P>
 During the same interview, Ough said his unique investment plan simply 
afforded an opportunity for cash-short public agencies to make money. "There's 
little or no risk," Ough said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time he had offered such assurances, some of his clients 
said, nor was it the only time he had been wrong. College Bankruptcy 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Ough developed the underwriting of a deal that led to the first 
Chapter 9 filing ever by a community college.  
</P>
<P>
 While working for Merrill Lynch, Ough helped tiny Lassen College, 250 miles 
northeast of San Francisco, borrow $7.1 million -- more than the school's 
$5.5-million annual budget at the time -- to build a garbage-burning, 
heat-generating plant on its Susanville campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Several banks rejected the project, but college President Warren Sorenson said 
in an interview this week that Ough was eager to help. 
</P>
<P>
 With Ough's help, the college issued $7.15 million worth of certificates of 
participation in November, 1982. Despite a BBB- rating from Standard & Poor's, 
the $5,000 notes sold out in five days. 
</P>
<P>
 By March, 1986 -- two years after the plant had opened -- Lassen College was 
being sued by First Interstate Bank for not making its loan payments. Profits 
from the plant were intended to pay off the loan, so when the plant suffered 
technical problems, the school faced closure if it did not seek bankruptcy 
protection, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ough is among the defendants in First Interstate's lawsuit against the 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch spokesman Timothy Gilles said the brokerage was not to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem was with the design, construction and operation of the plant 
itself," Gilles said. "Merrill Lynch just did the financing, and the financing 
was not the problem." Small Town's Default 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after taking a new post with Seidler-Fitzgerald Public Finance in 
March, 1986, Ough financed a bond issue to help Arvin -- a farm town of 10,000 
people 15 miles from Bakersfield -- build a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 With an annual operating budget of $1.4 million, Arvin borrowed $7.89 million 
to issue certificates of participation in 1988, with Ough and 
Seidler-Fitzgerald acting as the underwriter. The city set aside $3.5 million 
in proceeds to pay off its loan and used the rest to build the 18-hole course. 
</P>
<P>
 For its role, Seidler-Fitzgerald received about $800,000 in fees, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the official statement that accompanies such transactions, the deal was 
described as having "a high degree of investment risk," and investors were 
warned that the developer had never built a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years, the $3.5-million reserve had been used up and the city had 
yet to earn a nickel in profits. Arvin defaulted in September, 1993, and the 
trustee of the notes took the matter to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Sherwood, an attorney representing Seidler-Fitzgerald, said he didn't 
know enough details of the transaction and declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city was not financially stable and they bought into this proposal, which 
was supposed to put millions of dollars into the general fund each year," said 
Thomas Payne, who took over as city manager in 1992. "Instead, it has drained 
us to the point where we're not sure we'll remain an incorporated city." SEC 
Investigation 
</P>
<P>
 While still at Seidler-Fitzgerald, Ough in 1990 was at the center of a 
so-called Marks-Roos bond project in Fresno County that has drawn SEC scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the complicated deal, five public entities -- the 
Chowchilla Memorial Hospital District, the city of Mendota, Sierra Kings 
Hospital District, the city of Orange Cove and the city of San Joaquin -- 
formed the Central San Joaquin Financing Authority and issued nearly $30 
million of unrated revenue bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The proceeds were to have been used to underwrite other bonds or pay off other 
obligations of the five agencies in the authority. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1992, one of the five, Chowchilla Memorial Hospital District, defaulted 
on nearly $5 million of revenue bonds issued by the authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The same year, another authority member, Mendota, defaulted on a $2-million 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
 While the SEC investigates the structure of the arrangement and whether 
investors received full disclosure, the authority is in disarray and some of 
the three partners that have met their fiscal obligations under the arrangement 
are concerned about potential exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherwood, from Seidler-Fitzgerald, said the SEC investigation is not focusing 
on the firm or on Ough, and that neither has done anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Kenneth Ough had told me there was a one-in-a-million chance this could 
happen," said one source in the deal who didn't want to be identified, "I 
wouldn't have done it." Officials Cite Trust 
</P>
<P>
 Similar sentiments were expressed by officials whose agencies Ough brought 
into the Orange County investment pool from outside. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ough first pitched the aggressive, borrow-to-invest scheme to Orange 
County schools and cities in early 1993, some officials said they opted to try 
it, in part, because they knew Ough and trusted him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ken brought that idea to the city. . . . To the best of my knowledge, it was 
a unique transaction," said George Ferrone, the city of Anaheim's finance 
director, who has worked with Ough for a decade. "This was an opportunity that 
he brought to us that made sense at the time, and until two weeks ago seemed 
like a real winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrone noted that the city earned $7.4 million in interest from the taxable 
note deals in 1993. Anaheim has $169 million in the now-frozen pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Although everyone from municipal bond experts to state Controller Gray Davis 
have inveighed against the borrow-to-invest scheme since the collapse of the 
pool, only a few raised red flags beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 One was former co-worker Street, who recalled that he was stunned in 1993 to 
learn that Ough had masterminded the borrowing of $200 million by four Orange 
County school districts solely to pump into the pool. Street said: "I called 
him up and said, 'What the (expletive) are you doing?' "

U.S. SAYS STING PIERCED CALI OPERATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Federal law enforcement authorities Friday took the cover off a nearly 
three-year money-laundering investigation that set up a Caribbean offshore bank 
to penetrate the Colombian Cali drug cartel and damaged a link between the 
cartel and a rising Italian organized crime group. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to producing 88 arrests and the seizure of about 9 tons of cocaine 
and $52 million in cash and property, Operation Dinero took possession of three 
paintings purportedly by Rubens, Reynolds and Picasso. In addition, Italian 
authorities seized an arms-smuggling ship. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States government and the international law enforcement community 
have made great strides in undermining and disrupting the Cali cartel's 
financial operations -- the lifeblood of their organization," said Thomas A. 
Constantine, chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration, at a press 
conference announcing the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The elaborate undercover operation, which eventually involved law enforcement 
officials in five countries and four federal investigative agencies, began in 
Atlanta in early 1992 when undercover DEA agents were commissioned by Cali 
operatives to set up money pickups in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Related DEA, FBI and Internal Revenue Service investigations, in which 
undercover operatives won the confidence of Cali representatives, also took 
place in Los Angeles, New York and Houston. In all, these operations laundered 
$39,549,209 in illicit drug funds, all of which was returned to the Cali 
cartel's custody and control, DEA and IRS officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 With the cooperation of British authorities, Operation Dinero set up a private 
bank in Anguilla, British West Indies, which laundered an additional $8.9 
million in non-cash, wire transactions for the Cali organization, beginning 
last July. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This led to identifying hidden accounts and assets of cartel figures, DEA and 
IRS officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've ever gotten to the level of operating a secret 
offshore bank that they felt very comfortable with," Constantine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Signaling a new priority on disrupting drug trafficking operations through 
undercover money laundering, IRS Commissioner Margaret Milner Richardson said 
that the operation should force launderers to ask themselves before their next 
transaction whether they are dealing with a genuine bank or the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's the IRS, the terms we are offering are 20 years -- and with no 
interest," Richardson told the press conference at DEA headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Constantine did not appear entirely comfortable with the concept of laundering 
more than $48 million for the cartel, even though it produced what he and other 
DEA officials described as invaluable intelligence that investigators will be 
pursuing for months as the inquiry continues. 
</P>
<P>
 He described it as "a difficult decision" but noted that the cocaine 
traffickers would have been able to launder the funds elsewhere with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert E. Bender, special agent in charge of the DEA's Los Angeles office, 
said:  
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the most significant thing (was that) the DEA was instrumental in 
interrupting the flow of money back to the Colombian (cartel). . . . That's 
their heart and soul. . . . They can justify losing a load of cocaine but when 
they lose their money, that hurts them." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the bank, several undercover corporations were set up in 
different locations to serve as "front" businesses in supplying loans, 
cashier's checks, peso exchanges and wire transfers and to create holding 
companies or shell corporations for the trafficking groups, DEA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Dinero established a direct link between the Cali cartel and an 
Italian organized crime group headed by Pasquale C. Locatelli, which had 
operations in France, Romania, Croatia, Spain, Greece, Italy and Canada, 
according to the DEA. 
</P>
<P>
 Locatelli had been serving a drug distribution sentence in a French prison 
when he escaped by helicopter in 1989. Last September, he was arrested in Spain 
as a result of the operation, along with alleged accomplices in Italy and 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Locatelli group, not considered one of the traditional, long established 
Italian organized crime organizations, used ships off the Colombian coast to 
pick up drugs and carry them to North Africa, where they were transferred to 
smaller craft from Southern Europe, the DEA said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, North Atlantic Treaty Organization forces intercepted one of the 
Locatelli group's vessels, suspecting that it was smuggling arms in violation 
of a United Nations embargo. A search of the ship at an Italian port turned up 
small arms and ammunition in two of 81 containers and the Italian military is 
currently holding the ship and containers. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, 17 arrests were reported -- three of them Thursday -- along 
with the seizure of 25 kilograms of cocaine and $2.5 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those arrested were identified as part of a local money-laundering 
"cell" that funneled $5 million through a Los Angeles-based DEA agent who was 
one of those going undercover as part of the sting. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an affidavit filed by the DEA in U.S. District Court in Los 
Angeles, Ramona Sanchez, a Spanish-speaking agent, was hooked up last spring 
with the Cali Cartel's secretive Southern California money-laundering ring with 
the help of a "confidential informant" who gained the confidence of a top 
"broker" for the drug cartel. 
</P>
<P>
 The cartel's representative had indicated that the Colombian drug operation 
wished to launder "up to $1 million in such proceeds per week," according to 
the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contacted through codes punched up on her phone beeper -- usually instructing 
her to call pay phones -- Sanchez then met the money couriers in such locations 
as the parking lots of a Toys 'R' Us store in Rosemead, a Fuddruckers 
restaurant in Pasadena and outside a Robinsons-May department store at the 
Montebello Town Center. There she was given duffel bags or suitcases containing 
up to $872,000 by the drug couriers, most of whom were Colombian women later 
found to be living modestly in apartments in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 As with other undercover operatives in the nationwide sting, Sanchez posed as 
someone who had contacts with crooked bankers supposedly willing to process 
such large amounts without alerting authorities.

L.A. BRUTALITY CASE LAWYER'S ROAD TO JUDGESHIP BLOCKED; COURTS: A SENATE PANEL 
APPROVED SAMUEL PAZ. BUT VEHEMENT OPPOSITION FROM POLICE GROUPS HAS STRANDED 
HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 There are few sure bets in life, but the approval of Samuel Paz as a federal 
judge seemed like one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of why it has not happened -- and why it may never happen -- is a 
cautionary tale about what can transpire when law and politics collide. 
</P>
<P>
 A widely respected Los Angeles lawyer and a former president of the American 
Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, Paz is a plaintiffs' police-abuse 
attorney with the distinction of having won one of the largest jury awards in 
the country for a victim of police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominated by President Clinton, Paz had Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) as his 
patron, a stack of complimentary letters and the blessing of the American Bar 
Assn. after the group's famously exhaustive screening process. Approval by the 
Senate Judiciary Committee seemed inevitable. Confirmation by the Senate would 
be routine. 
</P>
<P>
 All that would make Paz one of the first Mexican American judges of the 
federal District Court in Los Angeles, and would bolster Clinton's idealized 
vision of a diverse federal work force filled with people who "look like 
America." Paz, 51, boasts other personal credentials: He is the husband of a 
fund-raiser for the National Conference of Christians and Jews, a father of 
two, a lecturer to Latino students on the importance of education. 
</P>
<P>
 He seemed so perfectly poised to be a federal judge that he gave up his law 
practice, sold the Alhambra office building that housed it, attended a weeklong 
"baby judges school" in Washington and even lined up two law clerks and a 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometime in the fall, after Paz's uneventful Senate hearing, the path of 
his nomination hit a surprising dead end. 
</P>
<P>
 While candidates for positions as federal trial judges rarely prompt 
opposition, Paz had sparked denunciations from five police organizations, a 
conservative judicial watchdog group and the editorial board of a newspaper on 
the other side of the country -- the Washington Times, a key conservative force 
in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time and again Mr. Paz has proven himself not to be a friend of law 
enforcement or equal rights for all citizens including police officers," wrote 
Joe Flannagan, chairman of the Los Angeles chapter of the Peace Officers 
Research Assn. of California, in a stinging letter to Boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, which represents more than 39,000 local law enforcement officers in 
California and Nevada, accuses Paz of filing too many unjustified lawsuits 
against police officers who the group says were merely defending themselves in 
difficult and dangerous situations. 
</P>
<P>
 A video showing Paz speaking at a seminar for lawyers on how to sue police 
officers only incensed them more. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is making his fortune off our backs," complained E.F. (Skip) Murphy, state 
president of the peace officers group. 
</P>
<P>
 In early October, with controversy hanging over Paz's name and an election in 
the offing, the Senate Judiciary Committee simply dropped his nomination like a 
hot potato.  
</P>
<P>
 The official excuse: Committee members ran out of time before the 103rd 
Congress adjourned for an election break, as they did on 13 other nominees. 
Boxer has promised to resubmit Paz's name to the White House for renomination 
when the Senate goes back into session in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Paz, meanwhile, waits in an odd limbo between law practice and the federal 
bench. He is reluctant to talk about his dilemma, refusing to blame anyone for 
it. He insists he is waiting calmly for the storm to die down.  
</P>
<P>
 "We all knew that these were political decisions made by political people and 
there are many political considerations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His stunned supporters are less accepting.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is already a really sad topic," said USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky. 
"I think Sam would be a terrific judge. He's smart, conscientious, the epitome 
of good judicial temperament." 
</P>
<P>
 "He had been cleared by the ABA," said Santa Barbara attorney Laurie Harris, a 
member of Boxer's judicial screening committee. "He had a quick and cordial 
hearing, at which no problems were raised. He had every reason to believe he 
would be confirmed." 
</P>
<P>
 Paz's detractors vow to continue their crusade against him. And if the 
liberal-minded Paz faced problems when the Senate Judiciary Committee was 
chaired by Democrat Joe Biden and counted Boxer's California colleague, Dianne 
Feinstein, among the political majority, Paz could be doomed next time around. 
The committee will soon be headed by Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, a 
staunch conservative. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Whelan, who will be general counsel to the Republican majority of the 
committee, declined to comment on Paz's chances or those of any other judicial 
hopeful. But at a meeting of the conservative Los Angeles Lawyers Division of 
the Federalist Society on Friday, Whelan excoriated several of Clinton's 
already confirmed judicial appointments and warned that the Hatch-led committee 
would fight any nominees it deemed "activist" judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I welcome those clashes," said Whelan. "We will expose to the American public 
the addle-brained, soft-on-crime policies of liberal activist judges." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if committee members regard Paz with less hostility than that, they could 
grill him until he is charred beyond recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sam's timing couldn't be worse," said one federal judge, speaking on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Paz supporters say the same record that has agitated his opponents is 
what qualifies him for the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "My gosh, if someone who spends his entire professional career enforcing the 
Constitution doesn't get confirmation, then who should be confirmed?" said 
Venice attorney Stephen Yagman, who also represents people suing law 
enforcement officers for excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quirks of the process defy any easy logic, and may have turned Paz 
into a man without a job awaiting a position that won't materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 Banking too soon that a nomination will become an approval is "like not buying 
car insurance and figuring you'll never have an accident," said one former 
Reagan Administration official who worked with federal judicial nominees. 
</P>
<P>
 As Paz saw it, he had to begin shedding his law practice in preparation for 
confirmation; waiting too long, he reasoned, would have risked stranding his 
current clients when he suddenly became a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, as I was led to believe, once you've had your hearing, there's 
generally not much of a problem -- especially for someone who has been found 
qualified by the ABA," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, senators -- conforming to the tradition of "senatorial courtesy" -- 
normally give considerable deference to their colleagues' District Court 
nominees. Unlike Supreme Court nominations, which frequently precipitate major 
controversies, a federal trial judge candidate rarely ignites such a brouhaha. 
The Senate Judiciary Committee has rejected only three such candidates since 
1938. 
</P>
<P>
 Paz, however, was never the typical judicial candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts say they can think of no current federal judge who had been 
primarily a plaintiff's lawyer in police brutality cases. Most are culled from 
the ranks of federal and state prosecutors, corporate lawyers, and municipal 
and state judges. Boxer's other federal bench choice, former Municipal Judge 
Richard Paez, sailed through his confirmation process and is now the first 
Mexican American federal judge in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Paz, on the other hand, is best known for an $8.9-million verdict he obtained 
on behalf of Adelaido Altamirano, a groundskeeper who was shot by a Los Angeles 
police officer and paralyzed from the waist down in a case of mistaken 
identity. Eventually, Altamirano accepted a $5.5-million settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Paz was also co-counsel in a major case in which 120 plaintiffs sued the Los 
Angeles Police Department's undercover intelligence unit for illegal spying. 
The case was settled when the city agreed to pay plaintiffs $2 million and to 
disband the intelligence unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Paz's detractors were quick to exploit his lack of pedigree.  
</P>
<P>
 "Paz has absolutely no experience, at any level, as a jurist," wrote Shaun J. 
Mathers, president of the Assn. of Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs. (Paz's 
supporters note that 11 of the 27 federal trial judges in Los Angeles had no 
judicial experience before being named.) 
</P>
<P>
 Paz also left a paper trail less in law journals than in the Op-Ed pages of 
newspapers such as The Times, where he often staunchly criticized police 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 After a sheriff's deputy shot and killed 19-year-old Arturo (Smokey) Jimenez 
-- a gang member who was later found to have PCP in his blood -- in the Ramona 
Gardens housing project in East Los Angeles in 1991, Paz told reporters that 
the incident was "a classic example of an officer who violated all the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Paz represented Jimenez's mother, Elva, in a civil suit against the Sheriff's 
Department. After a two-week trial, the county agreed to an out-of-court 
settlement in which it paid her $450,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to outgoing Judiciary Committee Chairman Biden, sheriff's 
association president Mathers said the case was an example of Paz's "offensive 
and inflammatory practice of making allegations to the media prior to 
investigations of officer-involved shootings. . . . The officer's actions to 
protect his life and the life of his partner, who had been knocked unconscious 
by the PCP-charged suspect, were determined entirely justified. Yet Mr. Paz 
continued to incite the community against the Sheriff's Department and the 
deputies." 
</P>
<P>
 Paz was hardly alone in his critical comments. The Jimenez case was singled 
out as "most disturbing" by the Kolts Commission in its lengthy 1992 report on 
the department. The commission said the shooting was "a story of deficient 
training and flawed judgment and a deputy who was not suited for a (gang unit) 
assignment." 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as 1991, Paz acknowledged that he was an unlikely judicial 
candidate. "I don't believe I'll ever be appointed," he said that year in an 
interview with the Los Angeles Daily Journal, a legal newspaper. "The 
Republican governors (George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson) are hostile toward an 
attorney who had given consideration to civil rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Paz feels his unusual background "was part of the reasons the senator 
(Boxer) wanted to consider my nomination. . . . I think she sees it's necessary 
to have some balance on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Paz's bid has been supported by a wide variety of individuals, including a 
host of liberal members of Congress, Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti and longtime ACLU 
activist Stanley K. Sheinbaum, who became president of the Los Angeles Police 
Commission in the wake of the Rodney G. King beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a time when the broader community was turning against the police," 
but Paz "never joined that bandwagon, certainly not in the obsessive way that 
certain others were doing," Sheinbaum said in a letter to Boxer last August. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Chapman, Boxer's chief aide on judicial appointments, says she is still 
committed to Paz's nomination and will resubmit his name to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department official Eleanor D. Acheson, who oversees judicial 
nominations, would not comment on whether the Administration will renominate 
Paz or any other stalled candidate. However, Acheson said she has had a "very 
positive" meeting with Hatch and is optimistic about future Clinton nominees. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how supportive Boxer's frequent Democratic ally Feinstein will 
be on this sticky issue. Several sources said Feinstein was quite relieved that 
she did not have to cast a vote on Paz's nomination during her tense reelection 
campaign against Republican Mike Huffington, who attacked her vote for a 
federal judge from Florida who was accused of being soft on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 For Paz to be confirmed, Boxer will have to "go to the mat" and vouch for him, 
according to Elliot Mincberg, legal director of People for the American Way, a 
liberal advocacy group. Boxer has already committed herself to renominating 
Judith McConnell, a San Diego Superior Court judge in a similar limbo. Some 
opposition to McConnell arose because of her 1987 decision awarding custody of 
a teen-age boy to the gay partner of his deceased father, over the objection of 
the youth's natural mother. The political question, Mincberg says, is: "How 
many people can one senator go to bat for at a given time?" 
</P>
<P>
 Staffers for the senator who could be Paz's greatest hurdle -- Hatch -- will 
not reveal how he is leaning on the Paz nomination. Hatch has already asked Paz 
in writing to respond to his police critics, and Paz has responded by saying he 
has no animus toward police.  
</P>
<P>
 Paz continues to team-teach one course at Loyola Law School, where he is an 
adjunct professor, and he acts as a consultant to other lawyers. "I'm doing 
quite well economically," he said. He insists that his limbo is an emotional 
respite from a usually grueling work pace. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first vacation I've had in 25 years," said Paz, whose children 
are 6 and 14. "This is actually a pleasant time to be with my children and 
spend time studying." 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, he has found a contemplative haven at USC Law School. At 
Chemerinsky's invitation, he is a "judge-designee in residence." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they made that name up," Paz chuckled. 
</P>
<P>
 The unpaid position allows him an office and resources to study legal issues 
regarding securities, patents and intellectual property -- "things I was not 
familiar with," he said. "I've been using this time to be as best prepared as I 
can to take the bench."

WORLD PERSPECTIVE; BRITAIN; ANGLO-IRISH PEACE LINKS, POLITICS BECOME TANGLED

<P>
 With the British government suffering a political thrashing anew and the Irish 
government only now sorting out its own internal tumult, many analysts here are 
saying the already difficult search for peace in Northern Ireland may get even 
more complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 British Prime Minister John Major's government suffered its latest disastrous 
defeat Thursday when it lost a "safe" Conservative seat in Parliament to the 
surging Labor Party -- which, under new leader Tony Blair, is running far ahead 
of the Tories in polls. 
</P>
<P>
 In balloting in wealthy Dudley West, in the Midlands in central England, Labor 
won by a whopping 20,694 votes -- the worst by-election drubbing for the 
Conservatives since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tory defeat was particularly painful because only 7,706 people voted for 
the ruling party. In the April, 1992, election, the Conservatives won 34,729 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor's vote held steady at 28,400. 
</P>
<P>
 If translated into national terms, the voting this week would leave the 
Conservative Party without a single parliamentary seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Dublin, a new government has finally been cobbled together in a 
coalition led by newly installed Prime Minister John Bruton, leader of the Fine 
Gael party, replacing the Fianna Fail administration of Albert Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds had led the Anglo-Irish move for talks with the maverick Sinn Fein, 
the political arm of the Irish Republican Army, and extremist Protestant 
paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bruton's Fine Gael has less close ties with Sinn Fein and has often 
viewed the group as an anti-democratic force, he has promised to continue the 
peace process; on Friday, Bruton met Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams and 
leading Northern Irish militant Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the quest to end 25 years of violence continued, there were signs 
of just how tangled the peace process may become: 
</P>
<P>
 * On the one hand, in what was viewed as an encouraging development, Bruton 
reappointed Dick Spring, head of the Labor Party, as Ireland's foreign 
secretary. Spring held that post under Reynolds and used it to promote peace 
talks on Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 * Without firm direction from London, though, the 900,000 Protestant Unionist 
majority in Northern Ireland has indicated it may be loath to reach any 
agreements with the 600,000 Catholic minority. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the Conservatives were holding their heads, trying to figure their 
course now. They have lost a series of by-elections caused by deaths of Tory 
incumbents, and the party has been racked by internal squabbling. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say Major's grip on power has grown so tenuous that he cannot count 
on members of his party to stick with him in any vote -- except perhaps in a 
vote of confidence, which could bring down the entire government and force 
premature national elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The defection of right-wing, anti-Europe Thatcherites is doubly harmful to the 
Tories because Major could be forced to rely on votes of Northern Ireland 
Unionist members of Parliament on critical issues; this would leave him in 
their political debt, and they might seek to be repaid in matters concerning 
the province. 
</P>
<P>
 Major gave no indication he is prepared to bow to right-wing pressure to 
change policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some good can come out of it," he declared of Thursday's vote, 
"providing that people realize within the Conservative Party that we are all 
pulling in the same direction for the same cause at the same time and against 
the same opponent."

 Capt. Jeb Stewart, a U.S. Army officer from Walnut Creek, Calif., smiled at 
the soldiers arrayed before him and noted sardonically, "You get a lot of 
diversity in the Cambodian army." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the recruits was barely 16 years old; two others were in their late 
60s. They were among 45 Cambodians being trained by a contingent from the U.S. 
Special Forces in the arcane art of detecting land mines and disposing of them 
safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart and his 13-member contingent, among the first U.S. servicemen sent to 
Indochina since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, are here on a mission 
restricted to "humanitarian assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 The ghosts of the Vietnam conflict, a quagmire that the United States 
initially entered by dispatching "advisers" in the early 1960s, have caused 
Washington to proceed with maximum caution -- this despite urgent appeals for 
help from the Phnom Penh government, which is fighting a seemingly endless war 
with Khmer Rouge insurgents. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said the Clinton Administration is considering a larger package of 
assistance to Cambodia's armed forces but has tied the aid to the government's 
progress in reforming the army and its bloated command structure. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the biggest allotment of Western help for Cambodia's army has come 
from Australia, which announced last month that it will provide $6 million, 
double the previous year's military assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said the aid is mainly in the form of 
training in counterinsurgency tactics and does not include any "lethal 
material" such as weapons or ammunition. "This is not a full-scale war," Evans 
maintained. "This is a comparatively small-scale insurgency situation in which 
the government needs to be assisted." 
</P>
<P>
 China, France, Indonesia and Thailand have also provided small amounts of aid. 
But no country has yet offered the Cambodians what they most desperately need: 
advanced weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
 The country's navy consists of a few withered craft on the Tonle Sap River, 
and the air force has been grounded for years because of the lack of spare 
parts for aging MIG-17s. 
</P>
<P>
 Cambodia perplexed some of its aid donors recently by announcing the purchase 
of 90 surplus tanks from Poland and Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they picked up the tanks for a bargain price of $33,000 each, they 
will contribute almost nothing to the effort aimed at controlling the Khmer 
Rouge because the guerrillas stay concealed in the country's dense jungle or 
hide in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Cambodian army has an official roster of 130,000 troops, at least 
10 times the size of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla force, it was given a bloody 
nose by the insurgents earlier this year when government troops briefly 
occupied the gem-mining center of Pailin in western Cambodia, only to be driven 
out a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally annoying, the Khmer Rouge now roams the countryside almost at will, 
embarrassing the government with brazen attacks such as the kidnaping in August 
of three backpackers from Britain, Australia and France. The three were 
subsequently killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its relative weakness, the Cambodian government has dropped the 
idea of launching an offensive against the insurgents early next year, as it 
has every year for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, according to Tea Chamrath, one of two defense ministers in Cambodia's 
shaky coalition government, the army intends to switch its focus to rural 
development needs such as building roads and schools in hopes of persuading the 
nation's peasants to change their loyalty from the Khmer Rouge to the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Tea said the Defense Ministry has already demoted all of the army's officers 
by one grade, reducing the number of generals from 2,000 to 500, a number he 
hopes to cut to 110 by early January. Many generals bought their stars in the 
previous army because of the lucrative spoils available to men of high rank. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, he said there are plans to cut the army from 130,000 to a fighting 
force of about 70,000. "Before we can let them go, we have to find them a job," 
he said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Tea is appealing for aid to help provide vocational training to demobilized 
soldiers. Government soldiers now account for a sizable part of the crime in 
Cambodia because many have not been paid for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say Cambodian army troops are 100% good," said Tea, who spent much of 
the 1980s in Torrance, Calif., and whose mother and father still live in Long 
Beach. "There are worrying things. There are bad people. But we can correct 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Tea also defended the government's policy of giving amnesty to Khmer Rouge 
insurgents, although some are known to be murderers. A six-month amnesty 
granted earlier this year has proved popular with the guerrillas. More than 
1,000 have surrendered and joined the Cambodian army, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are like wild animals," Tea said. "It is better to keep them in a cage, 
where you know they will be safe, than letting them bite the people."

CUOMO BLASTS GOP FOR WORST KIND OF POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what was likely his final speech as New York's governor, Mario M. Cuomo 
bitterly criticized the new Republican agenda as politics at its worst, guided 
by opinion polls, tainted with racism and devoid of compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politicians used to think of themselves as shepherds.That's all over now," 
Cuomo told a full house at the National Press Club on Friday. "Now the 
politicians are following the sheep: Read the polls! They'll tell you where to 
go to pasture!" 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat Cuomo, defeated last month in his bid for a fourth term by Republican 
George E. Pataki, warned voters that they had better take the time to think 
about what they want and then send the right signals to their government. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you tell them you want the death penalty, you'll get it," Cuomo said. "If 
you tell them to ignore sick people, you'll get it. If you tell them to ignore 
the poor, you'll get it. If you tell them to victimize young children, you'll 
get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be careful what you ask for because they're listening for you. And ask for 
the right things. Ask for the truth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuomo, the Democratic Party's most articulate and stalwart liberal, blasted 
the GOP's "contract with America" as "a kind of plastic populism." 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes absolutely no demand on our political leadership, other than that 
they set sail in whatever direction the political winds appear to be blowing at 
the moment," he said.

MUSLIM GROUP PLEDGES TROOPS, CASH FOR BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Muslim leaders ended a summit in Morocco with a promise of financial and 
diplomatic support for Bosnia's Muslims and a threat of economic measures 
against countries that support their Serbian adversaries. 
</P>
<P>
 A special statement on Bosnia-Herzegovina by the heads of state of the 
Organization of the Islamic Conference, or OIC, which closed Thursday, pledged 
to pool the wealth of its 52 members in defense of Bosnia's Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 It urged members to donate between $300,000 and $5 million to a special fund 
for Bosnia and offered to increase the number of Muslim troops serving with the 
United Nations Protection Force in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The war in Bosnia dominated the three-day summit and united the OIC's diverse 
members, which have rarely achieved cohesion since the first Islamic summit 25 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement, echoing a resolution by foreign ministers, said the Saudi 
Arabia-based OIC regarded the U.N. ban on supplying arms to the mainly Muslim 
Bosnian government as legally and morally void. 
</P>
<P>
 A final resolution also included an implicit threat to defy the U.N. arms 
embargo.

U.N. EXPECTS TO RESUME TROOP FLIGHTS; BOSNIA: REOPENING OF SARAJEVO'S AIRPORT 
WOULD BE FIRST IN NEARLY A MONTH. KARADZIC'S VOWS CREDITED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Banking on goodwill pledges that the Bosnian Serb leader made to former 
President Jimmy Carter, the U.N. Protection Force said it expects to resume 
troop-rotation flights to the Sarajevo airport today for the first time in 
nearly a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The likely reopening of the airport is seen as a key test of the sincerity of 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who this week professed a new willingness 
to settle the intractable civil war. The airport in the Bosnian capital has 
been closed since Nov. 21, when the Bosnian Serbs rescinded safe-passage 
guarantees in retaliation for North Atlantic Treaty Organization air strikes 
against the Serbs' targets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Troop rotation is a very normal activity," U.N. spokeswoman Claire Grimes 
said. "This would mean a speck of normalization is appearing on the horizon." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to draw Carter into the peace process, possibly as early as 
Sunday, Karadzic put forward six proposals to ease the tense standoff in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, including resuming flights at the airport, ensuring free 
movement of humanitarian relief convoys and instituting a cease-fire in the 
Sarajevo area. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptical U.N. officials and the Muslim-led Bosnian government have taken a 
wait-and-see attitude toward the proposals, saying their implementation would 
only restore the status quo before relations rapidly deteriorated this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials acknowledged that any movement would constitute progress, and on 
Friday the United Nations cautiously indicated that Karadzic appeared to be 
fulfilling at least some of his pledges. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials backed off earlier reports that hinted that Bosnian Serbs were 
probably responsible for an attack on a U.N. helicopter near Sarajevo on 
Thursday. An investigation Friday revealed that the helicopter, which was 
struck in the tail with 12 rounds of small-arms fire, never passed over 
territory controlled by the Bosnian Serb army, meaning it was probably fired 
upon by Bosnian government forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Although intense fighting continued near the Muslim farm town of Velika 
Kladusa in northwest Bosnia, the perpetrators there have been Croatian Serbs 
and rebel Muslims not directly under Karadzic's command. Further south in 
Bihac, where Bosnian Serbs had been shelling regularly, it was relatively quiet 
Friday for the first time in days, a U.N. spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Relief officials said a convoy with 120 tons of food that had been delayed for 
48 hours at Croatian Serb checkpoints was permitted into Bihac, although it was 
unclear what role Karadzic might have played in getting it through. The convoy 
was only the second in a month to reach the U.N.-declared "safe area," where 
180,000 people have barely enough food to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Bihac have had only an ounce of food a day arrive in the last 6 
1/2 months," said Peter Kessler of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for 
Refugees. "They have been sustaining themselves off stocks and the summer 
harvest. They will need a lot more than this." 
</P>
<P>
 In another small sign of progress, the Bosnian Serbs also signed off Friday on 
an additional 13 relief convoys into Sarajevo over the next three weeks, which 
would mean 3,500 tons of food and supplies for the depleted capital, Kessler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a surge in convoys, only about half of Sarajevo's needs can be met 
without a resumption of the humanitarian airlift.

U.S. TROOPS TO SAFEGUARD U.N. EVACUATION FROM SOMALIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton agreed Friday to send U.S. troops to Somalia early next year 
to cover the withdrawal of the remaining U.N. peacekeeping forces and to 
safeguard the removal of dozens of American tanks and other heavy weapons now 
in storage in Mogadishu. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made his decision Thursday in response to a longstanding request from 
the United Nations to provide American protection in the face of increasing 
harassment of U.N. forces by Somali militiamen. The United Nations has 
announced plans to remove all its forces by March 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Defense Secretary John M. Deutch told reporters that the U.S. 
evacuation force would consist of 3,000 Marines, a four-warship Navy amphibious 
ready group and several Air Force AC-130H gunships. Several hundred Marines 
would go ashore, while the rest would remain on their ships. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutch said Clinton had decided that the United States has an obligation to 
help safeguard the withdrawal of U.N. troops from countries such as Pakistan, 
India, Malaysia, Egypt and Bangladesh because they had gone into Somalia in 
1992 at U.S. urging. 
</P>
<P>
 "In his (the President's) words, it's the right thing to do," Deutch said of 
the U.S. pledge to help protect the U.N. force. 
</P>
<P>
 There are now 15,000 U.N. peacekeeping troops in Somalia -- the remaining 
portion of a 25,000-troop Third World force that has been gradually withdrawing 
for more than two months. Only about 2,500 are expected to be there when the 
Marines go in. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States also has a sizable arsenal of armor and heavy weapons -- 
including M-60 tanks, OH-58 helicopters and armored personnel carriers -- that 
U.S. forces left behind for U.N. troops when the Americans departed last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. request for help has become more urgent as Somali militia have begun 
challenging the authority of U.N. forces. U.N. officials have reported several 
incidents over the last few weeks in which U.N. forces have been blocked or 
shot at. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Somali clan leader Mohammed Farah Aidid also has let it be 
known that he regards the U.S. equipment as his now. Deutch said Friday that 
the Administration fears that the weapons "would destabilize the country if 
they fell into the wrong hands." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The United States sent troops to Somalia in December, 1992, to help open 
humanitarian relief routes after civil war erupted between rival factions 
following the fall of Somali President Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991, preventing 
food from reaching starving Somalis. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. forces successfully restored food supplies throughout the country only to 
see the situation deteriorate after the United Nations took over the mission in 
1993. Security ultimately became so lax that U.N. peacekeepers were attacked by 
militiamen loyal to Aidid. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. troops pulled out in March after an October, 1993, gunfight between Aidid 
supporters and U.S. troops left 18 Americans dead and 67 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said the amphibious ready group carrying the 3,000 Marines 
would be sent to the waters off Somalia well in advance of the March 31 
withdrawal deadline for U.N. forces and would remain in the area in case U.N. 
troops found themselves in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines will be part of the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which includes 
special operations forces skilled in extracting hostages and prisoners of war. 
</P>
<P>
 The amphibious ready group will be headed by the amphibious assault ship 
Essex.

GORE SEEKS A WARMING TREND IN MOSCOW; RUSSIA: VICE PRESIDENT DISMISSES AN 
EARLIER WARNING BY YELTSIN OF A 'COLD PEACE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a three-day visit to Moscow aimed at soothing irritated relations 
between the United States and Russia, Vice President Al Gore said Friday that 
the threat of a "cold peace" was only rhetorical. 
</P>
<P>
 "My impression is that there is no cold peace but instead a warm relationship 
that is very much on track," Gore said after a 30-minute meeting with President 
Boris N. Yeltsin at the hospital where Yeltsin is recovering from minor nose 
surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 At a European summit in Budapest, Hungary, earlier this month, Yeltsin had 
warned of a "cold peace" in a divided Europe if the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization pushed ahead with a proposal to extend membership to the Central 
and Eastern European countries while excluding Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev had snubbed a meeting of 
NATO foreign ministers by abruptly refusing to sign a cooperation agreement 
while television cameras waiting to record the event were rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. Administration official said the United States still does not 
know whether Moscow will sign the Partnership for Peace agreement but blamed 
some of the Russian ire on the "misimpression" given to the Russians by the 
Europeans about whether the former Warsaw Pact nations could join NATO as early 
as next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore talked with Yeltsin "in some detail about the misunderstandings they (the 
Russians) received from the Europeans about what NATO did and didn't do," the 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In meetings with Russian Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, Gore stressed 
that the United States wants any expansion to be gradual and to be approved in 
consultation with the Russians, the official said. Moreover, even if Moscow 
opts not to sign the Partnership for Peace agreement, Russia's relationship 
with NATO will be defined through other international agreements, the officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While Gore was ironing out relations with Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin, and 
signing more agreements on U.S.-Russian cooperation on the environment, space, 
energy and defense conversion, U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry, also 
visiting Moscow, met for 90 minutes with Deputy Defense Minister Andrei A. 
Kokoshin and Mikhail P. Kolesnikov, head of the Russian military general staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry told the Associated Press on his airplane that he had tried to calm 
Moscow's concern about a NATO expansion and had extensive discussions about how 
to support the U.N. humanitarian effort in Bosnia-Herzegovina. He said the 
Russian officials were preoccupied by the situation in the breakaway republic 
of Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 To the obvious relief of his hosts, Gore repeated to every Russian official 
and news reporter that the United States considers the rebellion in Chechnya to 
be a Russian internal affair, although the United States hopes the conflict can 
be resolved without more bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 If the televised images of Russian troops, tanks and helicopters firing on 
Muslim villagers in Chechnya sent the message that Moscow is still capable of 
using tanks to protect its national interests -- perhaps the wrong message for 
Poland and the Czech Republic, which insist on NATO membership as a guarantee 
against Russian aggression -- Gore voiced only sympathy with the "immensely 
complicated" problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As special forces patrolled Moscow to deter possible terrorist attacks from 
the Chechen community in the capital, Tipper Gore was forced to skip a planned 
trip to a Russian school because of a bomb threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow police said they now handle about a dozen such threats every day. They 
said the teen-age telephone caller to the school that the vice president's wife 
planned to visit was probably just a prankster. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the U.S.-Russian agreements signed as a result of the Gore-Chernomyrdin 
Commission on Economic and Technological Development were pledges to cooperate 
on such joint problems as Arctic pollution, telecommunications, exchanging 
technical information on nuclear warhead security, recommending revisions to a 
Russian tax system that stifles Western investment, and the international space 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp. has also agreed to issue up to $500 
million in loan guarantees to promote private U.S. investment in converting 
Russian defense plants to peacetime uses.

BELGIAN TOWN WELCOMES SURVIVORS OF BATTLE OF THE BULGE ON 50TH ANNIVERSARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A frigid wind howled through the forests, but the old men who huddled there 
were remembering a much crueler winter that began 50 years ago Friday with the 
first shots of the Battle of the Bulge. 
</P>
<P>
 Before dawn on Dec. 16, 1944, Adolf Hitler's panzer brigades crashed through 
the pines along the border in a desperate attempt to push the Allies back to 
the North Sea and change the course of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a century later, the people of Bastogne welcomed survivors from the U.S. 
units that resisted the onslaught. They also honored the memory of 20,000 
American soldiers who did not survive one of the bloodiest battles of World War 
II. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cold, bloody and somebody trying to kill me," is how Donald Dean summed up 
his memories of the battle fought over the snow-covered Ardennes hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean, from Jasper, Ark., was a 24-year-old sergeant in the 101st Airborne 
Division's "Screaming Eagles," which held the German advance at Bastogne. 
Wearing his army jacket, he listened proudly to the homage paid to the veterans 
at a ceremony beside the giant, star-shaped monument to the fallen Americans 
built on a low hill overlooking the town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, the American Army faced and met its sternest test," said Madeleine 
Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, who led the tribute to the GIs 
together with Belgium's King Albert II. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 U.S. veterans traveled to Bastogne to remember how they broke 
Hitler's last offensive. They were joined by dozens of former fighters from the 
Belgian resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The main square in Bastogne, Place McAuliffe, is named for Gen. Anthony 
McAuliffe, whose spirited defense against overwhelming odds kept the town from 
falling back into Nazi hands. 
</P>
<P>
 McAuliffe's place in military history was assured by his eloquent answer to a 
German surrender demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "In just one word (he said) what the world had been waiting to tell Hitler for 
years -- 'Nuts,' " said Albright, referring to the general's famously terse 
response to the Nazi demand.

ISRAEL, HEZBOLLAH DUEL IN S. LEBANON; MIDEAST: JERUSALEM POLITICIANS SPAR OVER 
BEST TACTICS TO USE AGAINST MILITANT GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On a road outside a South Lebanon village, the Israeli army may have started 
making good this week on its promise to strike back at Hezbollah, the guerrilla 
movement formed by Lebanese Shiite Muslims to oust Israel from the south. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Hezbollah leaders -- Faris Hareb and Abd Majid Marii -- were badly injured 
when a bomb exploded on a road outside the village of Zatour as their car 
passed by it Wednesday. Hezbollah immediately blamed Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Israeli commando forces were responsible . . ." Hezbollah said in a statement 
released to reporters in Beirut. 
</P>
<P>
 The army spokesman's office made no comment on the attack. But Israel has, in 
the past, acknowledged killing and kidnaping Hezbollah leaders in South 
Lebanon. Senior army commanders have warned in the past week that the army 
would soon start taking "directed actions" against Hezbollah -- a euphemism 
commonly applied to hitting at the movement's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Rightist politicians in Israel have been urging massive military retaliation 
for a recent string of deadly Hezbollah attacks on both Israeli soldiers and 
the South Lebanon Army, which is an Israeli-backed militia. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin stirred a storm of controversy earlier in the 
week when he warned that military retaliation against Hezbollah might lead to a 
costly counterattack on Israeli civilians or on Jews outside Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 In comments to reporters traveling with him to Japan and South Korea, Rabin 
said that Hezbollah killed Jews in Buenos Aires and London this year in 
response to Israeli attacks on Hezbollah. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin's comments were seen as a shift away from the Israeli practice of 
hitting targets as they become available, regardless of the sort of retaliation 
an attack might provoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon complained that the army has become "a 
tool in the hands of cynical politicians," held back from taking the offensive 
by the government's desire to make peace with Lebanon and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon, a leader of the opposition Likud Party, masterminded Israel's June, 
1982, invasion of Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should shatter the enemy's equilibrium . . . by keeping them under 
permanent insecurity and under constant movement," Sharon told Israel Radio on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's attack on the two Hezbollah leaders seemed geared to illustrate 
that the army has options available to it in its war of attrition with 
Hezbollah that fall short of all-out invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports from Beirut said that Hezbollah leaders had gone into hiding, fearing 
assassination. Israel reportedly was beefing up its patrols in its self-styled 
security zone. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 Israeli soldiers jointly patrol the security zone with about 3,500 
SLA troops. Israel carved out a band of southern Lebanese territory in 1985, 
when it pulled most of its troops out of Lebanon that had been there since its 
1982 invasion. Hundreds of thousands of mostly poor, mostly Shiite Lebanese 
villagers live inside the zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials say the zone is needed to protect Israel's northern towns 
from rocket attacks and from guerrilla infiltrations. The zone is about 12 
miles deep at its widest point and less than two miles deep at is narrowest 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Lebanon's government has said it cannot make peace with Israel until the 
Israelis completely withdraw from South Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Lebanese government refuses to disarm Hezbollah, arguing that it is a 
legitimate resistance movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel's presence in the zone -- its only active front -- is costly, both 
financially and in terms of casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 According to army figures, 26 soldiers died in the zone in 1993. An additional 
17 have died in the zone so far this year. Most recently, an officer was killed 
Sunday and seven soldiers were wounded in a Hezbollah ambush. 
</P>
<P>
 The SLA also endures a steady stream of casualties. More than 40 SLA soldiers 
have died in the zone this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Hezbollah leaders say their immediate goal is to destroy the SLA as an 
effective fighting force. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's ambush prompted the latest round in what has been a nine-year debate 
here on what to do about Hezbollah. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting wounded soldiers in an Israeli hospital, Maj. Gen. Amiram Levine, 
newly appointed head of Israel's northern command, called for a fresh offensive 
operation against Hezbollah. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end we'll have to defeat them, to take the initiative and attack 
them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by reporters about Levine's threat, Rabin replied: "Whoever thinks that 
he has a formula for resolving the problem is mistaken. The problem isn't 
Lebanon. Today there is an infrastructure for Islamic terror in the entire 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Minister Shimon Peres seconded Rabin's reservations about taking the 
offensive against Hezbollah. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have already tried the offensive initiative, and it didn't solve the 
problem," Peres told Israel Radio this week. "Too much blood has been spilled 
in Lebanon without bringing the results we hoped for." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Israeli analysts argue that Syria is responsible for the upsurge in 
Hezbollah attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 With tens of thousands of troops in eastern Lebanon, Syria remains the chief 
powerbroker in a nation still struggling to recover from the civil war that 
erupted in 1975. Syria also is a close ally of Iran, the spiritual fountainhead 
and chief financier of Hezbollah. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moshe Maoz, head of Hebrew University's Truman Institute for Middle East 
Studies and an expert on Syria, said that Hezbollah does not need Syrian 
encouragement to attack Israeli forces in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hezbollah's war is a guerrilla war of liberation," Maoz said. "Even if there 
was a massive military intervention in Lebanon by Israel, it would not deter 
Hezbollah. Their aim is to drive Israel from South Lebanon, and to dismantle 
the South Lebanon Army."

ARMED PATROLS DROPPED AT SNOWMASS SKI RESORT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Aspen Skiing Co. has decided to discontinue armed patrols of its Snowmass 
resort.The company said regular police patrols on the mountain, apparently a 
first for American ski areas, was creating a bad image. 
</P>
<P>
 The ski company had Snowmass Village police, carrying guns in their fanny 
packs, patrol the resort four times a week. Patrols began after Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the perception has been extremely negative and, the new 
program has led people to believe that there is a crime problem at Snowmass Ski 
Area, which simply is not the case," Police Chief Art Smythe said Thursday.

 Risking shark attacks and deadly jellyfish, a French adventurer set out Friday 
from the Cape Verde islands to swim across the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied only by an unmanned raft loaded with supplies, Guy Delage, 42,

MYERS SAYS SHE'S LEAVING WHITE HOUSE AT END OF YEAR; PRESIDENCY: PRESS 
SECRETARY, 33, CONTENDS IT'S TIME 'TO MOVE ON TO DO OTHER THINGS.' HER 
DEPARTURE COMES AMID A SHAKE-UP IN THE CLINTON TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers, one of President Clinton's longest 
serving and most loyal aides, confirmed Friday that she will leave the 
Administration at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, 33, said that it is time to "move on to do other things" but did not 
specify what her next job will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers' departure comes at a time of upheaval in the Clinton White House and 
Cabinet as the Administration heads into the last half of its four-year term in 
the aftermath of the Republican landslide in November. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last month, Clinton has lost Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, 
counselor David Gergen, Democratic Party Chairman David Wilhelm, White House 
political director Joan Baggett and a host of less-prominent officials. A week 
ago Friday, the President fired Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders for the latest 
in a series of controversial public statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, the most visible woman in the White House after First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, is likely to be replaced by Michael D. McCurry, currently the 
chief State Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry on Friday refused to confirm or deny that he would be appointed but 
offered praise for Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry to see her go," McCurry said. "She's been -- she is a marvelous 
person and a good friend and has been a great colleague and has served this 
President very effectively and loyally." 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry, 39, has had a peripatetic political career, working for Sen. Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan and the Democratic presidential campaigns of Ohio Sen. John 
Glenn, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey. He also 
served as communications director of the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Myers, who grew up in Valencia, Calif., is the daughter of Steve Myers, a 
former Navy combat pilot and Lockheed Corp. test pilot and a professed 
Republican. She has bounced from campaign to campaign over the last decade, 
working for Michael S. Dukakis in 1988 and Dianne Feinstein in 1990 before 
joining the Clinton camp early in his run for the presidency in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 She is generally liked by the White House press corps, who nevertheless felt 
that she was less than authoritative because of limits on her access to the 
President and constraints on the scope and power of her office. 
</P>
<P>
 She escaped being reorganized into irrelevance in a September White House 
staff shake-up engineered by Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta, appealing over his 
head to Clinton, who not only saved her job but gave her a raise and a better 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Myers acknowledged in recent weeks that she had gotten "burned out" by the 
unrelenting pressure of the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if she was forced from the job, Myers said: "I'm neither jumping nor 
being pushed. I'm walking away when I think it's the best time." 
</P>
<P>
 Marlin Fitzwater, who served as chief spokesman for former Presidents George 
Bush and Ronald Reagan, said that Myers was handicapped by Clinton's hostility 
to the press, which "permeated the entire White House." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that she never had the access nor the support within the White 
House to become the authoritative voice of the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many times you felt Dee Dee was operating with her hands tied and she 
really didn't know what was going on," Fitzwater said. "Part of it is access. 
The other part was that she didn't have staff to check things out to make sure 
that what she said publicly was accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 Myers said she had to overcome the hurdles of age, gender and geography when 
she took over the prestigious post. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think coming into this job being young, being from Los Angeles -- and let's 
face it, in Washington being from California is a negative -- and being female, 
those things created a challenge for me," she said in an interview with The 
Times earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, I have had to work very hard and have to continue to work very 
hard to overcome that . . . Washington is still very much a male-oriented 
culture."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; NEWS ANALYSIS; SUITS TARGET MANY, BUT DEEPEST 
POCKETS MAY BE MERRILL LYNCH'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Where are the deep pockets? 
</P>
<P>
 That is the key question for investors, government agencies and others seeking 
to recover losses stemming from the collapse of Orange County's investment 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, several parties have been sued for fraud and other misdeeds. Some of 
the defendants -- Robert L. Citron, the former Orange County treasurer who 
directed the county's unusually aggressive investment fund, Assistant Treasurer 
Matthew R. Raabe and Orange County auditor Steven E. Lewis -- appear unlikely 
to yield the billions of dollars needed to make the county and its creditors 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's Wall Street behemoth Merrill Lynch, the largest underwriter 
of Orange County's bonds and the nation's biggest brokerage, with 1993 revenues 
of $13.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment, Merrill Lynch looks like the deepest pocket," said USC law 
professor Jennifer Arlen, a securities regulation expert. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm has reaped fees in excess of $100 million on Citron's Orange County 
trades, according to a lawsuit filed Friday by two investors in Orange County 
bonds. During the past two years alone, Citron purchased from Merrill Lynch 
almost $6 billion in bonds issued by the Federal National Mortgage Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Another defendant in many of the lawsuits is Michael G. Stamenson, a 
$1-million-a-year San Francisco-based Merrill Lynch salesman who played a key 
role in brokering and underwriting securities for Orange County since at least 
1988, according to the suits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The basic theory of most of the cases filed thus far is that the defendants 
either lied about the financial health of the Orange County investment fund or 
failed to disclose critical information about the fund's precarious condition, 
thus misleading investors into thinking their money was safe with Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendants had actual knowledge of the misrepresentations . . . or acted 
with reckless disregard for the truth," according to a federal class-action 
suit filed this week by Lieff, Cabraser & Heiman, a San Francisco law firm. The 
suit contends that the investments in Orange County bonds of David and Rosalyn 
Bare, two Los Angeles County residents, lost value because of the county's 
fiscal debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 A suit filed Friday also contends that Orange County's lack of meaningful 
oversight over Citron's activities allowed Merrill Lynch and Stamenson "to take 
virtual control over the investment decisions of defendant Citron for the 
investment pools, and to materially influence the nature" of the public debt 
financings and disclosures of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors repeatedly approved Citron's activities without discussion, 
and officials said they were unaware of audits that called the treasurer's 
conduct into question. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, Orange County itself is insulated from suits because of its 
bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county's lawyers have indicated that they, too, are preparing to sue 
Merrill Lynch on the grounds that the brokerage should have advised the Board 
of Supervisors that Citron was making unsuitably risky investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is likely to contend that Merrill Lynch owed a fiduciary duty to 
the supervisors, its ultimate clients. Its suit also may contend that Citron 
was not as sophisticated an investor as he was hailed as prior to the recent 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, Merrill Lynch's likely defense, legal experts say, would be that 
Citron was a knowledgeable, sophisticated investor who -- with the firm's 
assistance -- was very successful for years and had been fully authorized to 
act by the supervisors. Merrill's lawyers aren't commenting; a company 
spokesman said the firm has done nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Any suit by the county is likely to make new law, according to Columbia 
University law professor John C. Coffee, a securities law specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 "The case may well decide what the professional responsibility of a securities 
firm is when faced with a sophisticated and insistent client who demands to 
pursue a course of action that the securities firm knows, or should have known, 
is positively reckless," Coffee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the county were to win such a suit, damages may be limited by the fact 
that, before the recent debacle, the county's rate of return on its investments 
was considerably higher than that of other public investment pools. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a defense was used successfully by brokerages seeking to reduce their 
liability after San Jose lost $60 million in somewhat similar circumstances a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch was one of the defendants in that case; the firm settled with 
the city for $750,000, although San Jose attributed $3 million of its losses to 
Merrill Lynch, according to City Atty. Joan R. Gallo. The city garnered a total 
of $24.8 million in settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 Other possible targets of lawsuits are some of the professionals -- lawyers, 
accountants and outside auditors -- who advised Orange County, as well as firms 
that aided the county in its bond offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, KPMG Peat Marwick, the county's auditor, is under fire for lax review 
of the investment pool's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor Briggs, a partner in LeBouef, Lamb, Greene & MacRae, the New York law 
firm that served as bond counsel on a $600-million Orange County offering last 
June, acknowledged the risk of a suit, but said he was not concerned about any 
liability.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any basis for a suit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Gillers, a New York University law professor, said a U.S. Supreme 
Court decision rendered last April makes it more difficult to sue lawyers or 
accountants as the "aiders and abetters" of a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said, "in a situation like this, the temptation to sue lawyers is 
almost irresistible." Among the reasons: Suits against lawyers can be used to 
put them at odds against their client, thereby aiding a plaintiff; law firms 
have large insurance policies, and they usually settle, "because they don't 
want information about how they practice law to be revealed in public forum," 
Gillers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the prospect of suits against law firms was foreshadowed Friday when 
the latest class-action suit against Merrill Lynch, Stamenson and Citron was 
filed in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana by attorney Joseph W. Cotchett, who 
won multimillion-dollar settlements from two large law firms he sued in 
connection with the Lincoln Savings & Loan scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint alleges that all the defendants "sought and received substantial 
assistance" in issuing bonds and filing official statements from law firms and 
other professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 All the defendants have denied any wrongdoing. And legal experts say they have 
lots of possible defenses. A key one is that the risks of Citron's investment 
strategy were widely known, particularly after mid-April, when media coverage 
of his election foe's criticisms increased. Arguably, that controversy put 
investors and Orange County on notice about the trouble that emerged full-blown 
this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Citron and Raabe defended their tactics. In late April, Citron 
told reporters that despite rising interest rates, the assets in Orange 
County's investment pool were safe. He said there was $700 million available to 
use as collateral for the county's loans if interest rates continued to rise -- 
which Citron did not expect -- and maintained that the investment pool had 
enough cash available to cover anticipated withdrawals by the municipal 
agencies that were its biggest investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Those remarks and others have been cited in the lawsuits as false and 
misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we have a fascinating situation" -- with a politician being sued for 
allegedly false statements made during an election campaign, said Joseph A. 
Grundfest, a Stanford University law professor who previously served on the 
Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Grundfest and Arlen said they did not believe there was any "safe harbor" 
exempting statements from fraud charges because they were made during a 
campaign. But they acknowledged that a 1st Amendment defense might be raised.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; INVESTORS JOCKEY FOR WINNING EDGE IN A GAME WITH 
FEW RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 What has become crystal clear in the nation's largest municipal bankruptcy is 
that many investors in Orange County's ill-fated investment portfolio are going 
to lose money, lots of it. What is unclear is whose ox is going to be gored. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the billions of dollars lost by departed Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert 
L. Citron be divided evenly among those with money in the fund, or will some 
end up far down in a pecking order, shouldering more of the financial loss than 
others? 
</P>
<P>
 In an ordinary business bankruptcy, there is a firm division between secured 
creditors, those who extended credit against a guarantee or collateral, and 
unsecured creditors, generally suppliers of goods and services. Secured 
creditors are the ones most likely to get their money. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the case of Orange County's investment pool, municipal bankruptcy law 
sets no priority between the competing claims of the Newport-Mesa Unified 
School District, with almost $80 million in the fund, Judge Margaret R. 
Anderson's retirement nest egg and the special $8-million fund that had been 
set aside to replace the county Fire Department's aging fleet of trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does it distinguish between the managers of the $1.3-million fund to 
protect gnatcatcher habitat, Operation Santa Claus, which has $10,000 in the 
pool, and the Orange County Transportation Authority, with $1 billion on the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 All must fend for themselves with few hard and fast rules in an emerging 
battle over the $5.4 billion that remains in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, scores of investors are exploring legal arguments in an attempt to 
show they deserve to recover more than others who placed money with the county 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of competing parties with competing demands. Unwieldy is 
perhaps too mild a term to describe what's happening," said professor Dan 
Schechter, a bankruptcy expert at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles. "There is a 
strong argument that there will be a hierarchy of creditors. But this is an 
area of new law. There is no set priority on anything. I mean, the county could 
end up giving everyone a 27% haircut." 
</P>
<P>
 There are 187 governmental entities that have funds in the investment 
portfolio that Citron managed as well as thousands of individuals who invested 
retirement funds and court settlements. 
</P>
<P>
 Who eventually recovers money and in what amount will be determined largely by 
the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and the county creditors committee, which was picked 
Wednesday by bankruptcy Trustee Marcy J.K. Tiffany. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel is made up of representatives from the fund's major institutional 
investors, including the Orange County Department of Education, the County 
Transportation Authority, the County Sanitation Districts, the Transportation 
Corridor Agencies, the city of Irvine representing all county cities, and the 
city of Mountain View, representing municipalities outside the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The creditors committee is responsible for developing a disbursement and 
recovery plan that is acceptable to the competing interests that sit on the 
committee, as well as a host of subcommittees. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, investors and creditors can ask the Bankruptcy Court to order the 
county to release funds or grant them priority for recovering their original 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankruptcy lawyers anticipate that many of those involved will make their 
pitch to the creditors committee or the Bankruptcy Court. Complex negotiations 
to work out compromises will also occur, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Circling the wagons is part of the game," said Richard Levin, who for 16 
years was a bankruptcy attorney with Stutman, Treister & Glatt, the Los Angeles 
law firm now representing Orange County. "You have a lot of people who have 
lost money or stand to lose lots of money. Of course, they are going to fight." 
Under Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy statutes, all parties involved are supposed 
to be treated equitably, bankruptcy lawyers say. No one can be granted priority 
for removing funds or being paid unless the creditors committee or a bankruptcy 
judge agrees to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bankruptcy does not look at deservedness or whether you invested voluntarily 
or involuntarily," Levin said. "The fundamental principal of distribution is 
equality. If you have no collateral, you are part of the great unwashed." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyers also say it could very well turn out that the losses are shared 
pro rata -- that is, everyone will lose a percentage equal to what they had in 
the fund.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; RIPPLES OF WORRY FELT IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY; 
INVESTMENTS: COUNTY TREASURER SEEKS TO REASSURE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND SCHOOLS 
DESPITE $357-MILLION PAPER LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL JACOBS and CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the collapse of Orange County's investment fund, San Diego County 
Treasurer Paul Boland is facing sharp questions about the way he has managed a 
$3-billion government investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of praise for squeezing out high returns for local governments and 
districts in his county, Boland finds himself defending high-risk investment 
practices that at first blush look a lot like those used by Orange County's 
discredited former treasurer, Robert L. Citron. Among the exotic devices that 
the two funds have in common is the inverse floater, a "derivative" geared to 
do well when interest rates fall. 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, the San Diego County fund shows a loss of $357 million, largely 
because the value of Boland's investments plummeted this year while interest 
rates rose. This week, Boland has been holding meetings with finance officers 
from cities, school systems and water districts in the county, trying to assure 
them of the solidity of his fund and prevent a run on deposits that might force 
him to sell off holdings at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in government finance who reviewed the San Diego County investment 
portfolio for The Times noted the substantial paper losses, as well as Boland's 
willingness to bet on the movement of interest rates by investing in 
derivatives -- about 26% of the fund. However, they also noted that, unlike his 
counterpart in Orange County, Boland had not borrowed heavily in an effort to 
increase his gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Boland drew support Friday when Standard & Poor's agreed that his fund was 
sound and concluded that there was no reason to drop San Diego's current AA 
bond rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Boland says that he will have to sell as much as $400 million in the 
funds holdings at a loss to meet the cash needs of his investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 68-year-old retired Navy captain contends that if the investors -- the 
school districts, water agencies and cities that invest in the San Diego County 
fund -- stand together and avoid panic he will be able to wait out most of his 
fund's paper losses and keep money flowing when withdrawals are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Diego, the large number of government agencies that invest in the fund 
-- and that can claim 25% of its assets -- do so voluntarily. They can pull out 
their share whenever they like, forcing Boland to sell investments at less than 
their full value. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem in San Diego County is that people have the right to withdraw and 
if they do so, it would force the county to liquidate some securities," said 
Kay Chandler, president of Chandler Liquid Asset Management in San Diego. 
Chandler was instrumental in helping San Jose out of a similar financial crisis 
a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to avoid losses, Boland said that on Thursday he asked finance 
directors of about 100 municipalities and special districts that invest in the 
county pool "to sit tight." 
</P>
<P>
 Boland told the assembled officials: "We are all in this together. We have 
enjoyed the good times, we have to hang together and enjoy the bad times, and 
if we don't hang together, we have a problem. We have to come to an agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 He also told the investors that they can expect reduced returns on their 
investment even if they do stand by the fund -- returns of 4% this year 
compared to nearly 6% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 That loss of interest could cost the San Diego Unified School District as much 
as $1 million next year, said the district's controller, Henry Hurley. But like 
school districts generally, the schools have no choice but to keep idle cash on 
deposit with their county treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 To help ensure there is no run on the fund, Boland is forming an advisory 
committee, including representatives of four cities, to evaluate withdrawal 
requests. So far there appears to be no stampede. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the idea of having the value of my investments go down," said El 
Cajon Finance Director James Kell, whose city has $24 million in the San Diego 
County pool. "But as long as nobody panics and everybody remains cool, then I 
think we can weather this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Anxiety levels are also high in other counties that, like San Diego, have 
relied on derivatives and other devices for raising their rates of return. 
</P>
<P>
 San Bernardino, Monterey, Placer, Sonoma and Solano are among the counties 
that have relied heavily on these devices. But their treasurers insist that 
they are on much more solid ground than Orange County and do not expect any 
problems meeting their obligations. 
</P>

Michael Kennedy also contributed to this story in Los Angeles.

EX-OAKLAND POLICEMAN WHO SAID WIFE NAGGED HIM CONVICTED IN HER MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former police officer who said his wife's nagging made him strangle her was 
convicted of murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Carlen, who had spent 22 years on Oakland's police force, cried as the 
jury returned the verdict Thursday.His lawyer had argued for a voluntary 
manslaughter conviction, saying the killing was an unplanned crime of passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlen, 48, testified that his wife of 15 years, Carol Ann, had nagged and 
dominated him for years. He said that on the day he strangled her, she had been 
bothering him about making frivolous mail order purchases and said she wanted 
to take their long-planned vacation to Germany alone. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he strangled her in their Alameda home, put her body in the trunk of 
her car and drove it to an industrial part of Oakland. He spray-painted the 
word "War" in bright orange paint on the car, then reported his wife missing. 
Prosecutors said Carlen tried to make the murder look like a gang killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlen will be sentenced Jan. 17. He faces 25 years to life in prison.

HUFFINGTON DENIES REPORT OF PLANS TO SELL HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Rep. Mike Huffington, who lost a costly and bitter U.S. 
Senate race to Democrat Dianne Feinstein on Nov. 8, said Friday that Huffington 
has no plans to move from his Santa Barbara-area mansion and is not putting the 
property up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports that Huffington and his wife, Arianna, were going to list the 
Italian-style home known as Villa Ruscello with a realty agent were unfounded 
"and a little bizarre," Jennifer Grossman, a spokeswoman for the family, said 
in a telephone interview from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have no interest in selling the home," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Grossman added, the Huffingtons have moved Arianna Huffington's 
ailing father from Greece to the Montecito house to live with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The report that the Huffingtons planned to put the house on the market 
originated in the San Francisco Examiner early this week. A version of the 
report distributed by the Associated Press appeared in The Times on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spent $27.5 million of his personal fortune on his losing Senate 
race.

U.S. PLEDGES TO CLOSE ANY GAP IN QUAKE RECOVERY FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal disaster officials said Friday that they will provide earthquake 
relief funds for all eligible roads, schools, hospitals and other government 
structures damaged in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake even if they must ask 
Congress for more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Emergency Management Agency officials were reacting to state and Los 
Angeles County reports that estimates of damage to public facilities have 
doubled to about $6 billion.The $2.8 billion allocated for such repairs has not 
yet been exhausted, FEMA said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional Director Shirley Mattingly, in a letter to the county, denied that a 
"purported shortfall" of federal funds was hampering quake recovery efforts. 
Projects are funded based on their eligibility, not funds allocated and 
available at a given time, she said.

GOP LEGISLATORS REJECT BROWN'S OVERTURE; POLITICS: FRESHMEN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS 
CALL HIS INVITATIONS TO PRIVATE MEETINGS A BLATANT ATTEMPT TO DIVIDE THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Freshman Assembly Republicans on Friday flatly rejected as the "political 
equivalent of jury tampering" an offer by Democrat Willie Brown to meet 
privately to settle the speakership fight and organize the lower chamber for 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter signed by all 18 GOP newcomers, they told Brown his invitation 
amounted to a "blatant and transparent attempt to split and divide the newly 
elected Republican freshman members of the Assembly." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, fighting to regain the state's second most powerful political office, 
sent letters Tuesday to each of the new GOP members inviting them to meet with 
him privately to discuss their "interests, desires and needs" before the new 
session gets started in earnest Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assembly Republicans rebuffed the invitation as an attempt to persuade 
them to abandon GOP leader Jim Brulte's quest to become Speaker and reelect 
Brown. Currently, the Assembly is without a Speaker, with Brown and Brulte tied 
with 40 votes each. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Speaker's key powers is the authority to make committee assignments 
and appoint committee chairs, which Brown has used to solidify his political 
base by rewarding his supporters. In an apparent attempt to drive home his 
point, a Brown postscript told the freshmen: "I hope you have completed your 
committee preference list and have forwarded it to the chief clerk." 
</P>
<P>
 But the new GOP Assembly members replied Friday that Brown's "attempts to 
utilize political insider tactics to remain as Speaker to overturn the verdict 
of the California electorate is nothing less than the political equivalent of 
jury tampering." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans won 41 seats in the Nov. 8 election, setting the stage for a 
takeover of the lower house for the first time in more than two decades. But 
their plans were upset Dec. 5 when maverick Republican Paul Horcher of Diamond 
Bar broke ranks and voted for Brown, deadlocking the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, neither Brown, of San Francisco, nor Brulte, of Rancho Cucamonga, 
has produced the 41st vote needed to become Speaker.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Brown, who has been pitching a "power sharing" arrangement with 
Republicans to break the stalemate, is talking to the public in an attempt to 
build popular support for returning as Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 His aides said Friday that Brown has participated in at least 20 talk shows 
and news interviews since the Dec. 5 deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an ongoing effort to make sure that our unfiltered viewpoint is out 
to the public so they better understand what is going on in Sacramento," said 
Brown's chief of staff, Michael Galizio. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, for example, Brown spoke with Los Angeles Times editors and made 
several other media appearances in Los Angeles, Galizio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's offensive was characterized by Assembly GOP spokesman Phil Perry as a 
desperate attempt to recapture the post, and Perry said Republicans will 
attempt to counteract Brown.

BODY STOLEN FROM A GRAVE IS RECOVERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The remains of a 20-year-old Texas woman whose body was stolen from her 
freshly dug grave were recovered Friday, but authorities said they still had no 
motive or suspects in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 A newspaper delivery man discovered the body of Melinda Ann Lee lying by the 
side of a South Dallas road Friday morning, said Capt. Larry Williams with the 
Dallas County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The local medical examiner's office used dental records to identify the 
remains, which were unearthed from Restland Memorial Park sometime between 
Monday night and Tuesday morning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators declined to reveal any details about the condition of the body, 
but said interviews with Lee's friends and family have put them no closer to 
solving the bizarre case. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee died Dec. 7, nearly two months after she was involved in a car accident 
with an alleged drunk driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Her body was stolen two days after her burial last Saturday.

DOG ON DEATH ROW GIVEN REPRIEVE AFTER OUTPOURING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Labrador retriever that last week was sentenced to die by lethal injection 
for chasing mail carriers won a reprieve Friday when a judge dismissed the case 
against the canine. 
</P>
<P>
 But nature may carry out the sentence anyway.Veterinarians this week found out 
that 5-year-old Smokey has heart worms and will die unless he gets treatment. 
And they said owner Craig Shawn Jackson has told them that he would rather see 
the animal go naturally. 
</P>
<P>
 Smokey's legal case drew hundreds of phone calls and petitions from around the 
world after Danville City Judge T. Ryland Dodson ordered the dog destroyed Dec. 
6 for chasing -- but not biting -- three mail carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 The pleas for clemency included a letter to Dodson from former Secretary of 
State Henry A. Kissinger and a petition from 40 members of the Italian Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most amazing thing I've ever heard of," Dodson said Friday in a 
telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole community's been harassed for more than a year, including the mail 
people, who won't even deliver mail on that street. The news media quite often 
doesn't get the total picture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paulette Dean, director of the Danville Humane Society, said authorities 
returned Smokey to Jackson on Friday, but the owner, who no longer faces a $50 
fine for keeping a vicious animal, has refused to consider the treatment, which 
can cost up to $350. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said other members of Jackson's family pledged to make sure the dog 
recovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodson said he chose to spring Smokey after finding that the city ordinance 
was not in compliance with a recent amendment to state law.

2 AIRLINES HALT FLIGHTS, CITING SAFETY ISSUES; TRAVEL: AMERICAN EAGLE, KIWI 
SUSPEND SOME SERVICE DUE TO PILOT TRAINING CONCERNS. AND THE FAA PROBES 
SABOTAGE ABOARD 5 JUMBO JETS IN NEW YORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Two airlines suspended flights because of safety concerns Friday, and federal 
officials said that a separate investigation was under way into five instances 
of sabotage aboard one company's jumbo jets at Kennedy International Airport -- 
all adding to an increasingly nervous Christmas travel season. 
</P>
<P>
 Some travel agents reported passengers expressing fear and resistance to 
booking commuter flights in the wake of two crashes in six weeks that killed a 
total of 83 people. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, American Eagle grounded flights in Chicago serving 10 Midwestern 
cities as pilots demanded more training before taking off in icy weather. 
Reservation agents sought to place travelers on other airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 At Newark International Airport in New Jersey, Kiwi International Airlines 
voluntarily suspended most of its service Friday because of FAA questions about 
the carrier's pilot training records. The suspension will continue until Kiwi 
can persuade the FAA that its training meets government standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA did allow Kiwi's 6:10 p.m. flight to West Palm Beach, Fla., to leave 
Newark after the crew proved it had the required training, said FAA regional 
administrator Arlene B. Feldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the FBI said that five Boeing 747 jets belonging to Tower Air were 
sabotaged at New York's Kennedy International Airport in November. The sabotage 
wasn't subtle, and sources close to the investigation said the damage appeared 
to be the work of a disgruntled employee rather than terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage was discovered after ground crews received false readings from 
cockpit instruments during preflight checks. In each instance, wires were cut. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, American Eagle announced it was 
halting service until Jan. 4 between Chicago and the following cities: 
Champaign and Peoria, Ill.; Ft. Wayne and South Bend, Ind.; Columbus and 
Toledo, Ohio; Lansing and Traverse City, Mich.; and Green Bay and Madison, Wis. 
American Eagle also canceled some of its flights at Kennedy, starting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline said it was acting after representatives of the Allied Pilots 
Assn. -- one of four unions representing pilots at American Eagle -- questioned 
the level of cold weather training that pilots recently assigned to Chicago and 
New York had received. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilots were scheduled to fly Swedish-built Saab 340 aircraft after the FAA 
ordered French- and Italian-built ATR-42 and ATR-72 aircraft grounded during 
icy conditions. The FAA acted a month after an American Eagle ATR-72 crashed on 
Oct. 31 in Indiana, killing all 68 on board. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, an American Eagle Jetstream Super 31 crashed as it was approaching 
Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina, killing 15 people, 
although weather was not immediately suspected as a cause. 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines spokeswoman Mary Frances Fagan insisted Friday that the Saab 
340 pilots -- who normally fly more southerly routes -- were amply trained for 
cold weather. The airline hopes to resume service Jan. 4 with pilots from the 
three other unions, Fagan said, noting that "the difference is that their union 
leadership has not raised the safety issue," Fagan said. 
</P>
<P>
 APA President James G. Sovich said the majority of the pilots in his union 
have had no recent experience flying in winter weather. He said the only 
preparation management gave them was a 400-page insert in their flight manuals 
along with some information on how to navigate around O'Hare -- all handed to 
them Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the pilots neither "requested nor demanded" the flight suspensions, 
Overman said. The union did not think the airline needed to shut down to 
address the pilots' concerns, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not talking about weeks of classroom instruction -- just something more 
thorough than what they received," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For passengers, it meant long lines Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Nashville, Tenn., an American Eagle Jetstream Super 31 commuter 
plane landed with one of two engines out Friday as it returned for maintenance 
following an emergency landing in Knoxville, Tenn., a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Mechanics could not determine why the engine went out, said Don Bedwell, an 
American Eagle spokesman. The plane was being flown to Nashville with just two 
crew members aboard. The flight Thursday was carrying six passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 In New Jersey, Kiwi's suspension disrupted service on routes linking Newark, 
Chicago, Atlanta, portions of Florida and Puerto Rico. The airline, which was 
started two years ago by former employees of Eastern, Pan Am and other 
carriers, said it hoped to resolve the dispute with the FAA shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have never blown a tire, overshot a runway or scratched a plane in over 
23,000 flights," said Bob Iverson, the company's chief executive officer in a 
fax that was sent to travel agents. "Our pilots average nearly 20 years of 
experience as commercial aircraft pilots and the 1,000 employee/owners of Kiwi 
stand behind their flying records." 
</P>
<P>
 Tower Air, which serves Israel, South America, Europe and India as well as 
portions of the United States, said its own personnel "detected and corrected 
cut wires . . . in five instances during early November in which we suspect the 
cuts were deliberate." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said most of the wires were cut in obvious places, in some instances 
disabling the planes' in-flight entertainment systems. Two of the planes that 
suffered other damage were cargo aircraft. In one of the incidents, 19 wires 
were severed. 
</P>
<P>
 Since discovery of the sabotage, security has been tightened and no further 
damage has been reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA, FBI and the Port Authority Police Department, which has jurisdiction 
over Kennedy, are conducting a joint investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman reported from New York, Beckham from Chicago.

LOUISIANA DEMOCRAT WEIGHS LEAVING PARTY FOR GOP; POLITICS: REP. BILLY TAUZIN'S 
DEFECTION COULD BE FIRST OF SEVERAL. HE SAYS SOUTHERN CONSERVATIVES ARE TIRED 
OF BEING SHUNNED BY DOMINANT LIBERAL WING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Believing that he may set off a new political earthquake for the Democrats, 
Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (D-La.) this weekend is going home to the bayous of 
his southern Louisiana district to contemplate the search for a new 
philosophical home. 
</P>
<P>
 By next week, Tauzin could become a Republican, and his switch could have 
far-reaching implications for his congressional career, for Democrats in 
Congress and for the future of politics in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 Tauzin is a conservative Southerner who charges that the liberal House 
Democratic leadership has closed its ranks to members like him. Within a month 
of the Republicans' Nov. 8 victory at the polls, Tauzin announced that he was 
thinking of defecting to the GOP. And the new House Republican leadership has 
returned the attention, courting Tauzin with political inducements, a committee 
chairmanship and promises of philosophical kinship. 
</P>
<P>
 Tauzin would not be the first national Democratic lawmaker to join the GOP 
since the elections. Alabama Sen. Richard C. Shelby, charging on Nov. 9 that 
the "Democratic Party is incapable of reform," has that distinction.  
</P>
<P>
 But if he goes, Tauzin believes that his departure will set off a slow trickle 
of defections among like-minded Southerners. As many as a dozen, he believes, 
could follow him, although only two have openly acknowledged that they are 
contemplating such a switch. 
</P>
<P>
 And if they let him go without a fight, said Tauzin, the Democrats would be 
conceding two things: first, that they are a party of liberals who are 
incapable of responding to the public's increasingly conservative mood and, 
second, that Democrats are willing to forfeit the politically powerful South, 
as well as their chances of regaining a congressional majority, to the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we (conservative Democrats) are a shrinking minority in the House, 
the question is, can we abide the discrimination?" Tauzin told The Times. He 
has complained that conservative Democrats are routinely denied plum committee 
assignments, leadership posts and even the right to speak on the floor by 
Democratic leaders.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, the battle I'm waging is over the willingness of the Democratic 
leadership to give every member the same effectiveness any other member has. If 
I'm going to be affected by a glass ceiling because of the way I vote, my 
ability to voice my constituents' concerns is affected and I'm not going to put 
up with that. . . . I'm gonna find a new home." 
</P>
<P>
 If Tauzin stays in the Democratic Party, however, it will be at a distinct 
cost to the House Democratic leadership. He already has won one of his 
conditions: The Democratic leadership has agreed to Tauzin's demand that 
Democrats reject rules that bar renegade Democrats from serving in the House 
leadership or as committee chairmen.  
</P>
<P>
 But that means the party will have to tolerate Democrats who look and act like 
Republicans -- not only among the party's House ranks but in their leadership.  
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats' partial concessions have yet to regain the loyalty of Tauzin, 
who said that he has been stung by the indignities of being shunned by 
Democratic leaders over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be a very big doubting Thomas," he said. In the end, Tauzin said 
that he will decide to which party he belongs after a series of public and 
private meetings this weekend with his family, his constituents and his 
supporters in Louisiana's Third District. 
</P>
<P>
 What he will find, said political analysts, is an electorate that is part of a 
growing trend throughout the American South: staunchly Democratic since 
reconstruction, Southerners are abandoning the party and turning in increasing 
numbers to the GOP, where they believe that their conservative convictions are 
welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 While the South has voted overwhelmingly Republican in presidential races for 
many years, the realignment of the region's national legislators is now just 
catching up. For the first time in history, Southerners voting in the November 
elections sent more Republicans than Democrats to the House, awarding 16 new 
seats to the GOP. And the House leadership, anchored by Georgia Republican Newt 
Gingrich, reflects the region's new role as a potential Republican powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the second wave of Southern realignment and that's what Tauzin and 
others are looking at," said Earl Black, a political scientist at Rice 
University in Houston. "They're seeing an erosion of the Democratic base and 
contemplating whether now is the time to make a move. This is the return of the 
conservative Southerners, now as Republicans, in leadership positions and as a 
majority in Southern delegations." 
</P>
<P>
 For disgruntled Democrats like Tauzin, that historic shift means that a 
defection to the GOP could come at relatively little political cost. Although 
registered Democrats continue to outnumber Republicans in Louisiana several 
times over, their party affiliation has grown weak. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Tauzin's 76-year-old mother, Enola Tauzin, a lifelong Democrat, reflects 
that breakdown. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "For a while the Tauzins were all very Democratic, and so were my family, the 
Martinezes," said Mrs. Tauzin, whose political advice the congressman has vowed 
to take first. "I suppose at heart we were Democrats. But the country's 
changed. I don't believe labels mean too much anymore, and the young people, it 
doesn't make too much difference to them." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, said one of Tauzin's Louisiana advisers, the 51-year-old lawmaker 
may choose between a philosophically comfortable political home with the GOP 
and a cold calculation of the Democrats' prospects of regaining power in the 
House.  
</P>
<P>
 "Suppose these (Republicans) are fly-by-night, that they do 10-20% of what 
they say they want to do and get 90% of the people mad at them in the process?" 
asked Clifford Smith, a 60-year-old civil engineer from Houma, La., who has 
known Tauzin for 25 years and served as his campaign's finance chairman for 
three years.  
</P>
<P>
 Tauzin is "not only got to ask where he's going to be. He also has to ask, 
where are they going to be?"

OWNERS OF DEER FACE YULETIDE CRUELTY TRIAL; COURTS: JUDGE TURNS DOWN THEIR 
REQUEST TO DELAY THE CASE UNTIL AFTER CHRISTMAS. FATHER AND SON DENY A CHARGE 
THEY ABUSED THEIR ANIMAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The timing, the defendants contend, is too damaging to be a coincidence. 
Charged with cruelty to a reindeer, they face trial virtually on the eve of 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some hidden agenda on the part of the city attorney to bring this to 
trial before Christmas," defense attorney James R. Tweedy complained Friday, 
arguing that prosecutors jockeyed the trial into the holiday period in order to 
portray the defendants as the grinches who killed Rudolph. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors scoffed at the notion that they would calculatedly try to maneuver 
the trial into a time period when jurors might be feeling particularly 
unsympathetic to alleged reindeer-abusers. 
</P>
<P>
 Siding with the prosecution, San Fernando Municipal Court Judge L. Jeffrey 
Wiatt denied a defense request to delay the trial of Stuart Miller and his son 
William until after Christmas. Jury selection began immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The Millers, who ran a major San Fernando Valley Christmas tree business in 
prior years, have been charged with one count of cruelty to an animal in the 
death of one of their herd of deer and one count of possessing wild animals 
without a license. They could be sentenced to up to a year in jail and fined up 
to $21,000 if convicted on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
 The deer were displayed at the Millers' tree sales lots to remind buyers of 
Santa's reindeer during the holiday season, and they were kept in several pens 
around the area the rest of the year. The creatures are not actually reindeer, 
but European fallow deer pressed into service as reasonable facsimiles of their 
larger cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 One of a herd of eight died Aug. 10 at a yard in Granada Hills where the 
Millers kept the animals, in what city animal control officers said were 
unhealthy conditions. The animals had insufficient water and the one that died 
had 15 feet of chicken wire and coat hangers tangled in its antlers and around 
its neck -- showing that the fencing used was dangerous to the animals -- the 
prosecution argues. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officers were forced to lasso it to remove the junk endangering 
it, they said, but shortly after that, the animal died. The officers had 
earlier that month posted warnings at the site, ordering that the deer's living 
conditions be improved. 
</P>
<P>
 The Millers, however, blame the officers for the death. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers were so eager to embarrass the Millers in a running dispute over 
the treatment of the deer that they hogtied the ailing animal to keep it in 
place until a Times photographer could arrive to get a picture of it, said 
Stuart Miller, 52, to reporters outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 He also blamed The Times, saying the newspaper acted "so they could get a 
trash story . . . at the deer's expense, the deer's life." 
</P>
<P>
 "My son Will and I are not, nor ever have been, guilty of cruelty to animals," 
he said, arguing that many people who live near his deer pens could attest to 
the good care he gave the animals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prosecutor, Deputy City Atty. Norman Wegner, told reporters that the 
deer "was already in extremely dire straits," due to "the fairly callous 
neglect of the condition of the animal" and that the Millers cannot blame the 
animal control officers for trying to save it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wegner said the Millers took good care of the deer during the Christmas 
season, but neglected them in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal control officers said they made two trips to the Granada Hills pen 
after receiving complaints from neighbors in August. On their second visit, on 
Aug. 10, they found the deer writhing in pain, with pieces of the fence stuck 
in its antlers, Wegner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers had found the herd's metal water tubs empty on their first trip, 
Wegner said, and posted a warning that the site had to be cleaned and the fence 
mended. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Millers have been prominent in the Valley at Christmas for years, 
Stuart Miller said that a personal bankruptcy, unconnected to his Christmas 
tree sales, has closed down the family business this year. He is still active 
in Christmas tree farms in Oregon, he said, and his son is working for another 
Christmas tree operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior Miller opened his first Christmas tree lot as a teen-ager in 
Granada Hills. The enterprise grew into Miller & Sons Christmas Tree Co. of 
Mission Hills, which proclaimed itself the "McDonald's of the Christmas tree 
business," operating as many as 50 lots in California, including eight in the 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller was known for hardball business practices, which included suing smaller 
Christmas tree dealers and quarreling with neighbors who complained about noise 
and light from his lots. 
</P>
<P>
 His most famous quarrel pitted him against the Cicero family, longtime 
operators of Valley farming operations, a battle that lasted several years and 
came to be dubbed "The Christmas Tree Wars." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller brought legal actions complaining that it was unfair competition to 
sell trees from farmland the Ciceros leased at Pierce College. Miller contended 
that other tree sellers should have been able to bid on the site, as publicly 
owned land. 
</P>
<P>
 He succeeded at one point in getting college administrators to order the 
Ciceros off the land, but the Ciceros attracted widespread public sympathy and 
were allowed to remain.

A LEAP OF FAITH; HOLIDAYS: DAN SHUSTER MAY BE JEWISH, BUT HE PROVIDES CHRISTMAS 
TREES FOR FAMILIES ALL OVER THE VALLEY AND THE NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dan Shuster is among the jolliest of the jolly and filled with generosity when 
the Christmas season rolls around, and for good reason -- he owns the 
third-largest Christmas tree business in the nation, which expects to take in 
nearly $12 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just the money but the joy of the season. "It's a great pleasure for 
me to go to a tree lot and see a family choose a tree that's going to be their 
home's centerpiece for two, three or four weeks," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He never has a tree of his own, however, because the Christmas tree magnate is 
Jewish. 
</P>
<P>
 And Shuster, 62, a committed Jew who grew up in a traditional Jewish family, 
has been president of one synagogue and is on the board of another, serves on 
the board of the Jewish Federation Council's semiautonomous San Fernando Valley 
Alliance and is chairman of the large Valley Jewish Festival planned for May 21 
at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuster says there has never been a conflict between his religion and his main 
livelihood for 25 years, Yule Tree Farms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see where one thing interferes with the other, because if I weren't 
doing it, somebody else would be," said Shuster, who lives in Woodland Hills 
and has an office in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor, Shuster said, has he ever compromised his faith by placing what some Jews 
jokingly call a "Hanukkah bush" in his home -- evergreen trees that critics 
regard as subterfuge for sneaking a popular Christian custom into the Jewish 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hanukkah is not 'Jewish Christmas' and should not be observed as a 
substitute," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To each his own, he says. "Everybody has to have some beliefs, and they ought 
to enjoy them, particularly for the sake of their families." 
</P>
<P>
 At Encino's Valley Beth Shalom, where Shuster is a board member, Rabbi Jerry 
Danzig, executive director of the synagogue, said Shuster is widely respected 
in the Jewish community. "He's a gentle person and a delight to be with," the 
rabbi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuster even displays what Christians praise as the "true Christmas spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 "He does incredible work with food banks," Danzig said. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the seasonal nature of his primary business, Shuster and his partners 
also run a company that sells canned and frozen food to prisons. "We do this 
mainly to keep our crew together for Christmas," Shuster said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company donates some food to charities, notably to One Voice, a Santa 
Monica-based organization that works with Head Start educational programs and 
has an annual Christmas giveaway for the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give them Christmas wreaths to go with the food boxes," Shuster said. "At 
the very end of the season, I give One Voice a couple thousand Christmas 
trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Silbert, founder-director of One Voice, said that the generous Shuster 
"sends us between 5,000 and 6,000 fresh, full, wonderful trees -- not dead 
leftovers" to distribute to the needy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids scream with joy," said Silbert, a former sociology professor at Cal 
State Northridge who started One Voice in 1981. "I've been so moved because 
sometimes they are more pleased with the trees than the food because they 
didn't expect to have a Christmas tree." 
</P>
<P>
 It was only by chance that Shuster got into the Christmas tree business. He 
earned a master's degree in poultry husbandry at Penn State and had a 
fast-growing chicken ranch in Norco when he decided that that business was too 
time-consuming and became a food broker. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a friend of Shuster's moved to Oregon and started growing Christmas 
trees as a hobby. "The thing grew," Shuster said, "and all of a sudden he 
didn't know what to do with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked by his friend to become a partner, Shuster first protested that he knew 
nothing about Christmas trees because he never had one in his home. But his 
friend persuaded him, saying that he needed someone who was unafraid to meet 
people and was based in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The business has grown every year since," said Shuster, who is in charge of 
marketing and sales. "We ship trees all over the country and as far away as 
Singapore, and this year we expect to ship out 650,000 trees." 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, his retail clients include Albertson's and Vons 
grocery stores, Home Depot and places such as Cicero's on the northwest corner 
of Pierce College in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The firs and pines are farmed on 4,000 acres around Canby, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes six years to grow a tree and we have more than 4 million in the 
ground at present," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, however, Shuster will cut his workload in half, turning over more of 
his business to a son-in-law, Barry Kodish of Agoura Hills, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuster has volunteered to direct arrangements for the Valley Jewish Festival 
on May 21, an outdoor cultural fair sponsored by the San Fernando Valley Jewish 
Alliance that he hopes will exceed in scope the Valley's Exodus Festivals of 
1989, 1991 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping we'll get 50,000 people," he said. "I think it's important to 
have good entertainment, ethnic food, booths to learn about Jewish agencies and 
a time when people can meet one another in one of the largest Jewish 
communities in the country."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CHRISTMAS SHOW TO FEATURE REAL SNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calabasas residents will be treated Tuesday to a rare sight in Southern 
California: snow. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third consecutive year, city officials have arranged with a 
snow-making company to cover a hillside in Gates Canyon Park with white stuff 
to celebrate Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just love it, because there is nobody else around here who has snow," 
said Heather Toma, a city recreation specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 A kickoff event, complete with Christmas carolers and Santa Claus, is 
scheduled for 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Tuesday. There will be refreshments and 
crafts for sale. Children ages 2 to 12 are encouraged to bring sleds and 
toboggans. Admission to the event will be $3. 
</P>
<P>
 The park will be open to non-residents as well, Toma said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Benedetto, chief executive officer of North Hollywood Ice, said it will 
take slightly more than an hour to cover a 200,000-square-foot area of Canyon 
Gates Park with three to four inches of snow, using snow-blowing machines that 
grind up large blocks of ice. The snow should last for two or three days, 
depending on the weather, he said. FRANK MANNING

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; STUDENTS BATTLE AD BLITZ WITH THEIR OWN ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the battle against the blitz of tobacco and alcohol advertising in 
low-income areas, eight elementary school students from the northeast San 
Fernando Valley have gained some big yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 Make that big signage. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, more than 350 students from elementary, middle and high 
schools in San Fernando, Arleta, Sylmar, Pacoima and Sun Valley entered a 
billboard-drawing contest to counter alcohol and tobacco advertising aimed at 
youth. Some of their work began appearing on area billboards this week. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public unveiling ceremony Thursday on Maclay Street in San Fernando, high 
atop a beauty supply store, 9-year-old Maxwell Rosenberg's simple message stood 
for all to see: "If You're Depressed, Talk To A Friend, Not A Bottle." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy. I'm excited to see it up there," Maxwell said, squinting at his 
handiwork. He sat sandwiched between his mother and the principal of his 
school, Canterbury Avenue School in Arleta. "The idea is just to keep kids off 
alcohol and drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Gannet Outdoor and Patrick Media Group Inc. donated the free ad space after 
the San Fernando and Pacoima Alcohol Prevention Coalition presented studies 
showing that alcohol and tobacco promotion outstripped all other kinds of 
billboard advertising in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier Flores, executive director of Pueblo Y Salud Inc., said studies showed 
that of 35 billboards identified in Pacoima and San Fernando, 32 were alcohol 
or cigarette-related. He said the concentration of that type of advertising is 
no accident: "They targeted us because of our minority population." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was news to us," said Ed Dato, director of government relations for the 
Chicago-based Patrick Media Group. "We don't have many billboards in that area, 
and we don't have a lot of cigarette or beer accounts either. But some of the 
other companies do. We agreed to help them change the pattern." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Gannet and Patrick Media agreed to cut their cigarette and alcohol 
advertising in half in the area, and also agreed to allow the community groups 
to use some of their billboards to spread alternative, health-related messages. 
</P>
<P>
 The student artwork selected to adorn the new signs is simple, the messages 
clear.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: UNIVERSAL CITY; POWER RANGERS CONCERT AIDS DARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid a barrage of pyrotechnics and a thundering rock and roll soundtrack, the 
Mighty Morphin Power Rangers made their nationwide live concert debut this week 
at the Universal Amphitheater, battling the evil forces of Rita Repulsa and 
Lord Zedd. 
</P>
<P>
 But the turned-to-life animated TV characters also helped advance the war 
against drug use by schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 About $400,000 in proceeds from Tuesday's show has been donated to DARE 
America (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) to supplement the organization's 
$6-million annual budget and boost a program that has dwindled in Los Angeles 
the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 As the organization's national teen-age ambassadors, the Power Rangers are 
able to reach students in Los Angeles junior high and high schools that no 
longer have DARE police officers present, said Glenn Levant, worldwide 
executive director of the DARE program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Power Rangers represent positive role models," said Levant. "They 
incorporate a lot of techniques that we use to help children avoid peer 
pressure, such as the idea that there is strength in numbers and that, to avoid 
bad elements, one should associate only with people in the right frame of 
mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Los Angeles Police Department in 1992 restricted its deployment of 
DARE officers to elementary schools, Levant said the Power Rangers are the only 
way to keep his program's message circulating among L.A. teen-agers and 
preteens. 
</P>
<P>
 "This program was designed to serve students from kindergarten through their 
senior year of high school. Now we provide them with just one-third of the 
curriculum," Levant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levant correlates the recently reported rise in drug experimentation among 
students to the absence of DARE officers at secondary schools in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the involvement of the Power Rangers will help remind adults of the 
need to assist and monitor their children's activities. Throughout the Power 
Rangers' seven-month national tour, DARE will have an information booth set up 
at each venue. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD spokesman Sgt. George Villalobos said the department recognizes the value 
of the DARE program but does not have the manpower to reinstate it on all 
school campuses. ANTONIO OLIVO

<P>
 The Contractors State License Board opened a new Earthquake Response Center in 
its Van Nuys district office Friday to deal specifically with complaints about 
contractors doing quake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of complaints has risen dramatically since victims of the 
Northridge earthquake began receiving insurance payments and federal funds to 
repair their homes, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the additional office, people can expect investigations into complaints 
to begin within two weeks of their first call, said Sam Haynes, a spokesman for 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
 He recommended that people have the full name and license number of the 
contractor when calling in a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 The number is (818) 908-4592. MAKI BECKER

JUDGE THROWS OUT EVIDENCE IN POLICE-PORNOGRAPHY CASE; COURTS: FLAWED SEARCH 
WARRANT WEAKENS CHARGES AGAINST EX-OFFICER WALTER BENTLEY JR., ACCUSED OF 
TAKING CHILD-SEX MAGAZINES FROM EVIDENCE LOCKERS FOR PERSONAL USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Saying he was troubled by a flawed search warrant, a Superior Court judge on 
Friday decided he had no choice but to throw out key evidence against a retired 
Los Angeles police officer accused of taking child pornography from police 
evidence lockers for personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling by Judge Robert J. Perry undercuts the charges against Walter Ray 
Bentley Jr., whose lawyer successfully argued that police failed to explain in 
the affidavit requesting the warrant why they needed to search his home in 
Granada Hills -- where investigators found dozens of illegal magazines, many of 
them stamped as Los Angeles Police Department evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, prosecutors are being forced to re-examine the case, saying they 
may have to drop the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ruling today clearly places this case in jeopardy and we have a number of 
options to study over the next month," Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Yochelson said 
after a hearing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The choices facing prosecutors include dismissing the charges or refiling them 
and appealing Perry's ruling, Yochelson said. He called the mistake by police 
an "accidental oversight" during the preparation of a complicated search 
warrant involving four locations and several cars. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bentley's attorney, Darryl Mounger, expressed confidence that the felony 
charges against Bentley -- one count of receiving stolen property and one count 
of possessing child pornography -- would be dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case for all intents and purposes is over," Mounger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley, 47, is also charged with 11 counts of illegally accessing police 
computer files in a separate case that gave rise to the discovery of the child 
pornography in his bedroom closet. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than face departmental charges stemming from the investigation, which 
began as an internal police matter, Bentley resigned last March after 23 years 
of service. 
</P>
<P>
 About 120 magazines and several 8-millimeter films were found during the 
search on June 9, 1993. The original purpose of the search was to look for 
evidence that Bentley had been leaking confidential criminal records to two 
private investigators in the San Fernando Valley, including a retired deputy 
LAPD chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some material for the computer case was taken from Bentley's home -- 
including two personnel rosters containing officers' names and serial numbers 
-- the bulk of the evidence was seized elsewhere and remains available for use 
by the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Yochelson on Friday declined to speculate on the future of the computer case 
against Bentley, saying he would have to discuss that matter, as well as the 
pornography charges, with his superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 The other men involved in the computer case have already been convicted and 
sentenced in separate plea agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Deputy Police Chief Daniel R. Sullivan -- who once headed the 
department's Valley Bureau -- pleaded no contest in September to five 
misdemeanor counts of unlawfully possessing confidential criminal histories. He 
he was fined $5,000 and placed on a year's summary probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Thomas Whiteaker, who runs a Mission Hills investigation 
firm, pleaded no contest to five identical charges and received the same 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they have videotaped evidence of an on-duty Bentley phoning his 
home for messages and then signing on to a nearby LAPD computer using various 
officers' serial numbers and passwords, allegedly to fill requests for 
confidential criminal background information. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounger tried Friday to suppress the surveillance videotapes, saying police 
violated Bentley's right to privacy at his workplace by setting up hidden 
cameras without first obtaining a search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry rejected the argument, agreeing with Yochelson that Bentley worked in an 
open office setting without an expectation of privacy, and that the 
surveillance began as an internal police probe that did not require the same 
legal safeguards as a criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perry said he was "very concerned" by the lack of any reference to 
Bentley's home in a lengthy affidavit in which police explained why they needed 
to search several locations in connection with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Bentley's house on Ludlow Street in Granada Hills, officers 
combed through a Police Academy office where Bentley was assigned and the 
private offices of Sullivan and Whiteaker. 
</P>
<P>
 The search warrant itself listed the Bentley home's address, according to 
Yochelson, but in the crucial supporting affidavit, police forgot to specify 
the location again and to spell out exactly why they needed to conduct a search 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no doubts that this was his home and that there was probable cause 
that illegal activity was going on," Perry said. "The problem I have with this 
case is that I am not at all satisfied with the affidavit. . . . There is 
nothing in the affidavit to indicate why they wanted to search his home." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the hearing, Mounger said Bentley had saved the magazines and films, 
which depicted underage girls in various sex acts, as "memorabilia" of his 
assignments at the Juvenile Division. He had plans to use them in training 
courses he sometimes led, Mounger added. 
</P>
<P>
 But Detective Bill Dworin, who heads the LAPD's sexually exploited child unit, 
said Bentley's job in the Juvenile Division had been more administrative than 
investigative, and that the few classes he taught had focused on physical, 
rather than sexual, abuse of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentley had easy access to the lockers where the unit kept evidence, however, 
Dworin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's never handled a case in our unit," Dworin said. "All that stuff was 
taken for his own personal use."

ACCUSED KILLER OF WOODLAND HILLS MAN MAY FACE 2ND MURDER CHARGE; CRIME: POLICE 
SAY THEY ARE '99% SURE' BODY FOUND NEAR CASTAIC IS THAT OF A CHICAGO WOMAN LAST 
SEEN WITH JACK ALAN GOGA. 
</P>

<P>
 Police said Friday they will seek a new murder charge against Jack Alan Goga 
-- who this week was charged in the death of a Woodland Hills man -- after 
tentatively identifying a body found in June as that of a Chicago woman who was 
last seen in Goga's company. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Detective Rick Swanston said authorities are "99% sure" 
that a body found June 14 near Castaic is that of Digna Adames, 25, who 
disappeared in mid-June after traveling to Los Angeles with Goga. 
</P>
<P>
 Goga, 50, who is being held in police custody in Michigan, has already been 
charged with the murder of Charles (Chick) Evans, whose body was found in his 
Woodland Hills home on Dec. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they have tentatively identified the body found near North Ridge 
and Lake Hughes roads as Adames after viewing coroner's photographs of bodies 
found around the time Adames disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Adames left a 7-year-old son in Chicago in May to travel to Los Angeles with 
Goga after the former Motown producer promised her a recording contract, family 
members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adames would call home frequently but the calls stopped after June 10, her 
father's birthday, said Adames' sister Rosa Medino in a telephone interview 
from Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Adames was reported missing in early July, and her family spent months 
agonizing over her fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope he gets what he deserves," Medino said of Goga on Friday. Of her 
sister, Medino said, "We just want to get the remains and bury her." 
</P>
<P>
 Police say they believe Goga killed Evans, 60, after the Woodland Hills man 
tried to get his house guest to leave.

CALABASAS BANK ROBBED TWICE IN 3 DAYS; CRIME: THE FBI IS STUDYING WHETHER ONE 
PERSON IS RESPONSIBLE IN BOTH HOLDUPS, IN WHICH ARMED MAN ASKED TO MAKE 
WITHDRAWAL AND ASKED FOR $100 BILLS.

<P>
 Twice this week a man has entered Southern California Savings, strode up to a 
teller, displayed a semiautomatic pistol and told the teller he wanted to make 
a withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice this week the robber has gotten away. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it was the same robber is one of the things the FBI is trying to 
determine. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, "he obviously feels comfortable in that bank," noted FBI spokesman John 
Hoos. 
</P>
<P>
 Descriptions of the robber differed only slightly, Hoos said, including the 
fact that the first one was clean-shaven and the second appeared to have a 
mustache. 
</P>
<P>
 But investigators believe it could be the same culprit, because the technique 
was virtually identical in both cases, he said. In both holdups -- the first 
about 3:45 p.m. Tuesday and the next about 1:30 p.m. Thursday -- the robber 
entered the bank on Calabasas Road and showed a teller a pistol in his 
briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first robbery, he said: "I'd like to make a withdrawal please." Then he 
told the teller: "Don't forget the hundreds." 
</P>
<P>
 The robber's words on Thursday were similar, Hoos said -- "I want to make a 
withdrawal" and "Do you have any hundreds?" 
</P>
<P>
 "In both cases he just exited the building and walked away," Hoos said. "It 
was quick in, quick out." 
</P>
<P>
 Robbers who target the same bank twice in three days are unusual, but far from 
unheard of, particularly in Los Angeles, Hoos said. "When you're the bank 
robbery capital of the world, anything can happen."

2 GRANT HIGH STUDENTS ASSAULTED BY GROUP; VIOLENCE: POLICE SAY THE 
NINTH-GRADERS WERE APPROACHED BY MORE THAN 20 YOUTHS WHO DEMANDED MONEY. THE 
PAIR WERE TREATED FOR CUTS AND BRUISES.

 Wielding hammers and baseball bats, a group of more than 20 youths attacked 
and beat two Grant High School students Friday when they refused the group's 
demand for money, according to school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack sent both ninth-grade boys to North Hollywood Medical Center, where 
they were treated for cuts and bruises and later released to their parents.But 
school officials were stunned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't had anything this large happen before with extortion," said Grant 
assistant principal Joe Walker. "This was a group of predators seeking prey, 
and they just decided to pick on these kids. It's odd that there were this many 
people -- 20 to 30 of them -- out looking for trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Both school security and a unit from the Los Angeles Police Department North 
Hollywood Division responded to the incident. Police Lt. Nick Zingo said police 
could not provide details until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Walker, the victims were walking down Hatteras Street near 
Burbank Boulevard at the edge of the campus about 10:30 Friday morning when 
they were approached by a group of between 20 and 30 people demanding money. 
</P>
<P>
 When the boys either didn't have money or refused to comply, they were hit 
with sticks, baseball bats and hammers, Walker said, adding that the boys were 
off-campus during school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Both boys were taken by paramedics to North Hollywood Medical Center, and the 
school nurse accompanied them. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims, whom Walker did not identify, did not get good looks at their 
attackers. "They were covering their faces," Walker said. He added later: "We 
don't know if they were our students or non-students or students from other 
schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker said, however, that he did not believe the attack was gang-related.

GALLEGLY TO HEAD TASK FORCE ON IMMIGRATION; POLITICS: HOUSE SPEAKER-DESIGNATE 
NEWT GINGRICH NAMES SIMI VALLEY REPRESENTATIVE TO LEAD SPECIAL CONGRESSIONAL 
PANEL THAT WILL DRAFT REFORM LEGISLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) did not win the immigration subcommittee 
chairmanship he had been pushing for but House Speaker-designate Newt Gingrich 
gave him a consolation prize Friday: the leadership of a special congressional 
task force on immigration reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before California's Proposition 187 stirred a national debate on the 
issue, Gallegly had emerged as a key player among Republicans in the effort to 
curb illegal immigration, introducing a series of controversial, hard-line 
measures. With the GOP now in the majority and immigration on the front burner, 
Gallegly said he was ready finally to implement change in the country's laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "For probably the first time since I've been in Washington, we have an 
opportunity to enact real immigration reform," Gallegly said in a statement. 
"The resounding approval of Prop. 187 in California and the increased focus on 
this issue . . . sends a clear message that America wants us to do something 
about the people who come here illegally." 
</P>
<P>
 The task force, whose membership is still uncertain, will work with the 
governors of border states and other officials in drafting legislation for 
congressional consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly became involved in the immigration issue in 1990 after officials in 
Agoura Hills complained to him about day laborers at a small shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Gallegly's district was split between eastern Ventura County and 
parts of the San Fernando Valley. Today his 23rd District encompasses all of 
Ventura County, except for most of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he introduced a package of bills intended to crack down on illegal 
immigration, including a controversial proposal that would amend the 
Constitution to deny citizenship to children born in the United States to 
illegal residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, who is entering his fifth term, would not say which of his 
immigration reform proposals introduced last session -- including a plan for 
tamper-proof identification cards for resident aliens -- would re-emerge in 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The other members of the task force and the group's exact scope will be hashed 
out early next month in meetings among Gallegly, Gingrich and Rep. Lamar Smith 
(R-Texas), chairman of the immigration subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 That panel, the launching point for immigration legislation, plans dozens of 
hearings on the issue during the coming year, with at least one planned for 
California in the next few months. Smith said he wants to proceed in a thorough 
fashion and build bipartisan support for any proposals, putting off voting 
until 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said California, which has the bulk of the country's illegal residents, 
will have a major voice in the debate. In addition to Gallegly's presence on 
the task force, two other Californians sit with Gallegly on the immigration 
subcommittee -- Rep. Carlos Moorhead (R-Glendale) and Rep. Sonny Bono (R-La 
Quinta). 
</P>
<P>
 As attorneys continue to battle over the legality of Proposition 187, which 
cuts off most government services to illegal immigrants, some anxious local 
immigrant rights activists are bracing for the proposals from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned about any new policies on immigration that are going to 
isolate U.S. citizens of Mexican descent as second-class citizens," said 
Armando Garcia, a spokesman for the Ventura County Coalition on Immigrant 
Rights. "We're going to be busy documenting abuses."

MOORPARK HOPES TO LURE AWAY NEWHALL FIRM; BUSINESS: CITY HELPS ASSEMBLE $8 
MILLION IN STATE AND LOCAL TAX BREAKS. SPECIAL DEVICES INC. IS CONSIDERING A

<P>
 The city of Moorpark has helped package about $8 million in state and local 
tax breaks to lure away a Newhall-based company with 700 jobs and head off the 
firm's flight to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapidly expanding company, Special Devices Inc., which makes small 
detonators used to spring car air bags, has outgrown its Newhall plant and 
wants to expand to more than 1,000 employees by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials picked a 285-acre parcel in an isolated part of Moorpark 
last spring, saying it is ideal for a new plant. The company would spend about 
$12.5 million building the facility on 15 acres, leaving the rest as open 
space, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 While company officials like the location, California state taxes and local 
fees would make the cost of building in Moorpark more than $10 million higher 
than in Mesa, Ariz., said Moorpark Councilman Scott Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials in Mesa, where Special Devices has another plant, have offered 
to give the company a graded parcel and have promised quick approval of 
construction plans, Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the processing fees for Mesa add up to about $62,000," Montgomery said. 
"Here in California, the county and city fees alone add up to about $1.6 
million. In addition, because of the environmental review process, it would 
take them about 10 months longer to build here. And we wonder why businesses 
are moving out of state?" 
</P>
<P>
 A Special Devices executive was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But city and state officials said they expect to meet with company executives 
next week to go over the incentive package. A decision is expected by the end 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined recruitment of Special Devices is part of an ongoing effort by a 
Ventura County "Red Team," a group of local officials, state legislators and 
economic development experts in the Wilson Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery said that Moorpark and Ventura County are offering to cut about $1 
million in fees, including about $700,000 that would go to road maintenance and 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also has pledged to cut through red tape and reduce the time it would 
take the company to get a building permit from 10 months to about six. The 
county would speed up its agency reviews and the city would combine Planning 
Commission and City Council hearings into one. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more significant are pledges for $5 million in state tax breaks, and an 
offer by the California Department of Transportation to contribute land that 
would add about $2 million to the package, Montgomery said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state tax credits could be claimed after the new plant is designated an 
enterprise zone by the Legislature, a proposal that Assemblyman Nao Takasugi 
(R-Oxnard) and state Sen. Cathie Wright (R-Simi Valley) plan to introduce next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 As an enterprise zone, the company's plant would be granted an estimated $5 
million in payroll and income tax credits, said Wright spokesman John Theiss. 
The tax credits would be for jobs the company creates over the next five or six 
years, Theiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incentive package was developed over several months in conjunction with 
the state Trade and Commerce Agency, part of the county's Red Team, said the 
agency's Tom Alfano. 
</P>
<P>
 "Along with officials from the city and county, we meet with the companies to 
hear what their needs are," Alfano said. "We look for creative ways to lure new 
businesses to the state and keep the ones we already have here." 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Gov. Pete Wilson sent a letter to Special Devices President Thomas 
Treinen encouraging him to stay in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Key bargaining sessions are set for Tuesday and Wednesday in Westlake Village. 
Moorpark officials are optimistic because the $8-million package now rivals 
Mesa's tax advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's close to making up the difference," Montgomery said. "Besides that, 
they would be able to stay in California, which is something they have said 
they want to do."

SLAIN WOMAN MOURNED AT VIGIL; TRAGEDY: FRIENDS AND FAMILY OF MARTIAL-ARTS 
INSTRUCTOR VERNOICA ESTRADA GATHER ON FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF HER STILL-UNSOLVED 
DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been a dark year for those who knew Veronica Estrada. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 of her friends and family gathered for an hourlong vigil Thursday 
night at the unlit roadside where the 29-year-old martial-arts expert was slain 
a year ago. They stood around a handmade cross illuminated by candles and 
flashlights, pondering her still-unsolved death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we didn't have to be here," Estrada's sister, Theresa, exclaimed 
suddenly, bursting into tears after the group joined hands and recited the 
Lord's Prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Some rushed to comfort her. Others cried among themselves or wandered off to 
stare into the bushes where Veronica's body was found the morning after the 
Dec. 15, 1993, killing. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cindy Jalving, one of her cousins, the vigil marked the first time she had 
visited the slaying site on the side of Soledad Canyon Road, one of the city's 
main thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I'm wondering as I'm looking at all this traffic is why nobody 
stopped to help her," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jalving made the inscribed, three-foot wooden cross that family members 
planted along the roadside, filling the hole with concrete when they were 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure someone might try to pull it out," Jalving said. "We want to make it 
difficult for them. This is a reminder to people." 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Estrada, a nationally ranked tae kwon do competitor who taught the 
martial art to children, was strangled while walking home from the Canyon 
Country studio where she worked. 
</P>
<P>
 A co-worker, Stuart Edward Milburn, 27, was arrested in March on suspicion of 
killing her, but two trials have ended in hung juries. Prosecutors say they 
will seek a third trial, but Milburn could be set free at a Dec. 27 hearing if 
a judge decides that no jury is likely to reach a unanimous verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada's death sparked a crusade to install street lights along Soledad 
Canyon Road by friends and relatives, who claimed her death might have been 
avoided if the area had been lighted. The Santa Clarita City Council approved 
the lights along a two-mile stretch in the spring, but the only light during 
the vigil came from flashlights and candles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The street lights are conspicuous in their absence," said Deborah Luck, a 
friend of Estrada's who launched the petition. 
</P>
<P>
 The city must get 60% of the property owners along the road, mostly absentee 
commercial landlords, to agree to the installation of lights, which would be 
paid for by all the property owners in the area, said City Engineer Tony 
Nisich. He added that one more signature should secure the funding -- and 
believes he has a willing participant -- and the lights can be erected within a 
couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
 Vigil participants said putting Estrada's death behind them is difficult, 
especially with ongoing events such as the trial and the effort to get street 
lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Misfortunes surrounding the tragedy continue: Theresa Estrada said a burglar 
broke into her garage Thursday morning and stole several boxes, including one 
filled with Christmas ornaments made by her sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened . . . while we were at the cemetery," she said.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; STUDY COUNTS FEWER PRACTICING MUSLIMS; ISLAM: ADHERENTS 
IN NORTH AMERICA TOTAL ABOUT 500,000, A SURVEY FINDS. BUT IT REMAINS A 
FAST-GROWING RELIGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The first scientific survey of mosques has found that organized Islam in the 
United States and Canada, although growing rapidly, is no larger than a small 
Christian denomination of about 500,000 adherents, a finding which may sharply 
lower many previous estimates of the total Muslim population. 
</P>
<P>
 The study nevertheless indicated that Islam may be, as reputed, one of the 
continent's fastest growing religions, which at the current rate of growth 
would overtake Judaism early in the next century as the second-largest 
religious group after Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 80% of the 1,046 Muslim congregations, mostly in the United States, 
were formed in the past 25 years, according to the survey directed by the 
Islamic Resource Institute of Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious scholars praised the survey as a long-sought starting point for 
establishing a factual profile of Islam in the United States and Canada, with 
its mix of mostly Indo-Pakistani and Arab immigrants and African American 
converts. A summary of the still-unpublished survey is included in a new Muslim 
resource guide for the news media, of which The Times obtained an advance copy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first solid research in this area," said sociologist Wade Clark Roof 
of UC Santa Barbara, who helped construct the poll. Roof is president-elect of 
the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey results should reduce some estimates of the overall American Muslim 
population, said Ihsan Bagby, who completed the study this year before taking a 
faculty position in international studies with Shaw University at Raleigh, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Some previous estimates by scholars and religious leaders have placed the 
number of Muslims in the United States and Canada at 6 million to 8 million. 
But because Islamic scholars commonly contend that only 10% of American and 
Canadian Muslims attend mosques, the new study's count of about 500,000 
mosque-goers indicates a total population of 4.6 million to 5 million, Bagby 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, that is well above the 2 million or less estimated by separate 
national surveys in 1991 by the Gallup Poll and the City University of New 
York. Islamic leaders disagreed with those findings as too low, saying that new 
immigrants and black converts are often missed by conventional polling. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, other studies show there are about 6 million Jews in the United 
States and Canada. That is only about 20% more than Bagby's estimate of the 
Muslim population, even though the number of Muslims was negligible until the 
1960s, while Jews have been established in large numbers on the continent for 
more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
 To arrive at the figure of nearly 500,000 Muslims who attend mosques, the 
survey's researchers asked each Islamic center how many people take part in 
activities other than Islam's two major feast days -- one marking the end of 
the fasting month of Ramadan and another that celebrates the time of the annual 
pilgrimage to Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagby said that the average number of such active participants per 
congregation was 465 people, which he multiplied by the 1,046 known mosques -- 
or masjids , an Arabic term for "house of prayer" that Muslims prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagby attributed the rapid growth of Islamic centers to a combination of 
immigration, conversions and births. "Based on immigration and conversion 
(rates) alone," he said, "it is safe to say that the Muslim population is 
growing a minimum of 125,000 a year." At that rate, the Muslim population would 
surpass the number of Jews in the United States and Canada by 2010, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether many of those people will associate with local Islamic centers is an 
open question. "The notion of masjid membership is not strong among Muslims," 
Bagby conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey showed that the actual number of "mosqued" Muslims -- those who 
have taken part in Islamic center prayer activities more than twice a year -- 
may be compared at best to the U. S. memberships of small Christian bodies such 
as the Church of the Nazarene, the nationwide Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran 
Synod and the Orthodox Church in America, an Eastern Orthodox denomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a tally based on actual mosque attendance, however, it has been 
difficult to gauge the true numbers of American Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always urged people not to exaggerate numbers of Muslims," said Salam 
Al-Marayati, director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles. "It 
adds more to people's apprehensions than to people's understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Muslims attend no mosque, in part, because in Middle Eastern, African and 
Asian nations -- where it is often the dominant religion -- Islam is not 
organized into the local church congregations common in North America. Moslem 
immigrants are thus unaccustomed to establishing such affiliations, Islamic 
leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagby said that the study was conducted from mid-1992 to last March through 
telephone interviews with representatives of 341 mosques. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only a handful, fewer than 10, refused to participate," Bagby said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most accurate study to date," said Yvonne Haddad, a 
much-published scholar on Islam in America. Haddad, who teaches at the 
University of Massachusetts, noted that Bagby "had every big gun in Islamic 
leadership in North America supporting his research." 
</P>
<P>
 One expected finding was that most masjids are multicultural. Seven of every 
10 masjids have more than one ethnic group worshiping there, Bagby said. Either 
African Americans or Indo-Pakistanis were the largest groups at most masjids, 
followed closely by Arab Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York City area has the largest number of masjids, 98, followed by the 
Chicago metropolitan area with 60 and Southern California with 55, the study 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Southern California ranked second highest in estimated total attendance at 
the traditional midday Friday prayers at its 55 masjids, with 11,858 
worshipers, compared to more than 27,000 in the New York area. (Devout Muslims 
are expected to pray five times daily, at home or work, and to attend a Friday 
service, if possible.) 
</P>
<P>
 The states with the largest numbers of masjids were New York (132), California 
(117), Illinois (74), New Jersey (60) and Texas (58). The highest attendance at 
Friday prayers was reported by 31 masjids in Washington, D.C. -- with an 
average of 472 people each -- and the 33 masjids in Toronto and the rest of the 
Ontario province of Canada, with an average of 328, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 The average Friday attendance in Southern California masjids was reported to 
be 242 people, a figure which fails to reflect the much larger attendance at 
some major masjids.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, the large Islamic Center of Southern California on Vermont Avenue 
in Los Angeles attracts between 1,000 and 1,500 people every Friday, according 
to Al-Marayati. And about 1,000 also attend services at the Islamic Society of 
Orange County in Garden Grove, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, combined attendance at two prayer services of the 
Islamic Center of Northridge on a recent Friday was between 320 and 360, said 
Hasan Mulla, director of the masjid. The Northridge masjid, which was organized 
in 1977, is currently constructing a new building in Granada Hills just north 
of the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller Valley area masjids hold Friday prayers in Van Nuys, North Hollywood 
and Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Islam in this country has loose federations rather than denominations. The 
survey found that 39% of the masjids are affiliated with the Islamic Society of 
North America, based in Plainfield, Ind., but 30% say they are independent. The 
next largest segment, 20%, follows the lead of Imam W. Deen Mohammed of 
Chicago, who has steered the once-sectarian Black Muslim movement into the 
Islamic mainstream over the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nation of Islam, headed by controversial Minister Louis Farrakhan, was not 
included in the survey, Bagby said. "The masjids we dealt with recognize each 
other as all belonging to the mainstream of Islam," and they do not consider 
Farrakhan's group in that mainstream, he said. Organized Islam 
</P>
<P>
 Mosques, called masjids or Islamic centers by Muslims, have been forming at a 
rapid rate in the U.S. and Canada in recent decades. Nearly 80% of the existing 
1,046 mosques were organized in the last 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Years mosques formed: Before 1960: 11% 1960-69: 11% 1970-79: 28% Since 1980:

 WITH BULLETINS? As the incoming chairman, Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez will 
deliver the annual "State of the County" address before the Orange County Forum 
on Jan. 10. Think he'll find anything to talk about? . . . A spokeswoman says 
tickets for the $35 luncheon event, at the Hyatt Regency Irvine, have sold 
briskly since news of the county's bond crisis. She adds: "Surprise, surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 SHOO RATS: All agencies here have bond crisis money troubles. But in the 
Fullerton School District, some things require no expense spared -- like 
fighting rats. . . . District trustees this week had to chuckle as they 
approved $665 spent on exterminator services because of a rat in the

was found partially eaten and a chair had huge chunks bitten out of it. . . . 
They got their money's worth -- the rat has not returned.

CLINTON TAX PLAN HAD ALLIES, FOES AT WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senior Administration economic policy-makers strongly opposed the middle-class 
tax cut proposal announced by President Clinton Thursday night but lost out to 
Clinton's political advisers, Administration and congressional sources said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 White House political aides argued that the sweeping tax cut proposal offered 
during the fall election campaign by Republicans had to be countered.  
</P>
<P>
 Alice Rivlin, director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, 
tried to rally other economic advisers to launch a last-minute fight against 
the tax cut, the sources said. But she and others were unable to sway the 
President in the face of mounting political pressure to announce a tax cut 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivlin felt "very distressed and lonely" when the President decided to go 
ahead with the tax cut, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officials said that they shared Rivlin's concerns about the tax plan. 
One Treasury Department official said Friday that senior officials in the 
department were worried that the tax cut package "is not good economic policy." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not about economics," the official said. "This was driven completely 
by politics."  
</P>
<P>
 However, the Treasury official's boss, Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, said Friday 
that he supports the Clinton plan because he is convinced that the spending 
cuts are real.  
</P>
<P>
 "My take on it is, if we didn't pay for this (with compensating reductions in 
spending), those economists that say that you would take it away from the 
people by an increase of interest rates are absolutely right," said Bentsen. 
"And that's why we fought so hard to see that it was paid for to the penny and 
that has been accomplished."  
</P>
<P>
 In a nationally televised address Thursday night, Clinton unveiled a package 
of personal tax cuts that appears to put the Administration squarely in the 
middle of a bipartisan bidding war over the hearts and pocketbooks of 
middle-class voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's middle-class tax cuts would include a $500-per-child tax credit for 
children under the age of 13 in families earning as much as $60,000, with 
smaller credits for those earning as much as $75,000. It also would provide 
deductions for as much as $10,000 a year in post-secondary education costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also called for an expansion of individual retirement accounts, 
granting the deduction to couples earning up to $100,000, and consolidation of 
federal job training programs into a single plan to provide training vouchers 
for those who lose their jobs. The Administration said that the President's 
plan would cost $60 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of internal opposition to the White House proposal came as outside 
economists criticized all tax cut proposals now on the table. Although many 
economists conceded that the middle class needs relief from stagnating wages 
and incomes, they argued that tax cuts of the kind being offered will not 
provide a long-term cure. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, they warned that this is exactly the wrong time to be cutting 
taxes -- when the economy is operating at close to full capacity and full 
employment. As a result, they said, any effort by the White House and Congress 
to stimulate the economy with a tax cut that will juice up the economy will 
prompt the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to apply the brakes and curb 
the threat of inflation -- thus wiping out economic gains from lower taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad economics," said Henry Aaron, an economist at the Brookings 
Institution, a Washington think tank. "This isn't the time to be cutting taxes, 
when the deficit is still large, and we certainly don't need any stimulus right 
now. And this could create the environment for a bidding war on taxes, with a 
steady stream of petitioners asking for their tax breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you will find that most economists share that view," Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those concerns were widely held by many Administration policy-makers who 
reluctantly signed off on the Clinton tax plan because they recognized the 
political momentum behind it and because the President remained committed to 
spending cuts that would fully offset the revenue lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts, however, believe that any spending cuts should be used for 
further reduction of the federal deficit -- not to compensate for revenue lost 
because of a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, sources said, it became clear that Clinton wanted to put a stop to 
the political beating he has taken for the last two years for failing to live 
up to his 1992 campaign pledge to provide a middle-class tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a group in the Administration who wanted to continue to press 
strongly on deficit reduction and not have any tax cuts," noted one senior 
Administration official. "We felt we had started on the path of deficit 
reduction and we should keep at it. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it was clear that the President had a commitment to live up to his 
campaign pledge for middle-class tax relief."  
</P>
<P>
 The major competing tax plan from the Republicans has come in the House 
"contract with America," which has as its centerpiece a tax cut that would 
provide a $500-per-child tax credit for all children in families with income of 
as much as $200,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has criticized the Republicans repeatedly for failing to spell out how 
they plan to pay for their cuts or how they would manage the finances of their 
separate proposal calling for a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet senior budget analysts have joined Rivlin in voicing concerns that Clinton 
also pushed ahead without a detailed plan for spending cuts. Clinton said that 
he would get about $24 billion in savings over five years, largely by 
consolidating or turning over to private hands major operations at several 
government departments, including the departments of Energy, Transportation and 
Housing and Urban Development.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Administration plans to obtain another $52 billion in savings 
by extending the current "freeze" on discretionary spending through 1999 and 
2000. Discretionary spending covers the budgets of most major government 
functions, except entitlements like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined, the White House argues that those savings would give Clinton enough 
money to compensate for the revenue lost to his tax reductions and still have 
enough left over to reduce the deficit by an additional $16 billion.  
</P>
<P>
 The White House has not yet specified what programs it will cut, however. Vice 
President Al Gore will announce the specific cuts from the departmental 
consolidations Monday and several senior Administration officials stressed 
Friday that the spending cuts from the extension of the discretionary cap into 
1999 and 2000 will be identified in the budget that the White House releases in 
February.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; DAILY DEVELOPMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 SUPERVISORS STRIKE BACK 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators were well aware of the county's financial slide and did 
nothing to stop it, some Orange County supervisors said. "We asked them for 
help and they said, 'No, hands off, we're not going to do anything," said 
Supervisor Roger R. Stanton."Now the only thing they have done, from the lips 
of the chairman, is to start throwing rocks." On Thursday the chairman of the 
Securities and Exchange Commission, which has subpoenaed supervisors' 
documents, suggested that voters should oust officials who are so lax in 
oversight. 
</P>
<P>
 AUDITS TURNED UP LITTLE 
</P>
<P>
 An outside auditing firm in 1993 found only one small problem in the office of 
county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron and repeatedly issued 
all-clears on the county's investment fund. The firm, KPMG Peat Marwick, has 
contributed more than $9,000 to supervisors and candidates for those jobs over 
the past 15 years. Now county officials and lawyers for fund investors see the 
firm as a target to blame for the county's financial mess. 
</P>
<P>
 SOME CASH GOING OUT 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County supervisors approved a plan to distribute cash to schools, 
cities and agencies in danger of not meeting payrolls or missing other crucial 
payments. The action would release up to $153 million from the now-frozen fund. 
A bankruptcy judge must still approve the action. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN DIEGO ANNOUNCES LOSS 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego County has lost $357 million in risky investments, the county 
treasurer announced, terming the shortfall "paper losses." He asked fund 
investors not to pull money out for fear of sparking a run on the account. 
</P>
<P>
 PORTFOLIO SALE GOES ON 
</P>
<P>
 The liquidation of Orange Count's portfolio continued, with Salomon Bros. 
auctioning off another $1 billion in securities.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; ROUNDUP OF THE INVESTIGATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These regulatory and law enforcement agencies are looking into the investment 
practices that led to the Orange County financial crisis: 
</P>
<P>
 SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 
</P>
<P>
 What it does: Federal agency regulates stock and bond brokers and the security 
industry as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Role in the bond crisis: The SEC has subpoenaed extensive records from the 
five-member Board of Supervisors and at least three financial advisers who 
helped the county issue bonds, the proceeds of which found their way into the 
troubled county investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 NATIONAL ASSN. OF SECURITIES DEALERS 
</P>
<P>
 What it does: An industry self-regulatory organization that oversees stock and 
bond brokerages and their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Role in the bond crisis: The NASD is investigating $3,000 in contributions 
from three Merrill Lynch employees to former county Treasurer-Tax Collector 
Robert L. Citron during his reelection campaign earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION 
</P>
<P>
 What it does: A federal watchdog agency that monitors activity on the various 
commodity market exchanges. It does for commodity futures trading what the SEC 
does for stock and bond trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Role in the bond crisis: The CFTC is reviewing documents to determine whether 
the county investment portfolio held any futures commodities and, if so, 
whether federal regulations were followed. 
</P>
<P>
 ORANGE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
</P>
<P>
 What it does: The county office prosecutes criminal violations of state and 
local law. It also represents the government in civil suits to collect taxes or 
take property for public use. 
</P>
<P>
 Role in the bond crisis: Probing the bond controversy, including possibly 
checking allegation that Citron accepted improper gifts from investment firms. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
</P>
<P>
 What it does: As an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice, the office 
prosecutes criminal violations of federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 Role in the bond crisis: Trying to determine if the U.S. mail or telephone 
wires were used to defraud investors in the now-collapsed county investment 
pool.

VIEWPOINT / LETTERS; CSUN ADMINISTRATION SHOULD SUPPORT FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hard to believe how Long Beach State can open their multimillion-dollar 
Pyramid complex and Cal State Northridge President Blenda Wilson, with her 
highly acclaimed unique talents, can't make a commitment to Northridge's 
underfunded football team. 
</P>
<P>
 And where has the creative thinking of the athletic department been? How come 
all of the businesses in the Valley who belong to various chambers of commerce 
haven't been sent free tickets to opening games along with an application for 
tickets for the rest of the season? 
</P>
<P>
 The students who allegedly voted down the student referendum to support 
athletics with a higher student activity fee (a huge part of the vote coming 
from off-campus facilities where students don't get involved with activities) 
should now understand that an admission fee may be charged to gain entrance to 
school athletic functions unless students purchase a semester pass to all 
athletic events. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ron Kopita, the Northridge dean of students, can tell us that interest in 
keeping the football team is running 50-50, then why can't he forget the 
disinterested 50% and start concentrating on what he's going to do for the 
normal 50%? 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, when is someone at Northridge going to step up and show some 
leadership and commitment to the football program and begin marketing it to the 
point where it will help finance the athletic department instead of tearing it 
apart from within? How many athletes have we lost due to a lack of leadership? 
How many athletes have gone elsewhere because the program is in limbo? 
</P>
<P>
 The administration at Northridge should concede that the '60s and '70s are 
over. Get with it or get lost.

JAZZ REVIEW; ELLIOT MOVES CROWD, BUT HE'S STUCK IN THE SAME PLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Elliot has a winning formula. The animated, pop-fired saxophonist 
knows just what to do to rouse his audience to appreciative ovations. 
</P>
<P>
 That formula -- accessible melodies, big but uncomplicated beats and an epic 
sense of drama -- worked its magic at the Galaxy Concert Theatre on Thursday, 
moving the crowd to cheers and long stretches of hearty applause a number of 
times over the course of Elliot's 90-minute performance. With these kind of 
results, who can blame the saxophonist for not taking any chances? 
</P>
<P>
 But a gamble or two was exactly what Elliot's show needed. There was no sense 
of daring, no experimentation, no willingness to look deeper into a melody or 
its rhythmic base. Instead, Elliot made it easy on his audience, and himself, 
by prying only superficially into each number's promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake: Elliot is skilled at what he does. He showed himself a master 
of emotive sounds, able to give the simplest line extra weight with tonal 
variations (squeals, squawks and gruff overtones) while developing the kind of 
dramatic interest one expects from a B-grade action-adventure film. But there's 
little sense of risk. Just like the movies, we know our hero will triumph in 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Working mainly from his new "After Dark" album, Elliot and his band came out 
under swirling smoke-machine cover and jumped right into the formula. Song 
after song followed the same course. 
</P>
<P>
 After stating the theme, Elliot would move into an improvisational section 
that developed slowly with individual notes, not phrases, taking the spotlight. 
Then, building through a series of dynamic stages, the solo would peak on a 
single, high, sustained tone, often played as a screech. There, the solo came 
to an abrupt end, dissolving back to the theme or picked up by another band 
mate. 
</P>
<P>
 This pattern was repeated on almost every tune, with a similar response from 
the crowd. You've got to hand it to the guy. He really knows how to milk an 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Elliot's use of long, single tones -- a frequent ploy -- was predictable. 
Time and again, the note came first in direct, vibrato-less style, then began 
to wobble as the saxophonist's wide vibrato set in.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the similarities in his approach, Elliot should get credit for 
employing the formula over a range of material, from funk and backbeat numbers 
to Latin-influenced songs and ballads. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunes such as the slow-paced "Song for Her" and the Spanish-flavored "El 
Anio," which opened with guitarist Richard Smith's impressive flamenco lines, 
gave needed variety to the upbeat program. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's brief solo spots were the evening's most electrifying moments, as he 
packed what little time he had with swirling lines and bent-note escapades. 
Bassist Naoki Yanai also was impressive, moving effortlessly through racehorse 
solo sections while pinning backbeat numbers with solid funk. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Elliot was at his most revealing when dealing with the familiar 
"Over the Rainbow" and Percy Sledge's "When a Man Loves a Woman." Here, his 
formula worked just fine, bringing soul and emotion to the familiar pieces as 
the saxophonist displayed a vocalist's sensibilities. Somehow, these two tunes 
make everything else he does seem redundant. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening act Rain-bo Tribe took a more varied approach, mixing jazz, hip-hop, 
reggae and Latin influences into an attractive, short set. The quintet's tune 
"Wayne's World," featuring trumpeter-keyboardist Michael Alan Henderson and 
saxophonist Lincoln Adler, began on a tough riff before moving into some swing 
for the brass. Their ill-conceived cover of the Isley Brothers' "For the Love 
of You," with bassist Rob McDonald's vocal, ended a promising set on a sour 
note.

DON'T FORGET THE LITTLE GUY; ART: GRASS-ROOTS PROGRAMS DEALING WITH 
MULTICULTURAL ISSUES MERIT SUPPORT, POET MITSUYE YAMADA TELLS ACTIVISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Japan-born, Seattle-bred poet Mitsuye Yamada spent part of her childhood in an 
internment camp in Idaho during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the 1950s, when she was a graduate student in English at the University 
of Chicago, " politics was a bad word," she said. "You weren't supposed to say 
anything in your poems except truth and beauty." 
</P>
<P>
 As Yamada explained Thursday morning to the Orange County chapter of Women 
For:, a political action group, the women's movement of the 1970s finally 
galvanized her awareness of herself as an Asian American writer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to get rid of my education," she said, "to get rid of the idea that 
political art . . . is lesser than world-class literature." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Yamada's talk at the Irvine Marketplace was grandly titled "Politics 
and the Arts: The Future Outlook for the Arts and Humanities in America," it 
turned out (perhaps because she had to attend a relative's funeral immediately 
afterward) to be a brief, low-key chat about the importance of supporting 
grass-roots programs dealing with multicultural issues in the arts and 
humanities. 
</P>
<P>
 The author of "Camp Notes and Other Poems" and "Desert Run: Poems and Stories" 
(both published by Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press), Yamada is a board 
member of Amnesty International, U.S.A., and the founder of Multicultural Women 
Writers of Orange County. She was a professor of English at Cypress College for 
19 years and has taught at San Diego State and UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 When Yamada became a board member on the California Council for the Humanities 
-- the state affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities -- she 
said, "it felt right to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Community programs sponsored by the Council, which receives no state funds, 
include "Humanities a la Carte" (lunchtime talks about the arts and humanities 
held at Los Angeles-area businesses), "Scholars in the Schools" (one educator 
held dialogues with students while impersonating Thomas Jefferson) and 
Motheread, an inner-city project that teaches mothers how to read to their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Other programs funded by the Council's relatively meager budget ($400,000 this 
year) include exhibitions (with historical or sociological -- rather than 
purely artistic -- themes), films, radio programs, lecture series and 
conferences. No grants are awarded to individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Yamada encouraged Women For: to apply for a $750 planning grant for a 
community program of its own. Program grants range from $5,000 to $25,000, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant proposals are accepted from nonprofit organizations on April 1 and Oct. 
1 of each year; interested organizations may request further information from 
the California Council on the Humanities, 312 Sutter St., Suite 601, San 
Francisco, CA 94108. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to such arts-supporting politicians as Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
(D-Calif.), Yamada reminded her audience that "our friends have to choose their 
battles (in the post-election climate). The arts and humanities may be on the 
bottom of the heap." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to compare the funding situation in the United States with that of other 
countries, Yamada said, "we're pretty much at the bottom of the heap. In Japan, 
their living treasures are people . It's a wonderful concept. They fund for 
life a person with talent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spend a lot of money on art that we lift from other cultures, which should 
be back in the country where it belongs. We put a lot of money into paintings 
(sold at upscale galleries). 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's not the art we (at the Council) are talking about. You could come 
off the street and come up with some idea you think is worth funding and would 
benefit our community."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; HUEY LEWIS & THE NEWS: THE SAME OLD STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Memo to Huey Lewis: In the news business, late delivery is a sure way to lose 
subscribers. It wasn't until the last quarter of a nearly two-hour show 
Thursday at the Coach House that Lewis and band offered any news worth hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, Huey Lewis & the News already has lost much of the fan base that, in 
one of the most unlikely developments in pop history, turned this unremarkable 
Bay Area bar band into an '80s arena attraction able to score three consecutive 
platinum albums from 1983 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 By rights, an utterly mediocre performance like the one Lewis and company gave 
during most of their show should weaken whatever following remains. 
</P>
<P>
 At $45 a ticket, Lewis' sold-out stand at the Coach House, which also included 
two scheduled performances Friday night, was the most expensive attraction the 
Coach House has presented in nine years as a concert club, not counting special 
New Year's Eve packages. 
</P>
<P>
 That means at least 1,500 fans in Orange County still highly value Lewis & the 
News despite the band's decline in popularity over the past five years. The 
fans' adoring response suggested that these were hard-core Huey lovers who 
probably wouldn't abandon their nice-guy hero unless he began acting like the 
vampire Lestat. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Lewis' singing voice, never anything special, sounded as if it had 
been sucked dry of whatever juice it once had. In a show that alternated 
between his R & B-flavored pop hits and the straight-on soul and jump-blues 
featured on his most recent album, the all-oldies covers collection, "Four 
Chords & Several Years Ago," Lewis was hopelessly overmatched by the 
tradition's vocal demands. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His husky voice couldn't reach a high note, much less sustain one. The 
decorations, intensifiers and free flights that allow expert soul singers to 
stir up the emotions or simply convey a sense of musical zest were beyond his 
grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 All that remained were the feeble cries he substituted for high notes and 
grunted "unhs" that evidently were supposed to mean he was really putting his 
muscles into it. 
</P>
<P>
 Expressiveness is possible without a great voice if a singer can somehow make 
the feelings and characters in a song believable. But Lewis sells a lyric the 
way Orange County is going to sell what's left of its investment portfolio: at 
a deep, deep discount. 
</P>
<P>
 "She Shot a Hole in My Soul," a brassy soul oldie drawn from Lewis' current 
album, could have been a mini-drama with moments wry, plaintive and caustic. 
Instead, it came across with the pastel amiableness that is the only shade of 
feeling Lewis offers. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, one figured, an experienced instrumental outfit like the News would 
be able to keep the music sharp and the energy pumping (four of the five core 
members have been with Lewis since the band began in 1979). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, for more than an hour, they failed to muster the energy and 
enthusiasm that you'd demand from a professional bar band whose members play 
for $45 a night, let alone one that commands $45 a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally we don't play smaller venues, but I think it's the best place to see 
somebody play," Lewis noted at one point. He and his band didn't exactly seize 
the opportunity to blow out the joint and prove that they've still got 
arena-scale heat in them. 
</P>
<P>
 No soloist stepped forward to ignite the show; guitarist Chris Hayes, the 
player who had the most opportunities, was strictly routine. His hurried, 
thin-toned blues soloing at the end of "She Don't Know" was a particularly 
ill-conceived and inexpressive capper to a sweet-soul number that called for 
something much sweeter and far more soulful. 
</P>
<P>
 After a while, it became apparent that background singers Conesha Owens and 
Sandy Griffith were the most potent musical force in Lewis' 11-member ensemble, 
which included, besides the five News men, a spare keyboards player and a 
sometimes-punchy three-man horn section. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until the last song before encores, the R & B oldie "Better to Have 
and Not Need," that the female vocal duo's bright voices and lively stage 
presence finally were featured. Sure enough, it was the first song of the 
evening on which the band played with some ensemble spark. 
</P>
<P>
 That belatedly discovered spirit carried over into most of the encore. On an 
urgent and boisterous reading of the Sam & Dave nugget "I Thank You," Owens and 
Griffith took over and made the most of the spotlight, pushing Lewis into the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the surging blues shuffle "Bad Is Bad," the band seemed to take 
inspiration from a cool, jazz-tinged tenor-sax solo by Ron Stallings that 
created one of the concert's few unpredictable moments of playful possibility. 
And on the rocking closer, "Workin' for a Livin,' " the entire band, Lewis 
included, finally began to sound as free and vibrant as it should have all 
along. 
</P>
<P>
 At $45 a pop -- a pretty healthy livin' to be workin' for -- Lewis & the News 
should not have been an hour-and-a-half late in delivering. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, fans interested in hearing a young blues, soul and R & B band that 
has hunger, fire, and a front man worthy of his classic-soul influences can 
check out Barrelhouse, playing tonight and each Sunday in January at the 
Heritage Brewing Co. in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing for a $5 door charge, Barrelhouse is virtually certain to put out more 
passion and excitement than Lewis & the News did at a record-setting price.

FANS FACE SOME DISCONCERTING SECURITY; MUSIC MEN ON PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Proving Music Knows No Borders" (Nov. 24), Esa-Pekka Salonen, touring with 
the Los Angeles Philharmonic in Mexico, is quoted saying that Proposition 187 
is "based on a lack of knowledge and a lack of rational thought." He also 
connects the ebb of interest in classical music to Prop. 187.Ernest Fleischmann 
echoes this by saying, "Let's not despair; Prop. 187 is a temporary thing." He 
also coins the phrase political politicians as the alleged movers of Prop. 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Salonen and Fleischmann are protected under free speech. The situation changes 
when -- as quasi cultural ambassadors -- statements are made that demean the 
majority of California voters, including Philharmonic supporters, who allegedly 
lack knowledge and rational thought. In this context these statements were 
ill-advised.

EUROPEAN CREWS ENTICED BY ARIZONA'S 'OLD WEST'; ENTERTAINMENT: GERMAN, ITALIAN 
AND EVEN JAPANESE COMMERCIAL AND WESTERN MAKERS FLOCK TO THE STATE TO CAPTURE 
THE LEGENDARY UNTAMED ATMOSPHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ARTHUR H. ROTSTEIN, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The setting is a vintage Hollywood Western: a rugged cowboy in a 
cobweb-covered saloon. 
</P>
<P>
 But a closer examination reveals some differences. The actors are German, 
doing a commercial for a cocktail mix. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just movie and television Westerns that are being filmed these days 
at Arizona's Old West towns. German, Italian and even Japanese models, actors 
and film crews are flocking to the state to make commercials and do still photo 
shoots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Europeans just love the Western -- they love the Western look," said Sue 
Birmingham, who with her husband, Ed, owns Apacheland Movie Ranch. The 85-acre 
location has its own stage town and is located east of Apache Junction at the 
base of the Superstition Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 American companies are also taking advantage of the foreign fascination with 
the Wild West. A Marlboro cigarette ad uses Arizona as a backdrop for 
commercials geared to Spain and Hong Kong, while Kellogg's cereal used the 
state for a European commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 First built in 1939 for the William Holden-Jean Arthur movie "Arizona," Old 
Tucson, which has also been a theme park since 1959, has been used for more 
than 200 feature films. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing increased traffic from European firms," said Jay Cole, film 
production manager at Old Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason they come here is they like the Old West look," said Cole, who 
suspects that the current country-Western music craze in England has probably 
heightened that popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been 37 film and photo projects at Old Tucson so far this year, 
including four feature movies and an industrial film for a European 
petrochemical conglomerate, he said. Eight of the projects were commercial 
photography shoots for German and Austrian fashion and shoe catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Tucson, 12 miles west of Tucson, totaled only 28 projects in 1993 -- four 
of them major movie or TV projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a general fascination with the West," said Linda Peterson Warren, 
Arizona Film Commission chairman. "Europeans seem to have the notion that it is 
still untamed, rugged and with the terrain that they can't even come close to 
in their countries. And we're capitalizing on it." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Arizona realized about $79 million in direct moneys from all 
filmmaking ventures -- movies, television and commercials, Old West and 
contemporary, Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 State officials have difficulty estimating the full impact of the increase in 
revenue from commercials because producers and film crews frequently deal 
directly with regional film offices. Prescott, Yuma, Lake Powell, Page, Cochise 
County and the Navajo Nation are among locations with offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often we don't know they're even here," Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Bradshaw is replacing a Western set burned down about eight years ago on 
his 90-acre ranch in Sedona's breathtaking Red Rock country. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradshaw was involved in Arizona's movie and site-location business for a 
quarter of a century before the advent of the state film office. He said TV 
commercial work such as a recent Spanish Marlboro ad made on his ranch keeps 
his operation busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always having these models shoot out here -- mostly clothing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision by 20th Century Fox to open a major animated film production 
facility in Phoenix will be a big boost to the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a permanent part of our production landscape now," Warren said. "It 
sends a very strong message to Los Angeles that Arizona is a production 
center."

KEATON HAS NO REGRETS ABOUT DROPPING BATMAN ROLE; ENTERTAINMENT: THE ACTOR 
TAKES STOCK OF HIS CAREER. 'THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS I WANTED TO DO, ON 
STAGE AND OFF STAGE,' HE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL WILLISTEIN, THE ALLENTOWN MORNING CALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Batman no more. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the word from Michael Keaton. And for good reason, according to the man 
who played the Caped Crusader in "Batman" and "Batman Returns." 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked away from it ('Batman') because I had done two of them and, based on 
the script that I had read, I didn't see anything that was making me jump up 
and down. I didn't feel that it was going to be all that rewarding," Keaton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of other things I wanted to do, on stage and off stage. . . . 
While it wasn't the easiest decision in the world (not to do a third 'Batman'), 
once it was made it was real easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Val Kilmer will play Batman in the third big-screen installment. 
</P>
<P>
 In Keaton's latest movie, "Speechless," he and Geena Davis star as speech 
writers who are political rivals and fall in love along the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the idea of doing a romantic comedy 'cause I'd never done one, and I 
liked the idea of working with Geena Davis," Keaton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keaton, 44, was philosophical about his career: 
</P>
<P>
 "You reach the point where you say, 'How much time do I have left on the 
planet?' And while I have a lot of time left on the planet, the next question 
is 'How much time do I have left to do the things I really want to do and enjoy 
them and how does that fit in with my life right now this year?' " 
</P>
<P>
 After portraying a dying father in "My Life," Keaton said he was ready for the 
lighter fare of "Speechless." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been hearing people say, 'Do you do comedy anymore?' I think that's the 
good news and bad news." "My Life," a moving drama considered a box-office 
failure, received many positive reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's probably the best hero I've played. Actually, that movie did pretty 
well 'cause it made some money and it didn't cost any money. . . . It was 
really, really hard to do the role." 
</P>
<P>
 The next role for Keaton is "Multiplicity," a movie directed by Harold Ramis 
in which he plays a man who is cloned into four different people. 
</P>
<P>
 Keaton said he's not much interested in starring in movies that depict graphic 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mostly what bothers me is the desensitization of it. . . . The news does that 
as much as movies," Keaton said, noting that a script's violent content could 
influence him to not make it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need to put that out there. Now this is tricky stuff. . . . I love 
action movies. I'll tell you what . . . I loved 'Speed,' but I don't like 
certain moments in 'Speed.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Keaton said he monitors what his son watches in movie theaters and on 
television. "My son will get up and click the TV off when he knows there's 
something on he can't see," said Keaton, adding that he feels it's a parent's 
responsibility to determine what their children see. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the desensitization of politics, as portrayed by the spin doctor 
Keaton portrays in "Speechless"? 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't such a light movie -- and it is nice light entertainment -- 
that's all this movie is. If it was a political movie, I would've loved to play 
it more cynical, even more spin doctor," Keaton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope people are gettin' cynical and not apathetic. I'm convinced that the 
most effective work gets done on the local levels and grass-roots level."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; NOTEBOOK; BUILDING UP WIEDER IS TOO MUCH FOR SOME 
ROSSMOOR RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's in a name: Orange County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder is expected to 
take a break from all that depressing talk about bankruptcy today to attend a 
modest ceremony in Rossmoor. A new building is being dedicated as the Harriett 
M. Wieder Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder, who is retiring after 16 years in office, had pushed for two grants to 
develop the facility for the Community Services District, which arranges for 
trash pickup and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 The honor, however, isn't sitting well with some Rossmoor residents fuming 
about the county's financial collapse. Said 62-year-old stockbroker Paul 
Knight: "Can you believe it? This Board of Supervisors should be hung up to dry 
by their thumbs." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials defended their decision to honor Wieder at the 3:30 p.m. 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be a nice protocol-type thing," said Bill Sheldon, general manager of 
the Rossmoor Community Services District. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may have been some problems here at the end, but that doesn't change 
the fact that she showed particular concern for the district." 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside relief: This week, 1,000 Orange County businesses received packets 
of Alka-Seltzer to ease stomach pains caused by Orange County's financial 
collapse. Gifts from the Riverside County Economic Development Agency, the 
mailings carried this message: "Riverside County is just what the doctor 
ordered." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency also purchased more than a dozen radio spots, which will run 
through January, that urge Orange County businesses to relocate to Riverside 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 No word on whether the Riverside effort includes wooing Orange County 
government officials too. 
</P>
<P>
 $2 billion? How many quarters is that? On Friday, Orange County officials 
revoked free parking privileges for the media at the parking lot at the Hall of 
Administration, the heart of county government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Effective immediately, validated parking for media representatives is to be 
discontinued," said Auditor-Controller Frederick A. Branca in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials couldn't say how much the move will save the financially battered 
county, which charges the public 75 cents for each 30 minutes of parking. 
</P>
<P>
 Law on-line: Orange County's financial woes are the topic of discussion on 
Lexis Counsel Connect, the largest on-line service exclusively for lawyers. A 
panel of experts began to talk electronically this week about the long-term 
effects of the bankruptcy. An estimated 17,000 attorneys, law professors and 
judges will have access to the dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unclear who will get billed for the hours on-line.  
</P>
<P>
 Happy landings: After several air carriers and the Federal Aviation 
Administration expressed concerns that airport funds might be used to bail out 
the county, the Board of Supervisors has agreed to keep John Wayne Airport 
revenue separate from other county money and spend it only on the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Instant karma: Is it a coincidence or the wrath of God? Some foes of 
Proposition 187 say the latter. Consider there are 187 cities, districts and 
other agencies who joined the county's ill-fated investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 All this in the financially troubled county that gave birth to the recently 
approved state initiative that denies education, welfare and non-emergency 
medical care to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Said anti-Proposition 187 activist Carolyn Henry from Anaheim: "This 
bankruptcy is the mark of Cain on Orange County. It's like we fought God and He 
won!" 
</P>
<P>
 Credit where credit is due: Broadway Stores Inc. has offered to let all Orange 
County government workers, along with those in the county's cities and school 
districts, defer their Broadway charge-card payments for 90 days on purchases 
through Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it was taking this action because of recent news reports 
raising questions about whether some local government employees will receive 
paychecks after Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "These workers are our friends, neighbors and relatives, and if through this 
action the Broadway can help make this a better Christmas for these 
hard-working employees, I can think of no better gift we can give," said 
Broadway Stores President and Chief Executive Officer David L. Dworkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Equal credit: Some of Orange County's 67 credit unions are promising to help 
any of their 700,000 members who might find themselves without a job or without 
pay during the county's fiscal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 A few, for instance, are offering to defer interest on loans for those laid 
off, said Henry Kertman, a spokesman for the California Credit Union League. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are expected to provide plans similar to one announced earlier this 
week by the Orange County Teachers Federal Credit Union, which is offering 
members emergency payroll loans if their paychecks are delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Wishful thinking: Merrill Lynch officials in Santa Ana politely asked about 40 
placard-carrying, slogan-chanting protesters from Teamsters Union Local 952 to 
kindly clear out of their office this week. And the Teamsters, who were there 
to accuse the investment firm of driving the county to financial ruin, politely 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
 So Merrill Lynch officials said they were calling the police. About 30 minutes 
later the police still hadn't arrived, prompting one teamster to say: "The cops 
aren't coming. They've been laid off." 
</P>
<P>
 Not true. Officers finally came and promptly dispersed the protesters.

U.S. PLEDGES TO CLOSE ANY GAP IN QUAKE RECOVERY FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal disaster officials said Friday that they will provide earthquake 
relief funds for all eligible roads, schools, hospitals and other government 
structures damaged in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake even if they must ask 
Congress for more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Emergency Management Agency officials were reacting to state and Los 
Angeles County reports that estimates of damage to public facilities have 
doubled to about $6 billion.The $2.8 billion allocated for such repairs has not 
yet been exhausted, FEMA said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional Director Shirley Mattingly, in a letter to the county, denied that a 
"purported shortfall" of federal funds was hampering quake recovery efforts. 
Projects are funded based on their eligibility, not funds allocated and 
available at a given time, she said. Nearly $12 billion in earthquake relief 
has been allocated thus far.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; O.C. SCHOOLS' FISCAL WOES MAGNIFY THEIR 
DIFFERENCES; EDUCATION: ONE SUSPENDS A FIELD TRIP. FOR POORER DISTRICTS LIKE 
SANTA ANA'S, IT MEANS ENDING COMPUTER LABS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.R. MOEHRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 For children at one school, Orange County's fiscal crisis means a fun science 
field trip may be called off. 
</P>
<P>
 For children at another school, the crisis means cutting computer labs and 
after-school classes for which there were long waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
 While every school in the county perceives the budget disaster as a sinister 
threat, different items are being threatened in each of the districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're circling our wagons," said Barbara Smith, assistant superintendent in 
the Capistrano Unified School District, voicing a contentiousness common among 
county educators. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as besieged districts cling to a sense of "us" against "them," the 
crisis sometimes sharpens their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a function of where you had your extra resources," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Capistrano Unified's Castille Elementary School in Mission Viejo, for 
instance, extra resources were designated for a $20,000 science field trip 
filled with hands-on experiments and moonlight hikes. The trip now dangles by a 
thread because the funds for it were tied up in the county's depleted 
investment portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Unified officials won't call the trip dead -- not after parents 
staged countless carwashes and bake sales to raise the money. 
</P>
<P>
 But, by contrast, Santa Ana Unified School District officials say they'd love 
to have a $20,000 field trip to cancel. 
</P>
<P>
 The field trip they were forced to cancel for many of their schools this week 
was a visit to nearby Rancho Santiago College, where fifth-graders and their 
parents were to be given a short, no-frills tour of one post-high school 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Unified officials said Friday that developments in their district 
are more dramatic than canceled field trips. They conceded for the first time 
that their schools are slashing after-school classes and extra tutoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids were real excited about (the Spanish classes)," said an angry Kathi 
Jo Brunning, head of Santa Ana's Parent-Teacher Assn. "Some of their friends 
are either bilingual or speak more Spanish than they do English, so this was an 
opportunity for them to communicate better." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaylen Freeman, Santa Ana Unified's assistant superintendent for business, 
said such opportunities are relics of a freer era. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have frozen everything at this point, other than basic, essential programs 
and expenditures," he said. "All purchase orders come to my desk. And if they 
weren't emergencies, they weren't going anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman said his district has been massaging its budget for the last three 
years, because of hard economic times. So he and other Santa Ana officials, 
unfortunately, know how to respond to a financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a basic district," he said. "We have basic programs. We've had 
significant reductions over the last three years. We're not in a position where 
we can say we're cutting any frills." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Santa Ana's largest elementary school, Martin Elementary, has 
canceled "intercession" -- lessons offered during long recesses. The extra 
teaching is now deemed a luxury, said Roxanna Samaniego Owings, Martin's 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been temporarily suspended," Owings said. "I don't like the word 
canceled." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a defiant attitude not only helps districts cope, it often blurs the 
differences among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a family in crisis," Smith said. "It's like when Hurricane Andrew 
hit, but you can't see the damage. The reason you can't see the damage is, 
we're seeing in our school district -- this may sound very Pollyanna, but it's 
very true -- we're seeing people pull together and saying, 'We're not going to 
let it defeat us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Smith still holds out hope, for example, that Castille's science field trip 
can be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county and state need to make us whole," she said. "The county had no 
right to take that money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some Capistrano Unified officials and parents say the science trip is 
irrelevant and misleading. They insist that their predicament is no less gritty 
than Santa Ana's, and may even be worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were a (Capistrano) principal doing second-semester ordering," Smith 
said, "where you might be ordering extra art supplies, some new playground 
balls, a new net for your volleyball, instead you're going to order paper, 
pencil, chalk. And you're going to keep your Xerox toner, but you're going to 
try not to make copies of some particular lesson and give one to every student. 
Now you're going to put it on the board and have them copy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Unified Supt. James A. Fleming said his district receives less 
state money than Santa Ana does, so it has less to cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no librarians, no nurses, no guidance counselors," he said. "There's 
a lot of stuff we can't cut because we don't have it." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the budget crisis has played itself out, Fleming predicted, 
Capistrano Unified will be forced to make adjustments just like those Santa Ana 
made this week, and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, parents and school officials said, children will suffer because of 
financial dealings they don't understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said: "Eventually our country has to decide that when a disaster like 
this befalls an institution which is trying to serve its future -- kids -- that 
they need to at least put us on the same range as Chrysler and the S&L's." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, she added, "What you see on CNN is a picture of John Wayne's house on 
Balboa Island, like that's how we all live, and isn't it funny that all these 
people are out of money?"

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; BROKER HANDLED 3 OTHER FAILED BOND DEALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The broker who persuaded Orange County schools and cities to borrow millions 
to funnel into risky investments also played a key role in at least three other 
bond deals in California that collapsed, one of which is being investigated by 
the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment banker Kenneth D. Ough, 42, has handled hundreds of routine deals 
for schools and cities up and down the state that have met with success. But 
public records and interviews show that on occasion, Ough has exhibited a knack 
for finding new financial approaches and testing the untried. And while he and 
the firms he has worked for have earned six-figure fees, he has encouraged some 
schools and municipalities to assume high risks. For example: 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1990, Ough negotiated a $30-million bond issued by five public entities 
in the San Joaquin Valley. Two years later, two of the five failed to meet the 
financial terms of the deal, prompting an SEC investigation into whether 
investors received adequate disclosure of potential risk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Four years before that, Lassen Community College District became the first 
community college district in the nation to declare bankruptcy after it was 
unable to meet the obligations of a $7.1-million bond deal handled by Ough. The 
value of the bond exceeded that of the one-school district's annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
 * The city of Arvin faces a declaration of bankruptcy and unincorporation 
after the city's finances crumbled in part because of the weight of an 
$8-million bond put together by Ough. Proceeds from the bond were to have gone 
toward the construction of a golf course, but the low-income farm town has been 
unable to attract enough golfers to pay day-to-day expenses of the course, let 
alone the debt service on the bond. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is, I asked Kenneth Ough repeatedly if any of the things that 
eventually happened could happen, and I got repeated assurances that they 
couldn't," said one source involved in the San Joaquin Valley transaction who 
requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the Orange County school districts and cities that Ough directed into 
the investment pool have accused him of committing any wrongdoing. In addition, 
Ough has a clean record with the SEC and the National Assn. of Securities 
Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Many officials from agencies Ough has worked with, including several in Orange 
County, speak highly of his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were with Ken for 10 years, since his days at Merrill Lynch," said Terry 
Bradley, an administrator with Clovis schools near Fresno. "He did a good job 
for us. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We told Ken what we wanted him to do. It was never Ken telling us what he 
wanted us to do." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior vice president at his current firm, Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, Ough did 
not return numerous telephone messages seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ken has been an investment banker in Southern California for the past 17 
years," said Rauscher Pierce Executive Vice President Leslie Lynch. "He has a 
very, very large client following. . . . Ken's history speaks for itself." Firm 
Subpoenaed 
</P>
<P>
 Rauscher Pierce is one of two Wall Street investment houses that have been 
served with subpoenas by the SEC in the wake of the stunning drainage of Orange 
County's $7.5-billion investment pool. Lynch said he has been told that the 
firm is not the target of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 While working for three investment firms over 15 years, Ough has maintained a 
long business rapport with recently resigned Orange County Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, 133 of the 420 new issues by Orange County agencies in Citron's 
investment pool have been handled, at least in part, by brokerages at which 
Ough was working at the time, according to Securities Data Co., a New 
Jersey-based firm that compiles information on municipal bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ken was sort of a young up-and-coming guy, and I think Citron liked him. They 
had similar personalities. They hit it off," said one investment banker who has 
known Ough for years and spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years, fondness has translated into hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in fees for Ough and his firms, and billions of dollars for Citron to 
use as collateral to carry out his sometimes exotic investments known as 
reverse repurchase agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how much money Ough has made in any of his broker arrangements. 
A Los Angeles native, he and his wife, Marilyn, live in a four-bedroom, 
three-bathroom house valued at $600,000 in Canyon Country near Santa Clarita. 
He majored in political science at Cal State Northridge and received a master's 
degree in public policy and administration from Cal State Long Beach in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 He is described by colleagues as industrious to a fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never knew Ken Ough to be anything but a hard-working professional," said 
former co-worker Chriss Street of Newport Beach. "He was a head-down, 
14-hours-a-day guy." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Ough has emerged from the shards of the shattered Orange 
County investment scheme as the architect of the high-risk deals through which 
two cities and four school districts have borrowed roughly $750 million over 
the past two years and invested it, hoping to reap better-than-average returns. 
</P>
<P>
 No one seems to track such milestones. But Ough is believed to have been among 
the first to get schools and cities to issue the so-called taxable notes -- a 
financial instrument that allows municipalities and agencies to issue more debt 
than they are allowed under regulations involving tax-exempt notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rauscher Pierce's Lynch defended the deals: "They were issued strictly in 
accordance with the state law, opined on by bond counsels, approved by the 
superintendent of schools for the county, and the proceeds of the issue were 
administered by the county treasurer, as provided by law." Reputation as 
Standout 
</P>
<P>
 In a room full of blue suits pitching their financial wares, Ough is said to 
have stood out from the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 As he made his presentations to school and city officials throughout the state 
-- a Wall Street Johnny Appleseed of sorts -- Ough had an ability to make 
complicated financial transactions sound simple. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the premise he pushed was this: To make money in these tough times, 
you have to borrow money. And no place will pay more interest on your borrowed 
money than Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was just extremely confident in what he was doing and what he was 
selling," said Ronald Moore, superintendent of Chowchilla Unified School 
District, which invested $2.5 million in Orange County's pool. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview in 1993, Ough credited Citron's business acumen and said 
borrowing to invest for public entities probably would not be advisable 
anywhere else: "It's very limited. . . . It would not work in another county." 
</P>
<P>
 During the same interview, Ough said his unique investment plan simply 
afforded an opportunity for cash-short public agencies to make money. "There's 
little or no risk," Ough said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time he had offered such assurances, some of his clients 
said, nor was it the only time he had been wrong. College Bankruptcy 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Ough developed the underwriting of a deal that led to the first 
Chapter 9 filing ever by a community college.  
</P>
<P>
 While working for Merrill Lynch, Ough helped tiny Lassen College, 250 miles 
northeast of San Francisco, borrow $7.1 million -- more than the school's 
$5.5-million annual budget at the time -- to build a garbage-burning, 
heat-generating plant on its Susanville campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Several banks rejected the project, but college President Warren Sorenson said 
in an interview this week that Ough was eager to help. 
</P>
<P>
 With Ough's help, the college issued $7.15 million worth of certificates of 
participation in November, 1982. Despite a BBB- rating from Standard & Poor's, 
the $5,000 notes sold out in five days. 
</P>
<P>
 By March, 1986 -- two years after the plant had opened -- Lassen College was 
being sued by First Interstate Bank for not making its loan payments. Profits 
from the plant were intended to pay off the loan, so when the plant suffered 
technical problems, the school faced closure if it did not seek bankruptcy 
protection, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would Merrill Lynch do it? I don't know," said Stephen Pezullo, an 
accountant who was elected to the college board in 1985 and now serves as its 
president. "The only ones that won on (the deal) were the attorneys and the 
brokers that sold the bonds." 
</P>
<P>
 Ough is among the defendants in First Interstate's lawsuit against the 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch spokesman Timothy Gilles said the brokerage was not to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem was with the design, construction and operation of the plant 
itself," Gilles said. "Merrill Lynch just did the financing, and the financing 
was not the problem." Small Town's Default 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after taking a new post with Seidler-Fitzgerald Public Finance in 
March, 1986, Ough financed a bond issue to help Arvin -- a farm town of 10,000 
people 15 miles from Bakersfield -- build a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 With an annual operating budget of $1.4 million, Arvin borrowed $7.89 million 
to issue certificates of participation in 1988, with Ough and 
Seidler-Fitzgerald acting as the underwriter. The city set aside $3.5 million 
in proceeds to pay off its loan and used the rest to build the 18-hole course, 
complete with pro shop, bar and grill and a 230-seat banquet room. 
</P>
<P>
 For its role, Seidler-Fitzgerald received about $800,000 in fees, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the official statement that accompanies such transactions, the deal was 
described as having "a high degree of investment risk," and investors were 
warned that the developer had never built a golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years, the $3.5-million reserve had been used up and the city had 
yet to earn a nickel in profits from the golf course. Shallow city coffers were 
empty, so Arvin defaulted in September, 1993, and the trustee of the notes took 
the matter to court. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Sherwood, an attorney representing Seidler-Fitzgerald, said he didn't 
know enough details of the transaction and declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 While the issue has yet to be resolved, City Manager Thomas Payne said 
bankruptcy is all but inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city was not financially stable and they bought into this proposal, which 
was supposed to put millions of dollars into the general fund each year," said 
Payne, who took over as city manager in 1992. "Instead, it has drained us to 
the point where we're not sure we'll remain an incorporated city. It's given us 
a tremendous black eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Payne, who was hired to steer the city through its financial troubles, said in 
hindsight the whole idea seems ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 "My God, Arvin with a golf course? That's like Arvin with a Disneyland!" SEC 
Investigation 
</P>
<P>
 While still at Seidler-Fitzgerald, Ough in 1990 was at the center of a 
so-called Marks-Roos bond project in Fresno County that has drawn SEC scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the complicated deal, five public entities -- the 
Chowchilla Memorial Hospital District, the city of Mendota, Sierra Kings 
Hospital District, the city of Orange Cove and the city of San Joaquin -- 
formed the Central San Joaquin Financing Authority and issued nearly $30 
million of unrated revenue bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The proceeds were to have been used to underwrite other bonds or pay off other 
obligations of the five agencies in the authority. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1992, one of the five, Chowchilla Memorial Hospital District, defaulted 
on nearly $5 million of revenue bonds issued by the authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The same year, another authority member, Mendota, defaulted on a $2-million 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
 While the SEC investigates the structure of the arrangement and whether 
investors received full disclosure, the authority is in disarray and some of 
the three partners that have met their fiscal obligations under the arrangement 
are concerned about potential exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherwood, from Seidler-Fitzgerald, said the SEC investigation is not focusing 
on the firm or on Ough, and that neither has done anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Kenneth Ough had told me there was a one-in-a-million chance this could 
happen," said one source in the deal who didn't want to be identified, "I 
wouldn't have done it." Officials Cite Trust 
</P>
<P>
 Similar sentiments were expressed by officials whose agencies Ough brought 
into the Orange County investment pool from outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never informed us of any risk," said Sally Frazier, superintendent of 
Madera County schools, which has $3 million in Orange County's pool. "He 
portrayed it as a safe treasury." 
</P>
<P>
 When Ough first pitched the aggressive, borrow-to-invest scheme to Orange 
County schools and cities in early 1993, some officials said they opted to try 
it, in part, because they knew Ough and trusted him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ken brought that idea to the city. . . . To the best of my knowledge, it was 
a unique transaction," said George Ferrone, Anaheim's finance director, who has 
worked with Ough for a decade. "This was an opportunity that he brought to us 
that made sense at the time, and until two weeks ago seemed like a real 
winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrone noted that the city earned $7.4 million in interest from the taxable 
note deals in 1993. Anaheim has $169 million in the now-frozen pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Although everyone from municipal bond experts to state Controller Gray Davis 
have inveighed against the borrow-to-invest scheme since the collapse of the 
pool, only a few raised red flags beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
 One was former co-worker Street, who recalled that he was stunned in 1993 to 
learn that Ough had masterminded the borrowing of $200 million by four Orange 
County school districts solely to pump into the pool. Street said: "I called 
him up and said, 'What the (expletive) are you doing?' "

 TREE THREAT: A nasty fungus is killing many of the Valley's Christmas trees. 
Named the "Grinch" by tree growers, the disease has eliminated as much as 40% 
of the Monterey pines on some tree farms this year. . . . It breaks down the 
tree's cell structure, cuts off its nutrients and causes it to drown in its own 
sap.Many Valley growers have had to raise prices and import fir trees from the

ITO DELAYS RULING ON DISCLOSING SIMPSON-GRIER JAILHOUSE TALK; COURTS: THE 
DEFENSE ARGUES THAT THE CONVERSATION WAS PRIVILEGED, BUT PROSECUTORS MAINTAIN 
THE MINISTER WAS ACTING MORE AS A COUNSELOR THAN A CLERGYMAN. 
</P>

<P>
 After a heated courtroom debate -- enlivened when one of O.J. Simpson's 
lawyers accused Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito of mishandling Simpson's 
security arrangements in jail -- Ito delayed a ruling until Monday on whether 
prosecutors may learn the contents of a jailhouse conversation between Simpson 
and the Rev. Rosey Grier. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay leaves alive for at least a few more days a debate that has tugged 
at the margins of the case for nearly a month, as prosecutors have sought to 
learn what Simpson told Grier, an ordained minister, during an emotional 
jailhouse visit in November. In their final arguments on the subject Friday, 
prosecutors said Grier was acting more as a counselor than a minister and also 
maintained that by raising his voice, Simpson waived whatever confidentiality 
might apply to the remarks, even if made to a clergyman. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Jeff Stuart said he overheard a snippet of that conversation and 
informed his superiors of it, but Simpson's attorneys have fought to keep 
prosecutors from learning what was said, arguing that the conversation was 
protected by the privilege that protects ministers from having to disclose 
their private talks. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Simpson's attorneys have said that even if the deputy did hear a 
short comment or two, the remarks had to have been taken out of context because 
Stuart testified that he could not hear what came just before or after the 
comments by Simpson and the brief response from Grier. Simpson is accused of 
killing his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman 
on June 12; he has pleaded not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 In court, defense attorney Gerald F. Uelmen offered a hypothetical example of 
how a seemingly incriminating comment could be misunderstood out of context. 
"We can imagine a situation where Mr. Simpson would say, 'I am so depressed. I 
can't imagine a situation where people I know would go on television and say I 
did it; I killed two people,' " Uelmen said. If the deputy only heard the words 
"I did it; I killed two people," that would not accurately depict the 
conversation, Uelmen said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Uelmen was backed up Friday by defense lawyer Robert L. Shapiro, who 
complained that the confidentiality issue is complicated by the fact that the 
visitation area where Simpson and his attorneys meet on weekends is inadequate. 
According to Shapiro, deputies can look over the lawyers' shoulders at their 
papers and can hear conversations between the attorneys and their client even 
when no voices are raised. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were guaranteed that we would have privacy," Shapiro said. "We did not." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro went on to accuse Ito, who supervised the jailhouse arrangements, of 
bungling that job and of disingenuously suggesting in court that they were 
adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 That prompted a rare flash of anger from the judge, who at first cautioned 
Shapiro to watch his step. When Shapiro ignored him, Ito sharply advised him to 
"take a deep breath" and reconsider his line of argument. Then Ito recessed 
court for a long lunch break. 
</P>
<P>
 When court resumed, a chastened Shapiro apologized for his comments, saying he 
had been overcome by his zealousness in advocating his client's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Ito is a professional," Shapiro said later, outside court. "He knows I 
respect him. He respects me. It was something that was said in the heat of 
advocacy." 
</P>
<P>
 In court, Ito accepted that apology but still did not rule on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will hopefully issue the court's ruling on this Monday morning," Ito said. 
"Sorry to the people who expected to be out of town." 
</P>
<P>
 The jailhouse exclamation has lingered as an intriguing sideshow to the trial 
since late November, when Ito and the attorneys mysteriously toured the Men's 
Central Jail, inspecting the area where Simpson meets with his attorneys and 
others on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 But with that issue apparently near resolution, the judge and lawyers turned 
late Friday to a topic at the case's core, the DNA test results that the 
prosecution believes will link Simpson to the murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers, who originally had indicated that they were prepared to 
wage a major pretrial battle to contest the prosecution's DNA tests, this week 
shifted gears, saying instead that they preferred to hold that debate in front 
of the jury. On Friday, Uelmen argued that their proposed approach would save 
both sides time and would keep Simpson from having to pay for a hearing that 
could last two months or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearings over the admissibility of scientific evidence typically take place 
outside the presence of the jury because their purpose is to allow the judge to 
decide what evidence jurors should hear. Prosecutors opposed the defense 
motion, saying Friday that the unorthodox proposal would present jurors with 
mountains of evidence, much of which would be highly technical and could 
distract the panel from the other issues in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 George W. Clarke, a deputy district attorney from San Diego who is assisting 
the prosecution team on DNA issues, said the defense proposal could extend the 
period for which jurors need to be sequestered and would create a "substantial 
and dangerous possibility of forgetting evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito met privately with the lawyers in an effort to reach a compromise 
on the DNA issue, they emerged without an agreement. As a result, Ito said he 
would consider the various suggestions and issue a ruling by the end of the day 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 No court hearings are scheduled until Jan. 4, when the two sides will return 
with a host of issues to confront. In addition to the DNA evidence, defense 
attorneys are battling to keep out references to what they call "marital 
discord" between Simpson and his ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say that evidence is relevant and prepared an 85-page legal 
pleading that urges Ito to allow jurors to hear it. Although that motion was 
filed under seal, sources who have read it say it lays out in detailed and 
highly charged language the couple's volatile history. 
</P>
<P>
 According to those sources, the allegations extend beyond three incidents that 
have been most widely reported: a 1985 fracas in which Simpson was found by 
police wielding a baseball bat after having shattered the window of his wife's 
car; a 1989 fight that ended with Simpson pleading no contest to charges of 
spousal abuse, and a 1993 incident in which Nicole Simpson called police for 
help while a man she identified as her ex-husband was smashing in a door and 
screaming at her. 
</P>
<P>
 Those incidents are documented in police files, but prosecutors also have 
canvassed friends of Nicole Simpson for details about Simpson's behavior on 
other occasions. Candace Garvey, for instance, recalled a verbal altercation at 
a Christmas party last year, and other acquaintances described incidents that 
they either witnessed or that were described to them by Nicole Simpson, the 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 How much of that information will be ruled relevant in the murder trial is a 
decision for Ito. He has not yet indicated when he will hear arguments on that 
issue.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SMALLS WILL AGAIN SEE COUNTY IN COURT; LAW: 
PARENTS SUED AFTER LION MAULED 5-YEAR-OLD GIRL IN CASPERS PARK. PART OF THE 
SETTLEMENT IS IN COUNTY POOL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Laura Small and her family thought their ordeal with the county had ended a 
year ago, when they received a $1.6-million settlement stemming from a mountain 
lion attack that left the young girl partially paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, the Lake Forest family learned that some $90,000 of Laura's 
settlement was trapped in the county's beleaguered investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 To their amazement, they found themselves heading back to court once again 
Friday as part of a federal class-action lawsuit trying to saving Laura's 
investment and those of other minors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never wanted to have anything to do with another lawsuit," said Susan 
Small, Laura's mother. "But we do need to protect her money and be cautious 
about it. . . . It's such a confusing situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed by attorney Wylie A. Aitken, who represented the family in 
the settlement, alleges that Merrill Lynch, broker Michael Stamenson and former 
county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron "were recklessly using and 
abusing the pooled funds of Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Laura was 5 years old in 1986 when a cougar leaped from the bushes in the 
Ronald W. Caspers Wilderness Park and grabbed her head in its mouth. A hiker 
who heard the mother's screams beat the big cat with a stick until it released 
the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack, which came as Laura and her mother were searching for tadpoles, 
left Laura blind in her right eye. She also suffered brain damage and was 
partially paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smalls sued the county, arguing that park officials was aware of the 
potential for mountain lion attacks but did nothing. When the county challenged 
a $2-million jury award, the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana urged 
the county to settle the case. In October, 1993, more than seven years after 
the attack, the family reached a settlement with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Small said most of Laura's settlement was put in insured annuities. A 
Superior Court judge gave them two options for investing the remaining $90,000. 
They chose the county's investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura, now 13 and in the eighth grade, is doing well, her mother said. But she 
will require periodic medical examinations and physical therapy throughout her 
life. Some day she will even need a specially adapted car, her mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family always has said the settlement would ensure her future financial 
security.  
</P>
<P>
 "I really did think when we put the money in the Orange County fund it would 
be safe," Small said. "It was kind of ironic even putting it in the county fund 
because of all the trouble we had gone through."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; EDITORIAL COMMENTARY ACROSS THE NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's newspapers have had plenty to say about Orange County's plight: 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's high-flying plunge into financial disaster should be a 
cautionary tale for local governments and public agencies all over the country, 
including Maryland. By investing heavily in derivatives, the latest Wall Street 
sucker bait for big-risk, low-knowledge speculators, the affluent California 
subdivision has already lost $1.5 billion in taxpayers' money, a sum that may 
double before the catastrophe subsides. 
</P>
<P>
 BALTIMORE SUN, DEC. 10 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Discretion shouldn't be granted local officials tempted to take chances. The 
sort of borrowing and speculation on interest-rate trends that Orange County's 
Robert Citron specialized in...should be outlawed for good. State Sen. Quentin 
Kopp, I-San Francisco / San Mateo, says he will introduce a bill to this 
effect. Better late than never. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER, DEC. 11 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 But because his (Robert L. Citron) returns were so good for so long, everyone 
pretended that merry-go-rounds never stop. The behavior of Merrill Lynch, 
Citron's primary investment advisor over the past year or so, is even more 
disgraceful. By all accounts, Merrill rang up huge investment fees by feeding 
Citron's recklessness like a bartender pushing drinks on a drunk driver. 
</P>
<P>
 HOUSTON CHRONICLE, DEC. 14

 Pressures on investment managers to produce spectacular results are enormous. 
Orange County's fiasco should remind everyone that municipal agencies cannot be 
gamblers.

 As far back as the 1970s, urban experts were predicting that the bankruptcy ax 
would strike many financially strapped cities as declining tax revenue made it 
difficult for them to meet their fiscal obligations... Oddly, however, the ax 
has just fallen on the neck of California's Orange County. That one the 
nation's most affluent counties is experiencing one of urban America's worst 
fiscal nightmares has nothing to do with being financially strapped.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; NONPROFIT AGENCIES FEEL PAIN OF FISCAL CRISIS; 
SERVICES: SOME PAID EMPLOYEES ARE NOW VOLUNTEERS AS COUNTY FUNDING IS SUSPENDED 
TO GROUPS THAT, EVEN IN NORMAL TIMES, STRUGGLE TO EXIST. 
</P>

 Jonathan Lee knows what it's like to come to a country without knowing anyone, 
without speaking the language, without reading well enough to understand when a 
flashing sign at an intersection warns, "Don't walk." 
</P>
<P>
 So when the former Vietnamese refugee learned this week that his boss had to 
stop paying him because of the county's fiscal crisis, he got up as usual 
Friday, donned a dark suit and a colorful tie and headed off to his job as an 
employment specialist at The Cambodian Family Inc., a nonprofit refugee agency 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The only difference was his new title: volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a regular day," said Lee, 32, who is one of more than a dozen 
workers at the agency who have seen their pay slashed or suspended because the 
county has stopped paying its contractors. By Monday, as many as 10 more 
workers will be teaching English for no pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dressed up nice and acted like nothing happened, Lee said. "I feel like the 
first priority is the clients. These people I work with very closely. They've 
become a part of my life. . . . They've become a part of my family." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The county's budget debacle fell hard on nonprofit organizations Friday, as 
hundreds of social service contractors owed money by the county frantically 
cast about for ways to keep their doors open and services flowing. Most, like 
The Cambodian Family, are awaiting federal or state funds administered by the 
county that were frozen as a result of its bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
 Many administrators say they believe the money will trickle in eventually, but 
prompt payment means everything to nonprofit agencies that survive with thin 
financial cushions. 
</P>
<P>
 Orangewood Children's Foundation in Orange issued a plea for public donations 
Friday to keep afloat its temporary-care service for children in need of 
shelter or at risk of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we can hold together another couple of months," said Executive 
Director Judy Nelson. But "we're turning people away who are new. . . . We had 
a grandmother needing surgery who wanted her children taken care of, and we 
could not take them in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim-based Hope House, a residential drug-abuse treatment provider, stopped 
doing "everything that isn't vital" and was seeking monetary and food 
donations, said Executive Director Marc Corradini. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're turning out the lights when we don't need them . . . and (contacting) 
families, friends and graduates" for help, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, United Way of Orange County was assessing whether nonprofit 
organizations in immediate need might qualify for emergency loans from its 
$100,000 fund. "We have been really scrambling," said Merritt Johnson, the 
agency's president. He said United Way has sent surveys to all its affiliate 
agencies to gauge their level of need, but as yet has distributed no money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very sincere in saying we want to be helpful," said Johnson, who 
estimated that the agency could make loans available as early as next week. "We 
think the services (provided by human service agencies) are critical and 
vital." 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators of the nonprofit groups say they are both saddened by the 
fiscal fiasco and heartened by the dedication of their staffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has gone through some shock and sadness," said Rifka Hirsch, 
executive director of The Cambodian Family. But "some have just rallied. 
They've just taken the situation in the most positive way possible. They're 
trying to bring humor to the situation, trying to offer positive sympathy to 
everyone involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Hirsch said staff members who are continuing to work without pay are making a 
great personal sacrifice. "The wages that people earn here are extremely 
important to them. They go into their daily living." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the nonprofit organization struggled to adjust to the funding shortfall, 
Lee, who helps refugees find jobs, and many of his colleagues vowed to work 
free to keep what they consider essential services in place. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cambodian Family, owed more than $100,000 by the county, provides 
English-language instruction and an employment service for refugees during 
their often-disorienting first eight months in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel like the funding's there for us," said Lee, who settled in this 
country in 1984 and has worked at the agency the past four years. But "if it's 
the end of the rope, I might have to look for another job." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee figures clients need his services more than he needs his next paycheck. 
And he makes no secret of the fact that he loves his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his own employment is in jeopardy, Lee helped two refugees land jobs 
Friday. "I wish and believe the government could find a way to help this 
program continue," he said. "I don't know. I just have the feeling these people 
need help."NONPROFIT ORGA

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; NEW FOOTHILL RANCH SCHOOL WILL OPEN ON TIME AFTER 
ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 What a difference three days make. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Saddleback Valley Unified School District officials sent grim word 
to parents that the Jan. 3 opening of Foothill Ranch Elementary School was on 
indefinite hold because of the county's financial quagmire. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the same school district officials changed their minds, saying that 
the contractor has agreed to continue work even though he already is owed 
$118,000, and that district number-crunchers have figured it won't cost that 
much more to open the new facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The news was greeted with cheers by 370 students at Portola Hills Elementary, 
whose classes have been held in portable trailers and who anxiously await a 
move to the new facility after the winter break. They were notified at lunch, 
which turned into an impromptu celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all smiling and screaming," said Jenna Scherman, a 10-year-old 
fifth-grader. "I was yelling. It's the best. I still can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jenna's father, Ron Scherman, who had grumbled earlier in the week about the 
delay, struck a far different note Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the other day I heard rumors that even worse things were going to 
happen, so I was pleasantly surprised," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 District spokeswoman Elaine Carter said the decision was made after officials 
discovered that paying for the trailers at Portola Hills Elementary School 
would cost nearly the same as the extra costs associated with running the new 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seemed like the practical thing to do," Carter said, "even though 
there will be some additional costs to the district." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter also said that two of the 47 full-time and part-time district workers 
notified this week that Friday would be their last day will be hired back 
because the new school is opening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost a wash to do it," Trustee Dore J. Gilbert said of the financial 
implications to the district for opening the new school versus keeping things 
as they were. "Think how bad you feel when you're ready to move into you new 
home and you get a letter that says, 'Sorry, it's not ready yet.' "

ORANGE COUNTY HALL OF FAME; AN ILLUSTRIOUS TRACK RECORD; MARY DECKER SLANEY IS 
NOTHING LESS THAN A LEGEND, AND STILL STRIVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Way back when, she was Little Mary Decker, a tiny, tenacious runner in 
pigtails and braces. 
</P>
<P>
 At 14, she was 5-feet-and-a-sliver, 83 pounds and already a phenom, the 
fastest little girl in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, the Garden Grove schoolgirl beat the reigning Olympic silver medalist 
in the 800 meters, outrunning the Soviet on Soviet soil, then came home and 
suffered her first injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Mary Decker got her foot caught in her bicycle spokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember that," said Mary Decker Slaney, now 36 and living in Eugene, Ore., 
with her husband, Richard, and their daughter, Ashley, 8. "I'd been to Europe 
and come back, and I think I was riding my bike to the ice cream store. I'd 
been all over the world, and I couldn't get to the ice cream store." 
</P>
<P>
 A broken toe cost her six weeks of training. The injury was only the first of 
many that have marked her career, almost as much as world records she held in 
the mile, her five American records that still stand, the double-victory in 
1,500 and 3,000 meters at the World Championships at Helsinki in 1983. And, of 
course, the commotion that followed her agonizing fall after colliding with 
Zola Budd in the 3,000 at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Slaney is the best American woman middle-distance runner ever, and without the 
injuries -- and the U.S. boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow -- she would 
have accomplished even more, almost certainly winning the one thing her career 
is missing -- an Olympic medal. Still, even after some 16 to 20 surgeries -- 
the latest an extensive operation on her left Achilles' tendon 13 weeks ago -- 
she hasn't quit and in fact has set her sights on running the 5,000 and maybe 
the 10,000 in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would mean a lot, and the fact that the Olympics are in Atlanta, in this 
country, would mean even more because of what happened in '84," said Slaney, 
who will be inducted into the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame Sunday. "I 
never really thought I would get the opportunity to think about running in 
another Olympics in this country in my lifetime. It would mean a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime L.A. track promoter Al Franken, who saw the fluid, gliding stride 
Slaney had at 13 and knew she would be a superstar, would like to see Slaney 
return to the Olympics, but says it will be "a terribly tough fight." 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds terribly difficult because she has just undergone so many 
surgeries," he said. "The problem always has been that she was fragile. 
Terribly talented, terribly dedicated and terribly fragile. I don't think one 
person in a million would go through all the surgeries she's been through. They 
would just say, 'I've had it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Slaney, who appeared only in a few road races last winter, meets her share of 
people who think she has had it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely," she said. "They say, 'Oh, I thought you retired,' and I say, 
'I've just been injured.' They say, 'Well, Mary's coming out of retirement,' 
and I say, 'I didn't retire, I've just been injured.' That's OK, given my age 
and given my problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though she will turn 38 in '96, if she is healthy -- a sizable if -- 
Slaney probably could make the Olympic team. Perhaps rather easily. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my feeling, that women middle-distance and distance runners do 
continue to get stronger," she said. "I feel if I get healthy and stay healthy 
for one full year prior to the next Olympics and the Olympic trials, I could 
run better than I've ever run. I'm not trying to duplicate what I've done in 
the past, I'm trying to do better." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent Achilles' surgery was her second major procedure in the last seven 
months, after bone surgery on her heel. She is hopeful this will be the one to 
solve a litany of Achilles' problems. Doctors and shoe specialists have been 
studying films and high-tech molds of her feet to try to develop orthotics that 
will help prevent further injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of it is the way I run, high on my toes, and with a hard push-off," 
Slaney said. "In turn, I absorb a lot of shock in my lower legs, which is where 
all my problems have been." 
</P>
<P>
 Always an impatient patient, Slaney says she is ahead of schedule and hopes to 
be running road races in three to four months, "then fall right back into the 
track season in June, July and August." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, she rehabilitates. 
</P>
<P>
 "As she would put it, she's shuffling," said Richard Slaney, the British 
discus thrower she married in 1985. "How fast is that? Faster than I can run, 
for sure. I can't shuffle with her." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife hardly wants to admit her post-surgery pace on her 30-minute jogs. 
"Really slow," she said. "About 7:30 per mile." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, that's slow . . . if you set the world record with a 4:16.71 mile in 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Slaney discovered her extraordinary ability by accident at the age of 11, when 
she and her best friend went to a cross-country meet held by the Huntington 
Beach parks and recreation department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had finished all our chores for the day and were trying to decide what to 
do afterward," Slaney said. "I think it was a Saturday. We had gotten a handout 
at school the day before about what was going on at parks and recreation that 
weekend. Neither of us knew what cross-country was. We had no idea it had 
anything to do with running. We went, and I won. I won easily. I think it was 
three-quarters of a mile. The next weekend there was a city race and then a 
county race, and I kept winning all the races."  
</P>
<P>
 She ran for a track club called the Long Beach Comets, and later, the Blue 
Angels of Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 At 15, she set three indoor world records. By 16, incredibly, her career was 
in trouble. Shin splints. The 1976 Olympics, when she was 18, came and went. 
But by 1980, she was back, breaking world records left and right. It was only 
the first comeback of several -- and maybe there will be one more. 
</P>
<P>
 "A long time ago, when I first had the first problem, it took me three years 
to get it fixed," Slaney said. "I was told by everyone, 'If you have surgery 
you're finished.' My attitude now is, if it's not working and you can fix it, 
what's wrong with that? If you don't fix it, you can't run anyway. If you do, 
maybe you can. I'm so grateful to these guys (surgeons). Without orthopedic 
medicine I would not still be running. I couldn't even think about racing, or 
even going for a run." 
</P>
<P>
 She was unable to compete in the Olympics in 1980 because of the U.S boycott, 
and unable to run against the world's best in Los Angeles in '84 because of the 
retaliatory Soviet boycott. In Seoul in '88, slowed by a virus in the weeks 
before the Games, she finished 10th in the 3,000. In '92, she failed to make 
the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 Slaney's biggest achievement might have been her double world championship in 
'83, when she beat the Soviet's best in one of the greatest East-West 
confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was an underdog, so to speak," said Slaney, who later added that "one thing 
I say with pride is that everything I've done has been drug-free." 
</P>
<P>
 But the moment that is remembered will always be what happened at the Coliseum 
after Budd drifted to the inside and Slaney's right foot struck Budd's left 
calf, eventually sending Slaney tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sports Illustrated recently published 40 years of pictures, one of them 
was of Slaney's agonized face after the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh well, I suppose I'll always get an opportunity to see it," Slaney said. "I 
assume going into '96 we'll see it a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "My attitude has always been that it's unfortunate it happened. Then again, my 
life could be quite different than it is now. Maybe I wouldn't want to run, or 
at least compete. Maybe I wouldn't have the same desires." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe she would. Even now, though she knows she will one day retire from 
competition, it is hard to imagine it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even after '96, if things go well, why would I stop if things are going 
well?" she said. "There are road races and other meets, not just the Olympics. 
I just like the sport. The Olympics, sure they're important, but it's not the 
only thing. I'm not doing this because I feel like I have to do it. I'm doing 
it because I like it."

INTRODUCTORY COURSE HAS BELIEVERS, CRITICS; RECRUITING: SKEPTICISM SURROUNDS 
THE BOOMING BUSINESS OF MATCHING HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES WITH COLLEGE ATHLETIC 
PROGRAMS.

 They line the walls of Jeff Duva's Woodland Hills office like so many 
trophies, dozens of framed resumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Each contains a picture of a young athlete in the upper right corner. The name 
of a college has been inked over the page in block letters. 
</P>
<P>
 These are Duva's success stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Duva's business, National College Recruiting Assn., helps high school athletes 
get into college athletic programs by compiling profiles of his clients and 
mailing them to hundreds of college programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The theory is that it helps the high school athlete market himself for college 
coaches, increasing his chances of being recruited and, ultimately, of 
receiving an athletic scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 NCRA is one company in a growing industry capitalizing on the race for 
athletic scholarship money. Most of these companies operate similarly, mailing 
profiles to college programs that match the client's athletic and academic 
ability and geographic preference. 
</P>
<P>
 Reactions from students who have used the services are mostly positive, many 
saying that they received correspondence from many schools. Some college 
coaches, however, are skeptical, saying that they seldom recruit anyone from 
the profiles they receive and that students could accomplish the same thing on 
their own for less money. 
</P>
<P>
 Duva, who also owns Bluechip magazine, a publication about the nation's top 
prep athletes, has 10 full-time employees in his Woodland Hills office and has 
sold more than 40 NCRA franchises across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 His main office alone sends out profiles on 150 to 300 high school athletes a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eight out of 10 kids in our program will get scholarships or financial aid or 
priority walk-ons," Duva said. "One hundred percent of the kids get 
correspondence from colleges. They will be put into the recruiting cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 Such attention is not cheap. Most services charge $465 to $900. But Duva said 
students should consider all they are getting: a chance to land their names on 
the desks of hundreds of college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because we do it in volume and we automate it, we can do it for much, much 
less than a parent or coach could," he said. "They would spend thousands of 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, using the service probably won't get you a football scholarship at 
Nebraska. Most NCAA Division I programs spend thousands of dollars each year to 
attract top prospects -- UCLA spends $200,000 on recruiting each year for 
football alone -- and coaches in these programs usually know years in advance 
which athletes they are interested in recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 The services are geared to help athletes not of blue-chip caliber establish 
correspondence with smaller NCAA Division II and III programs, NAIA and 
out-of-state schools that don't have large recruiting budgets. There is no 
guarantee of receiving a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 David Jacobs was overshadowed by a star teammate on the Calabasas High 
baseball team and was not getting much attention from college recruiters. After 
signing with NCRA, he received letters of inquiry from many schools. 
Eventually, he chose to attend Cornell, which does not give athletic 
scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Jacobs' father, Jake, said that NCRA opened the door for his son at 
Cornell and called the service "probably the best investment we have made in a 
long time with regard to his future." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Mignone was another typical recruiting service client. A good golfer and 
average student at Mission Viejo Trabuco Hills High, he had no college 
recruiters pounding on his door. In the fall of his senior year, Mignone signed 
with College Bound Student Athletes, a Wisconsin company. 
</P>
<P>
 After CBSA had sent out profiles on Mignone's behalf, he received about 200 
questionnaires from college coaches and eventually got more than a dozen 
scholarship offers. He accepted a full scholarship, worth more than $12,000 a 
year, to Seton Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Mignone's father, Robert, who paid the $600 bill for CBSA, could not have been 
more pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was excellent," he said. "They delivered exactly what they 
promised." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chris Shot, president of Scout Team, an Atlanta recruiting service, said 
that with some companies, clients often are misled about what the services can 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people have the misconception that working through our company gets 
you a scholarship," Shot said. "I think the reason people have that 
misunderstanding is because a lot of companies use that in their marketing." 
</P>
<P>
 John Ritchie, the West Coast regional director of CBSA, said he goes to great 
lengths to explain to clients exactly what they are buying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We help represent high school student-athletes in getting national exposure 
to colleges across the country," he said. "What we try to do is direct the 
student to the colleges that they will most likely be able to get into." 
</P>
<P>
 Evaluating an athlete's potential, however, is often left to the high school 
coach and even the athlete himself, hardly unbiased judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that we don't want to jeopardize in mailing out information 
is our credibility. . . . So we need to be somewhat selective in who we work 
with," Ritchie said. "We want to make sure that the student-athletes we work 
with have the potential to play in college." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, services rarely turn down a client's check. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of profiles from recruiting services have crossed Coach Tom 
Marshall's desk in the men's basketball office at Cal Poly Pomona. Most were 
about athletes who would not make his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be realistic about what your abilities are and what your chances 
are of getting into a university that is going to give you a full scholarship," 
he said. "You have to check your ego at the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Many college coaches suggested that in most cases, students could accomplish 
the same thing as the services simply by doing a little research and writing 
some letters. 
</P>
<P>
 A case in point is Mike Good, former quarterback at Los Alamitos High. He 
signed with CBSA in spring of his junior year after three years of playing 
back-up to Tim Carey, now a reserve at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Good then had an excellent senior year, passing for a school-record 403 yards 
and four touchdowns in leading Los Alamitos to victory in the Southern Section 
Division II championship game. He contacted Northern Arizona Coach Steve Axman 
on his own, clipping the prep quarterback statistics out of the local newspaper 
and faxing them to the Lumberjacks' football office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within five minutes, he had the coach on the phone to him," said Good's 
mother, Suzi. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, Good accepted a scholarship to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 But even though Good's outstanding senior year and his own initiative landed 
him the scholarship, Suzi Good said that the money spent on CBSA was not 
wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have to say that the experience with CBSA gave us some ideas," she 
said. "You cannot expect the schools to come after you. There are so many 
wonderful athletes out there that, if you don't market your child in one way or 
another, you will miss out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing I would have done differently is giving (CBSA) more direction 
as far as what colleges we wanted them to contact." 
</P>
<P>
 A common complaint about the services from both parents and coaches is that 
their computer matching is not specific enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Most services match on the client's geographic preference, academics and 
self-described athletic level. Depending on the sport the athlete plays, the 
computer can come up with hundreds of colleges that match a client's 
specifications. And because almost every college that receives correspondence 
from a high school athlete -- whether it be a hand-written letter or a 
professional resume -- responds by sending the athlete a questionnaire, the 
athlete might receive bundles of letters from schools he is not interested in 
attending. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Reese, who played basketball at Hoover High, was contacted by many 
schools after NCRA sent out his profile. But most of the schools that showed 
interest in him athletically did not offer the academic environment he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of schools said, 'Come out and walk on and then we'll give you a 
scholarship the next year,' " Reese said. "But I wanted to get somewhere that 
has a very good academic reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote to several universities on his own and ultimately decided to forgo a 
possible athletic scholarship at one of the smaller schools that had contacted 
him because of his NCRA profile. He chose to pay his way at UC San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Among coaches, the attitudes about the services are mixed. Most said they keep 
the resumes on file but rarely end up recruiting an athlete solely because of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 10 years that I have been here, no one from (the service) has ever 
come to our school," said Mary Ann Kluge, women's basketball coach at Pacific 
Lutheran University in Tacoma, Wash. "We have never landed a recruit that way. 
Most of the athletes that subscribe to those kinds of services are looking for 
a great deal of their college tuition to be paid for." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Ryan, track coach at Cal State Los Angeles, said any good coach uses a 
more hands-on approach to recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can go to the Arcadia Invitational and see about 18 hours of races and . 
. . you can see about every kid you have to see," he said. "Maybe it's 
different in the heartland. Maybe in Arkansas, they all just sit by the mailbox 
to recruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I often wondered how many of these kids (who use recruiting services) get 
contacted. They put a picture on it, so it's nice to see what the kids look 
like, and that's the extent of their usefulness. They are just not very 
helpful." 
</P>
<P>
 Often, some coaches say, the resumes lack important information. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of those forms never even put the (grades) down if they are not very 
good," Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, coaches say the profiles, which are often mailed in bulk to the 
school's athletic director, are not personal enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay Don, athletic director at Cal State Dominguez Hills, said she would prefer 
to receive a personal letter from an athlete who has taken the time to narrow 
his choices to a few schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the personal touch that usually makes the difference," Don said. "If 
you get something that says, 'Dear Coach' or 'Dear Athletic Director,' you have 
a tendency to not look at that as (closely) as you would something that had 
your name on it, and the reason for that is that you don't know if they are 
really interested in your school. If you are going to spend a couple of hundred 
dollars recruiting someone, you want to recruit someone who is really 
interested in your school." 
</P>
<P>
 That goes for coaches at NCAA Division I schools as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Sondheimer, UCLA associate athletic director in charge of recruiting, 
sifts through hundreds of pieces of correspondence a day from potential 
recruits. His advice to high school athletes is always the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "My recommendation to potential recruits in any sport is that they invest 
$2.90 in postage stamps and an hour of computer time to print 10 letters and 
send out 10 letters to 10 realistic colleges based on their level of ability," 
he said. "That will give them a realistic opportunity of being seen for a 
scholarship."

FAMILIAR RIVALRY ON COURT; VOLLEYBALL: PERENNIAL POWERS UCLA AND STANFORD MEET 
TODAY IN TEXAS WITH AN NCAA CHAMPIONSHIP ON THE LINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY WITHERSPOON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Of course, it had to end this way. The UCLA and Stanford women's volleyball 
teams are the sport's heavyweights, capturing the attention of the volleyball 
community whenever they meet, as, inevitably, they do at some point each year 
in the NCAA playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 This season is no different, and the stakes could be no higher when UCLA 
(32-3) plays Stanford (31-1) in the championship game tonight at 5:30 p.m. PST 
in a highly anticipated match between the powerful Pacific 10 Conference's two 
best teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever and wherever these teams meet, crowds swell to three times their 
normal size. More than 7,000 tickets have been sold for tonight's final in the 
16,300-seat Frank Erwin Center on the University of Texas campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a perfect setup," Stanford junior Cary Wendell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendell was a freshman when Stanford won its only championship, defeating UCLA 
in 1992. That year, the Bruins, led by Natalie Williams, were undefeated and 
considered the favorite to win their third consecutive national championship 
before Stanford, led by Bev Oden, beat them in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 That match was a pay-back for the 1991 season, when Stanford lost only one 
regular-season match before UCLA swept the Cardinal in the West Regional final 
at Maples Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is the rivalry in collegiate women's volleyball," Stanford Coach 
Don Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last four years, either UCLA has ended Stanford's season in the 
playoffs or vice versa. Last season, UCLA defeated Stanford in the West 
Regional semifinals before losing to Brigham Young in the regional final. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, UCLA leads the series, 31-13. UCLA also has won most of the two 
teams' playoff matches, 5-1. The Bruins have won three NCAA titles, in 1984, 
'90 and '91. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bruins say they will be concentrating only on today's match, not 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody knows what the rivalry is and what it means to the school," 
UCLA outside hitter Jenny Johnson said. "But right now, the rivalry is not 
what's important. The championship is what's important." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal won the conference title with a 17-1 record, UCLA second at 16-2. 
They split their two regular-season matches, each winning at home.  
</P>
<P>
 Stanford has the sport's most dominating player in Kristin Folkl, a 6-foot-2 
outside hitter from St. Louis who will also play basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 But USC Coach Lisa Love, whose team was swept by Stanford in the West Regional 
final, was impressed with the other players too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although Kristin gets a lot of the publicity, and she is a wonderful player, 
it's not just about her," she said. "They are very well-balanced. They can 
attack you very effectively from a lot of positions." 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing about the Cardinal players: They're big. In addition to Folkl, 
Stanford's starting lineup includes middle blockers Barbara Ifejika, a 6-2 
freshman, and Anne Wicks, a 6-2 senior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's kind of intimidating for us to walk in the gym and have them see 
this front line that just goes on and on and on," said Marnie Triefenbach, a 
6-0 outside hitter. 
</P>
<P>
 But if any team can give second-ranked Stanford a close match, it's 
third-ranked UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, a starting outside hitter for UCLA, said she and her teammates will 
not be in awe when Cardinal players walk into the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are probably a bigger team than we are, but that's not intimidating at 
all," said Johnson, who led UCLA with a team-high 18 kills in its five-game 
semifinal victory over Penn State on Thursday. Johnson raised her level of play 
to compensate for Annett Buckner, UCLA's leading hitter, who struggled in that 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA barely survived its semifinal match, but Stanford gained momentum with an 
easy sweep over Ohio State. Stanford has not lost a game since Nov. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stanford looks like the team to beat, the rivals are so familiar with 
each other that neither might have an edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time we played, they were calling out our plays before we ran them," 
Shaw said.

LOVE HOCKEY? JOIN THE CLUB; NO LOCKOUT IN THE PCHA, WHERE BUDGETS ARE TIGHT AND 
THE PLAY IS INTENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's almost 10:30 p.m., and they haven't finished the second period yet. That 
wouldn't be a problem in the NHL, but it's a major concern when you're paying 
hard-earned cash for 90 minutes of ice time and the meter is threatening to run 
out before the game does. 
</P>
<P>
 After each shift, as players from the Orange Coast College hockey club gasp 
for breath, they sneak anxious glances at the clock above the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, you have to give us extra time because the door got stuck," Phil Bahler 
of Orange Coast yells to no one in particular. The superintendents of the 
Culver City rink can't hear him. They're in their offices. They know better 
than to venture into the frigid rink, where the fans watching Orange Coast play 
USC on a recent Monday night huddle under blankets and wrap their fingers 
around cups of steaming coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "You owe us," Bahler continues. "C'mon, the door got stuck twice, and we lost 
10 minutes. You owe us." 
</P>
<P>
 The hockey gods must be listening. No one tells Bahler they can stay on the 
ice, but no one drives the Zamboni out to chase them off. To squeeze in the 
last period, the teams agree to play without stopping the clock until the 
timekeeper decides otherwise for the last two minutes. Orange Coast players 
complain that he's secretly wearing USC colors under his layers of clothing, 
but he remains impassive as Orange Coast holds on for a 6-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the Pacific Collegiate Hockey Assn., a loosely organized league of 
club hockey teams that embraces 10 schools from San Jose to San Diego. In the 
PCHA, you learn that time costs money, and you often have to make up the rules 
as you go along. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's not great hockey. Most players are Easterners or Canadians who played in 
youth leagues but gave up when they realized they had no professional futures. 
California-bred players couldn't make Division I teams because they didn't have 
top-notch coaches to push them when they were young and because the hockey boom 
touched off by Wayne Gretzky's arrival in Los Angeles hadn't filtered down to 
their level. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, competition in the PCHA is intense and the skill level is respectable, 
considering most clubs subsist on budgets that make practice a rare luxury at 
upward of $250 per hour for ice time. 
</P>
<P>
 USC players pay $350 a season for the privilege of skating before sparse 
crowds at Culver City on Monday nights at 9. The school's recreation club 
council contributed $4,000 and players raised $4,000 themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 "On a bare minimum shoestring budget, we need $17,000 to operate, and that 
includes three road trips without staying in a hotel," said Derek Magdalik, the 
club's president, general manager and most energetic promoter. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier College, which revived its club this season and is playing some games 
against PCHA teams, gives its skaters $4,500. Orange Coast, relegated to 
playing home games on Saturdays at 10:15 p.m. at the Ice Capades Chalet in 
Costa Mesa, gets limited funding from the school but gets a van for northern 
trips. A donor supplied the Pirates' classy black and red jerseys. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, which usually plays at Burbank's Pickwick Arena on Fridays at 8:45 p.m. 
or Saturdays at 10:15 p.m., charges dues of $300. The school kicks in $2,600, 
which does not come from the athletic department budget.  
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, at the University of Minnesota, a Division I varsity hockey team, 
the operating budget for expenses such as supplies and travel is about 
$400,000. That doesn't include the cost of 18 scholarships or coaches' 
salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 But what they lack in polish, PCHA players, coaches and administrators make up 
for in dedication. 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach Mark Wilbur, who played for the Trojans a decade ago, laced up his 
first pair of hockey skates when he was 5. "I played until I decided I wanted 
to read and write," joked Wilbur, whose father owned a triple-A hockey team in 
St. Paul, Minn. "I came to SC to play golf, and then I found out they had a 
club hockey team. I quit to play club hockey. My friends thought I was nuts, 
but once a hockey fanatic, always a hockey fanatic." 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a dark suit befitting the downtown accountant he is by day, Wilbur 
stands on a wooden bench during the Trojans' game against Orange Coast and 
coaxes his players to backcheck and hit opponents. He is drained after USC's 
loss and is startled to realize it's after 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in the office at 7 a.m. Seven a.m. comes awfully early some mornings," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast goaltender Derek Walker, who was born in Nova Scotia, has spent 
at least $3,000 on equipment. That's in addition to club dues and traveling 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hobby," said Walker, who works at a packing and crating company to 
support his hockey habit. "But it's something we take really seriously. We're 
representing our school and we're working real hard." 
</P>
<P>
 As Magdalik points out, the PCHA boasts another unique attraction. As long as 
the NHL lockout drags on, he says, "We're the only game in town." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to college hockey, the NHL is a newcomer to the West Coast. Hockey 
was a varsity sport at USC in the 1930s but died in the early '40s. It was also 
popular at Stanford and Cal, where it remains a strong club sport. U.S. 
International University in San Diego had a Division I program until it was 
overwhelmed by the costs of travel, ice time and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, as operating and insurance costs skyrocketed, rinks closed and 
college hockey faded away. A forerunner of the PCHA was born in the early '70s, 
but it was a renegade league. Players looked suspiciously old to be students. 
Teams entered the league and abruptly disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
 Stability is still a missing link. Long Beach State was to play in the PCHA's 
Southern Division this season with UC San Diego, San Diego State and Orange 
Coast but pulled out with little warning, and Pepperdine folded its team in 
mid-November. That's still not as crazy as what happened a year ago. Whittier 
was in, then it was out. Then St. Mary's unexpectedly withdrew. What was 
schedule-maker Bahler to do? 
</P>
<P>
 "We turned around and put University of the Pacific in. That wasn't too bad," 
he said. "But then Northridge played two or three games, got into a 
bench-clearing brawl and got into trouble with the ice rink (Iceoplex in Van 
Nuys). They were asked not to come back and they dropped out. We had a disaster 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn Taylor, a Van Nuys insurance executive, has made it his personal 
mission to clean up PCHA's act. From his initial involvement as a hockey parent 
through his years as president of the Southern California Amateur Hockey Assn., 
he was convinced there was a place for college hockey in the crowded sports 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 His first task after being elected the PCHA's president last summer was to 
restore an aura of legitimacy to the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "As played here on the West Coast, it became almost like playing pickup games. 
Anybody could play," he said. "Schools had their code of ethics and the clubs 
were allowed to exist because the student body wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the schools that have clubs, these kids want to have more recognition 
and more sensible activities. They just want to have a better program. That's 
one of the reasons I prevailed, because I believed in the necessity of building 
strong rules and living with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor enlisted 11 schools this season and gave others probationary status to 
test their commitment. Bahler created three divisions and crafted a 94-game 
schedule that runs from Oct. 7 through March 25. A champion will be determined 
through playoffs, and those games will feature 20-minute periods. Teams during 
the regular season sometimes play 12-minute periods when they can't afford more 
ice time. 
</P>
<P>
 To help defray the cost of equipment, which is the biggest expense, Taylor is 
courting corporate sponsors. For the first time, the Kings are promising to 
help by sending their coaches to a clinic of league coaches sometime this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 But every gain comes slowly for the PCHA, and there are many steps backward. 
USC and UCLA were to play at the Forum on Nov. 17 after the Kings faced the 
Buffalo Sabres, but the NHL lockout wiped out that game and, with it, the 
schools' hope for wide exposure. They met at Pickwick Arena on Nov. 18, the eve 
of their schools' annual football game, and drew about 900. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Getting recognition) is a real uphill battle," said Nathan Brandstater, a 
fourth-year chemistry major at UCLA and assistant captain. "We're all full-time 
students and some of us work, too. We get some support from the university, but 
we don't have the staff to handle advertising and PR. It's tough to try to sell 
tickets and have people say, 'I didn't know we have a hockey team.' " 
</P>

 If players and fans knew college hockey were alive here, would they care? 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor believes they would. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main thing now with the PCHA is to clean up its entire image, to create a 
strong program and get the community involved where the teams are located," he 
said. "We want to get students to want to attend games.  
</P>
<P>
 "My vision for the PCHA is I want to have Nevada, Oregon, Washington and maybe 
even Arizona join. All of them are club (teams) now and they're playing in all 
kinds of funny ways. If a schedule is done for them, it's more organized. As a 
league, all these things would be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe by 1999, it would compel a school to say, 'Maybe we ought to try 
Division I and build a rink.' There are great pluses for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Magdalik also sees a vast potential audience. He cites the University of 
Arizona, which nearly fills its 6,850-seat rink and has a recruiting program. 
Arizona is ranked first in the American Collegiate Hockey Assn., the governing 
body for club-level teams. The ACHA divides teams into tiers based on skill. 
Arizona is in the top tier; PCHA teams are in Tier 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to get us into Tier 1, and with our new coach (Wilbur), I think 
that's going to happen," Magdalik said. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor insists the game will sell itself, and that success for the PCHA is 
only a matter of making people aware it's there. 
</P>
<P>
 "If college hockey was anywhere near the popularity and scope it is in the 
East, it would be totally different here. We'd have publicity and TV games," 
Taylor said. "I'm sure that will happen here. It will get there."

AN ODD COUPLE OF BRUINS; EDNEY AND ZIDEK, FROM DIFFERENT WORLDS, HAVE A LOT IN 
COMMON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three years ago, a dorm room hardly seemed big enough for Tyus Edney and 
George Zidek, players born a world apart and separated by more than a foot in 
height. 
</P>
<P>
 What on earth could Edney, a Long Beach Poly High graduate, say to Zidek, who 
had experienced a revolution in Czechoslovakia but never had pounded the 
playgrounds of America? 
</P>
<P>
 How well could an American 5-foot-10 burst of point-guard energy and 
basketball improvisation communicate with a European seven-foot workaholic with 
a lot to work on? 
</P>
<P>
 This is how Edney remembers meeting Zidek, his assigned roommate freshman 
year: 
</P>
<P>
 "I moved into the dorms early, and when George first came, my friend was in 
the living room, asleep or something, and (fellow Czech Richard) Petruska and 
George came in the door, and it just scared him," Edney says, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't even see to the top of their heads. They just came in and said," 
and here Edney's voice drops to a deep, pseudo-foreign rumble, " 'Where's 
Tyus?' They were two big guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years later, Edney and Zidek are fast friends, the lead guard and 
center, two of the second-ranked Bruins' three senior starters -- the other is 
fifth-year senior Ed O'Bannon -- pivotal parts of a team that is hoping its 
experience can guide it deep into the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Though O'Bannon is the team's emotional leader and most talented player, Edney 
and Zidek are its calmer, quieter veteran souls. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years after their first meeting, after choosing to room together again 
their sophomore year, Edney and Zidek are bound by camaraderie and an easy 
friendship that both say began growing almost as soon as they became roommates. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, the paths to Bruin basketball significance were vastly different. 
Edney, though a relatively unheralded recruit, impressed the coaching staff and 
earned playing time immediately as a freshman and has started since his 
sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
 Zidek, meanwhile, struggled, playing behind Petruska, who had transferred from 
Loyola Marymount, and the more experienced Rodney Zimmerman. As recently as the 
fall of 1993, Coach Jim Harrick said that Zidek, recruited after Cherokee Parks 
had bolted the area to sign with Duke, wasn't in his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It says a lot about both of them, that coming from totally different 
backgrounds, they became such good friends," says UCLA assistant coach Mark 
Gottfried. "I mean totally different. 
</P>
<P>
 "They became friends quickly. Both of them have the most gentle spirits. They 
have no ego, either one of them. They're very humble." 
</P>
<P>
 Zidek and Edney say that despite the cultural and practical differences of 
their lives and UCLA careers, they are more alike than different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people think, I guess, he'd be wild and stuff, but really, he spends a 
lot of time watching TV or stuff like that," Zidek says of Edney. "I would say 
he's quiet. He doesn't do many wild things. I think he's the same way he is on 
the court. He doesn't make many turnovers on the court, he doesn't make many 
turnovers in life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bet you you would get along with him. He's a real nice guy." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Zidek says it was Edney who played a part in Zidek's decision not to 
leave UCLA after his frustrating first two seasons and return to the Czech 
Republic for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Zidek has steadily improved to the point where he has been one of UCLA's more 
consistent offensive threats this season, but he almost wasn't here to enjoy 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't have much faith that I was going to break through," he says. 
"But when things were not going very well for me the first two years, Tyus 
always encouraged me to stay with it and don't get frustrated. Just keep 
working. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he talked, he'd tell me to remember that good things take some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Zidek went home, played well on the Czech national team, talked to his father, 
a coach with the Czech team, and decided to return to school. Even if 
basketball wasn't going well, Zidek was having a brilliant academic career at 
UCLA, majoring in economics. 
</P>
<P>
 So when he came back for his junior year, Petruska having graduated, Zidek 
threw himself into refining his game -- grabbing Gottfried or anybody else who 
would shag balls for him while he shot and shot and shot, in the mornings and 
after practice. 
</P>
<P>
 And during those shooting sessions, Zidek began developing a sweeping hook 
shot -- now a shot virtually impossible to block -- that he shoots with each 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning, I was very frustrated," Zidek says. "I knew the only way I 
could get a starting job was by outworking everybody every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Gottfried: "George is an example of a guy who just stuck it out, kept 
working. In George's junior year, as Rodney was a senior, it was clear that 
George had emerged." 
</P>
<P>
 Zidek was the starter all of last season and averaged 11 points and seven 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "One game in the middle of last year, I remember they were double-teaming 
Zidek," Harrick says. "And I punched Mark on the bench. I said, 'Look, they're 
double-teaming George!' We went from a guy who wasn't even in our plans to 
someone they had to double team." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, with the Bruins' half-court offense rotating around him and Ed 
O'Bannon down low, Zidek is averaging 13.3 points and, most important to UCLA's 
tournament future, has made 62.5% of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
 He made three of the biggest shots of his career in UCLA's one-point victory 
over Kentucky in early December, including a left-handed hook that the Wildcat 
defense obviously was not expecting. 
</P>
<P>
 For a UCLA team that has struggled to get consistent production out of its 
half-court game, Zidek's pressure scoring was a revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, that was great," Edney says. "I think every time he gets it down there, 
he's going to score. And if he doesn't, it's like, 'Whoa, that's a surprise.' 
He's really developed his post game to where he's going to have to be stopped. 
People are going to have a hard time doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Harrick: "I don't think (Kentucky) had anybody in the game that could 
handle George, and I'm not sure George feels anybody can handle him now. We've 
got to look inside and get that guy the ball, because good things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Zidek breaks up his teammates in the locker room, purposefully 
mangling American slang with his Czech accent and telling them all, only half 
joking, that nobody can stop him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows he's focused," Edney says. "But he's like a comedian 
sometimes too. People might not think that, but he's kind of silly. Doing 
little silly things. You can't imagine some of the things he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Like making friends with a little guy from Long Beach who was assigned to live 
with him three years ago? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people'd ask me how it was, and I'd say it was cool," Edney says. 
"We just got along well from the start. He's a funny guy when you get to know 
him. The more I got to know him, the closer we became."

IT'S BACK TO POLLS AT CSUN; REFERENDUM: STUDENTS WILL GET THIRD CHANCE TO 
PROVIDE FUNDING FOR MATADOR ATHLETICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Third time a charm, perhaps? 
</P>
<P>
 After two losses at the student polls, Cal State Northridge will stage another 
fee referendum next spring, with money again earmarked for the school's 
debt-ridden athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting of school athletic administrators and coaches on Friday, 
Northridge President Blenda J. Wilson threw her support behind a referendum to 
be held in March, which will mark the third attempt in the past year to 
underwrite athletics with increased student fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also told the group that she is still reviewing a list of athletic 
funding scenarios and plans to issue to the public by early next week a short 
list of options. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the scenarios involve budget or program cuts, Athletic Director Bob 
Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's oft-controversial NCAA Division I-AA football team, which had a 
budget of $500,000 in 1994, remains under consider for elimination, Hiegert 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Northridge is facing a budget deficit of approximately $700,000 next year. 
</P>
<P>
 After soliciting feedback on the funding proposals, Wilson is expected to 
select one of the scenarios by mid-January, Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it comes to that, we need to give the affected student-athletes time (to 
find another college at which to play)," Hiegert said. 
</P>
<P>
 The referendum will be presented during the Associated Students election March 
8-9, Hiegert said. Athletic referendums were shot down twice by student vote in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletics -- hampered by declining enrollment, damage associated with the 
January earthquake and a sluggish economy -- must find a new way to skin the 
same cat. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Hiegert said, plans call for the measure to be presented to 
students in a detailed either/or format. In past elections, no athletic 
programs were specifically targeted for elimination if the referendum was voted 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 The end result next spring, should the referendum again fail, will be 
painfully clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students will know exactly what is going to happen," Hiegert said. "It will 
be along the lines of, 'Here's the programs we'll have if it passes and here's 
what you'll have if it doesn't.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In October, a referendum that would have hiked student fees $49 per semester 
was narrowly defeated in the largest election turnout in school history.  
</P>
<P>
 The fee would have generated $2.25 million annually for athletics based on 
current enrollment levels. A similar proposal was defeated last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiegert said it has not been determined what level of funding will be sought 
from students on the third referendum attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal State University system, of which Northridge is a member, also is 
facing a possible 10% fee hike next year, driving registration costs to more 
than $1,000 per semester. Nonetheless, the notion of Referendum III was 
well-received by coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in favor of another referendum a day after the last one failed," said 
Pete Cassidy, the men's basketball coach.  
</P>
<P>
 "A school of 25,000 in a community of millions should have a major athletic 
program and students should recognize the value of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also assured the group that despite looming departmental cuts, the 
school will remain a member of Division I, where it has competed for the past 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Wilson in a release through a school spokesman: "We are committed to 
offering a quality NCAA Division I program at whatever funding level we can 
sustain." 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge coaches have complained that the threat of dropping to Division II, 
however remote it may have been, has negatively affected their ability to 
recruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a relief," Hiegert said. "We're glad it's been put to bed. (Rival 
coaches) were using that in a recruiting situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's major news," said Don Strametz, the track and cross-country coach. "We 
can move forward. Everybody has lost recruits over the past couple of weeks 
because of this (uncertainty)."

OKLAHOMA GOES WITH EXPERIENCE; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: SCHNELLENBERGER, 60, IS CHOSEN 
TO LEAD THE SOONER PROGRAM BACK TO NATIONAL PROMINENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Oklahoma turned to a builder of football programs to return the Sooners to 
national prominence, hiring Howard Schnellenberger to replace Gary Gibbs on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In five years, Schnellenberger led Miami from the brink of extinction to a 
national title.In 10 years at Louisville, he won nearly half his games and took 
the Cardinals to two bowl games. That was a program that in the decade before 
his arrival had only two winning seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 His college record is 96-71-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is exciting for a 60-year-old coach who has coached for a long time to be 
given the assignment and trust and confidence to lead this program," 
Schnellenberger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not used to leading a great program and coming in in the shadows of Bud 
Wilkinson and all the other great coaches you have had here." 
</P>
<P>
 Pending approval by the school's regents, Schnellenberger will be given a 
five-year deal worth a base salary of $125,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnellenberger lends an established coaching name to Oklahoma. The Sooners, 
winners of six national titles, have not won a Big Eight title since 1987 and 
this season finished 6-5 and in fourth place in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it is his "avowed goal" to restore the program to national prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnellenberger was 54-56-2 in 10 seasons at Louisville and took the team to 
the 1991 Fiesta Bowl and the 1993 Liberty Bowl. That Fiesta Bowl team finished 
10-1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals went 6-5 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Before going to Louisville, Schnellenberger coached at Miami from 1979 to 1983 
and led the Hurricanes to the 1983 national championship. He also was coach of 
the Baltimore Colts in 1973-74 and served as an assistant coach with the Miami 
Dolphins and Rams.

MORNING BRIEFING: HIS CHANCES IN HEISMAN RACE DIAGNOSED AS HYPER-EXTENDED

 Steve McNair of Alcorn State didn't win the Heisman Trophy, but the school 
received another honor, if you can call it that. 
</P>
<P>
 Derick Hackett, the Alcorn State sports information director, won the hardly 
coveted 1994 Hypseman Award.  
</P>
<P>
 The mythical trophy is given annually to the publicist who "personifies the 
hyperbolic nature of the Heisman Trophy award by undertaking the best 
unsuccessful campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 The award is fittingly sponsored by a group called the Dead SIDS Society.

 Frightening: Defensive end Ray Seals of the Pittsburgh Steelers, when asked 
about a nickname for the team's defense:  
</P>
<P>
 "I think of us as Zulu warriors. When I was a kid, I saw a great movie about 
the Zulu warriors and how they swarmed over the fields of Africa.

 Clip and save: Roger Clemens, Boston Red Sox pitcher, on new teammate Jose 
Canseco: "Jose was always a tough out for me, but I enjoyed facing him. He

 Come again? Adam Schefter in Pro Football Weekly: "Not long ago, Colorado 
wanted (Denver Bronco Coach) Wade Phillips to go away. Then he goes from lame 
to fame to maybe being considered the NFL coach of the year."

 Countdown: Gene Collier in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: "Pitt will make it

AROUND THE NFL; HOT 49ERS CAN CLINCH HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE 
</P>

<P>
 For now, Steve Young would rather understate the San Francisco 49ers' success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to look at it as a streak or above-average performance," the 
49er quarterback said. "I'd like to think that we're fulfilling expectations 
and playing up to our standard rather than something we're going to drop from. 
There will be tough games in the future, but I want this to become the norm." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning has been the norm recently for the 49ers, who haven't been beaten 
since a 40-8 loss to Philadelphia Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco (12-2) has won nine in a row since then, and seeks to extend the 
streak today against the Denver Broncos (7-7) at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 During the victory string, the 49ers have outscored opponents by an average of 
19.6 points (35.8 to 16.2) and they are only 26 points shy of the franchise 
record for points in a season (475), set by the 1984 team, which won the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 With the NFC West title and a first-round postseason bye already clinched, the 
49ers will be trying to secure home-field advantage throughout the playoffs by 
beating the Broncos. Denver, which has won seven of 10 since opening the season 
0-4, still has playoff aspirations, but needs a victory to bolster those hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 John Elway was sidelined against the Raiders last week because of a twisted 
knee, only his seventh missed start because of injury in 12 seasons, but 
returned to practice this week.

<P>
 Talk about playoffs. Talk about Cris Carter's pass-catching record. Talk about 
venerable quarterbacks Warren Moon and Dave Krieg. But don't forget Barry 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Any time the Detroit Lions play, Sanders is apt to be a factor. The fact that 
he hasn't done much in the last five games between Detroit and Minnesota only 
makes today's game in Pontiac, Mich., more intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (9-5) can clinch their second NFC Central title in the last three 
years with a victory. The Lions (8-6), who won the division title in 1991 and 
1993, will remain in the hunt for another divisional crown and move closer to a 
wild-card playoff berth if they win. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders leads the league in rushing with 1,721 yards in 302 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately, the Vikings have shut him down. In the five games since Sanders 
rushed for 220 yards against the Vikings on Nov. 24, 1991, they have limited 
him to an average of 49.5 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter has 111 catches, one shy of the league record of 112 set last season by 
Sterling Sharpe of Green Bay.

 Joe Montana confirmed that he will start in the Kansas City Chiefs' final home 
game of the season, Sunday against Houston. Montana has been sidelined the last 
two games because of a foot injury as the Chiefs fell to 7-7.

AROUND THE NFL; RAMS; ANDERSON WANTED ELLARD IN PRO BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wide receiver Flipper Anderson scolded Pro Bowl voters Friday for leaving 
former teammate Henry Ellard off the NFC squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellard caught 65 passes for 1,284 yards with the Washington Redskins this 
season, averaging 19.3 yards per catch. He was left off the NFC roster in favor 
of starters Jerry Rice of San Francisco and Cris Carter of Minnesota, and 
reserves Sterling Sharpe of Green Bay and Michael Irvin of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has had a Pro-Bowl season," Anderson said. "He got shafted in the voting. 
I know a couple of those guys have had good seasons with their teams, but they 
didn't have better games statistically than Henry." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellard caught 17 fewer passes and nine fewer touchdowns than Sharpe, but he 
has 302 yards more receiving. Irvin has caught 71 passes for 1,143 yards and 
six touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Henry got to 1,000 yards quicker than any receiver in the league," Anderson 
said. "I know Sharpe and Irvin are mainstays, but I still believe Henry had a 
better year than they did, and I don't think it's fair the way the voting 
went." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said he left a message on Ellard's answering machine Friday, telling 
him "to keep his head up. He's having a great season." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tight end Troy Drayton, who has complained about his role in the Rams' passing 
game this season, was rewarded Friday when he was named a Pro Bowl alternate 
behind San Francisco's Brent Jones and Jay Novacek of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton is third on the Rams in receptions with 30 for 260 yards but leads the 
team with six touchdown catches. He has complained twice this season for the 
team's inability to get him the ball and taking him out in passing downs in 
favor of a four wide receiver formation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes it all worthwhile," Drayton said. "Even though I didn't have the 
numbers I wanted, it showed that some of the guys (players and coaches) thought 
pretty highly of me. I'm pretty happy, and I can't complain." 
</P>
<P>
 As an alternate, Drayton will go to the Feb. 5 game in Honolulu only if Jones 
or Novacek decide not to play. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Slater (elbow, rib injuries) will get some work at right tackle in 
goal-line and short-yardage, as well as some on regular downs for Sunday's game 
at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might even run back a few punts," Slater said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Darryl Henley (groin) returned to practice Friday and is expected 
to start, Coach Chuck Knox said. . . . Defensive tackle Jimmie Jones (right 
ankle) also returned to practice. . . . Linebacker Chris Martin, quarterback 
Jamie Martin, defensive end Jay Williams and tight end Rickey Brady will be 
inactive. MIKE REILLEY

AROUND THE NFL; RAIDERS; HOSKINS MIGHT FILL IN AS A SAFETY VALVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Starting free safety Eddie Anderson is listed as questionable for Sunday's 
game against Seattle because of a groin injury he suffered in the Raiders' 
victory over Denver last Sunday. If Anderson is unable to play, Derrick Hoskins 
will start in his place, with Patrick Bates starting at strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will really feel good to be back out there," said Hoskins, who began the 
season at starting strong safety only to lose his position after he was injured 
against Kansas City on Nov. 6. "It will be my first start since I got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 With Bates and Hoskins in the lineup, the Raiders will have interchangeable 
safeties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both Patrick and I know each position like the back of our hands," Hoskins 
said. "At times, you may see us switch, with me playing strong and him playing 
free." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, a nine-year veteran, leads the team with 81 tackles, including two 
sacks.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Dan McGwire starting at quarterback in place of injured Rick Mirer for 
the Seahawks, the Raiders will have an advantage because of McGwire's lack of 
mobility. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you can't count him out because he can throw the ball all over the 
field," Coach Art Shell said. "He did good enough to lead them to a win last 
week (a 16-14 victory over Houston)." LONNIE WHITE

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; HOT 49ERS CAN CLINCH HOME-FIELD 
ADVANTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For now, Steve Young would rather understate the San Francisco 49ers' success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to look at it as a streak or above average performance," the 
49er quarterback said. "I'd like to think that we're fulfilling expectations 
and playing up to our standard rather than something we're going to drop from. 
There will be tough games in the future, but I want this to become the norm." 
</P>
<P>
 Winning has been the norm recently for the 49ers, who haven't been beaten 
since a 40-8 loss to Philadelphia Oct. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco (12-2) has won nine in a row since then, and seeks to extend the 
streak today against the Denver Broncos (7-7) at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 During the victory string, the 49ers have outscored opponents by an average of 
19.6 points (35.8 to 16.2) and they are only 26 points shy of the franchise 
record for points in a season (475), set by the 1984 team, which won the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they had people hurt, they didn't do well," Denver Coach Wade Phillips 
said. "Ever since then, they looked like they could score 40 points against 
anybody. They played some of the teams we played and just destroyed them. It's 
scary." 
</P>
<P>
 With the NFC West title and a first-round postseason bye already clinched, the 
49ers will be trying to secure home-field advantage throughout the playoffs by 
beating the Broncos. Denver, which has won seven of 10 since opening the season 
0-4, still has playoff aspirations, but needs a victory to bolster those hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to play as good as we can play, and we think we can win," 
Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Elway was sidelined against the Raiders last week because of a twisted 
knee, only his seventh missed start because of injury in 12 seasons, but 
returned to practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about playoffs. Talk about Cris Carter's pass-catching record. Talk about 
venerable quarterbacks Warren Moon and Dave Krieg. But don't forget Barry 
Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Any time the Detroit Lions play, Sanders is apt to be a factor. The fact that 
he hasn't done much in the last five games between Detroit and Minnesota only 
makes today's game in Pontiac, Mich., more intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vikings (9-5) can clinch their second NFC Central title in the last three 
years with a victory. The Lions (8-6), who won the division title in 1991 and 
1993, will remain in the hunt for another divisional crown and move closer to a 
wild-card playoff berth if they win. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders leads the league in rushing with 1,721 yards in 302 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately, the Vikings have shut him down. In the five games since Sanders 
rushed for 220 yards against the Vikings on Nov. 24, 1991, they have limited 
him to an average of 49.5 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter has 111 catches, one shy of the league record of 112 set last season by 
Sterling Sharpe of Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Montana confirmed that he will start in the Kansas City Chiefs' final home 
game of the season, Sunday against Houston. Montana has been sidelined the last 
two games because of a foot injury as the Chiefs fell to 7-7.

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; GOING UNDERCOVER TO FIND THE REAL ALL-NFL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bill Plaschke 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maybe it's the underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 When Terance Mathis was asked for something that would help observers 
distinguish him from the dozens of receivers who are not playing as well as 
Jerry Rice, he pondered a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 His name is not imprinted on a visor worn shamelessly on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 He has never glared out from the TV and barked, "Get real." 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't run around the field with a towel hanging to his knees or wearing 
his socks at his ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 He has never made a cameo on "Coach." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He pondered some more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I do have these boxer shorts," he admitted. "My kids gave them to me. I 
wear them every Sunday to the game. My lucky boxer shorts." 
</P>
<P>
 What's unique about that? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," he said, "they have pictures of Pebbles and Bam-Bam on them." 
</P>
<P>
 That must be it, then. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathis, of the Atlanta Falcons, apparently was left off the NFC Pro Bowl team 
because his shorts depict the Flintstones. 
</P>
<P>
 He certainly couldn't have been ignored because of his statistics. He ranks 
second in the league in catches, with 103, behind Cris Carter of the Minnesota 
Vikings, and second in yards with 1,284, behind Rice of the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Carter and Rice were voted to the Pro Bowl. So were Sterling Sharpe of 
the Green Bay Packers and Michael Irvin of the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Sharpe will invite Mathis to Hawaii anyway. That way, Sharpe could honor 
Mathis, and Carter, after they both break Sharpe's single-season record of 112 
catches. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that any of this should matter. As all-star games go, the Pro Bowl is as 
meaningful as one involving softball teams made up of rock stars. 
</P>
<P>
 But in case anyone is fooled, we present you with an all-NFL team that has 
something to do with the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 And we present the spurned Mathis, naturally, as our captain. 
</P>
<P>
 In honor of those whose bluster has obscured players such as Mathis, we have 
also included 1994's most overrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics note that Mathis struggled in the New York Jets' conventional offense 
for four years before joining the Falcons through free agency and becoming the 
perfect wide receiver for their run-and-shoot. He's 5 feet 10 and fast. 
</P>
<P>
 But he still has to catch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get very upset when I hear that I'm doing well because of the system," he 
said. "You still have to get open. You still have to make the plays." 
</P>
<P>
 And he still has to get into the end zone, which he has done 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an incredible year," said Mathis, a former New Mexico star. "I 
don't think it's actually sunk in yet. Nobody in Atlanta really knows me. I'm 
just walking around, enjoying it, thinking whatever happens, happens." 
</P>
<P>
 He also gets our vote because of his cool-sounding charity, TLC. 
</P>
<P>
 As in, Terance Loves Children. TIMES ALL-NFL TEAM 
</P>
<P>
 OFFENSE: 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Best: Steve Young, 49ers. Who would have guessed that in the same 
year he is whipped by Joe Montana, he outruns Montana's ghost? He has never 
been better. A Super Bowl coronation awaits. 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated: Jeff George, Atlanta Falcons. Nothing more than a Craig 
Erickson in wolf's clothing. It took his departure from Indianapolis for the 
league to finally figure this out. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running Backs Best: Barry Sanders, Detroit Lions, and Emmitt Smith, Cowboys. 
The first player is the league's prettiest. The second, its toughest. 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated: Ricky Watters, 49ers. In tough situations, the team's loudest 
player is often the first to disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wide Receivers Best: Carter, Mathis. Rice is not here because we can pick only 
two. Just because he's the best ever doesn't mean he is the best every year. 
Mathis' numbers and Carter's acrobatics have been stunning. 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated: Michael Haynes, New Orleans Saints. For $10 million, the 
Saints were hoping for Jerry Rice. Instead, they got Nate Singleton. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tight End Best: Ben Coates, New England Patriots. Is any skill player more fun 
to watch? When he thrusts his 6-4, 245-pound frame above two linebackers to 
make a catch, the football game is transformed to a combination of basketball, 
rugby, and "kill the man with the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated: Keith Jackson, Miami Dolphins. Now that he has learned to 
block, he has forgotten how to catch. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Center Best: Dermontti Dawson, Pittsburgh Steelers. Nobody comes close to 
matching his combination of blocking skills and decision making. Don't say this 
to anybody in those taverns along the three rivers, but he may be better than 
Mike Webster. 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated: Bart Oates, 49ers. Makes more mistakes than you'd expect from 
a 36-year-old lawyer who learned under Bill Parcells. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Guards Best: Keith Sims, Dolphins and Nate Newton, Cowboys. Sims has finally 
escaped the shadow of more prominent Dolphin lineman Richmond Webb. Comedian 
Newton consistently shows there's nothing funny about his blocking. 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated: Steve Wisniewski, Raiders. His reputation as a tough guy 
should no longer eclipse the truth that no matter who is running, the Raiders 
cannot consistently run. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tackles Best: Will Wolford, Indianapolis Colts, and Tony Jones, Cleveland 
Browns. Neither made the Pro Bowl, so apparently fans and players were not 
watching those giant holes given Marshall Faulk and all that time afforded 
Vinny Testaverde. With weak or injured players around them, both men have had 
outstanding seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated: Gary Zimmerman, Denver Broncos. Anybody from an offensive line 
that threatens John Elway's existence daily does not belong within a six-hour 
flight of the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kicker Best: Fuad Reveiz, Vikings. With 22 consecutive field goals during 
these pressure months, he certainly earned his first Pro Bowl invitation in his 
nine seasons. We're finally even spelling his first name correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated: Chip Lohmiller, Washington Redskins. Once a favorite of 
teammates and fantasy-leaguers alike, in the last two years he has missed 17 of 
53 field-goal attempts and four extra points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kick Returner Best: Mel Gray, Lions. What you might imagine Sanders would look 
like with room to run. The best now, and ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated: None. Their duties and importance far outweigh their pay and 
stature. Every one of these guys is underrated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 DEFENSE: 
</P>
<P>
 Tackles Best: John Randle, Vikings, and Chester McGlockton, Raiders. Entire 
offensive lines are sometimes directed at them. Randle gives the Vikings 
outside hope of surprising the Cowboys and 49ers. McGlockton is the only chance 
the Raiders have of stopping the Steelers' running game in a rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated: Pierce Holt, Atlanta Falcons. It's amazing how a 6-4, 
275-pound guy can simply vanish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ends Best: Leslie O'Neal, San Diego Chargers, and Charles Haley, Cowboys. Does 
anybody else think that the Chargers' best defensive player is O'Neal, and not 
that teammate who appeared on "The Tonight Show?" Haley gives the Cowboys not 
only an enforcer, but a conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated: Chris Doleman, Falcons. He mopes, he whines, he doesn't stop 
the run. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inside Linebacker Best: Junior Seau, Chargers. Last week he was chasing down 
the 49ers on one leg. He takes so many chances that he is sometimes burned, but 
for once his play matched his celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated: Vincent Brown, Patriots. How can a guy be overrated if you've 
never heard of him? If the Patriots make the playoffs, you will. Just don't 
listen. Lately, USC rookie Willie McGinest has played better. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Linebackers Best: Greg Lloyd and Kevin Greene, Steelers. One of these 
two is the defensive player of the year. The difficulty is determining which 
one it is. In their strength and intensity lie the AFC's best chance at 
stealing a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated: Pat Swilling, Lions. Quick now, a show of hands. How many 
people realize this guy doesn't even start regularly anymore? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerbacks Best: Deion Sanders, 49ers, and Terry McDaniel, Raiders. For all 
of his hype, Sanders remains the most influential defensive force in the game. 
And for this season, anyway, big-play McDaniel has been better. 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated: Eric Allen, Philadelphia Eagles. The re-enforcement of the 
no-chucking rule has severely damaged his game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Safeties Best: Eric Turner, Browns, and Darren Woodson, Cowboys. The newest in 
a breed of three-position safeties -- guys who also behave like cornerbacks and 
linebackers. Once the ball is snapped, they are impossible to avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated. Steve Atwater and Dennis Smith, Broncos. Smith, 35, has 
declined far more than Atwater, but both are living off reputations created 
when the Broncos were a championship-caliber team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Punter Best: Mark Royals, Steelers. With this guy putting a league-leading 33 
punts inside the 20-yard line, no wonder the Steeler defense plays so inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 Most overrated: None. There hasn't been a punter famous enough to qualify for 
an overrated tag since Ray Guy. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) QUICK HITTERS 
</P>
<P>
 * SINGIN' IN THE PAIN: Loud singing was heard from the shower area in the 
Astrodome's visitors' locker room during the fourth quarter of last week's game 
between the Houston Oilers and Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer? Seahawk safety Eugene Robinson, whose season had just ended with a 
torn Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
 Showering next to him was injured tackle Ray Roberts, who would have preferred 
to suffer in silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't upset at him," Roberts said. "But I just wished he would shut up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * FAT AND FATTER: An otherwise pedestrian matchup on Sunday has been enhanced 
by a feud between Arizona Coach Buddy Ryan and his former defensive tackle 
Keith Rucker, who has been playing for Cincinnati since Ryan ran him out of 
town because of his 360 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've coached a lot of great defensive linemen in my day, and Rucker darn sure 
wasn't one of them," Ryan said. "He can't play. He can stand out there and take 
up a suit, but I come here to win a Super Bowl, not to coddle people." 
</P>
<P>
 Responded Rucker: "It's hard for me to have a guy his size and proportion call 
me fat. What is he -- five feet and almost 300?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rucker, who is 6-4, implied that he wouldn't go out of his way to avoid 
hitting Ryan during pursuit on any play near the Cardinal sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll go for the ballcarrier," Rucker said. "But if I get (Ryan), there's 
nothing like killing two birds with one stone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * THE PRICE OF VICTORY: Preparing for their showdown in Pittsburgh on Sunday, 
the Cleveland Browns are acutely aware that of the last 10 teams that defeated 
the Dallas Cowboys, only two were victorious the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * THE COST OF DEFEAT: Cris Dishman, Oiler cornerback, on the difference 
between this year and last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Last year) was a great time to be an Oiler. We could go to a restaurant with 
a 20-minute wait and get seated immediately. If a policeman pulled us over to 
give us a (speeding) ticket, he would let us off with a warning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, if we go to a restaurant with a 20-minute wait, they don't seat us for 
two hours. If we get pulled over, not only does the cop write the ticket, but 
he checks for proof of insurance, asks to see the registration and checks the 
inspection sticker." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * WET AND WILD: Deion Sanders tried to climb into the stands after last week's 
game in San Diego after a fan dumped a cup of beer on him. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't because he got soaked. It was because he doesn't drink. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that hurts me the most is I never tasted alcohol," Sanders said. "I 
don't drink. I never have. I never will." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * BATTLE OF THE TITANS: Today, for once, Minnesota quarterback Warren Moon 
will not have to feel badly about sharing the NFL record for career fumbles 
with 125. 
</P>
<P>
 Because on the same field will be the man he shares it with, Detroit 
quarterback Dave Krieg. 
</P>
<P>
 This should be fun. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * TAKE THAT: The Dallas Cowboys' Pro Bowl ballot included five San Francisco 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Norton Jr., the Cowboys' former teammate and a Pro Bowl player last year, 
was not one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * A MAN'S MAN: Bubby Brister on replacing Randall Cunningham this week as the 
Philadelphia Eagles' quarterback: "Nothing against Randall, but I ain't going 
to be holding anybody's hand in the huddle." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * CROSSING THE LINE: There seems little doubt that Jimmy Johnson will announce 
on the Fox pregame show Sunday that he is staying with that network for another 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't be surprised if he changes his mind next month. The Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers could have a serious buyer by then, somebody willing to give Johnson 
a job as coach-general manager and a piece of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * MAKES SENSE TO US: Arizona's Greg Davis said he relaxed before kicking the 
game-winning field goal against the Washington Redskins by practicing breathing 
techniques learned with his wife in a Lamaze childbirth class. 
</P>
<P>
 *

 * THROW THIS FOOL OUT OF THE LEAGUE: Is it just us, or does the NFL's 
idiot-of-the-year award go to Seattle rookie cornerback Orlando Watters? 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two weeks after teammate Mike Frier suffered a paralyzing injury in 
an automobile crash involving two teammates, Watters was arrested early Tuesday 
morning by Seattle police for, among other things, allegedly driving while 
intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Seahawk Coach Tom Flores has already admitted that Watters made a mistake. So 
we do not feel we are tampering with due process by suggesting that he be 
sentenced to spending the next three years helping Frier try to walk again.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; HOSKINS MIGHT FILL IN AS A SAFETY VALVE 
</P>

 Starting free safety Eddie Anderson is listed as questionable for Sunday's 
game against Seattle because of a groin injury he suffered in the Raiders' 
victory over Denver last Sunday. If Anderson is unable to play, Derrick Hoskins 
will start in his place, with Patrick Bates starting at strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will really feel good to be back out there," said Hoskins, who began the 
season at starting strong safety only to lose his position after he was injured 
against Kansas City on Nov. 6. "It will be my first start since I got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 With Bates and Hoskins in the lineup, the Raiders will have interchangeable 
safeties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both Patrick and I know each position like the back of our hands," Hoskins 
said. "At times, you may see us switch, with me playing strong and him playing 
free." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, a nine-year veteran, leads the team with 81 tackles, including two 
sacks.  
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Lionel Washington, who has sat out the last four games because of a 
lower leg injury, will be inactive. He is expected to return for the final 
regular-season game against Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Dan McGwire starting at quarterback in place of injured Rick Mirer for 
the Seahawks, the Raiders will have an advantage because of McGwire's lack of 
mobility. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you can't count him out because he can throw the ball all over the 
field," Coach Art Shell said. "He did good enough to lead them to a win last 
week (a 16-14 victory over Houston)." LONNIE WHITE

 Anderson Wanted Ellard in Pro Bowl 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Flipper Anderson scolded Pro Bowl voters for leaving former 
teammate Henry Ellard off the NFC squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellard has caught 65 passes for 1,284 yards with the Washington Redskins, 
averaging 19.3 yards a catch. He was left off the NFC roster in favor of 
starters Jerry Rice of San Francisco and Cris Carter of Minnesota and reserves 
Sterling Sharpe of Green Bay and Michael Irvin of Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has had a Pro Bowl season," Anderson said. "He got (snubbed) in the 
voting. I know a couple of those guys have had good seasons with their teams, 
but they didn't have better games statistically than Henry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tight end Troy Drayton, who has complained about his limited role in the Rams' 
passing game, was rewarded when he was named a Pro Bowl alternate behind San 
Francisco's Brent Jones and Dallas' Jay Novacek. 
</P>
<P>
 Drayton is third on the Rams in receptions with 30 for 260 yards but leads the 
team with six touchdown catches.  
</P>
<P>
 "This makes it all worthwhile," he said. "Even though I didn't have the 
numbers I wanted, it showed that some of the guys (players and coaches) thought 
pretty highly of me. I'm pretty happy, and I can't complain." 
</P>
<P>
 As an alternate, Drayton will go to the Feb. 5 game in Honolulu only if Jones 
or Novacek decides not to play. 
</P>

 Jackie Slater, despite elbow and rib injuries, will get some work at right 
tackle in goal-line and short-yardage situations, as well as some on regular 
downs Sunday at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might even run back a few punts," he said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Darryl Henley (groin) returned to practice and is expected to start 
against the Bears. . . . Defensive tackle Jimmie Jones (right ankle) also 
returned to practice. . . . Linebacker Chris Martin, quarterback Jamie Martin, 
defensive end Jay Williams and tight end Rickey Brady will be inactive. MIKE

AMAT'S MCCUTCHEON HONORED; PREP FOOTBALL: VERSATILE PLAYER NAMED WINNER OF THE 
GLENN DAVIS AWARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It did not matter whether Daylon McCutcheon was playing on defense, offense or 
special teams. Whenever he was on the football field, good things usually 
happened for La Puente Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual task of selecting the top high school player in Southern California 
was made easy this year by McCutcheon's exceptional versatility. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he was presented the Glenn Davis Award earlier this week. The 
award is given each year by The Times in honor of the 1946 Heisman Trophy 
winner who attended Army and Bonita High in La Verne. Davis is retired and 
living in Palm Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there were other candidates, including defensive lineman Kory Minor 
of Bishop Amat and quarterback Kevin Feterik of Los Alamitos, none matched 
McCutcheon's credentials.  
</P>
<P>
 As a three-year starter, McCutcheon excelled at several positions, including 
safety, cornerback, kickoff and punt return specialist and wide receiver. When 
Tom Salter replaced Mark Paredes as coach this season, one of his first acts 
was moving McCutcheon to running back. The senior responded by rushing for 
2,450 yards and 28 touchdowns -- school records -- despite facing one of the 
area's toughest schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 McCutcheon, 5 feet 10, 175 pounds, showed his speed last Saturday night in the 
Southern Section Division I championship against Santa Ana Mater Dei. On his 
second carry, he broke loose for an 84-yard touchdown run before 26,295 at 
Anaheim Stadium. Mater Dei won, 28-21, ending Bishop Amat's perfect season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a lot of things to feel proud about, but not winning a CIF title 
certainly hurts," McCutcheon said. "It makes me feel like I didn't come up with 
that big play we needed. As a team leader, it's my responsibility to make those 
big plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is not large, his speed and moves have impressed college 
recruiters. He is visiting Michigan this weekend and has trips planned for USC, 
Washington, Colorado and Nebraska next month. National signing day is Feb. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 McCutcheon, 18, enjoyed running this season but projects himself as a college 
defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, I like defense better and think my size is better suited to 
it," he said. "That's not to say I'm ruling out running back or wide receiver, 
but it's just a preference at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Lawrence McCutcheon, was a star back for Colorado State and the 
Rams. Daylon's parents never married, and he was raised by his mother, Debbie 
Sterling. Until the last two years, Daylon did not know his famous father. But 
that has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father came to quite a few of my games this season and has offered some 
great advice," Daylon said. "Every kid wants to know his father, and this has 
been a very special relationship for me." 
</P>
<P>

BASEBALL; FEHR: AGREEMENT WON'T BE EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Donald Fehr, executive director of the baseball players' union, sent a memo to 
the membership Friday stressing that a settlement will not come easily when 
bargaining negotiations resume Monday in Washington and that the union will 
definitely challenge a unilateral implementation of the salary cap by the 
owners.  
</P>
<P>
 The owners voted in Chicago on Thursday to declare an impasse and implement 
the cap if an agreement is not reached by Thursday midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "While it is a positive sign that the owners want to continue talking, it will 
not be easy to reach an agreement," Fehr said in the memo to players and 
agents. "If there is no breakthrough, we expect the owners to impose the cap on 
the 23rd. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not agree that the negotiations are at impasse, or that the owners can 
legally impose the cap." 
</P>
<P>
 It was also learned that the owners received a financial report Thursday that 
showed the 28 clubs had debts totaling $600 million, including about $125 
million with the central line of credit. "Those are by far the largest numbers 
we've ever had in baseball," one owner said. ROSS NEWHAN

NBA ROUNDUP; IMPROVED PLAY SPEAKS FOR RIDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Isaiah Rider has had a lot to say this week. What he said with his play Friday 
night was much more meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
 Rider, who held a news conference Monday to respond to criticism from Coach 
Bill Blair about his lack of leadership, capped a 27-point outing by completing 
a three-point play with two seconds remaining, giving the Minnesota 
Timberwolves a 94-93 victory over the New Jersey Nets at Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory ended the Timberwolves' 14-game home losing streak, which dated to 
last season and matched the fourth-longest in NBA history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know all eyes are on me, and everybody's waiting to see what I'm going to 
do, so it's up to me to respond," Rider said. "It's kind of motivating me to 
step up my numbers, step up my play and exert myself." 
</P>
<P>
 With the Nets leading, 93-91, Rider took an inbound pass from Doug West and 
drove through the lane, making a twisting layup while being fouled by Derrick 
Coleman. The ensuing free throw ticked the front rim before settling into the 
basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston Garland stripped the ball from Coleman as time expired, clinching the 
Timberwolves' first home victory since April 6. They had been 0-10 at Target 
Center this season. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three games since Blair's criticism, Rider has averaged 24.3 points and 
led the Timberwolves in scoring each time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 106, New York 85 -- Danny Manning scored 17 of his 24 points in a 
37-point third quarter as the Suns shook off a cold-shooting first half and 
rolled over the turnover-prone Knicks at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Barkley made all five of his second-half shots and had 26 points, 12 
rebounds and three steals when he left the game with 8:19 to play and the Suns 
leading, 89-59. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 93, Charlotte 91 -- Reggie Miller scored 22 points and made two free 
throws with six seconds to play, giving the Pacers the victory at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Johnson, who led the Hornets with 22 points, tied the score at 91-91 
with a pair of free throws at the one-minute mark. An offensive foul by Dale 
Davis gave Charlotte the ball, but an attempted layup by Muggsy Bogues with 
nine seconds to play was blocked by Davis and Rik Smits. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's free throws put the Pacers in front, and a three-point shot at the 
buzzer by Dell Curry of the Hornets rattled off the rim. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 84, Philadelphia 80 -- Terrell Brandon scored 15 points, among them 
two crucial free throws with 16 seconds to play, as the Cavaliers held on at 
Philadelphia for their fifth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Price of the Cavaliers, who has had recent back spasms and did not play 
in Wednesday night's victory over the Nets, was kicked in the back during a 
melee under the Cavaliers' basket with 3:19 to play and left the game with 14 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 85, Atlanta 80 -- Scottie Pippen scored 22 points and B.J. Armstrong 
made two key 15-foot shots for the Bulls in the final 3:46 at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss ended the Hawks' three-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 131, Golden State 128 -- Shaquille O'Neal had 40 points and 18 
rebounds and Anfernee Hardaway had a career-high 38 points and 13 assists for 
the Magic in an overtime victory at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State, which has lost its last nine games, outscored the Magic, 15-5, 
in the final 3 1/2 minutes of the fourth quarter to tie the score at 121-121.

JOCKEYS ARE THREATENING A STRIKE ON JAN. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Contract negotiations between the Jockeys' Guild and the Thoroughbred Racing 
Assns. tracks were at a standstill after a three-hour session in New York 
Friday, leaving open the possibility that many of the country's jockeys won't 
ride at Santa Anita or other tracks on Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 A week-old proposal from the tracks regarding jockeys' accident and health 
insurance was not accepted by the guild.Apparently the only movement by the 
tracks was to extend their deadline, which had been Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've extended the discussions into next week, but we still need (an 
agreement) well ahead of the end of the year," said Brian McGrath, commissioner 
of the TRA. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath and John Giovanni, national manager of the Jockeys' Guild, said that 
another meeting is not scheduled, but they have agreed to talk by phone on 
Tuesday. The current three-year contract expires on Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wording (on the jockeys' television rights) is still a big obstacle," 
Giovanni said. "And the dollars the tracks are spending annually on premiums 
($1.7 million) are the same as the current contract. That left the guild to pay 
an $800,000 deficit in 1993. The tracks are not optimistic about the idea of 
running an extra race at each track each year, with the proceeds going toward 
insurance. The money offer on the table would bleed us the next three years if 
we agreed to it." 
</P>
<P>
 The tracks' proposal was said to be "final," and McGrath indicated Friday that 
it still is.

 "This is our best offer, and I'm still hopeful," McGrath said. "We've doubled 
the coverages, and in this economic environment, that's doing something. The 
jockeys are sincere, but they have to face the fact that there's not a big 
potful of money out there in racing -- for them or anybody."

LOS ALAMITOS; DOWN WITH DEBT HAS CHANCE TO BE CHAMPION 
</P>

<P>
 Los Alamitos saved the best for last, as 10 stakes races, including the 
$200,000 Champion of Champions, are scheduled for tonight, the final program of 
the 141-day quarter horse meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading the field for the Champion of Champions, tonight's 10th race, is the 
leading contender for world champion honors, Down With Debt.A victory would 
leave the 4-year-old mare undefeated for the year and end Refrigerator's 
two-year world champion reign. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by George Haddad and trained by Charlie Bloomquist, Down With Debt will 
face a tough field that includes Refrigerator, Brotherly, Femmes Frolic, 
Specially Fast, I Hear A Symphony, Sound Dash, Childish, Sheza First Down and 
Seals. 
</P>
<P>
 Seals, who finished in a dead heat for third in the Z. Wayne Griffin Directors 
Trial, was allowed to enter the Champion of Champions after Avison was 
scratched. The Connie Hall-trained Avison appeared in distress in his last 
start Nov. 11, when he unseated rider Joe Badilla, Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's 15-race program also includes six Quarter Horse Breeders Classics 
races, two overnight handicaps for quarter horses and one Arabian stake race.

BOYS' BASKETBALL NORTH HOLLYWOOD TOURNAMENT; CHATSWORTH UPENDS NORTH HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Chatsworth center Eddie Miller said he was praying during the Chancellors' 
championship game against North Hollywood in the North Hollywood tournament on 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-8 Miller was getting close shots, but missing almost everything. So 
while running up and down court, grabbing rebounds and setting picks, 
Chatsworth's big man was privately pleading for some divine intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 His prayers were answered. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller made a lay-up with two seconds left to lift the Chancellors to a 57-56 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was begging," said Miller, who scored six of his eight points in the final 
minute and 19 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth led by as many as eight points until the final 3:30. Terry 
Smith-Harris gave North Hollywood a 52-51 lead when he made a three-foot 
jumper. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood's Lonzo Cotton made two free throws with 2:01 left to make it 
a three-point Husky lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But with 1:19 left, Miller was fouled and went to the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies must have felt they had fouled the right guy. Miller had only two 
points. In the third quarter, he missed three jump shots inside the key, blew a 
layup and had another shot blocked by sophomore Shannon Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just thought to myself, 'Please, just let me get a free throw,' " said 
Miller, who had 10 rebounds. "The last two games, I've been in a slump. The 
shots are there, but they just don't go in." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller made both free throws to cut the Husky lead to 54-53. Then, after 
Jeffrey Carpenter missed the front end of a one-and-one, Miller made a short 
turn-around jumper to give Chatsworth the lead with 34 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Huskies weren't finished. With 11 seconds left, Smith-Harris put in a 
rebound off a jump shot by Arthur Lee to give North Hollywood a 56-55 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Time out, Chatsworth. Get the ball to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth (5-1) in-bounded, broke the Huskies' half-court trap and got the 
ball to Tariq Hill in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood's Johnson, flanking Miller under the basket, was the only 
defender. Hill could have taken a jump shot from the corner or drove the base 
line. But when Johnson broke toward Hill, Hill passed to Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson deflected the pass, but not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Johnson) tipped it to me," Miller said. "I thank him for the assist. This is 
a real big win for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee finished with 21 points and nine rebounds, and Johnson had nine points and 
12 rebounds for North Hollywood. Smith-Harris, who thought he had the 
game-winner, finished with 14 points, 14 rebounds and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played a good game," Smith-Harris said. "It was a battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Joseph had 19 points and Hill 12 for Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood (5-3) was playing without 6-6 forward Michael Delano for the 
second night in a row. Delano, who had 24 points against Granada Hills in the 
tournament opener, has been suspended from the team indefinitely, Coach Steve 
Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have to learn how to play without that guy," Miller said. "And I 
think we did some nice things tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Monroe 78, Banning 68 -- Shaka Stiner had 27 points, Tim Johnson added 18, and 
Quincy Brooks contributed 13 and seven assists for Monroe (5-3) in the 
third-place game.

BOYS' BASKETBALL / CRESCENTA VALLEY TOURNAMENT; WILLIS MAKES A NAME FOR 
CRESCENTA VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The guy named Jacobsen doesn't always lead the way for the Crescenta Valley 
High basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the guy named Jacobson. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, it's a guy named Willis. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that was the case Friday night when junior guard Jake Willis scored 
18 points to lead the Falcons to a 76-62 victory over Bellflower in the 
championship game of the Crescenta Valley tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 And Willis is not to be confused with brother Josh, a former Falcon player and 
the team's leading scorer as a senior in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it can be difficult to tell who is pouring in the points for Crescenta 
Valley without a score card. But the Falcons, ranked ninth overall in the state 
at the start of the season, keep winning. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory improved Crescenta Valley, ranked No. 1 in The Times' regional 
poll, to 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can come from five spots," Crescenta Valley Coach John Goffredo said. 
"Which is good. Stop one guy and we can go to another." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was never close, just interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Brock Jacobsen, a senior forward who has signed to attend San Diego, finished 
with 18 points to tie Willis for game-high honors and earn tournament most 
valuable player honors. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Jacobsen, who scored 12 points as Crescenta Valley jumped to a 25-16 
lead, spent most of the second and third quarters on the bench in foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Willis came in. He connected on four three-pointers, two in the 
third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jake really stepped up when we needed him," Goffredo said. " 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobsen, who led the tournament with 103 points in four games, has led the 
Falcons in scoring in all but one game this season. He is not accustomed to 
watching from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of tough to sit there for the whole third quarter," Jacobsen said. 
"But we have tons of talent on this team. Sometimes we show signs of 
brilliance." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior center Blake Jacobson, who has signed to attend Navy, chipped in with 
13 points, coming through with eight in a second quarter in which the Falcons 
extended their lead to 45-31. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, Jacobson and Willis, whose brother watched from the stands, 
were selected to the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Vanik Abedstephan scored 12 points, including a pair of 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Crescenta Valley tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin 68, Poly 60 -- Senior forward Johnny Sanders scored a tournament-high 
36 points to lead Franklin to third place. Senior guard Albert Torres added 13 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Jaime Cerna scored nine points for Poly and was selected to the 
all-tournament team. Senior forward Juan Lopez led the Parrots with 16 points 
and senior guard Polo Gonzalez added 15. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel 63, Quartz Hill 57 -- San Gabriel opened a 10-point lead with a 
20-point second quarter and hung on to take fifth place. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior guard Alex Canizal scored 11 of his team-high 20 points in the second 
quarter, including a pair of three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill was led by senior Aaron Brown, who scored 21 points, including 15 
in the second half. Junior guard Brad Hazard added 18 points and junior guard 
Robert Beeson added eight points.  
</P>
<P>
 Blair 64, Reseda 59 -- Junior guard Kisembe Wise led Blair to seventh place by 
scoring 16 of his 17 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Akua Floyd scored 21 points to lead Reseda. Floyd scored 10 in the 
first quarter.

MEN'S BASKETBALL / GLENDALE TOURNAMENT; GLENDALE REACHES FINAL, 74-60 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't pretty or remotely smooth but it took care of business and that's 
what mattered most to Glendale College men's basketball Coach Brian Beauchemin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros, despite committing 20 turnovers, still had enough to defeat 
Harbor, 74-60, in a semifinal game of the Glendale tournament Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, Glendale (8-2) advanced to the championship game against 
Chaffey tonight at 7:30. The Panthers defeated Santa Barbara, 91-83, in the 
other semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't played for a while," Beauchemin said. "Maybe that was part of (the 
problem)." 
</P>
<P>
 The last game for the Vaqueros before Friday was Dec. 9 when they lost to 
Trade Tech, 90-88. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoff might have affected Glendale, but the Vaqueros still managed to 
basically put the game away early in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros took advantage of poor shooting by Harbor (3-10) to lead by as 
many as 21 points in the first half, even though Beauchemin thought they could 
have performed better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were anxious," Beauchemin said. "We didn't make the extra pass. . . . We 
have to make every possession a good possession." 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor Coach Gary Cain, in his first season with the team, saw it somewhat 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a game plan to come out and control the tempo but the first five 
minutes we made one pass and put up the shot," he said. "We don't have the 
ability to get into a racehorse-type game (with opponents)." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale opened the game with a 21-7 run behind wing Charles Garcia, who 
accounted for nine points in that span. Garcia, a sophomore from Eagle Rock 
High, scored 13 of his game-high 27 points in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks made only six of 29 shots in the half (20.7%) and failed to score 
during stretches of four or more minutes several times. They also committed 14 
of their 23 turnovers before the half. 
</P>
<P>
 There were as many verbal salvos flying around the floor from both sides as 
shot attempts and the officials called two technical fouls on Harbor's Terrell 
Moore and one on Glendale guard Maurice Sowells. 
</P>
<P>
 Once tempers calmed in the second half, Harbor made a run at Glendale, cutting 
the Vaquero lead to 61-49 with 8 minutes 41 seconds left.  
</P>
<P>
 But Glendale pulled away on a 9-3 run sparked by Garcia's five points and four 
by guard Eric Scott, the last two on a dunk after stealing a pass and going the 
length of the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks hit another dry spell late in the game, scoring only two points 
in a six-minute span before a pair of three-point baskets by Eric Wright and 
Tyrone Jackman. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott finished with 18 points and Sowells had 13 and seven rebounds. Garcia 
led all rebounders with eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackman led Harbor with 20 points and Wright finished with 14. Vito Maciel 
added 12.

MCCARTHY TAKES OVER AT MOORPARK 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Remy McCarthy, who coached the Oxnard College men's basketball team for five 
seasons, has been named interim women's coach at Moorpark, Raider Athletic 
Director John Keever said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy replaced Lisa Ziegler, who resigned for personal reasons on Dec. 6 
after Moorpark defeated Antelope Valley, 59-33, in a nonconference game.The 
Raiders were 1-8 this season under Ziegler and 23-42 since she took over the 
program in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, who have not played since Ziegler resigned, will resume action 
with McCarthy as coach today in a Western State Conference game at Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited," McCarthy said. "It gives me a chance to get back into coaching. 
I'm 38 years old and think I still have a lot of coaching left in me." 
</P>
<P>
 At Oxnard, McCarthy was 85-68 from 1988-93. His final season at Oxnard was 
filled with controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 With three games left in the season, McCarthy dismissed freshman forward Steve 
Amar from the team after Amar questioned his punishment for being late to a 
practice. Sophomore center Art Wallace quit the team because he felt McCarthy 
treated Amar unfairly. Amar played at Ventura last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard was expected to challenge perennial power Ventura for the Western State 
Conference North Division in McCarthy's last season but finished fourth with a 
2-6 record, 16-14 overall. McCarthy's best season at Oxnard was his first, when 
the Condors finished 19-12. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy worked four seasons as a men's assistant at Utah before serving as 
head coach at Wenatchee (Wash.) Valley College for the 1987-88 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's back at Moorpark, where he assisted men's Coach Al Nordquist from 
1979-83 and also coached the women's softball team from 1981-83.

CROSSING OVER; THREE-TIME ALL-PRO LINEMAN IS A HIT IN BROADCAST BOOTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ARKUSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Randy Cross, 1982 began with "the Catch," the Joe Montana-to-Dwight Clark 
touchdown pass that turned the San Francisco 49ers into America's new team. 
But, for his life after football, something more important happened to the 
former Crespi High offensive lineman that year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Break. 
</P>
<P>
 He broke a leg at an amusement park in Redwood City. And found a career. 
</P>
<P>
 While recuperating, Cross broadcast a few minutes of sports each morning on a 
Bay Area radio station. Once back on the field, he hosted a Monday night radio 
talk show, adding a Saturday television show the next season. He sent tapes to 
the networks, and, in 1989, when he left the game, Cross went straight into the 
CBS booth. He had paid close attention to guidance counselor Bill Walsh. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always explained how temporary sports really is," said Cross, who lives in 
an Atlanta suburb. "It isn't your life's work." 
</P>
<P>
 Cross, 40, is wrapping up his sixth season of commentary, his first with NBC. 
On Sunday, he will team with play-by-play veteran Charlie Jones on the pivotal 
matchup between the Cleveland Browns and Pittsburgh Steelers, broadcast locally 
at 1 p.m. on Channel 4. Now this is his life's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm having as much fun doing this as I did playing football," Cross said. 
"I'm doing something less then 20 people in the whole world do." 
</P>
<P>
 Broadcasting makes perfect sense for Cross. He must perform in front of the 
camera on a weekly basis, much like his late father, Dennis, a television and 
film actor who played the good guy in Westerns. Young Randy often came home 
from school to see daddy gunned down by the bad guys. "I grew up watching him 
die on TV," Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross doesn't want the same thing to happen to him. He pours over game films 
each week. He develops sources throughout the league. Live television doesn't 
allow the luxury of second takes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people will look at just one game, but Randy will look at the last 
three or four games," Jones said. "He's very prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Football, however, is not a science. Each game assumes a unique character that 
often bears no relation to patterns and trends. "The game has to come to us," 
Cross said. "You might not use most of the stuff you had prepared, but in the 
end, what matters is how we covered the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is quite well, according to Jones. "He'll suggest isolates and replays 
on the right people," Jones said. "He knows the tendencies very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody taught Cross how to announce. That doesn't happen in this business. The 
network puts you in a lifeboat to see if you can swim. If you sink, there's 
always another former offensive lineman who needs a job. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardest part of announcing isn't dealing with the players. It's dealing 
with the producers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to deliver a coherent thought while a producer is talking in your 
ear," Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, his years with the 49ers gives him a feel for the game they don't 
teach you in broadcasting school. The fact that he played with winners and 
losers -- the 49ers were 2-14 in 1978 and 1979 -- makes it easier for him to 
spot the differences in the teams he covers. Look at their faces, Cross said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can see if everyone is giving up some piece of themselves," he said. 
"That's what winners do." 
</P>
<P>
 Cross is also very familiar with the game's mental and physical toll, 
especially on players going downhill. Football is brutal that way. One day, 
"you're the man," he says, the invincible star who owns the city. The next day, 
"somebody else is the man," and "they push you off the edge of the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "Empathy is a very important thing in what I do," Cross said. "You have to 
relate to the guys on the crummy teams, to the second and third-stringers." 
</P>
<P>
 Cross was lucky. He didn't have to be pushed out of the game. He jumped. He 
was 34. He quit near the prime of his career, announcing his retirement just 
days before he played in the 49ers' Super Bowl victory over the Cincinnati 
Bengals in January, 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, the 49er coach, tried to talk him out of it, but Cross would settle for 
playing at nothing below his Pro Bowl standards.  
</P>
<P>
 Cross made the Pro Bowl three times. "Because I left on my own terms, it was 
so much easier to deal with the entire process of leaving it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has missed playing only twice. The first time, the 49ers were playing the 
Minnesota Vikings in a 1990 playoff game and Cross knew "I could be here." 
</P>
<P>
 The second time, a few weeks later, was more traumatic. The 49ers had just 
routed the Denver Broncos to win a fourth Super Bowl, and Cross was 
interviewing running back Roger Craig. "You should've had this, too," Craig 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks, Roger, just what he needed to hear. "I just missed the fourth Super 
Bowl ring," Cross realized. 
</P>
<P>
 That was it. Since then, he hasn't looked back.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a real believer in that the best time is now," he said. "Memories are 
fantastic, but I'd hate to think that when I'm 65, that the highlight of my 
life would be something I did 40 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Cross doesn't want to restrict himself to pro football. This year, the former 
UCLA star covered two games at Notre Dame. The unfortunate part was that his 
father wasn't around to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got to see me from Little League to the Super Bowl," Cross said, "but it 
was hard not to think about my father when I was in South Bend. He was a 
fantastic Notre Dame fan." 
</P>
<P>
 Cross will cover the Irish in the Fiesta Bowl against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does Cross want to restrict himself to football. He already has covered 
wrestling and skiing events, and his NBC contract calls for him to do some 
Olympic coverage in his new home, Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Cross moved his family there from Northern California two years ago. He found 
a gated community bordering a Jack Nicklaus golf course in Alpharetta, about 25 
miles north of Atlanta.  
</P>
<P>
 "It reminds me a lot of the Valley when I grew up," said Cross, who lived in 
Pacoima and Tarzana. "That's when Porter Ranch was a ranch, Chatsworth was a 
park, and Calabasas was a stagecoach stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked half a block to grammar school, and my kids get on a bus, walk a 
block, and they're at grammar school. It's like the kids are in Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, just as he pursued perfection on the line of scrimmage, Cross is after 
the same goal on the line of communication. He wants to be the commentator on 
NBC's No. 1 team, a job held by Bob Trumpy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard for him to tell how he's doing because the results aren't nearly as 
tangible. On the field, he always knew if he kept Lawrence Taylor from getting 
to the quarterback. In the booth, nobody keeps official score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends and family will always tell you you did great," Cross said, "but how 
do you know?"

VAN NUYS' ASMAN RESIGNS FROM POSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Frank Asman, longtime track and cross-country coach at Van Nuys High, has 
resigned and will retire from coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Asman, the track and field coach since 1963 and cross-country coach since 
1967, informed school administrators of his decision Thursday.He will continue 
as chairman of the physical education department before making a decision about 
his teaching future at the end of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time just seemed right for a change," he said. "I'm kind of feeling that 
it's time to let someone younger than me come in and take over. I've also got 
other interests that I want to pursue." 
</P>
<P>
 Asman, 64, said that working with distance runner Gerardo Canchola and 
hurdler-jumper Kelley Peacock were two of his most fond memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Canchola was runner-up in the 1973 City Section cross-country championships 
and won the two-mile race in the 1974 City track championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Peacock won five individual City titles, including the girls' 100- and 
300-meter low hurdles, and long jump in 1986 to lead Van Nuys to a second-place 
finish. JOHN ORTEGA

BOYS' BASKETBALL / LA CANADA TOURNAMENT; CADY'S REUNION PARTY IS A REAL BASH, 
71-43 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BRESNAHAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deep down, Coach Mick Cady had no desire to play Notre Dame High, his former 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 He thought it was too theatrical, too much drama. He didn't like the pressure 
it put on his San Fernando players. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was the frightening thought of . . . the final score. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Cady, there was very little drama, save for his team's early 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the final score was indeed scary as Notre Dame blew out the Tigers, 71-43, 
in the first round of the La Canada tournament Friday night at La Canada High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights play Bishop Montgomery in the second round tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're like little babies. We're infants," said Cady, who led Notre Dame to 
the 1993 Southern Section Division III-A title, but has since relocated to San 
Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a long to go and it's going to take some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame (5-1) found itself trailing San Fernando, 12-7, midway through the 
first quarter, but turned on a three-quarter court press and turned up the 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights led, 31-22, at halftime and put the game away in the third quarter 
by outscoring San Fernando, 18-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen players scored for Notre Dame, whose depth wore down the Tigers. Only 
three players had scored for San Fernando (2-3) heading into the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They kept coming at us in waves," Cady said, who held an impromptu reunion 
with Notre Dame players past and present in the parking lot following the game. 
</P>
<P>
 John Garcia scored 11 points for the Knights. Jared Coller and David Sobel 
each added nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Trinidad had 15 points for San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In other first-round games: 
</P>
<P>
 St. Francis 84, Hoover 57 -- Ted Steben scored 22 points, including five 
three-point baskets, to lead the Golden Knights. 
</P>
<P>
 James Alvarez and Mihail Papadopulous each added 16 points for St. Francis 
(4-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Clarke scored 28 points for Hoover (1-6). 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell Hall 62, East Bakersfield 54 -- Treaven Davis scored 21 points for 
Campbell Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Appel and Demetrius Ingram each added 12 points for the Vikings (4-3). 
</P>
<P>
 La Canada 100, Fortune (Canada) 32 -- Charlie Petit scored 27 points and Scott 
Riddell added 16 for La Canada (4-3), which at one stage led by 72 points.

AYLSWORTH PICKS UP THE SLACK FOR WESTLAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With three of Westlake's starters on the bench or in other states, and the 
Warriors trailing Royal by 12 points in the middle of the second quarter, 
things looked bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 But fortunately for Westlake, Steve Aylsworth was one of the two on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Aylsworth, a junior, scored 17 of his 19 points in the second half and had 
seven assists to lead the Warriors to an 82-64 victory in a Marmonte League 
basketball game Friday night at Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 Aylsworth's performance was painfully familiar to Royal Coach Larry Wiksell. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's unstoppable," Wiksell said. "Marques (Pena) did a great job of 
containing him, but you can only contain him for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Aylsworth was instrumental in a 24-7 run that started late in the third 
quarter and extended into the fourth. It took the the game from Royal's hands 
and put it firmly into the grip of Westlake (5-1, 2-0 in league play). 
</P>
<P>
 Aylsworth scored 13 points during the stretch, including three consecutive 
three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hit a few shots and then he got that twinkle in his eye," Westlake Coach 
Gary Grayson said. "And when that happens the other team better look out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors needed every bit of Aylsworth's production because starters Billy 
Miller and Eric Guenther were out of town on football recruiting visits, and 
Nick Alexander missed much of the second half because he had four fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we got in foul trouble, I thought we were in deep trouble," Aylsworth 
said. "But out team just came out with a great team effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake's Matt Smiley scored 22 points and Nasir Shakouri added 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Hambly scored 14 points for Royal (7-2, 1-1). But Hambly fouled out with 
2 minutes 3 seconds to play in the third quarter. The Highlanders committed 
eight of their 18 turnovers in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal is off to its best start ever, but Wiksell attributed part of the 
Highlanders' problems Friday night to an attitude that permeated the program in 
the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of these kids have been a part of a basketball team that feels like it 
can win," Wiksell said. "Last year we didn't win our second game until after 
Christmas. And when (Westlake) got on a run, we might have gotten a little 
nervous." 
</P>
<P>
 Royal also was playing without two key players, Jermaine Smith and Jerome Lee, 
who were on football recruiting trips. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Highlanders dominated inside and led the entire first half, taking 
leads of as many as 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake took its first lead, 46-44, with 4:13 left in the third quarter on a 
three-point basket by Smiley. The Warriors led the rest of the way.

HART MAKING PLANS FOR A HAWAII TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Hart High football team, which advanced to the Southern Section Division 
II championship game last weekend, is expected to open the 1995 season with a 
nonleague game in Hawaii, Coach Mike Herrington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrington said he is "99% sure" the team will open against St. Louis High, a 
parochial school in Honolulu.Final word is expected in January, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart's Santa Clarita rival Canyon defeated St. Louis in Hawaii in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, which finished the 1994 season 13-1 and was ranked 13th in the state by 
Cal-Hi Sports, has several key players returning next fall, including 
quarterback Steve McKeon, who led California passers with 2,931 yards. Running 
back Ted Iacenda, who finished fourth in the state with 41 touchdowns, also 
returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart also has an open date during the weekend of Oct. 14-15 and attempted to 
schedule a game against national power Concord De La Salle, which finished the 
season 13-0 and was ranked No. 1 in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrington said the deal fell through when De La Salle officials declined to 
play the game at Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have one road trip (to Hawaii) lined up," Herrington said. "No way 
we can make another one. It would have been appealing, except for the Hawaii 
situation." STEVE ELLING

TRUTH BE TOLD, THOMPSON'S GOALS HELP LA REINA REMAIN UNDEFEATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forgive La Reina High's Aimee Thompson, for she cannot tell a lie. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, a freshman forward, had a confession to make moments after the 
Regents tied Southern Section Division IV rival Santa Clara, 2-2, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It kind of went in off my head . . . and then off my hand," she said, 
referring to her second goal of the game, which gave La Reina a 2-1 lead midway 
through the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Regents (5-0-1) allowed Santa Clara (2-0-2) to control the game for long 
stretches, but seized the momentum long enough to earn the draw. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were fortunate to tie," said La Reina Coach Joe Laraneta. "Sometimes being 
5-0 gets to you and young minds wander. They beat us to the ball all game and 
had a couple of chances to win it." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara tied the game not 10 minutes after Thompson's second goal, but 
might have won had several shots not bounced off the posts and crossbar 
throughout the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came out slow and we didn't get our touches down," said Thompson, who has 
scored eight goals in six games. "It was like we were rusty." 
</P>
<P>
 After Santa Clara's Cande Ruiz scored the game's first goal on a shot from 
more than 40 yards, Thompson took a short pass from teammate Samantha Conroy on 
a free kick and put a low shot into the left side of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Her second score came 24 minutes into the second half when she jumped out of a 
crowd in front of the Santa Clara goal and directed Conroy's corner kick from 
the right side past Saints' goalie Analiese White. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara's Lisa Seyl tied the game with seven minutes remaining.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE MEN'S BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; MULLIGAN NOT IMPRESSED WITH TEAM'S 
VICTORY 
</P>

 Irvine Valley almost got it perfect Friday night. The Lasers certainly 
scheduled the right opponent to open their new gymnasium. They also attracted a 
good crowd and sent the fans home happy. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not a night to remember, however, for Coach Bill Mulligan. Irvine 
defeated Palomar, 82-60, in a nonconference game at Hart Gymnasium but played 
far too poorly to impress Mulligan. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley played well in spurts, but with better execution could have won 
by far more than 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Palomar (2-10) played a slow-paced game, often running the 35-second shot 
clock to less than 10 seconds before shooting. Irvine Valley (9-5) had a tough 
time settling into its preferred up-tempo game. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley also attempted to force the ball into the hands of Keon Clark 
too often to please Mulligan. Clark, a 6-foot-11 center, overcame Palomar's 
collapsing zone and a sore ankle to score 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a lot of work to do," Mulligan said of Clark, who hadn't played for 
three weeks because of an injured ankle. "(But) he's got as much talent as 
anybody I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark scored nine of his 15 points in a two-minute span early in the second 
half, helping push Irvine Valley to a 48-25 lead with 14:46 left to play. The 
Lasers biggest lead was 28 points late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very sloppy game," Mulligan said. "We haven't had the big guy for so 
long. We (the coaching staff) told them to dump it in (to Clark) too much. 
We've got some guys who can shoot outside." 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Porter and Jeremy Garrett each scored 12 points for Irvine Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Quinn had 13 points for Palomar. 
</P>
<P>
 Official dedication ceremonies to open the new gym won't be conducted until 
Feb. 8, but Mulligan is happy the Lasers finally have a home to call their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday, they had played and practiced at Capistrano Valley and Laguna 
Hills high schools, often in the evening after those schools' teams had 
finished. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Cypress tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach 73, Golden West 67 -- Pete Sverkos of Long Beach scored 25 of his 
28 points in the second half to help Long Beach rally in one semifinal. Golden 
West led, 36-27, at the half and led until Sverkos made a three-pointer with 
6:49 to put the Vikings (13-3) ahead, 61-59. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West's Michael Dean scored with nine seconds left to cut the Long Beach 
lead to, 69-67, but the Rustlers never got closer.  
</P>
<P>
 Cypress 89, El Camino 83 -- Gil Gonzales (23 points) made six free throws in 
the final 37 seconds to keep Cypress (11-4) ahead. The Chargers play Santa 
Monica for the consolation championship today at 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 In the consolation round of the Pasadena tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 67, Rio Hondo 51 -- Fullerton (8-7) moved into the consolation 
final. Marcus Austin scored 21 and Jason Cunningham had 19 for Fullerton, which 
plays Rancho Santiago today at 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago 80, East LA 60 -- Nick Holt scored a career-high 29, making 10 
of 14 from the field for Rancho Santiago (9-3). His previous best came Thursday 
when he scored 28 in a 109-100 loss to Cuesta.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL LA QUINTA CLASSIC; ESPERANZA HANDLES OCEAN VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marc Hill, having coached Esperanza to a 10-point victory over Ocean View once 
this season, put Friday's La Quinta Classic championship game into perspective 
a few minutes before tipoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Hill figured it, the matchup boiled down to Esperanza's depth against 
Ocean View's two extremely talented players, Jennifer Tuiolosega and Becky 
Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill was right. Tuiolosega scored a game-high 28, and Fraser scored 21, but 
Esperanza had the more balanced scoring attack and defeated Ocean View, 71-63. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza (9-1), ranked No. 9 in The Times' preseason poll, won a game in 
which it got 15 points from its bench players, and Ocean View (5-5) got 14 from 
everyone other than Tuiolosega or Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
 Fouls played a major role in the outcome. Ocean View was whistled for 25 
fouls, and Esperanza called for 23. Ocean View's Heather Hill had three fouls 6 
1/2 minutes into the game, striking a blow to the Seahawks' hopes of avenging a 
78-68 loss to Esperanza in the third-place game of the Brea-Olinda Ladycat 
Classic a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Esperanza's) so athletic and physical," Ocean View Coach Ollie Martin said. 
"It's hard to play some of your (bench) players against them because they just 
can't match up physically against those kinds of athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heather's a physical, athletic player who can play with these players; when 
we lost Heather, we drop down in size and athleticism." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, 5 feet 9, sat out most of the second quarter and fouled out with 1:56 
left in the third; she was replaced by Jodie Umehira (5-2) and Tracy Beelner 
(5-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza, meanwhile, took advantage of its depth. 
</P>
<P>
 Monique Toney scored 14, Leah Combs 13, Kim Hayashi 12 and tournament most 
valuable player Lindsay Foss had 17 points and eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Foss was especially valuable in the fourth quarter, making five of seven shots 
and scoring 10 points against a Seahawk team that cut a 12-point lead to four, 
64-60, with 3 minutes 17 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a lot more confident when I have the ball at the end of the game this 
year," Foss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Marc Hill: "(Foss) wants the ball in pressure situations." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs also got seven points from Diane Severinsen and six from Theresa 
Gethins. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza held a 34-30 halftime lead and stretched it to 52-44 in the third 
quarter, helped by an eight-point quarter from Combs, a 6-foot freshman who 
finished with six rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In other tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills 39, Troy 33 -- Erika Tillman had 10 points and Sara Herkenhoff had 
five points and a school-record 20 rebounds for Dana Hills (3-5) in the 
third-place game. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago 42, La Quinta 26 -- Alejandra Torres had 16 points for Santiago in 
the seventh-place game. Santiago limited La Quinta to five points in the first 
half, taking a 20-5 lead.

BOYS' BASKETBALL TOURNAMENT OF CHAMPIONS; MATER DEI COMPLETES ROUT AFTER COTTON 
LOSES CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A run-of-the-mill Mater Dei rout turned a bit mean Friday night, with the 
flash point being the ejection of Monarch forward Schea Cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton berated and bumped an official in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lost among the elbows and shoves was the Monarchs' 77-46 victory in the 
Tournament of Champion semifinals at Ocean View High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without Cotton, the Monarchs (5-0) had more than enough to handle -- and 
even manhandle at times -- the Seahawks (6-4). Both sides got in as much 
contact as they could in the final 1 1/2 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played some physical games, but nothing like that," Monarch guard Kevin 
Augustine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei took control with a 16-0 run early in the second quarter to take a 
33-14 lead. It was as good as the Monarchs, and Cotton, have looked his season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton had 19 points by halftime, including two highlight reel dunks. The 
Seahawks had no one who could stop him or even slow him down. But that ceased 
to be a problem with 5 minutes 22 seconds left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton appeared to be checked hard by Ocean View's Erik Petersen. Cotton was 
knocked to the ground, but, instead of going after Petersen, he went after 
referee Mark Wexler. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun Jackson, Mater Dei center, stepped between the two and tried to restrain 
Cotton, who then bumped Wexler with his shoulder. Cotton was ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was ejected for the abusive language, not the contact," Wexler said. "I 
don't think the contact was intentional." 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was being handled by Rich Kollen, the head official assigner for 
Orange County. Kollen said Mater Dei officials would discipline Cotton and 
possibly hold him out for the first quarter of tonight's championship game 
against Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
 Speed Castillo, head of the officials association, said he will talk with 
Southern Section Commissioner Dean Crowley today to determine what action, if 
any, should be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Southern Section rules, a player who attacks an official can lose 
eligibility for his career. Both Wexler and Kollen said they did not believe 
the contact deserved that penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an unfortunate incident," Monarch Coach Gary McKnight said. "I'm going 
to have to review the tape. I'll have to get with school officials and then 
have a talk with Schea." 
</P>
<P>
 The intensity picked up after the incident. Both teams pushed and shoved their 
way to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just an Ocean View-Mater Dei game," Ocean View Coach Jim Harris said. 
"We respect each other so much that we go at it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gary had a young kid who lost it a little and I had a player who took a cheap 
shot and I sat him down." 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei extended its lead after Cotton's ejection. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson scored 15 points, making all seven of his shots. Clay McKnight, who 
was zero for three in the first half, made four three-pointers in the second 
half and finished with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View, which shot 34%, had no one to counter. 
</P>
<P>
 In other games: 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin 62, Los Angeles Westchester 53 -- David Lalazarian scored 28 points, 
making eight of 10 shots from the field and 11 of 17 free throws, for Tustin 
(8-1) in the other semifinal. He also had nine rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos 71, Los Angeles Manual Arts 67 -- Jeremy Vandervoet scored 23 
points and had 14 rebounds to lead Los Alamitos (7-2). Ali Ton had 14 points 
and nine assists for the Griffins. 
</P>
<P>
 Travis Reed scored 24 for Manual Arts (2-6).

THE TIMES 1994 FALL ALL-COUNTY TEAMS; TRITONS' GARDNER A 'CUT ABOVE' ATHLETE OF 
THE YEAR: SIX-FOOT-9 SENIOR GOALKEEPER RAISED SAN CLEMENTE'S DEFENSE TO A 
HIGHER LEVEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gabriel Gardner, San Clemente's 6-foot-9 goalkeeper, had no peers in the 
Southern Section this season. With Gardner putting up a nearly impenetrable 
defense -- he gave up only 4.2 goals per game -- San Clemente advanced to the 
Division I semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 At his best against the best, Gardner had 20 saves in a regular-season victory 
over eventual Division I champion Long Beach Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes being the most dominant defensive player in the pool wasn't 
enough for Gardner: He wanted to play the field. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente Coach Steve Yancey was accommodating; he allowed Gardner to play 
offense late in games the Tritons already had wrapped up and even let him start 
a game against a weaker opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish sometimes I could have played the field in big games, too," Gardner 
said. "I had so much energy that I felt like I could have turned a guy four 
times if I was setting hole." 
</P>
<P>
 He's probably right. Gardner scored 13 goals this season, including one in the 
final seconds of regulation against El Toro in the South Coast tournament. 
Gardner came out of the goal, looking to make a pass, but finding no one open, 
he winged a shot from mid-pool that skidded into the goal and sent the game 
into overtime. San Clemente went on to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his offensive productivity, Gardner, The Times Orange County player of 
the year, was much more valuable to the Tritons in the goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that a kid like this comes along for our program once in a lifetime," 
Yancey said. "He dominated the sport this year. He was a cut above. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were a decent defensive team, but Gabe made us a great defensive team." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a team that almost got to play for the championship. In the Division I 
semifinal, the Tritons and Wilson were tied, 6-6, late in the fourth quarter 
before Wilson scored a man-advantage goal with 1 minute 8 seconds left and 
added another in the waning seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a crushing loss, but Gardner said he didn't take it as hard as he did 
the semifinal loss that ended his junior year. Some teammates were crying, and 
Gardner said he felt a responsibility to leave a message with the younger 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just told them," Gardner said. " 'Every one of us went out there and gave 
it our all, and it didn't come our way. Remember how this hurts and use it next 
year.' I needed to be the leader and I wanted to show it was all right and that 
we should learn from it."

HOW OUTLAW CAPTURED 'SANTA'; MOVIES: THE LOW-KEY INDEPENDENT FILM COMPANY HAS 
ATTRACTED THE ATTENTION AND RESPECT OF HOLLYWOOD WITH ITS HIT 'THE SANTA 
CLAUSE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES MOVIE EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Outlaw Productions has one of the lowest profiles of any independent movie 
company in Hollywood. It has never been housed in a conventional office -- let 
alone on a studio lot. Its principals have never even hired a personal 
publicist, despite its having produced 10 movies over the past seven years, 
including 1989's art-house darling "sex, lies and videotape." 
</P>
<P>
 But low-key may be a thing of the past at Outlaw headquarters -- a spacious 
three-story house in the hills of Studio City -- where the phones are ringing 
more than they ever have and the fax machine adjacent to the kitchen is 
humming. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood's come calling at the company that produced this season's runaway 
hit, "The Santa Clause," starring Tim Allen. As of last weekend, the family 
comedy had grossed $96 million and is showing no signs of slowing down over the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone is congratulatory and then they want to talk about what business 
they can do with you. There have been a lot of phone calls . . . it's 
terrific," says Brian Reilly, who along with Outlaw owners Robert Newmyer and 
Jeff Silver produced the movie for Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having a great few weeks here! And we've certainly seen a higher volume 
of scripts than was the case before," says Newmyer. "We're reading into the 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 "And they're better scripts," adds Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like most of the projects they've brought to the big screen, the 
producers optioned the script to "The Santa Clause," written by first-time 
screenwriters and former stand-up comics Steve Rudnick and Leo Benvenuti, out 
of their own pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best $10,000 we ever spent," said Reilly, who was the on-set 
producer of the movie when it shot earlier this year on location in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa" is the first major studio hit for Outlaw, which -- with the exception 
of "sex, lies" (which cost $1.2 million and grossed around $25 million) -- has 
struggled with its share of duds, including "Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's 
Dead," "The Opposite Sex," "Crossing the Bridge," "Indian Summer," "Mr. 
Baseball" and "Wagons East." 
</P>
<P>
 But in June, 1992, Reilly received a phone call from an agent at Creative 
Artists Agency that would change Outlaw's luck. He pitched him the idea of 
"Santa Clause" on behalf of his clients, Rudnick and Benvenuti. 
</P>
<P>
 The Outlaw producers read the script and "within a few days, we had the 
writers in to meet with us because it was so fresh," says Reilly. "We then 
optioned the script with our own money," says Newmyer. Several drafts later the 
producers were ready to approach the studios for production money. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the "Santa" script had found its way into the hands of Tim Allen, 
star of the hit ABC sitcom "Home Improvement," through his personal managers. 
At the time, Jimmy Miller, who managed the screenwriters, was partnered with 
Allen's managers, Richard Baker and Rick Maccina. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller remembers that when he talked to his two partners about the script 
"they flipped and said it was the perfect movie for Tim." Miller, who's now in 
partnership with Eric Gold (their clients include Jim Carrey), serves as the 
executive producer on "Santa" along with Baker and Maccina. Baker said he 
immediately moved to give the script to Allen, but "he was too busy to read 
it." Allen, recalls Baker, did not read it until months later while vacationing 
in Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim finally read the script and got very excited about it," his manager said. 
"But Tim Allen was not Outlaw's first pick. They were hoping to attract actors 
like Tom Hanks and a director like Ron Howard." 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly readily admits that. 
</P>
<P>
 "They educated us about who he (Tim) was. They sent us tapes of his shows and 
we were really taken by him. We weren't looking to attach talent at the time. 
They (Allen's managers) came to us." But the producers said it didn't take much 
to convince them Allen was Santa. Allen himself contacted Jeffrey Katzenberg, 
then chairman of Disney Studios -- which produced "Home Improvement" and had 
aggressively been looking for just the right movie vehicle to launch the TV 
star's big-screen career -- to say he had found the project he wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg read the script on Thanksgiving Day, 1992, and "fell in love with 
it for Tim," says Newmyer, recounting how when he returned from the holiday 
weekend on Sunday "my answering machine was full of messages from (then 
Hollywood Pictures' president) Ricardo Mestres, (his senior vice president) 
Charles Hirschorn and Jeff Katzenberg." Each message, Newmyer says, "was more 
irate than the last: 'Where are you?' 'We want to buy this script!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly and Silver were brought in on the intense negotiations. Katzenberg 
insisted on immediately taking the script off the market, demanding that Outlaw 
close a deal by midnight that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jeff said, 'I'm not going to be interested in buying your script tomorrow!' " 
recalls Newmyer. And so a deal was closed. A Disney insider confirmed the 
studio paid around $500,000 for the script. Outlaw wanted it stipulated in the 
deal that Disney would put the movie on the fast track and make it early in 
1993 for release that Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 But a problem arose: "Tim couldn't make the movie that year because of some 
commitments to do stand-up," says Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg insisted the movie be put on hold for Allen, "because he saw him as 
the perfect guy for Santa Claus," says the producer, noting Outlaw agreed to 
wait. Cameras rolled on the $17-million film in April, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 After the picture wrapped, Katzenberg left Disney and his successor, Joe Roth, 
came in and gave the movie a major marketing push, reportedly spending more 
than $20 million in pre-opening costs, a huge amount both by Disney and 
industry standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlaw, which collects a producer's fee, may even wind up sharing in some of 
the movie's profits if it grosses as much as expected: more than $150 million 
in the United States and Canada alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a deal the company signed a year ago May with Warner Bros. and Fuji 
Television Network to finance movies as well as to pay for overhead and 
development, the Outlaw producers are guaranteed a bigger piece of profits if 
the films they make are successful. 
</P>
<P>
 The first film the company has produced under the deal is tentatively titled 
"Katie," a $14-million family movie about a 15-year-old boy and a captive 
gorilla, which Warners will release next year. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Outlaw's future plans? "We're looking for our next movie right now," 
says Newmyer.

GUESS WHAT DANGERFIELD CAN'T GET?; MOVIES: EVEN WITH SEVERAL FILM CREDITS AND 
TALK OF A POSSIBLE SUPPORTING ACTOR NOMINATION FOR 'NATURAL BORN KILLERS,' THE 
COMEDIAN IS DENIED MEMBERSHIP IN THE FILM ACADEMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Though he's been mentioned as a possible best supporting actor nominee for his 
work in Oliver Stone's "Natural Born Killers," Rodney Dangerfield still gets no 
respect. When he applied for membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts 
and Sciences, the comedian was turned down flat. 
</P>
<P>
 With major parts in at least three theatrical releases to his credit, 
Dangerfield meets the minimum criteria for consideration. But according to a 
letter signed by Roddy McDowall, chair of the Actors Branch Executive 
Committee, he still lacks "enough of the kind of roles that allow a performer 
to demonstrate the mastery of the craft." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is ridiculous -- especially since thousands of academy members haven't 
done any movies, to speak of," says Dangerfield, who was informed of the 
decision earlier this week. "People still quote lines from 'Caddyshack,' which 
I did in 1980. 'Back to School,' which I starred in, took in (nearly) $100 
million. And Oliver Stone -- who told me he loved my work -- cast me as the 
father from hell, a guy who molests his daughter. Maybe the character, which I 
wrote myself, was so distasteful that it turned the academy off. Certain people 
-- Roddy McDowall included -- sometimes let emotion overrule their 
intelligence." 
</P>
<P>
 "Natural Born Killers" was his first "dramatic" role, the 73-year-old 
Dangerfield admits. But previous comedic appearances in movies such as "Easy 
Money" (1983) and "Lady Bugs" (1992) also required him to "act." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not me up there," he insists. "Even as a stand-up, I'm acting. But 
like Charlie Chaplin who was forever 'The Tramp,' I'm locked into an image -- 
the 'nobody.' When I was performing at a New York club, a patron asked me for 
an autograph -- and more butter. Last year, AT&T dropped me from their 
commercials because I wasn't 'dignified' enough. I can't seem to get out from 
under." 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerfield's name was submitted by actor Leonard Gaines -- a 50-year friend 
who most recently appeared as the Ferrari dealer in "Scent of a Woman." The two 
used to hang out with Lenny Bruce at New York City's Hansen's Drug Store and -- 
along with other "lunch bunch" regulars such as Jerry Vale, Shecky Greene and 
Norm Crosby -- eat at Beverly Hills' Cafe Roma several times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines, who asked veteran academy member Michael Dante to co-sign the 
membership proposal card, was also baffled by the response. "What is 'mastery 
of the craft' suppose to mean?" he asks. "Rodney takes direction, he hits his 
marks, he delivers his lines . . . what else is there? 
</P>
<P>
 "Rodney's a big name in the business," Gaines says. "I was doing the academy a 
favor by bringing him in. Who knows? He may have done a benefit. It would have 
been good for Rodney too. All the money he's made hasn't helped his self-image. 
And he'd have free screenings at which he'd see all his friends."  
</P>
<P>
 Though McDowall was unavailable for comment, academy executive director Bruce 
Davis says the organization, of necessity, is more selective these days. Demand 
for membership has been up ever since the studios started sending movie 
cassettes to academy members in hope of Oscar consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a certain justice in the charge that not every academy member has 
done work of note," Davis admits. "But during the past six to eight years, 
we've become more rigorous in our admissions process. Twice a year, we have a 
pretty impressive group of actors making these decisions -- and they don't make 
them easily. Once you accept people, you have them for life. In the end, it's a 
double-edged sword. We're usually accused of having standards too low. Now 
we're accused of having standards too high." 
</P>
<P>
 The academy suggested it would be willing to reconsider Dangerfield's 
application once he has more credits under his belt. An unlikely scenario, the 
comedian says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Academy membership isn't something I need," says the comedian, who has 
written a book of jokes for HarperCollins and two feature film scripts in which 
he hopes to star. "And now that I've seen the way the academy functions, even 
the Oscar doesn't mean as much. I know the reality. Who are these geniuses who 
are judging us?"

MUSIC REVIEW; A RECYCLED MOZART FROM ZUBIN MEHTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Say this for Zubin Mehta's Mozart. It isn't fussy, and it certainly isn't 
precious. 
</P>
<P>
 It also isn't particularly graceful, sensitive or stylish. Call it assertive. 
Call it muscular. Call it hearty. Call it heroic. Call it ponderous. And, yes, 
sometimes call it sloppy. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way it is. That's the way it virtually always has been. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, our former music-director 
returned to conduct the final Philharmonic program of 1994. For better or 
worse, he made it a Mozart night. 
</P>
<P>
 The repertory offered an odd combination of predictable and jolting elements. 
The concert began with two familiar symphonies -- No. 32 in G, K.318, and No. 
41, K.551, a.k.a. "Jupiter" -- and ended with an almost-premiere -- "Davidde 
Penitente," K.469. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost -premiere? The concept borders on the oxymoronic. All things are 
possible, however, in the wonderful world of Wolfgang Amadeus, and our 
orchestra had never before ventured this music in this form. The last three 
words are the crucial qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
 The quasi-novelty in question demonstrates some creative recycling mustered 
for the Vienna of 1785. "Davidde Penitente" represents a drastic but hasty 
revision of the so-called "Great" Missa in C-minor, written in 1783. In 
converting the Mass to cantata, Mozart superimposed an Italian text (librettist 
unknown) on the Kyrie and Gloria of the popular Latin original, added a couple 
of bravura arias, and rewrote a trio section in the choral finale. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting hybrid isn't Mozart at his most coherent. The juxtaposition of 
operatic show and spiritual tell can be a bit disconcerting. The choruses tend 
to sound merely hectic when they want to be nobly agitated. An iconoclast, 
moreover, might question the quality of some portions of the first version.  
</P>
<P>
 Never mind. Even when Mozart is less than sublime, he is still more 
stimulating than many a composer at his lofty best. And concert-goers cannot 
live on masterpieces alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance on Thursday did not serve the problematic cause particularly 
well. Mehta made Mozart rather loud, prosaic and primitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The maestro didn't pause to search for subtlety. He tended to trample 
potentially introspective nuances. He seldom held back the orchestra for the 
relatively fragile soloists. 
</P>
<P>
 He did sustain a certain degree of urgency, however, amid an aura of warm and 
fuzzy Gemutlichkeit . Give him that. 
</P>
<P>
 The solo trio was dominated by Ruth Ann Swenson, fresh from "Lucia di 
Lammermoor" in San Francisco. She sailed through the ornate coloratura with 
laughing ease, shaded the line with fine dynamic flexibility, confronted the 
range extensions with dauntless valor, and reduced the text to a pretty 
vocalise (vowels, yes; consonants, well . . . ). 
</P>
<P>
 Swenson's big, bright soprano did not blend very effectively with Susanne 
Mentzer's not-so-big, pliant mezzo-soprano. Nevertheless, the seconda donna 
held her own artfully, some dubious trills notwithstanding. Kurt Streit, 
remembered as Tamino in the Music Center "Zauberflote," sang the tenor solos 
with tasteful virtuosity and pallid tone. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Los Angeles Master Chorale, trained by the redoubtable Paul 
Salamunovich, dispatched their complex duties lustily if not always smoothly. 
Gloria Cheng played the continuo, we think; her harpsichord remained inaudible. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half of the agenda involved Mozart by the numbers. In Mehta's 
perfunctory hands, the modest Symphony No. 32 functioned as listless overture 
to a broad and dutiful "Jupiter." 
</P>
<P>
 Poetic intimacy was scarce. So, at the other extreme, was thunderous grandeur. 
</P>
<P>
 * Zubin Mehta repeats this program with Los Angeles Philharmonic at the 
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion of the Music Center, 135 N. Grand Ave., Sunday at 
2:30 p.m. Tonight he conducts Mozart's "Jupiter" Symphony and Bruckner's Ninth 
(a holdover from last week). Tickets $6-$50 at the box office. Information:

TELEVISION REVIEW; NOT QUITE A STARDUST MEMORY; WOODY ALLEN REVISITS 'DON'T 
DRINK THE WATER' ON SMALL SCREEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here is Woody Allen as you may remember him -- before he became the 
accomplished filmmaker that he is today. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday's reworked "Don't Drink the Water" -- a comedically futile ABC 
movie that he has squeezed from his 1966 Broadway play, which was made into a 
theatrical film starring Jackie Gleason three years later -- is not from that 
early-work-in-progress, catch-me-when-I'm-really-good Allen. It's from the 
Allen of the present. The Allen who should know better. The Allen whose 
current, dead-eye funny theatrical feature, "Bullets Over Broadway," affirms 
that he does know better. 
</P>
<P>
 It's inexplicable why he would choose to make this screeching U-turn, which 
returns him to his neurotic schlemiel mode as a hapless American tourist 
fleeing police in a fictional Iron Curtain country during the Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking some innocent snapshots of locations that are off-limits, 
vacationing caterer Walter Hollander (Allen) and his wife (Julie Kavner) and 
daughter (Mayim Bialik) take refuge from the Commies in a U.S. embassy 
temporarily headed by a young diplomat (Michael J. Fox), also hapless. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't take long for the diplomat to fall for the daughter and for her 
boisterous parents to make a shambles of the embassy, to say nothing of the 
movie, whose awkward grafting of slapsticky sight gags and cheap one-liners 
(plus a nasty camel joke about Arabs) revisits a lower rung in Allen's career, 
when his films were in large part an extension of his stand-up comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 That was years ago. And at least in "Take the Money and Run" and "Bananas," 
for example, his raw excesses coincided with glints of brilliance that made 
those missteps forgivable. 
</P>
<P>
 There's rarely redeeming humor in "Don't Drink the Water," the one amusing 
component being Dom DeLuise's turn as a priest who does magic tricks. 
Otherwise, though, no rabbits in the hat. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Don't Drink the Water" airs at 9 p.m. Sunday on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 
42).

 Vincent Canby was named chief theater critic of the New York Times on Friday, 
after David Richards resigned to become a national cultural affairs writer for 
the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new position at the Post, the 54-year-old Richards will write profiles, 
news features and essays on arts and entertainment, said Virginia Rodriguez, a 
spokeswoman for the newspaper.He will assume his new duties sometime in 
January.

 Canby, the Times' Sunday theater critic, will start his new job next week, 
said Warren Hoge, a Times assistant managing editor. His old position has not 
yet been filled, Hoge added.

<P>
 "Vincent will write a couple more (columns), and then, in the new year, there 
will probably be a variety of contributors to that space from the Times staff," 
Hoge said.

 Canby, 70, became the Times' chief film critic in 1969 after working for the 
paper as a cultural news reporter and for Variety as a theater and movie 
reporter and critic. He became the Sunday theater critic last December.

 Oscar Music: What do standards such as "Thanks for the Memory," "Over the 
Rainbow" and "Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing" have in common with more 
contemporary pop offerings like "I Just Called to Say I Love You," "Beauty and 
the Beast" and "Streets of Philadelphia"? They're all songs that have taken 
home Hollywood's most coveted statuette, the Oscar. All 60 of the previous 
Oscar-winning songs will be released Feb. 28 in "The Envelope Please . . . 
Academy Award-Winning Songs (1934-1993)," a five-CD box set from Rhino 
Entertainment. The compilation's release comes right in the midst of Oscar 
season -- two weeks after the Feb. 14 announcement of this year's nominees, and 
six weeks before the March 27 telecast.

 How Many Did You See?: If you think you've caught most of the year's movies, 
statistics released Friday by the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. may come as a 
surprise. The organization, which presents the annual Golden Globe film and 
television awards, tallied up the releases from the 1994 calendar year. 
Eligible for this year's awards: 157 feature films, including 89 dramas and 68 
comedies, plus 33 foreign language films. Also eligible are 98 TV series -- 47 
of them dramas and 51 comedies -- and 72 miniseries and TV movies. The Golden 
Globes will be held at the Beverly Hilton on Jan. 21, with a broadcast that 
same night on cable's TBS. Nominations will be announced Thursday. MUSIC

 Mystery Solved?: Fifty years after his disappearance during a flight over the 
English Channel, celebrated big-band leader Glenn Miller was remembered in a 
celebration Thursday at England's American Military Cemetery near Cambridge. 
But the speculation over Miller's disappearance, and presumed death at the age 
of 40, remain. The accepted view is that Miller, a U.S. Army major, died when 
the single-engined Norseman, in which he was a passenger, crashed into the 
Channel. But in 1976 an alleged witness claimed that Miller had instead boarded 
a different plane, and stories at the time suggested that he was murdered in 
Paris or that he was still alive in France or Spain. This week, another 
"witness" surfaced. Victor Gregory, a former Royal Air Force bomber pilot, told 
reporters that he had seen Miller's Norseman crash into the sea after being 
caught by the jettisoned bomb blast. Said Gregory: "There's never been a 
mystery. It was the only Norseman in the area. The times are exact. That was 
Glenn Miller crashing." STAGE

 NYT Critic Post Open: David Richards, who took over the powerful role as the 
New York Times' chief theater critic last year, is returning to the Washington 
Post, where he held the theater critic job five years ago. A replacement has 
not been named, but Times cultural news editor Dan Lewis was recently quoted in 
the New York Observer as saying that second-string critic Ben Brantley has been 
getting more exposure through "the sheer force of his good writing." At the 
Post, Richards will become a national cultural affairs correspondent, writing 
arts and entertainment news and feature stories, essays and profiles from New 
York, Washington and other spots around the country. He will start the position 
in January.

 More Shakespeare Shake-Ups: The New York Shakespeare Festival's No. 2 
executive, managing director Jason Steven Cohen, ends his 22 years with the 
organization at the end of the month. Cohen's forced departure is a 
continuation of sweeping replacements and realignments since George C. Wolfe 
became festival producer after the abrupt ousting of festival founder Joseph 
Papp's successor, JoAnne Akalaitis, in early 1993. A festival publicist 
described the move as "part of ongoing restructuring" and said no replacement 
for Cohen was planned.

 Burnett on Broadway?: "It's a long shot" is how Carol Burnett's spokeswoman 
termed rumors circulating on Broadway this week that Burnett will co-star in 
the new Ken Ludwig comedy "Moon Over Buffalo." "Carol's read the play, she 
likes it a lot and that's as far as it's gotten," the spokeswoman said. Burnett 
has said recently that she would like to do a New York stage role. "Moon Over 
Buffalo," about an acting couple of dubious distinction, is expected to open in 
the spring. QUICK TAKES

 "Today" anchor Bryant Gumbel has a new contract to stay with the NBC program. 
Gumbel, who had reportedly been pursued by Fox to head that network's upcoming 
late-night show, took a few days off from "Today" when his contract expired two 
weeks ago, but returned to the program while negotiations continued. . . . Jim 
Newman, financial reporter for KTLA-TV Channel 5's "Morning News" and business 
editor at KFWB-AM (980), takes to the stage at Cerritos Center for the 
Performing Arts tonight as a special guest star in the national touring company 
of "The Will Rogers Follies." Newman, who is a distant relative of Will Rogers 
on his mother's side, steps into the role of Wiley Post, Rogers' friend who 
piloted their fatal flight. . . . The Westwood Playhouse is offering a $2 
discount to Steve Martin's comedy "Picasso at the Lapin Agile" through Jan. 8. 
To receive the discount, patrons must bring a new, unwrapped children's art

FANS FACE SOME DISCONCERTING SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone who attends concerts in Los Angeles likes feeling safe. But Steve 
Hochman's article "Palladium Security Reflects the Reality of Rock 'n' Roll" 
(Dec. 14) didn't exactly address the question: How much security is too much? 
</P>
<P>
 I was there for the mentioned Hole show. It was the same story that 
concert-goers now encounter at virtually every local venue -- overzealous 
security measures bordering on the absurd. Pat-downs have been going on for 
years, and no one objects to metal detectors. Together they are 99% effective. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why this new practice of forcing every person in line to completely 
empty their pockets is a time-consuming exercise in humiliation. At the Hole 
show, antagonistic security people did everything short of grabbing customers 
by the ankles and shaking them upside down. My favorite ballpoint pen was 
confiscated. My girlfriend's cigarettes were carelessly dumped all over the 
ground. I was told to immediately insert my foam ear plugs because they "looked 
suspicious." Two girls next to me were ordered to spit out their gum. Alert 
security went through someone's Kleenex. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that this personal invasion of privacy is just one more thing 
affecting concert attendance in the '90s. If we're going to be treated like 
Central Jail inmates, why not be completely thorough? Let's confiscate belts 
and shoelaces (the better to string up a disappointing performer). 
</P>
<P>
 When it takes 45 minutes in line just to clear security, then someone is 
enjoying their job a little too much.

WHERE THE MUSIC WENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The downbeat, please, Maestro; it is time to hear "The Firebird" by 
Stravinsky. This dauntless bird emerged from the ashes to soar again. 
</P>
<P>
 I recently replayed the audiotaped tribute made by KCRW-FM when KFAC-FM 
changed formats and became KKBT. It was titled "Requiem for a Radio Station." 
</P>
<P>
 What a joy it was to hear the familiar voices of Thomas Cassidy, the late Carl 
Princi, Fred Crane and Tom Dixon as they reflected on their decades with KFAC. 
Although it was sad to hear their reflections on the anger, hurt and sense of 
betrayal of having their jobs jerked out from under them, they also conveyed a 
sense of hope that someday Los Angeles would again have a radio station devoted 
to classical music. KFAC had been that station for about 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 KFAC was bought by a Dallas conglomerate for $55 million because of its 
powerful signal. The format was changed to urban contemporary. KKGO-FM 
purchased KFAC's classical record library and dropped its own jazz format. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 1 marks five years since KKGO became the new home of classical music in 
Los Angeles. It now claims to be the most listened to classical music station 
in the Western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you, KKGO; I wish you countless years of success!

'LAW & ORDER' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't understand your favorable article on "Law & Order" (" 'Law & Order' 
Steps Out of the Shadows," Dec. 7). The show is right-wing drivel and less 
realistic than HBO's two comedies in the same time slot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Law & Order" lifts stories out of the New York Times and doctors them up, so 
that in every criminal case we have the following: No police officers lie. The 
suspect is always guilty; the wrong person is never arrested for a crime. Crime 
labs make no mistakes. All prosecutors are ethical. No crime remains unsolved. 
Judges are nice to thug-type defendants. All defense lawyers are stupid, shrill 
and underhanded. 
</P>
<P>
 And I thought it was the liberals that were running the media.

MAKING REMAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re Richard Natale's article "Why Bother to Make Remakes?" (Dec. 5), I, too, 
feel that the only films that should be remade are those that didn't get it 
right the first time.In the old studio days, the moguls spewed forth remake 
after remake. However, this was before TV and VCRs -- we had only our memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, we can see these classics almost at will. The current "Love Affair" 
pales beside the first version and "An Affair to Remember." Dunne/Boyer and 
Kerr/Grant knock Beatty/Bening and misplaced '90s sensibilities out of the 
ring.

COMPOSER JOBIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The unexpected death of Brazilian composer Antonio Carlos Jobim is a great 
loss to our world of music ("Jobim Was More Than the King of Bossa Nova," Dec. 
9). We are all aware of his more popular commercial successes such as "The Girl 
From Ipanema," which brought the bossa nova (literal translation "new thing") 
to our shores, but his other compositions "How Insensitive (Insensatez)," 
"Desafindo" and "One Note Samba" will never die. 
</P>
<P>
 His '60s albums, particularly the '67 Grammy-nominated teaming with Frank 
Sinatra, were superb. I had the privilege of preparing his RCA compact disc 
reissues for release (a labor of love) and consider Jobim the "Gershwin of the 
Southern Hemisphere." 
</P>
<P>
 My lifelong wish to see him perform was finally realized at the Hollywood 
Bowl. A jovial, worldly man and a loving father, he was greatly concerned with 
the threatened ecology of his native Brazil. He re-created the sounds of rare 
jungle birds on his later and largely experimental albums. 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully Jobim's melodies will survive, but the music world has lost an 
extraordinary talent. Thank you, Antonio, for hours and hours of musical 
pleasure.

PEACE FUND FOR KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My wife and I were deeply touched by a story in Liz Smith's Nov. 25 column 
dealing with Judy Collins' recent visit to Yugoslavia for UNICEF. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during this visit that she learned of the grotesque "flower mines," of 
which children are the principal targets, and which have inspired her new 
Christmas album, "Song for Sarajevo." 
</P>
<P>
 A telephone number -- (800) FOR-KIDS -- was listed in Smith's report for 
anyone interested in helping the children of Sarajevo, especially this holiday 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 We called the number listed, which is a regional office for UNICEF; but for 
more information on the Judy Collins/Sarajevo project, we were directed to 
UNICEF in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 For others who may wish to support this project, contributions should be 
addressed to: "I Dream of Peace" Fund, U.S. Committee for UNICEF, 333 E. 38th 
St., New York, N.Y. 10016, Attn: Ms. Kelly Faulkner.

DANCE REVIEW; BRAVURA STEPPING IN MOSCOW'S 'NUTCRACKER'

By LEWIS SEGAL * The Moscow Classical Ballet "Nutcracker" repeats today at 2 
and 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 and 7 p.m. with different principals. The Haugh

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seen last year in Cerritos, the Moscow Classical Ballet "Nutcracker" dispenses 
with Christmas cheer in favor of hard-sell virtuosity. Don't expect a magic 
Christmas tree: This version makes everyone from little Fritz to old 
Drosselmeyer punch out bravura steps as if the event were some kind of 
cradle-to-the-grave technique competition. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even a Mouse Queen who clearly believes she's the Black Swan -- and 
although the result proves undeniably lively, the performance Thursday at the 
Haugh Performing Arts Center in Glendora would have been utterly soulless but 
for the sweetness and vulnerability of Ekaterina Berezina as Masha. Berezina 
may jump and turn with the authority of a seasoned Russian ballerina, but she 
remembers enough about childhood and heartbreak to give this staging the center 
of feeling it so badly needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Credited to company directors Nalalia Kasatkina and Vladimir Vasiliov -- with 
inserts from the same antique Vassily Vainonen version revived by the Kirov in 
1992 -- this "Nutcracker" is danced to deafening canned Tchaikovsky in sets by 
Lev Solodovnikov and costumes by Elizaveta Dvorkina that look skimpy compared 
to the opulence of what local companies can offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, the dancing is another matter. Russian training should never be taken 
for granted and, even if the Moscow Classical Ballet lacks a distinguished 
corps, the soloists are a commanding lot with their hyper-extended limbs, 
high-velocity clarity of execution and classic Soviet-style indigo eyelids. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Berezina, the Thursday cast boasted the superbly steely Tatiana 
Yatsenko as the Mouse Queen and the tirelessly flamboyant Sergei Domrachev as 
Fritz. In the title role, Konstantin Osin couldn't partner reliably but looked 
elegant and polished in solo passages. 
</P>
<P>
 Valery Trofimchuk never developed any coherent sense of character or purpose 
as Drosselmeyer but performed all his duties efficiently. LEWIS SEGAL * The 
Moscow Classical Ballet "Nutcracker" repeats today at 2 and 8 p.m. and Sunday 
at 2 and 7 p.m. with different principals. The Haugh Performing Arts Center is 
on the campus of Citrus College, 1000 W. Foothill Blvd., Glendora. Tickets 
range from $22 to $40, with a $5 discount for children 12 and under. (818)

DANCE REVIEW; INTENSE DANCE THEATRE PROGRAM AT NOSOTROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER * Dance Theatre of East L.A., Nosotros Theatre, 1314 N. 
Wilton Place, Hollywood, tonight at 8, Sunday, 3 and 8 p.m., $15. (213) 
960-4379. No one under 18 admitted.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When you look at dancer-choreographer Frank Guevara, you may imagine there is 
electricity in place of blood running through his veins, so charged and intense 
is his every move. This current also flows through the other performers of 
Dance Theatre of East L.A., which premiered three new works alongside recent 
pieces with new casting at Nosotros Theatre Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Often described as a dancemaker who addresses issues in the Latino community, 
Guevara continues to explore a movement vocabulary that includes the preening 
arched pauses of flamenco, street-wise stalks and punchy, quick rolls or 
jogging. But new works aren't as directly tied to Chicano themes as his 
reprised solo "Mojado," or "Cuerpo Marcado," which uses folklorico props, 
anxious jumps, spins and rubbing of reddish "marks" to project identity crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 This last piece might have lost power in its reworking from soul-searching 
solo to trio, performed in brief sections that hardly had time to develop. Nor 
did the recasting of a woman in Guevara's street-tough solo with a tire 
("Cursum Perficio") seem to work. Compact and muscled, Domino Fernandez made 
all the leaps and jumps of frustration, but without the bodily focus that might 
have made her relationship to the tire interesting.  
</P>
<P>
 The premiere of "Tres," (with Melissa Arambasich, Edward Rocha and Fernandez), 
was more successful, using lots of running, leapfrogging and crouching into 
football-inspired poses. A little shoving, suspicious eyeing and circling -- 
not too forceful, just wary -- gave it the feel of a playground with attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara's style-defining version of machismo is made up of taut posturing and 
muscled tightness that is curiously light as well as strong. It is dynamic in 
short bursts, but without more variation of mood and/or choreographic 
structure, we are left on the surface of many obviously deeply felt themes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere are the problems with this "aesthetics of intensity" more apparent 
than in "Amarrado" (Tied), a new solo for Bogar Martinez to mournful music by 
Purcell. In a tight-fitting peach jumpsuit with flowing bell-bottoms, 
Martinez's amazingly plastic and beautifully sculpted body stretched fully up 
and out, freezing in luxurious extended poses, then contracting and rolling 
from side to side. Then more poses, and a reaching posture of general anguish 
that recurs in many pieces. Jazzy or balletic steps often seemed awkwardly 
inserted. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nothing structurally awkward, however, about "Reto" (Challenge), a 
duet for Guevara and Martinez, commissioned from tango specialists Alberto 
Toledano and Loreen Arbus. In black tie, both men were seriously smoldering 
from the waist up, although they had not yet gotten their enticing tango leg 
play down. The fragment was brief, and, as with other pieces on the program, 
one hopes for more development of the theme in the future. JENNIFER FISHER *

tonight at 8, Sunday, 3 and 8 p.m., $15. (213) 960-4379. No one under 18

<P>
 Has the bloom come off the Grateful Dead's rose?  
</P>
<P>
 There certainly seemed to be fewer fresh faces at the venerable band's first 
of four nights at the Los Angeles Sports Arena -- the influx of a new 
generation of Deadheads that had been going on for about a decade seems to have 
slowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, good. All the focus on the sociocultural circus of the Dead scene in 
recent years got to be a distraction from the music. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, on the musical front, the rose was blooming anew, with the band 
lovingly and strongly reconnecting with its American music roots past and 
pointing to its own future with several impressive as-yet-unreleased songs. 
With the Dead reportedly working on its first studio album in six years, that's 
great news. 
</P>
<P>
 In an hourlong first portion, the Dead stuck largely with its strong 
foundation of country, folk, blues and good ol' rock 'n' roll. Bob Weir led the 
way with spunky takes on his own Marty Robbins-like "Mexicali Blues," Chuck 
Berry's "Promised Land" and Willie Dixon's "Wang Dang Doodle." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Garcia added his lovely new folkie-styled "Lazy River Road," and, of 
course, tied everything together with often stunningly fluid guitar work. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the real test of a show -- as any Deadhead will tell you -- comes 
after intermission in a set usually featuring seamless medleys, spacey jams 
and, ideally, several rousing crescendos. When it works, it's bliss; when it 
doesn't, it's interminable. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening set's punch carried through to Thursday's second half with a flow 
of songs and jams that, if not exactly bringing on satori, showcased the Dead's 
often-overlooked musical talents.  
</P>
<P>
 Two new songs -- one sung by keyboardist Vince Welnick, the other by Weir -- 
built up neo-soul grooves that led very nicely into an extended version of the 
Deadhead favorite "Uncle John's Band." Even the traditional "Space" jam had 
substance this night, touching on the styles of avant-garde composers Morton 
Subotnick and Harry Partch, with bassist Phil Lesh showing off his modern 
classical training. 
</P>
<P>
 While this was far from a total revamping of the Dead method -- hey, it ain't 
broke, you know -- it did show the group to be re-energizing its creative core 
as it approaches its 30th anniversary next year. Dead-head worship could keep 
the band going for years to come. This show made it clear that the Dead won't 
settle for just that. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Grateful Dead concludes its Sports Arena run Sunday and Monday, with 
tickets still available both nights at $30. 7:30 p.m. 3939 Figueroa St., (213)

POP ALBUM CHART; HOLIDAY TUNES RINGING UP SALES 
</P>

 "No Toys for O.J." has absolutely nothing to do with O.J. Simpson but a lot to 
do with Christmas. The KROQ cassette features assorted holiday songs and DJs 
Kevin and Bean chitchatting with celebs.Although available only at Wherehouse 
stores, it's selling well enough to debut at No. 57 on the pop chart. The 
season's third best-selling Christmas album--after the collections by Kenny G 
and Mariah Carey--is Natalie Cole's "Holly and Ivy" (No. 36). Yanni's 
41-week-old "Live at the Acropolis" has been surging the last two weeks, from 
No. 62 to No. 29--no doubt mostly thanks to Christmas shoppers. Madonna is 
taking bows all over the place now that her hot single, "Take a Bow," has 
rejuvenated sleepy sales of her "Bedtime Stories" album, boosting it from No. 
33 to No. 16 in the last two weeks. There's no catching hot-steppin' Ini 
Kamoze, whose "Here Comes the Hotstepper" single continues to lead the pop 
singles chart. 04,45,06,08,08 Rank Rank 2 Weeks Last Weeks on the Week Ago 
Chart 1. "Vitalogy," Pearl Jam 173 55 3 2. "Miracles: The Holiday Album," Kenny

"The Sweetest Days" isn't very high for such an eagerly anticipated album. 
However, it's geared more to the 30--50 adult contemporary crowd, which buys 
fewer albums. DENNIS HUNT

POP BEAT: EXTRA FANCY'S GRILLO BUSTS ROCK IMAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Being a gay man in rock is a total no-no," says Brian Grillo, who leads the 
abrasive and beat-heavy L.A. rock band Extra Fancy. "It's all right to be a 
drag queen or something that's not threatening, but to go up against other 
boys. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "But I just thought that so many of my friends have been beat up, have died of 
AIDS, have been treated like they were invisible, that this (band) is one way I 
can give off a positive image. I can break the stereotypes that gay men are 
either sick, wimpy or drag queens." 
</P>
<P>
 Grillo does shatter those confining images, striking a traditionally 
aggressive rock stance -- including gritty vocals and an imposing presence -- 
while presenting his own gay perspective. "I want to tell you that I love you/I 
want to tell you that I care/But somebody might be listening," he sings in one 
song, and he accents his quartet's post-industrial grind with hard-core go-go 
dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Homosexuality is nothing new in rock but it has generally been treated as a 
titillating diversion and glittery charade -- from the flamboyant 
cross-dressing of David Bowie to Mick Jagger's fey persona to, more recently, 
the coy lyrics of the London Suede. Rarely do any major artists lead an openly 
gay lifestyle. Folk-pop (Melissa Etheridge, k.d. lang) and dance music 
(Erasure's Andy Bell) have been far more open and honest about homosexuality. 
Rock has treated it as a selling point while remaining safely heterosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 Extra Fancy -- Grillo, drummer Derek O'Brien, bassist David Foster and 
guitarist Mike Hateley -- is not a launching pad for a gay agenda, though. Says 
Grillo: "The music just happens to involve a gay guy, which puts a different 
viewpoint on our songs and sound. But as a band, I want to go up against the 
Chili Peppers, Rollins and the Beastie Boys and be just as respected for our 
music without any tag on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Respect is already heading Extra Fancy's way. The band, which will play Club 
Lingerie on Tuesday, hasn't released any records, but sizable crowds (dotted 
with record execs) frequent its shows. Rodney Bingenheimer is playing 
"Self-Made" -- a track from a compilation album -- on his KROQ show, and the 
band has a song on the upcoming soundtrack for the film "The Doom Generation." 
Pretty good for a group that's only been at it two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Grillo, 32, grew up mainly in the Torrance area. He studied Afro-jazz dance 
and ballet and worked briefly as a nude go-go dancer in New York's Times Square 
before putting on his own dance revue, "The Grillo Follies," in L.A. in the 
late '80s. Turning to music, he sang in several local bands before forming 
Extra Fancy in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my background as someone who's always danced comes out in my music," 
says Grillo, whose group can turn an entire club into a bump-and-grind-o-rama. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some songs that have a techno-ish base. That's from going to gay 
discos and wanting to do an ode to that whole scene. But I always wanted to 
walk into a club and hear psychotic rock at the same time. So it's not like we 
do dance music, like the kind that's played on the radio, but you can shake and 
shimmy and go nuts to it."  
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Grillo wants his music to have impact beyond an initial rush of 
beat and bass. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dream is to be what Patti Smith was to me as a kid," he says. "She was the 
first woman to come into rock and get it right. She was threatening, cool and 
sounded better than most of the guy bands that were being shoved down your 
throat. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's sort of what I'd like to be: one of the guys that got it right and 
didn't have to do a campy song or come out in drag. I just want to go on like a 
man and say, 'This is my point of view in life,' reach a bunch of people, and 
eventually they'll get over it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Extra Fancy plays Tuesday at Club Lingerie, 6507 Sunset Blvd., 10:30 p.m. 
$5. (213) 466-8557.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; L7 LETS IMPACT OF ITS MUSIC PROVE ITS POWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI * L7 finishes its sold-out Whisky stand tonight and Sunday, 
8901 Sunset Blvd., (310) 652-4202, 8 p.m. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 L7 has many titles: Leaders of the hyped, angry-girl rock revolution; founders 
of the abortion-rights organization Rock for Choice, and the scrungy MTV band 
behind such hits as "Pretend That We're Dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the mainstream success of its third album in 1992, the L.A. band -- 
which plays heavy-duty rock with a seething edge -- was also renowned for its 
riotous live shows.But larger audiences meant larger venues (and even huge 
amphitheaters on the Lollapalooza '94 tour) where L7's jagged tumult came off 
more like adrenalized arena-rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, the band's first of four sold-out shows in the modest setting of the 
Whisky, marked a resurgence of its initial force and bite. The main reason: L7 
dropped its annoyingly faux bad attitude and instead showed its writhing sound 
to be its ultimate power. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer-guitarist Donita Sparks unleashed coarse roars from under Alice 
Cooper-ish eye makeup and matted black locks, while the band pumped out fat 
rock melodies with a gruff, churning edge. Bassist Jennifer Finch and guitarist 
Suzi Gardner also took turns as lead singer, letting loose shrill screams, then 
dropping into menacing monotones. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast tunes found the room exploding into a huge slam-a-topia, where as many 
women as men stage dove and crowd surfed (a rarity in the punk world). L7 is 
best in a small explosive space, where the impact of its music proves far more 
dynamic than its image. LORRAINE ALI * L7 finishes its sold-out Whisky stand 
tonight and Sunday, 8901 Sunset Blvd., (310) 652-4202, 8 p.m.

THEATER REVIEW; 'UNDERSIEGE STORIES' SHOVES PRISON LIFE INTO THE OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Undersiege Stories," the new piece from Keith Antar Mason and the Hittite 
Empire at Highways, is a series of five monologues from a jail cell that asks 
us to consider if the billion-dollar prison industry in this country is 
replacing the military industrial complex. If common sense says no to this, 
Mason will supply other questions worthy of some thought.  
</P>
<P>
 Is this country putting African American men in jail at an alarming rate so 
that it doesn't have to think about their problems? OK, possibly, in a slightly 
metaphoric sense, but that's not the whole story. The first monologuist (Ellis 
Rice) went on a shooting rampage on a train. The killer recalls that one victim 
"was begging, just like I used to beg for a job." Perhaps jail is not an 
inappropriate place for this man. Later, a young carjacker asks, "You've seen 
me as a nigger, you've seen me as a murderer, but have you ever seen me as a 
god?" To this, the only logical reply would be, "Well, if you've just hijacked 
my car, probably not." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mason is not interested in strict logic, rather in poetic logic that is 
unlaced with irony. He never really addresses the question of responsibility in 
an evening that is equally divided between blame and despair. Also, there is a 
fair amount of writhing on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the monologues, Antar plays Warden Limbaugh, a puppet of the ultra 
right who addresses the Senate (the audience) to let us know that the prison 
system is in fact working. Mason imbues the Warden with his grave and rather 
uneasy stage presence, but he doesn't really bother to develop a character, 
other than to just have the Warden say he's glad about Proposition 187 and that 
we finally kicked all homosexuals out of the military and put them in prison 
(the setting is the past, the present and the near future).  
</P>
<P>
 The monologues, on the other hand, occasionally rise from the dreary litany of 
complaint to illuminate the real loss of individual lives in continuing race 
wars. Rice has an affecting moment when his delusionary lost soul imagines 
himself a professor of African American studies at Berkeley who, when attacked 
by an insane person, can simply say, "Security, take him away." As the 
carjacker, Wheaton James lets you see the utter lack of hope just beneath his 
expert indifference.  
</P>
<P>
 The men perform in a net cage with nooses for each of them hanging off to the 
side. Dollar bills dangle above, just out of their reach.  
</P>
<P>
 Toward the end, when a prisoner moans, "You had the whip and chain in place 
when you brought me here," one begins to despair of catharsis or dramatic 
movement. Perhaps to illustrate his characters' lives, Mason never supplies it. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Undersiege Stories," Highways, 1651 18th St . , Santa Monica, tonight 
at 8:30, Sunday at 7:30 p.m., $10. (213) 660-8587. Running time: 2 hours.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; AN ADDICTION TO SCHMALTZ HINDERS PERRY PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Somewhere inside Steve Perry, there's a Broadway-style ballad singer 
struggling to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 He should be on a theatrical stage belting out flowery tunes from "Carousel" 
and "Oklahoma!," not squandering that grand, soaring tenor on plain old 
pop-rock songs, as he did Thursday in the opener of a three-night, sold-out 
stand at the Pantages Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically speaking, he has one of the best voices in rock -- the classiest 
set of pipes this side of Meat Loaf. But as a singer-songwriter, Perry has an 
apparently incurable addiction to schmaltz, still preferring saccharine 
romantic tunes, just as he did when singing lead for the rock band Journey from 
1978-87. 
</P>
<P>
 On his solo albums, 1984's "Street Talk" and the current "For the Love of 
Strange Medicine," he really pulls out all the schlock stops. There's nothing 
daring or hard-edged about songs like "Oh Sherrie," "Foolish Heart," "Missing 
You" and "Somewhere There's Hope" -- the highlights of his Pantages show.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the rock trappings -- the noisy accompaniment of his four-piece band -- 
didn't dilute the syrupy quality of these songs. 
</P>
<P>
 But you have to give him his due. On his first tour since Journey broke up in 
1987, Perry showed he can still turn an audience on. The crowd was in sheer 
ecstasy most of the time. Clearly, Perry's crown as rock's King of Schmaltz is 
secure. DENNIS HUNT

TV REVIEW; 'TAKE ME HOME AGAIN' AN AFFECTING TRIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Take Me Home Again," in spirit, might be the heartiest Christmas story you'll 
see on TV this season, although it's not about Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 The casting is hard to resist. Kirk Douglas and Craig T. Nelson play a father 
and son who embark on a pilgrimage, fleeing the old man's stodgy family 
environment and trekking across the country to fulfill the elder's wish to die 
in the same house and bed in which he was born. 
</P>
<P>
 They have not agreed on much since the son left behind his own wife (Bess 
Armstrong), went AWOL in the Vietnam War and disappeared. But now, 20 years 
later, the son is the old man's lifeline -- the only one in an oppressive, 
extended family with enough courage to help his ailing father sneak out from 
under a coddling wife (Bonnie Bartlett) and callow in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
 As they hit the country's bucolic back roads, the odyssey is fraught with 
father-son wounds that flare up in roadhouses and motels. There's forgiveness 
for choices made and, not unfeelingly, love re-emerges before the end of the 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
 En route, humor and social observations -- such as the father's tirade against 
fast food joints with their plastic utensils and hard pancakes compared to his 
memory of cozy, warm diners -- enliven Tom McLoughlin's direction and the 
script by Ernest Thompson ("On Golden Pond"). The latter also has a small role 
as a protective handyman in the movie, which he adapted from Lamar Herrin's 
novel, "The Lies Boys Tell." 
</P>
<P>
 The pacing turns a bit cluttered and overcrowded with worried family members 
crazily pursuing the spirited vagabonds all the way to the West Coast in what 
looks like a parody of a silent movie car chase. Happily, most of the bumps in 
the road are expressive detours, especially the father and son's amusing hustle 
of a stuffy trio of golfers. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Take Me Home Again" airs at 9 p.m. Sunday on NBC Channels 4, 36 and 39.

Service's computerized version of the Graduate Record Examination being 
vulnerable to cheating reported that Kaplan Educational Centers acknowledged 
violating copyright law when it sent its employees to memorize and accumulate

not believe they were violating copyright laws.

 Moon exploration -- Because of a copy editing error, a Friday story describing 
new findings about the moon contained the phrase, "the dark side of the moon 
that always turns its back to Earth." Contrary to popular perceptions, the moon 
has no dark side; however, it does have a side permanently facing away from 
Earth.

POP BEAT: EXTRA FANCY'S GRILLO BUSTS ROCK IMAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "Being a gay man in rock is a total no-no," says Brian Grillo, who leads the 
abrasive and beat-heavy L.A. rock band Extra Fancy. "It's all right to be a 
drag queen or something that's not threatening, but to go up against other 
boys. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "But I just thought that so many of my friends have been beat up, have died of 
AIDS, have been treated like they were invisible, that this (band) is one way I 
can give off a positive image. I can break the stereotypes that gay men are 
either sick, wimpy or drag queens." 
</P>
<P>
 Grillo does shatter those confining images, striking a traditionally 
aggressive rock stance--including gritty vocals and an imposing presence--while 
presenting his own gay perspective. "I want to tell you that I love you/I want 
to tell you that I care/But somebody might be listening," he sings in one song, 
and he accents his quartet's post-industrial grind with hard-core go-go 
dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Homosexuality is nothing new in rock but it has generally been treated as a 
titillating diversion and glittery charade--from the flamboyant cross-dressing 
of David Bowie to Mick Jagger's fey persona to, more recently, the coy lyrics 
of the London Suede. Rarely do any major artists lead an openly gay lifestyle. 
Folk-pop (Melissa Etheridge, k.d. lang) and dance music (Erasure's Andy Bell) 
have been far more open and honest about homosexuality. Rock has treated it as 
a selling point while remaining safely heterosexual. 
</P>
<P>
 Extra Fancy--Grillo, drummer Derek O'Brien, bassist David Foster and guitarist 
Mike Hateley--is not a launching pad for a gay agenda, though. Says Grillo: 
"The music just happens to involve a gay guy, which puts a different viewpoint 
on our songs and sound. But as a band, I want to go up against the Chili 
Peppers, Rollins and the Beastie Boys and be just as respected for our music 
without any tag on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Respect is already heading Extra Fancy's way. The band, which will play Club 
Lingerie on Tuesday, hasn't released any records, but sizable crowds (dotted 
with record execs) frequent its shows. Rodney Bingenheimer is playing 
"Self-Made'--a track from a compilation album--on his KROQ show, and the band 
has a song on the upcoming soundtrack for the film 'The Doom Generation." 
Pretty good for a group that's only been at it two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Grillo, 32, grew up mainly in the Torrance area. He studied Afro-jaz dance and 
ballet and worked briefly as a nude go-go dancer in New York's Times Square 
before putting on his own dance revue, "The Grillo Follies," in L.A. in the 
late '80s. Turning to music, he sang in several local bands before forming 
Extra Fancy in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my background as someone who's always danced comes out in my music," 
says Grillo, whose group can turn an entire club into a bump-and-grind-o-rama. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some songs that have a techno-ish base. That's from going to gay 
discos and wanting to do an ode to that whole scene. But I always wanted to 
walk into a club and hear psychotic rock at the same time. So it's not like we 
do dance music, like the kind that's played on the radio, but you can shake and 
shimmy and go nuts to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Grillo wants his music to have impact beyond an initial rush of 
beat and bass. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dream is to be what Patti Smith was to me as a kid," he says. "She was the 
first woman to come into rock and get it right. She was threatening, cool and 
sounded better than most of the guy bands that were being shoved down your 
throat. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's sort of what I'd like to be: one of the guys that got it right and 
didn't have to do a campy song or come out in drag. I just want to go on like a 
man and say, 'This is my point of view in life,' reach a bunch of people, and 
eventually they'll get over it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Extra Fancy plays Tuesday at Club Lingerie, 6507 Sunset Blvd., 10:30 p.m. 
$5. (213) 466-8557.
