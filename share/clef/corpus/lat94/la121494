 PAPER CHASE: For anyone who's waded through legal documents, this may come as 
no surprise -- the county's courts go through about 6 1/2 tons of paper a year. 
. . . But change is in the works. To meet requirements of a state law that goes 
into effect Jan. 1, the Municipal and Superior courts are switching to recycled 
paper. . . . The courts have already been recycling used paper as part of a 
program that diverts 35% of Government Center trash from landfills. Now, 
"they're completing the loop by buying recycled (paper)," analyst David 
Goldstein said.

 FIGHTING CHANCE? Nearly a year after it was given as a Christmas gift, a dog 
belonging to a Thousand Oaks family -- one of two Rottweilers accused of 
attacking passersby -- may be rescued from being put to sleep. . . . The clock 
is ticking, though. The family must meet an unusual condition before the dogs 
are saved for certain (B5). 
</P>
<P>
 LOOKING FOR TOYS: It's a perennial problem during lean economic years: The 
number of toys donated to local holiday drives lags far behind the need (B1). . 
. . The U. S. Marines are looking for thousands of toys by next week, with 
hopes of giving them to local children in time for Christmas. The drive was in 
the same predicament this time last year -- demand up, donations down. Despite 
the hard times, county residents came through. This year, the challenge is on.

<P>
 TOUR FOR PEACE: After fasting at the former Nazi death camp in Auschwitz, 
Poland, three Ventura residents this week began a 10,000-mile journey -- mostly 
on foot -- that will take them across Eastern Europe -- including war-torn 
Bosnia -- to Nagasaki, Japan, by August to commemorate the 50th anniversary of 
the World War II bombing of that city. . . . Lauren Fernandez, Aaron McFarlin 
and David Laughlin joined about 50 other adults on the Buddhist monk-led 
expedition. "Their goal is to walk through areas of conflict to promote the 
idea of peace," spokeswoman Annie Z. Hall said.

VAN EXEL GETS THE CALL, AND IT'S LONG DISTANCE; LAKERS: HE MAKES TEAM-RECORD 
EIGHT THREE-POINT BASKETS DURING 115-108 VICTORY OVER MAVERICKS. TARPLEY 
SUSPENDED AT HALFTIME BY DALLAS.

 We now return you to your regularly scheduled programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick at Nite played Tuesday after a one-game hiatus, during which time 
understudy Sedale Threatt scored 38 points against the Utah Jazz. Seventy-two 
hours after his absence because of a sprained left ankle, Nick Van Exel took 
the spotlight right back, making eight three-point baskets to set a franchise 
record and tying his career high of 35 points to lead the Lakers to a 115-108 
victory over the Dallas Mavericks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looked pretty good for an injured guy, didn't he?" Laker Coach Del Harris 
deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
 Looked pretty good for any guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel had made six three-point shots three previous times, including 
opening night at Detroit, good for the regular-season record. Michael Cooper 
had also done it in the 1987 finals against Boston. But, before 15,150 at 
Reunion Arena and a national television audience, the second- year point guard 
topped that mark by making eight in 16 tries, which also tied his team record 
for attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 The showing overshadowed oft-troubled Roy Tarpley being suspended indefinitely 
at halftime, apparently after he became angry when Maverick Coach Dick Motta 
replaced him in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel's four three-point baskets in the final quarter, in six tries, 
propelled the Lakers to their ninth victory in 11 games and their league-best 
eighth road victory.  
</P>
<P>
 One three-point basket came after the Mavericks had closed to within 93-90, 
another when the L.A. lead was 101-100 and the last when it was 110-108 with 
2:25 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great shooting," said teammate Eddie Jones, who had 19 points and six steals. 
"He hit one every time we needed one." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dallas guard Jason Kidd, who provided tight coverage on some of the 
shots: "It just shows he can step up and knock down the shots when someone is 
in his shorts. You've got to give him credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel also had 10 assists against only one turnover and three steals in 43 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you could say I was in a zone," he said. "It seemed like every time I 
touched it, it was going in. I felt it and I wanted it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels good, knowing everybody in the gym is oohing and aahing when you're 
hitting the shots. All your teammates and all your coaches want the ball to get 
to you." 
</P>
<P>
 As late as Monday night, the Lakers weren't even sure if Van Exel would play. 
He had practiced earlier that day, but favored the injury, and trainer Gary 
Vitti wanted to see if the ankle would be sore or swell up the next morning. 
Come Tuesday, Van Exel told Harris he was ready to go, so he went back into the 
starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 He paid immediate dividends, collecting all three of his steals in the first 
quarter. Jones had four during the same stretch as the Lakers tied an NBA 
record with 11 steals in a quarter, done four other times, and put Dallas in an 
early 15-point hole by forcing 12 turnovers in those 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks committed 26 turnovers in all, which the Lakers turned into 27 
points, but they still managed a comeback. They even went ahead for a bit early 
in the fourth quarter, before the visitors regained control. 
</P>
<P>
 Vlade Divac came to life offensively from there and made two baskets in three 
trips, one a three-point play, to put the Lakers up, 101-98. The Mavericks 
answered to cut the deficit to one, but then the Laker backcourt went off like 
a machine gun. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 A miss by Van Exel on a two-point shot along the baseline, then . . .  
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The Mavericks had scored on every possession in between, but still trailed by 
113-108 with 2:02 left. 
</P>
<P>
 They had other problems to deal with. Tarpley left the arena in the second 
half after the suspension. He had four rebounds and four points in seven 
minutes, his 12th game back since being reinstated after three seasons on the 
suspended list. 
</P>
<P>
 Maverick officials met after the game, but apparently decided only to meet 
again today, probably with Tarpley, to determine the length of the suspension. 
A team spokesman said he doesn't believe the discipline is connected to 
Tarpley's history of drug problems.

PLAYERS' UNION REJECTS OWNERS' LATEST PROPOSAL; BASEBALL: NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE 
AS DEADLINE TO IMPOSE SALARY CAP LOOMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baseball players "fundamentally" rejected the owners' latest contract offer 
Tuesday and didn't come back with a counterproposal, Colorado Rockies chairman 
Jerry McMorris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators resumed talks at 11 a.m. EST, about 10 hours after the sides 
recessed. They met for two hours before owners left the room and went back to 
their own caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're meeting with the mediator now, deciding where we go next," McMorris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until 4:15 p.m. that owners rejoined the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fair to say it's pivotal here," said Gene Orza, associate general 
counsel for the union. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the meeting, union officials held out little hope for a deal 
before Thursday, when owners are scheduled to meet in Chicago, and union head 
Donald Fehr said the lateness of Monday's talks was tied to Thursday's meeting. 
Management negotiator John Harrington has said that if there's no deal by then, 
owners will declare an impasse and impose a cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams, prepared to start the 1995 season with replacement players if the 
strike continues, want a new economic system in place before Saturday, the 
deadline for clubs to offer salary arbitration to their former players who 
became free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners originally planned to meet Dec. 5, but agreed to push back their 
meeting and the arbitration deadline by 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're literally out of time," McMorris said before Monday night's talks 
began. "With the holidays staring at us, it would be very difficult to move 
that date again." 
</P>
<P>
 If owners do impose a cap, they would eliminate salary arbitration and many of 
the union's gains of the past 25 years, and make players with four to six years 
in the majors restricted free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The union would challenge an imposed cap before the National Labor Relations 
Board, and both sides have been determining their strategy under the assumption 
it will be reviewed by judges and juries. 
</P>
<P>
 Players would make it harder for owners to defend an impasse if they make 
another counterproposal. The union's last offer, made Saturday, called for a 
flat 5.02% payroll tax that would apply to all clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Management officials admitted their offer of Sunday would roll back the 
percentage of revenue going to players, which clubs say was 58% in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's designed to put some drag" on salaries, McMorris said. "There's no 
deception to that. It's to get the level down to a 50-50 share." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was so complex, according to one source, that the spread sheet 
explaining it was more than 100 columns wide.  
</P>
<P>
 "This makes my head hurt," Fielder said during Sunday night's bargaining 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 A chart given the union by Philadelphia Phillies co-general partner David 
Montgomery showed the new plan could have a 55% marginal rate, which means a $1 
million payroll increase would raise a team's tax by $550,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first blush, it appears their new proposal contains virtually all the 
elements of the salary cap," Fehr said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax rate would increase as long as the percentage of money going to 
players was more than 50%. There would be three transition years. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of an example Montgomery gave the union, if players got 62% of the 
money this year, the target for 1996 would be 59%, so the tax rate would 
increase to 7.64%. Because the tax could keep increasing if players keep 
getting more than 50% of revenue, the union thinks the plan would serve as a 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, union officials said the plan would reward high revenue clubs for 
remaining just under the 112% threshold. That's because all clubs under the 
threshold would receive tax money, and the tax money would be given to a club 
in proportion to its revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Using 1994 figures, 19 clubs would pay a tax and nine would receive money. The 
receiving clubs would include the New York Mets, who were projected to have the 
sixth-highest revenue at $81.2 million but the eighth-lowest payroll, $34.4 
million counting benefits and employer taxes.

NEWSWIRE: GROSS SIGNS $6-MILLION DEAL WITH RANGERS 
</P>

From Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Texas Rangers signed Kevin Gross, 33, a free agent right-handed pitcher 
from the Dodgers, to a two-year, $6-million contract on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross' deal includes a $400,000 signing bonus. His 1995 salary is $2.5 
million, and he will get $3.1 million in 1996. Gross is eligible for $300,000 
in bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of high goals and expectations of myself," he said. "I don't 
necessarily expect to be the No. 1 starter. It's going to take a team effort 
from the whole staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Gross had the lowest earned-run average among the Dodger starters and topped 
the staff with 124 strikeouts. He also pitched for Philadelphia and Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers also signed free agent infielder-outfielder Mark McLemore to a 
two-year contract, using money it shaved from the payroll by dealing Jose 
Canseco and his $5.1-million contract to Boston on Friday.

NBA ROUNDUP; BURTON TURNS ON HEAT AS 53ER FOR 76ERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty-three points was Willie Burton's way of saying thanks to the 
Philadelphia 76ers. 
</P>
<P>
 The 76ers picked up Burton on Nov. 8, five days after the Miami Heat released 
him, and he rewarded them with a 53-point game against his old team Tuesday 
night at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just grateful to be getting the opportunity to play," Burton said after 
leading his new team to a 105-90 victory. "I'm really glad I'm here. I know 
I'll be playing here. It's a wonderful organization with a real good coach and 
a good team." 
</P>
<P>
 Burton's total was the highest in the NBA this season. He broke the 
27-year-old Spectrum record of 52 points, set by Michael Jordan on Nov. 16, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have a hard time sleeping tonight," Burton said. "I just want to 
savor this." 
</P>
<P>
 Burton's outburst against his former team was the best by a 76er since Wilt 
Chamberlain scored 53 points against the Lakers on March 19, 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami Coach Kevin Loughery said there were no hard feelings between him and 
his former player. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to give Willie Burton a lot of credit," Loughery said. "I'm glad 
he's doing well, but I wish it wasn't against us. He was always a terrific 
talent, and I hope he can stay focused and maintain that intensity." 
</P>
<P>
 Burton made 12 of 19 shots, including five of eight three-point attempts, and 
a franchise-record 24 of 28 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 His previous high was 28 points. He had scored 29 by halftime Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 93, Washington 85 -- Otis Thorpe had 27 points and 14 rebounds and the 
Rockets turned back a Washington rally in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets shot only 36.8%, but they made a run after falling behind by 17 
points in the third quarter. They closed to within five points on Chris 
Webber's basket with 1:40 to play but still lost their third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 98, Detroit 78 -- Scottie Pippen and Toni Kukoc got hot in time to 
rescue the Bulls from a horrific third quarter in their victory over the 
injury-depleted Pistons at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Pippen finished with 31 points and Kukoc a career-high 28 as the Bulls beat 
Detroit for the second time in three games. The Pistons, who had 13 of their 28 
turnovers in the second quarter, were playing without injured Grant Hill, 
Lindsey Hunter and Oliver Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 107, Milwaukee 101 -- Alonzo Mourning scored 20 points at Charlotte 
to lead the Hornets over the Bucks, who have lost 10 of their last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied at 90 with 3:03 remaining, Charlotte tightened its 
defense, forcing Glenn Robinson to miss two jump shots. Larry Johnson scored a 
key basket inside and Dell Curry made a three-point shot to give the Hornets a 
97-92 lead with 1:17 to play. Charlotte then made eight consecutive free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 85, Minnesota 83 -- Andrew Lang's short hook shot in the lane with 
1:21 to play in overtime lifted the Hawks in Atlanta and gave Coach Lenny 
Wilkens his 935th victory, three shy of Red Auerbach's NBA record. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the fifth victory in seven games for the Hawks and the third loss in a 
row for Minnesota, which has dropped 10 of its last 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 90, Indiana 83 -- Mark Price passed to Greg Dreiling for a dunk and 
drove for a layup at the start of the fourth quarter as the Cavaliers ran off 
the first eight points of the period to beat the Pacers at Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got mesmerized with the three-point shot," Coach Larry Brown said. "Any 
time you shoot only 14 free throws and are one for 14 from three-point range, 
that's going to do you in." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss stopped Indiana's five-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Mills scored 17 points, John Williams 15 and Bobby Phills 14 for 
Cleveland, which won its third in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Rik Smits led Indiana with 26 points, and Dale Davis scored 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento 112, Golden State 107 -- Rookie reserve Brian Grant scored 13 of 
his 15 points in the fourth quarter at Oakland as the Kings handed the Warriors 
their seventh loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant's dunk with one second to play in the third quarter gave Sacramento its 
first lead of the game, 78-77. He then scored all six in a 6-2 run to help the 
Kings open a 104-94 lead with 4:10 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch Richmond had 29 points and Olden Polynice 20 to lead the Kings, who have 
won five of their last six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Hardaway had 23 points for the Warriors.

'TO LIVE': A SWEEPING SAGA OF MODERN CHINA; MOVIE REVIEW: ZHANG YIMOU'S SUPERB 
FILM POSSESSES BOTH VAST SCOPE AND INTIMACY, RICHNESS OF INCIDENT AND AN 
AWARENESS OF THE QUIXOTIC ROLE FATE PLAYS IN ALL OUR DESTINIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Zhang Yimou's masterful, stirring "To Live" takes us from the turbulent, 
treacherous China of the '40s civil war to the brutal Cultural Revolution and 
beyond through the lives of one couple, who in the course of hardship and 
tragedy emerge as symbolic of the ordinary Chinese and their capacity to endure 
and to hope for a better future. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Yu Hua's "Lifetimes," the superb "To Live" is fortunately more 
absorbing than grueling -- and it is indeed the latter. It possesses both vast 
scope and intimacy, humor and sorrow, complex characterizations, richness of 
incident and an awareness of the quixotic role fate plays in all our destinies. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the latest triumph of China's most renowned filmmaker, whose 1988 debut 
feature, "Red Sorghum," won international acclaim and whose "Ju Dou" (1990) and 
"Raise the Red Lantern" (1992) received Oscar nominations for best foreign 
film. In adapting his own novel to the screen, Yu Hua's co-writer was Lu Wei, 
who also wrote the screenplay for Chen Kaige's towering "Farewell My 
Concubine." 
</P>
<P>
 In a small village in Northern China an indolent young man, Xu Fugui (Ge You), 
gambles away his family's fortune to the extent that he loses his family's 
ancient, magnificent townhouse. The man (Ni Dahong) to whom Fugui lost his 
ancestral home refuses to lend him money but lends him something that proves to 
be of far greater value: an old chest filled with his shadow puppets -- the one 
thing that diverted Fugui during his gambling days. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a real aptitude for putting on puppet shows with these lacy figures; 
more than once the puppets, so suggestive of the human predicament, will prove 
to be his salvation and that of his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Fugui's beautiful wife, Jiazhen (Gong Li), dreams modestly of living a quiet 
life with her family but almost immediately the Communists win control of the 
country. From here on the couple's life will be hard, blighted by terrible 
tragedy yet also sustained by their steadfast mutual love and devotion, and by 
warm camaraderie of friends and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 By now what many mainstream Chinese have had to endure under Communism is 
common knowledge around the world, yet "To Live's" forthright depictions of the 
hardships and sacrifices incurred by the revolution itself, the Great Leap 
Forward in industrial production in the '50s and the horrors of the Cultural 
Revolution of the mid-'60s to the mid-'70s, have brought down the wrath of the 
Chinese government upon Zhang and his film. 
</P>
<P>
 As punishment for Zhang illegally distributing his picture, he has been 
forbidden to make films in China with foreign financing for the next two years, 
and he and Gong Li, the radiant star of all his films, may not present or 
discuss in any context their film, which earlier this year won the grand jury 
prize at Cannes and a best actor award for Ge You. 
</P>
<P>
 The cruel irony of this banishment is that the epic vision of "To Live" moves 
beyond the critical to the historical; it celebrates all people at anytime, 
anyplace, who persist in the face of cataclysmic social, political and economic 
upheaval. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also notably fair-minded; you could easily make a case that the advent 
of communism was the instrument of Fugui's salvation, turning him from a 
totally irresponsible archetypal representative of the decadent ruling class 
into a proletarian hero, a strong and responsible husband and father in the 
face of grim adversity and loss. Similarly, the man (Niu Ben) who becomes the 
leader of the new Communist system in Fugui's village is a wise, kind 
individual, a practical man and not a knee-jerk political ideologue. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Zhang does not shy away from the horrors of the crazed Cultural 
Revolution with its cadres of hysterical young people raging through the 
streets, pursuing their savage inquisition. Yet in the film's most stunning 
sequence, Zhang expresses the absurdity of this long ordeal by injecting dark 
humor in a tragic situation. 
</P>
<P>
 When a young woman in childbirth starts hemorrhaging, student nurses do not 
know what to do because the hospital's professional staff has been carted off 
to a concentration camp. A frail doctor (Zhao Yuxiu) is in the last moment 
sprung from captivity, but he's so weak from beatings and starvation that his 
oddly comical nonstop gorging on dumplings makes him too sick to attend to the 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "To Live," which has been gloriously photographed by Lu Ye, is a remarkable 
accomplishment, spanning many years with both vibrant passion and absolute 
conviction. It is the most straightforward of all of Zhang's films, and its 
simplicity of style serves perfectly its great themes, which are timeless and 
universal.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'NELL': FROM, BUT NOT OF, THIS WORLD; JODIE FOSTER DELIVERS A 
STRONG PERFORMANCE AS A WOMAN UNTOUCHED BY MODERN SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Deep in rural North Carolina, in a secluded cabin hidden away in an especially 
remote corner of the Great Smoky Mountains, a singular young woman is 
discovered, someone who has lived her entire life without making contact with 
the forces of society. 
</P>
<P>
 Uneasy around other people, speaking a unique language, this person inhabits a 
universe all her own. So the quandary for her discoverers becomes how best to 
integrate those special qualities with what the workaday world has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from being the plot line of "Nell," this setup also summarizes the 
predicament the film's creators were presented with. Challenged by a remarkable 
performance by Jodie Foster in the title role, they were unable to construct 
anything that did justice to it, making the actress and her fine work seem as 
out of place in this movie as Nell and her naive doings are back in 
civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 Though "Nell" is a work of fiction, adapted from a play called "Idioglossia" 
by Mark Handley, the sudden appearance of people who have lived without human 
society is historically accurate. In fact, two previous films on the subject, 
Francois Truffaut's "The Wild Child" and Werner Herzog's "The Mystery of Kasper 
Hauser," were based on real situations. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of those films starred unknowns in the uncivilized role, and it is not 
difficult to understand why. The qualities that make a star a star -- a 
familiar voice, face, acting style -- are very difficult to efface, yet 
effacement is necessary if audiences are to be convinced that they are watching 
a renegade human being, not an actor playing a kooky part. 
</P>
<P>
 The barriers to this happening are so great that even a performer of Foster's 
abilities is not immediately convincing. But she works hard at making Nell come 
alive, using a keening vocal timbre, a gift for speaking the character's 
language as if it meant something, and a willingness to tap the kind of inner 
fury she has not shown much before. By the time "Nell" is over, Foster's 
passionate performance will make almost everyone believe. 
</P>
<P>
 The first person to discover Nell is Dr. Jerome Lovell (Liam Neeson), called 
to her cabin because of the death of Nell's mother, a hermit of some notoriety 
in the nearby town of Robbinsville. A hunky free spirit who dislikes making 
plans, Dr. Lovell is delighted by Nell's rural surroundings but uncertain about 
what should be done with this young woman who is a stranger to standard 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Dr. Paula Olsen (Natasha Richardson), an all-business scientist whose 
specialty is disturbed children. She has not the smallest doubt about what to 
do with Nell: take her out of the woods, lock her in a lab and place her under 
supervised clinical observation for the rest of recorded time. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lovell, a fiend for fresh air, disagrees and goes to court, convincing a 
judge that until more is known about Nell and what she wants, the young woman 
stays where she is. Which means that both doctors end up camping out at Nell's 
doorstep, observing her, trying to learn her language, and, in whatever time is 
left over, having philosophical debates about her future. 
</P>
<P>
 The issues Lovell and Olsen thrash over -- questions about whether it is 
healthy to live an entire life completely alone or how someone like Nell might 
handle the commotion her inevitable fame would bring -- ought to be interesting 
ones, but they and the entire movie are hampered by several defects. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, unlike the medical controversy in, say, "Lorenzo's Oil," these 
two doctors are not having a fair fight. In today's pervasive anti-science, 
anti-cities environment, all it takes is one vision of natural Nell dancing 
alone in the luminous moonlight and one glance at Dr. Olsen's officious 
supervisor (Richard Libertini) to figure out which way this movie has stacked 
the deck. 
</P>
<P>
 Making matters worse is the clunky, awkward dialogue playwright Handley and 
fellow screenwriter William Nicholson have come up with, language that makes it 
difficult to view the doctors as real people despite the presence of fine 
actors like Neeson and Richardson in the roles. Either excessively theatrical 
or too on-the-nose (a problem it shares with Nicholson's previous 
"Shadowlands"), the words here make one realize how lucky Nell is to have a 
language of her own. 
</P>
<P>
 And though Michael Apted has been dealt a hand rife with artificial crises, he 
has not helped things much with his unconvincing direction. Too much that might 
have been genuinely thought-provoking in this film has been sacrificed to 
enhance audience tearfulness, and that is unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, however, the strength of Foster's spooky performance makes "Nell" 
more effective and worthwhile than it otherwise deserves to be. And it is just 
because we come to care about that unusual young woman that we wish she were in 
a better movie, but that was not to be.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'QUEEN MARGOT': RICH AND FULL OF VERVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood doesn't make many grand-scale costumey historical romances anymore 
-- the kind of film that opens with a long crawl crammed with facts and dates 
and dynastical data. Movies are so good at taking us back in time that it's a 
shame so few do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Queen Margot," derived from an Alexander Dumas romance, is rich and full of 
verve. Director Patrice Chereau, an avant-garde theater and opera director best 
known for his massive modernization of Wagner's Ring cycle in Bayreuth in the 
late '70s, keeps the action buzzing and the faces looming. It's unusual to see 
a period film -- it's set in 1572, at the time of the Saint Bartholomew's Day 
Massacre -- that moves to a contemporary beat without sacrificing realism. 
</P>
<P>
 Chereau, with co-screenwriter Daniele Thompson, moves right into the torrid, 
horrific intrigue between the Catholics and the Protestants. He revels in the 
court intrigue, the scheming, the deviousness. You may not be able to sort out 
all the players and the plotting -- at least not without an encyclopedia and 
penlight handy -- but the broad historical outline survives. 
</P>
<P>
 And Chereau has cast actors with an operatic mien: Marguerite of Valois 
(Margot) is played by Isabelle Adjani, and her mother, Catherine of Medici, the 
Catholic Queen Mother of France, is played by Virna Lisi, who won the 1994 best 
actress award at Cannes for her performance. Their bond is obvious: Their faces 
are stamped with a larger-than-life furiousness. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama is propelled by the arranged (by Catherine) marriage of Margot to 
the Protestant Henri of Navarre (Daniel Auteuil). This union to reconcile the 
French turns out to be a ploy by Catherine to attract thousands of Protestants 
to Paris, where, six days after the wedding, they are destroyed en masse in the 
streets, in churches, in the Louvre. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saint Bartholomew Day's Massacre, which D. W. Griffith also dramatized in 
"Intolerance," is an orgy of bloodletting that threatens to flood both 
Catholics and Protestants in its wake. Margot, no friend of the Protestants, 
ends up their sympathizer. She forms an affection for Henri and a passion for 
the Protestant Lord of La Mole (Vincent Perez). She rebels against Catherine 
and her brother Charles IX (Jean-Hugues Anglade), and for a time becomes their 
captive. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult imagining Margot in captivity. In grand romantic tradition, her 
only captivator is La Mole. It's a passion that even survives his death. (Hint: 
She owes a lot to the court embalmer.) 
</P>
<P>
 Adjani, of course, is no stranger to grand passion in the movies. As Adele 
Hugo in Truffaut's "Story of Adele H," Adjani gave the definite crazed-by-love 
performance. Her Margot isn't in the same league with her Adele -- and the 
movie isn't at all comparable to Truffaut's as a study in passion -- but Adjani 
still burns a hole in the screen. Probably no major actress in movie history 
has managed to look as perpetually, ravishingly youthful as Adjani. She looks a 
couple of years older than she did in "Adele H," which came out almost 20 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisi, unrecognizable from her Hollywood days in '60s films like "How to Murder 
Your Wife" and "Assault on a Queen," gives a terrific dragon-lady performance. 
With her black veils and high domed forehead, she's a Medici right out of 
"Invaders From Mars." Lisi has a harsh raspy voice without a shade of lilt or 
sensuality. Her dark rage is almost comic in its magisterial meanness but Lisi 
doesn't camp it up. No one in the film does, with the possible exception of 
Anglade, who turns Charles IX into a reeling wreck -- a bloodstained banshee of 
a king. 
</P>
<P>
 At a running time of 141 minutes -- trimmed 23 minutes from the Cannes version 
-- "Queen Margot" isn't always brisk. The intrigues get a bit thick, and after 
awhile, the costume design (by Moidele Bickel) and the cinematography (by the 
great Phillipe Rousselot) overwhelm the court shenanigans. "Queen Margot" is 
far from great but it doesn't make the standard mistake of most movie romances 
-- it doesn't confuse authenticity with dullness. These days a period movie 
that brings you unabashedly into the period is rare. 
</P>
<P>
 * MPAA rating: Unrated. Times guidelines: It includes beheadings, garottings, 
and much bloodletting .

 Newton, the Highest Bidder: Wayne Newton didn't let Chapter 11 bankruptcy stop

were worth, said Jennifer Smith, a lawyer for Newton's creditors who catalogued 
his lavish spending in Reno, Nev., court documents. Since filing for Chapter 11 
bankruptcy protection in August 1992, Newton has made about a dozen purchases 
from Sotheby's, the documents show. Among them: A cigarette case belonging to 
the late Errol Flynn (estimated value $900-$1,200; Newton's purchase price was 
$7,150), and a painting by Pierre-Auguste Renoir entitled "Nu" (estimated value 
$18,000-$24,000; bought for $43,700). A federal bankruptcy court hearing is

 The Santa Monica Symphony may not be a model of precision music-making, but a 
veteran listener could find much to admire and enjoy in the second concert of 
its 49th season at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Music director Allen Robert Gross, now in his fourth season, lead briskly and 
breezily.He got his players, a mixture of college, community and, in the solo 
positions, professional musicians, to play with wonderful spirit and freedom: 
This orchestra did not play tentatively, even in such difficult music as 
Richard Strauss' "Don Juan," which opened the concert. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Auditorium acoustics, with its clear highs and resonant lows, proved 
friendly to the orchestra. In this atmosphere, Beethoven's First Symphony 
romped joyously, its instrumental detail frank and characterful, its accents 
emphatic and springy. Despite some moments of ensemble raggedness, there was 
never a hint of effortfulness in the playing. In all its essentials, the music 
bloomed. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen-year-old flutist Gregory Lawrence Jefferson was the lively, 
confident soloist in Mozart's Flute Concerto No. 2, K. 314. With a finely 
focused tone, compact vibrato, firm finger work and pointed articulation, 
Jefferson jumped all technical hurdles with abandon. 
</P>
<P>
 His musical inflection was straightforward but far from mechanical. He 
projected the direction of a line, knows and communicates its hills and curves. 
 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the program, conductor and orchestra rollicked and tip-toed 
through Johann Strauss Jr.'s "Roses From the South" Waltz. TIMOTHY MANGAN

MUSIC REVIEWS; SOUTHWEST CHAMBER TURNS TO BLAKE AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In complement to the exhibition of William Blake's illuminated prints at the 
Huntington Library, the Southwest Chamber Music Society offered its second 
program of music from Blake's time and on his words. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, that included Schubert's "Death and the Maiden" String Quartet, 
grand-prize winner (unofficial) for the most overplayed work locally in the 
last few seasons.Doubly unfortunate was its actual performance, before a 
sold-out audience in the Main Gallery of the library, Monday night, which the 
gods seemed to frown upon. Perhaps they were saying, "Enough, already!" 
</P>
<P>
 The normally solid Southwest String Quartet -- with a new second violinist, 
Susan Jensen (it wasn't her fault), and its regulars, violinist Peter Marsh, 
violist Jan Karlin and cellist Roger Lebow -- gave an extremely rickety 
run-through of the work, poorly tuned and executed on both the individual and 
ensemble levels, and at the same time over-the-top expressively as if to make 
up for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease appears to have infected the program notes as well, which made 
such statements as: "Without any exaggeration, it can be said that within 
Schubert, and most impressively within this composition, lies the foundation of 
20th-Century Expressionism," and worse. A similarly disheveled and forced 
account of Beethoven's String Quartet, Opus 95, had opened the concert. An off 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Happily, in between, tenor Jonathan Mack and oboist Stuart Horn gave polished 
readings to Vaughan Williams' "Ten Blake Songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Spare, unassuming and graceful settings, these songs unfold in modal, lyrical 
counterpoint, the tenor and oboe parts surprisingly independent, but cut from 
the same pastoral, folk-style cloth. The two performers uncovered the blush, 
bloom and sadness of the work with both intellectual and technical refinement.

THEATER REVIEW; 'LOS FAUSTINOS' A COMMUNITY CORNERSTONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are many versions of the Faust legend, but few can boast a devil who 
assumes the form of Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of Bernardo Solano's "Los Faustinos," Mephisto, (Christopher Liam 
Moore) disguised as the GOP officeholder, visits a Los Angeles neighborhood and 
beams at the Latino residents, saying he hopes they voted for Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Faustinos" is both set and staged in Watts, where the Cornerstone Theater 
Company has embarked on a 15-month project to nurture drama in the community. 
Cornerstone members who have performed similar community-based work nationwide, 
hope their stay will foster a resident company in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors are heavily involved in this second Watts-based production 
(after a double bill at Watts Towers Art Center). Local kids run the box office 
and usher viewers to metal folding chairs in the theater of San Miguel Parish 
Hall. Amateurs from the community compose the bulk of the 34-member cast, with 
a few Cornerstone pros like Moore in key roles. 
</P>
<P>
 The results are fascinating -- community theater in the best and truest sense. 
Solano and director Juliette Carrillo have not come to this neighborhood to 
patronize or preach about social injustice, the tongue-in-cheek allusion to 
Gov. Wilson notwithstanding. Instead, they have gone about the serious task of 
blending classic and contemporary, local and universal, reflecting the reality 
of Watts within the framework of a popular legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Solano's script, written in English and Spanish, follows the Faustinos, an 
impoverished Chicano clan whose members agree to sell their souls to Mephisto 
in exchange for various forms of temporal bliss: a movie career, a bigger 
house, a high-powered computer, a wide-screen television. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo's staging is both sophisticated and church-pageant simple. La Muerte 
(Shishir Kurup, made up as a human skeleton) narrates the tale and leads a 
three-piece band providing incidental music. A climactic meal at the Faustino 
household is presented as the tableau from Da Vinci's painting of "The Last 
Supper."  
</P>
<P>
 If the drama sags a bit, it's partly because Solano skimps on scenes that show 
the Faustinos enjoying their ill-gotten gains -- the kind of scenes that gave 
Christopher Marlowe's "Doctor Faustus" its kick. Occasionally, too, the 
ensemble's enthusiasm can't overcome some members' limited skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet "Los Faustinos" has more grit, vitality and spirit than countless 
high-gloss productions. It's the kind of home-grown theater even a Republican 
governor could love. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Los Faustinos," San Miguel Parish Hall, 2214 E. 108th St., Watts. Friday, 
Saturday, 7 p.m., Saturday, Sunday, 2 p.m. Ends Sunday. (213) 567-8634.

OF GOATS, HEROES AND CRISIS MANAGEMENT; CLAMPING DOWN ON ORANGE COUNTY'S FISCAL 
HEMORRHAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, a new Times poll has found Orange County residents really 
angry, pointing fingers and worrying about their future after investment losses 
prompted the county to declare bankruptcy. But even as that survey discerned 
little confidence in the county's ability to manage its way out of the crisis, 
local officials to their credit were finally beginning to get a containment 
boom around the mess. 
</P>
<P>
 The big question, of course, is how much spilled oil will have gotten away 
before things are really under control. The county, however, has consolidated 
its response to the emergency and begun to display a belated but somewhat 
greater openness about the degree of its exposure. That has to be something of 
a confidence builder, however modest. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's fiscal position remains thoroughly dicey, and the opportunities 
for decisions even now that make goats or heroes of their architects cannot be 
underestimated. At the same time, there is some evidence that the team the 
county has assembled to deal with the crisis is beginning to get a handle on 
the situation. This is a welcome change from having the Board of Supervisors 
oversee what amounted to a gambling casino operated with public funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the controversial moves now have a kind of logic. In the early days of 
the crisis, the county's bankruptcy attorney, Bruce Bennett, had to decide 
whether to sue to block the sale by New York brokerage houses of billions of 
dollars of collateral covering unpaid loans. The wisdom of suing later rather 
than sooner will play out in the courts, but the strategy was apparently 
deliberate and gives evidence of designed crisis management. In addition to 
Bennett's firm, Stutman, Treister & Glatt, the county has brought on board 
former state Treasurer Thomas Hayes, as a special financial adviser, and an 
advisory team from Salomon Bros. to unravel the county's investments while 
trying to protect it from interest rate increases. A team of accountants from 
Arthur Andersen & Co. is led by Thomas E. Daxon. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Hayes answered a big question hanging over this crisis by 
acknowledging that the amount lost from the beleaguered Orange County 
investment pool exceeded $2 billion. His recommendation that the Board of 
Supervisors launch an immediate restructuring program of county securities -- 
but "not a fire sale" -- was further evidence of resolve to deal decisively 
with the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The county had already curbed all but emergency spending, halted hearings on 
tax appeals and worked out an agreement to keep school funds in a separate 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 As the impact of this crisis affected investment funds across the country, as 
schools and transportation officials scrambled to ease fears and preserve 
services, the county has needed to send strong signals that it is getting its 
house in order. The recent Times poll shows the degree to which there was no 
confidence in the old regime; a full 86% of respondents had some fairly 
specific ideas indeed about who was responsible for the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's new spirit of disclosure and crisis management holds a message 
for other municipalities and states that may find themselves exposed by degree 
from their wrong bets on interest rates. Get a handle on the problem right 
away, go public with your plan and quickly spread out that containment boom. In 
the final analysis, you just can't hide.

AFFORDABLE HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William Fulton's column ("Behind L.A.'s Homeless Crisis," Opinion, Dec. 4) 
addresses one of the crucial issues facing the delivery of housing in our 
region, and indeed, the quality of life we are creating. What at one point may 
have been an ideal worth fighting for -- single-family homes on separate lots 
-- has now become an obstacle. As a region which will soon be home to 10 
million people, we cannot even hope to house ourselves in suburban tract homes. 
Recognizing this -- and creating city living patterns that will provide for it 
-- is one of the tasks for our local officials. Yet, as Fulton points out, not 
only former City Councilman Zev Yaroslasvky but others hide their heads in the 
sand and assume that they can keep this outmoded ideal for at least some of 
their constituents -- usually those that contribute the most -- and let the 
others be damned. The growth will come, but it will not be pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 The affordable housing incentives ordinance is nothing more than common sense 
applied to the delivery of housing for a multimillion-person population, yet it 
has been languishing for over two years. City Council members who publicly call 
for quicker and cheaper development become, in fact, champions of NIMBYs when 
they balk at its passage. Our local leadership fiddles while the city simmers.

 The Southern California Assn. of Non-Profit Housing is an association of 
affordable housing developers. * Fulton's observations are not only highly 
relevant to public housing problems but also education and other major social 
ills facing Los Angeles and, indeed, the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In this crushing climate of political correctness, too frequently lawmakers 
and public officials lose sight of social and economic reality and pursue 
unrealistic goals to assuage spokespersons for the needy rather than the needy 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 This political pandering has also forced public school educators to lower 
standards so that "everyone can graduate" -- whether qualified or not -- and to 
go to community colleges, also at taxpayer expense. Political correctness will 
also destroy the financial viability of our public health-care system if we 
continue to make it available to everyone from non-citizens to terminally ill 
people needlessly kept alive on support systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's do everything we can to help the financially and intellectually 
underprivileged and the physically helpless, but let's use common sense in 
providing the assistance they so critically need.

BASE CLOSURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was both angered and horrified by your story on base closures (Dec. 5). To 
suggest that the process has "generally worked well" is as inane as it is 
untrue.The process has worked about as well as a three-legged racehorse. 
Invaluable training and maintenance facilities have been forever lost in the 
mad race for short-term savings. If you would take the time to talk with 
officers and planners in the field, rather than the out-of-touch, 
office-sequestered "experts," you'd find this to be true. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is that building new facilities for relocated units and equipment is 
costing far more than the present infrastructure. Then you discuss plans for 
future base closures. Future base closures? You can't be serious! If this 
nonsense continues much longer, there will be no military left!

$100 THEFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 67-year-old woman momentarily blacked out at a teller machine inside a 
Rancho Cucamonga discount department store on Dec. 2. While she was in this 
state someone reached inside the machine and stole the $100 she was in the 
process of withdrawing for Christmas gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 To the person who did this, I want you to know some things about her. At 67 
her health isn't what it used to be. After raising six children and losing her 
husband of 45 years two years ago, she lives alone on a fixed income of a small 
pension and Social Security. She started budgeting in June to be able to buy 
gifts for her family. It wasn't only her money you took, you chipped away at 
her spirit, her independence, her feeling of being able to take care of 
herself.  
</P>
<P>
 After the tears were dried, she blamed herself for fainting. Her comment was 
that she hoped it was someone who needed it for his or her children. I doubt 
it, and as her daughter, I want to lash out at you and say "how dare you!"  
</P>
<P>
 To the strangers who helped her and showed her kindness, my heartfelt thanks 
for being there when I wasn't. To the person who is $100 richer, you don't know 
how poor you really are. In this season of "goodwill to others," shame on you.

GUN CONTROL AND THE CONSTITUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is no constitutional provision for individual ownership of guns, despite 
the assertion of Glenn Harlan Reynolds ("2nd Amendment: Something for 
Everyone," Commentary, Dec. 5). Article 1, Section 8 is specific about the 
issue. Congress is to "provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the 
militia." The U.S. Constitution also directs the militia to "suppress 
insurrections," which is just the opposite of what Reynolds argues. There is no 
mention about private ownership of guns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Second Amendment doesn't countenance private ownership of guns, either. 
Instead, the Second Amendment specifies the need for a "well regulated" 
militia, and only Congress has the power to regulate a militia. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds also urges that tyrannical governments can be overthrown because 
modern armies have consistently lost to armed civilians. Yet not one of his 
examples involved internal rebellion against a tyrannical government. Reynolds 
would have done better to look to our own Civil War as an example.  
</P>

<P>
 * Thank you for printing Reynolds' article on the Second Amendment. It is the 
best perspective I have ever read in The Times on the gun issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust Reynolds hopes will develop between gun owners and regulators can 
only come to pass if travesties like New York's gun-registration-this-year, 
confiscation-next-year programs are reversed. This sort of governmental ruse 
takes the call for goodwill off the shoulders of gun owners.

 * One must wonder what the reaction of the Founding Fathers would be if they 
had been confronted by today's proliferation of guns in America. Reynolds' 
arguments should be useful to present-day street gangs protesting government 
denial of their vision of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.

 * As a survivor of the Nazi concentration camps, I can assure Reynolds that 
the fate of the European Jews and Gypsies would not have been different by 
having guns at their disposal. A naive statement indeed, since Jews and Gypsies 
were highly outnumbered by the Nazis and their collaborators (the people of 
Hungary, Slovakia, France, Poland, etc.). 
</P>
<P>
 The Second Amendment is totally obsolete today. Times have changed and people 
have changed within those times.

 * Re "Fear of Guns Tips the Scale," editorial, Dec. 2: 
</P>
<P>
 What is the difference between these two questions: "Do you favor reducing the 
national debt?" and "Will you write a check for $5,000, payable to the U.S. 
Treasury, to do your part to reduce the national debt?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now, what is the difference between these two questions: "Do you favor tougher 
gun control laws as a means to reduce crime?" and "Will you restrict your right 
to lawfully own a firearm and voluntarily surrender all handguns currently in 
your possession as a means to reduce crime?" 
</P>
<P>
 If the UCI researchers want meaningful poll results, they should ask the right 
question. The scale has been tipped by the alarming escalation of brazen, gang- 
and drug-related crime. The police cannot stop the problem on the street. Why 
should I believe that they can stop it if it comes to my front door?

A SMART DECISION ON AUTO SMOG CHECKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week's decision by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to relax its 
rules governing auto emission inspections was perhaps inevitable. Not just 
because the new Republican majority in Congress may signal a less tolerant 
attitude toward environmental regulations. Not just because the proposed 
federal scheme, which relied heavily upon centralized testing stations, could 
prove enormously inconvenient and hence, enormously unpopular. And not just 
because some states were so resistant to the federal rules that they seemed 
willing to violate them and lose highway funds and other federal aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, in loosening its widely criticized smog rules, the EPA appears to have 
also recognized that its rules rest on an unsteady scientific foundation; 
research in recent years has revealed substantial uncertainty about which cars 
really cause how much smog and under what conditions. For this reason, the 
EPA's decision was not only politically inevitable but technically appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA Administrator Carol Browner has reportedly told a group of governors that 
they can employ options other than central test stations to meet new 
vehicle-testing regulations, as long as the overall pollution-reduction levels 
mandated by the 1990 Clean Air Act are met. For example, a state could require 
that only older, presumably dirtier-running cars go to a central inspection 
station. Or a state could choose simpler, less costly testing equipment that 
might not screen cars as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Browner's decision means that California can proceed with its plan, beginning 
next year, requiring initially that only 15% of all cars be tested at the 
special centers; the others would continue to go to service stations for smog 
checks.  
</P>
<P>
 The EPA announcement seems an acknowledgment of the substantial scientific 
uncertainties that dog the 10-year old smog-check program in California and its 
counterparts in other states. Emissions from mobile sources, primarily cars, 
may be far higher than once thought.  
</P>
<P>
 But cleaning up dirty cars eludes such easy or blanket solutions as central 
test stations. Most mobile-source emissions come from perhaps 5% to 10% of cars 
on the road, the so-called "gross polluters." Most of these are older cars, but 
not all of them. No one fully understands what causes some cars to become gross 
polluters. Moreover, the same car might pass a smog inspection one day and fail 
the next. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA's decision on emission rules signals its ability to read the political 
tea leaves. But the agency and individual states should now take the 
opportunity to advance the scientific understanding of auto pollution and the 
search for more effective -- and palatable -- regulatory schemes to cut smog.

ANOTHER 'BOYS TOWN' FANTASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Speaker-designate Newt Gingrich urges First Lady Hillary Clinton to rent the 
video of "Boys Town," a heartwarming 1938 saga about a bucolic home for wayward 
boys and juvenile delinquents, to get an idea of what he means when he proposes 
orphanages to care for poor children whose parents lose their welfare benefits. 
If "Boys Town" is what Gingrich has in mind, he needs to start printing money. 
</P>
<P>
 The real Boys Town, near Omaha, Neb., is no longer a traditional orphanage. 
And it costs more than $40,000 a year to care for a troubled, neglected or 
abused teen-ager who is lucky enough to get into the famous facility. That's 
more than it costs annually on average to keep an inmate in a California state 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys Town is expensive because the boys -- and girls -- who are there do not 
live in crowded dormitories. They live in small group homes, with surrogate 
parents. The family setting teaches youngsters how to function in families. But 
the approach, which also provides intensive supervision and counseling, is 
extremely expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 The money is well-spent. Boys Town often works after other placements -- 
including foster care -- fail. But where will those dollars come from if 
millions of poor children require residential care because welfare reform cuts 
off their parents? Raising taxes is out of the question in the 
Republican-dominated Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 A welfare-reform bill proposed by the House Republicans in the "contract with 
America" would throw a lot of families off of the rolls and allow states to use 
the savings to establish orphanages. The savings gained from denying welfare 
would barely allow public facilities to provide gruel for the large number of 
children who would need care. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare is relatively cheap. It costs about $2,500 a child per year. It also 
keeps children with their families. Loving, caring parents should not lose 
their children simply because they are poor, uneducated or unemployed. Poverty 
is not a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping families together is not always in the best interest of youngsters 
because of drug abuse, alcoholism, violence, neglect and other dangers. Nearly 
a half million children live in foster care, which costs twice as much as 
welfare. Substitute care is a bargain when it develops independent and 
disciplined adults. But bad foster parents and group homes turn out troubled 
adults who become homeless or resort to welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich would let them depend on charities, which are already overburdened. 
In the best of times, charities cannot provide food, shelter and clothing for 
millions of poor children. 
</P>
<P>
 Government is obliged to provide for poor children. The current debate rages 
over the best way to help poor parents and their children without encouraging 
dependency or increasing the cost of public assistance. America's troubled and 
neglected children could use 1,000 Boys Towns. That's not going to happen, no 
matter what Newt Gingrich says or Hillary Clinton watches.

ELIZABETH GLASER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another angel among us has passed on. The voice of Elizabeth Glaser is silent 
this day, stilled by the killer AIDS (Dec. 4). 
</P>
<P>
 I have no doubt that she herself would take no offense at how harsh and tragic 
that sentence reads. Nor would she fail to see the other, hopeful side. And 
that is, that in silence now, we might hear. 
</P>
<P>
 After reading accounts of Glaser's activism and courage in the face of AIDS -- 
in fact, giving it a new face itself, that of a woman, compassionate and driven 
-- I listened. I listened to my own silent tears. And reflected on her powerful 
words. 
</P>
<P>
 Glaser was obviously more than those words. She was a woman of action. Rather 
than cast blame, she chose instead to shed light on our collective 
responsibility in the AIDS crisis. And she used the word -- powerful tool that 
it can be -- in conjunction with that action. It became her life's work to 
bring awareness, raise funds and challenge governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Her call on Washington in 1992, so stunning and direct, moved many to tears. 
It is a call still in need of answers and actions. May we each become people of 
the same.

 * The saddest thing I read in the paper Dec. 4 wasn't about politics, or 
Bosnia, or welfare, or racial conflicts, or even murders -- oh, they're sad all 
right, but not the saddest. 
</P>
<P>
 I was hit hardest by the unfairness of the death of one good person, Elizabeth 
Glaser, the woman who accidentally contracted AIDS from a transfusion, passed 
it on to her two children and died. There's no one to blame, there's no 
salvation or forgiveness and there's no logic. All that's left is pain, and 
that is what's so sad.

POSTCARDS FROM THE EDGE OF HELL; SARAJEVO: SHELLS FALL AGAIN, ELECTRICITY 
FALTERS AND WATER TRICKLES. ARTISTS' POSTERS SHRINK AND COLORS DISAPPEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNA HUSARSKA, Anna Husarska is a contributing editor of the New Republic 
and a staff writer for the New Yorker.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The artists' credo, in charming fractured English, sounds like a message in a 
bottle: "Because of completely siege of concentration camp called Sarajevo and 
because of no possibility of any communication with Outside World, we decided 
to print our postcards and in that way to reach The World. It would be our way 
of lifting a multiple blockade in which we are living." 
</P>
<P>
 Dada and Bojan Hadzihalilovic, who designed this series of postcards called 
"Greetings from Sarajevo" are a typical Bosnian-blend household: Dada, 27, is a 
Muslim, her husband, Bojan, 29, is a Serbo-Jew. They still sign their work 
"Trio Sarajevo," but work as a duo because their colleague from the Academy of 
Fine Arts, Leila Mulabegovic, left before the shelling started there in April, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted to submit their work to the International Bienalle of Posters in 
Warsaw last spring, but lack of large-format paper reduced their posters to 
postcards and the siege kept them from leaving the town or sending the 
portfolio out. (They could travel, they say, if the Coca-Cola company would 
only sue them for copyright theft and extradite them to the United States.) 
Shortages of ink limit their palette to red and occasionally blue or green but 
they recall, without much modesty, Picasso's blue period. 
</P>
<P>
 The most disturbing setback to their enterprise, however, is the enemy fire. 
Their apartment-studio is just a few blocks from the confrontation line, so 
first they moved the studio from the front room -- too exposed to mortar and 
sniper fire -- to the kitchen. They cooked in the bathroom. When electricity 
for their computer and laser printer became too erratic, they moved to an 
office of the former Olympic center, which as headquarters of the United 
Nations forces had a priority power supply. After the cease-fire in February, 
they returned to their apartment, which is back on the front line. 
</P>
<P>
 Dada and Bojan call the postcards a "nonprofit project." To survive, they are 
art directors for several Sarajevo weeklies and they design identity cards and 
uniforms for the Bosnian army, the police and the railways in exchange for 
booze, cigarettes, sugar, feta cheese and peas. 
</P>
<P>
 Electricity is again working only intermittently and the shelling that stopped 
for half a year has returned. Water cuts are more and more frequent, wood for 
heating is difficult to come by and the food situation is catastrophic, with no 
airlift into Sarajevo for more than two weeks and no convoys, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Dada and Bojan live just one block from the presidency building in Sarajevo, 
where two anti-tank missiles landed last week while Yasushi Akashi, the U.N. 
special envoy, was inside. They hate it when high-ranking U.N. people are in 
town because it increases the intensity of Bosnian Serb shelling around their 
apartment. Bojan asked me to remember them on New Year's Eve: It will be the 
1,001st night of war in Sarajevo.

CALIFORNIA COMMENTARY; LEGISLATIVE GAMES SHORTCHANGE VOTERS; TWO REPUBLICANS 
ENGENDER THE CHAOS, ONE BY VIOLATING A CONTRACT AND THE OTHER BY UNETHICAL 
BEHAVIOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL H. LOWENSTEIN, Daniel H. Lowenstein, a professor of law at UCLA, 
specializes in election law. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Voters in November elected a majority of Republicans to both houses of 
Congress. As a result, control of both houses is passing in an orderly manner 
to the GOP. That's the way democracy is supposed to work in America. 
</P>
<P>
 California voters elected Republicans in 41 out of 80 Assembly districts. When 
the Assembly convened last week, no one took control and all we got was chaos. 
That's not the way democracy is supposed to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is to blame? 
</P>
<P>
 Not Willie Brown and the Democrats. Politics ain't beanbag, as an old-time 
political boss once said, and Democrats have the right to fight for the values 
and constituency interests they were elected to defend. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are the Republicans to blame. Their walkout from the State Capitol last 
Tuesday was unseemly, but it was the only means available to prevent what the 
Republicans understandably regard as theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Real responsibility rests on the backs of two men who were elected to the 
Assembly as Republicans: Richard L. Mountjoy of Arcadia and Paul Horcher of 
Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy's is the more complicated case. After he won the Republican primary 
in June, the Senate seat in his district became vacant, requiring a special 
election. To save money, the special election was held on Election Day in 
November. Because of a quirk in California law, Mountjoy was on the ballot for 
both the Assembly and Senate seats. He was elected to both. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mountjoy declared for the Senate, he took an oath that he intended to 
serve if elected. He had taken a similar oath when he filed for the Assembly, 
but at that time he could not have known that a vacancy would arise in the 
Senate. When he became a candidate for the Senate, he asked voters to support 
him for the Assembly merely in order to bring about another special election, 
at which another Republican could run. Mountjoy modified his plans because of 
the close partisan division in the Assembly. He announced that he would be 
sworn in as a member of the Assembly, vote to help assure the selection of 
Republican Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga as Speaker and then assume his 
senatorial office. He obtained a legal opinion from the legislative counsel 
saying he could do this. 
</P>
<P>
 In a legal opinion requested by Willie Brown's staff, I concluded that both 
Mountjoy and the legislative counsel are wrong. The Senate and the Assembly, 
not the courts, are empowered to resolve the question under the state 
Constitution. In doing so, they should be guided by two fundamental principles 
that transcend the admittedly murky and arcane legal doctrines that both the 
legislative counsel and I considered. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Mountjoy should be held to his contract with the voters. Both formally, 
in the oaths he swore to, and informally, in the posture he took in his 
campaign, Mountjoy made it clear he would serve in the Senate if he was elected 
to both offices. The Legislature should treat those promises as binding. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, even if the legislators believe Mountjoy can now choose in which 
chamber to serve, it violates the basic constitutional requirement of a 
bicameral Legislature for him to go back and forth between the chambers at his 
own convenience. He should be forced to choose, once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy, then, should not be permitted to vote for the Assembly Speaker, at 
least unless he is willing to renounce his Senate seat. Horcher, on the other 
hand, unquestionably has the right to vote for Speaker, and there are no legal 
constraints on how he chooses to exercise that right. Although he was elected 
as a Republican, he voted for Democrat Brown for Speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher's vote was legal but irresponsible. Legislative elections and the 
Legislature itself are organized along party lines. There is much concern 
nowadays about our ability as voters to hold the government accountable. Our 
only realistic chance to do that is through the party system. One of the good 
things about this year's national election is that we now can feel quite 
certain about who is responsible for what happens in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher, by defecting from his party, undermines this system of partisan 
accountability. How were voters in the 60th District supposed to vote to 
replace Willie Brown as Speaker of the Assembly? Only by voting for Horcher, 
the listed Republican candidate on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher says that he has been treated badly by the Republicans in the Assembly 
and that the Assembly Republicans are too conservative for him. He has no right 
to undermine the mandate of the people in an election because of his personal 
grievances and opinions. No one forced him to run for reelection as a 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy should have been sworn in as a senator on Dec. 5 and played no part 
in the speakership contest. Horcher should have voted for Brulte and then, if 
he chose, quit the Republican Party.  
</P>
<P>
 If both men had done the right thing, Brulte would have been chosen by a 40-39 
margin and the people's choice on Election Day would have been carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, we got a tie and chaos. Great entertainment but lousy government. 
Even though Mountjoy and Horcher are both wrong, there is a big difference 
between the two cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy is acting openly and aboveboard. He is following a legislative 
counsel's opinion, presumably in good conscience. I believe his actions violate 
the letter and spirit of the Constitution, but there is nothing personally 
dishonorable in his behavior.  
</P>
<P>
 Horcher's actions are unethical. Often we think of ethics too narrowly. 
Avoidance of theft, corruption and the like are important, but the real meaning 
of ethics in public life is acceptance of the full measure of responsibility 
inherent in public service. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher is, as the Republicans charge, a political traitor. Fortunately, in 
California we have the right to recall elected officials who behave 
irresponsibly. The voters in Horcher's 60th Assembly District should exercise 
that right as rapidly as possible.

MEDICARE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS; HEALTH CARE: INSURERS, HOSPITALS AND UNCLE 
SAM FIGURE WHAT THE PATIENT DOESN'T KNOW WON'T HURT HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL WILLON, Phil Willon is a retired journalist who lives in Palos Verdes. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whenever latter-day Henry Clays suggest a Great Compromise on health care with 
big government and big business working together in harmony, I think of my 
wife's $15,000 overnight hospital bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out we already have a health plan that encourages the government and 
private enterprise to play nice. It's an exclusive 36-million-member club 
called Medicare, reserved for Social Security recipients 65 and up. Last year, 
it paid hospitals $75 billion. But when bureaucracy and business cohabit, 
strange things can happen. I discovered some of them while looking into my 
wife's $15,000 hospital bill after minor surgery that required an overnight 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that Medicare, the hospital, Blue Cross and the insurance arm of the 
American Assn. of Retired Persons (AARP) have joined in a loose alliance of 
silence that misleads patients. A Medicare statement told my wife that it had 
approved a $15,000 hospital bill, which she had never seen, and had paid 
$12,000 (80%). Turns out that Medicare really paid $1,600 (10.5%). Still, the 
bill required that she or her insurance company pay the 20% now "payable by 
you" -- $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not a clerical error. Medicare, the hospital, Blue Cross (which 
handles Medicare hospital bills in Southern California) and AARP (her 
supplemental insurance company) all knew that her 20% payment would be almost 
twice as much as Medicare's 80%. Only the patient was kept in the dark.  
</P>
<P>
 On the face of it, Medicare's formula is simple: On receiving the hospital 
bill, Medicare decides how much it will approve. It pays 80% of what it 
approves. The patient, or her insurance company, pays the remaining 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 A staff physician told me that the hospital -- and it's not the only one -- 
apparently inflates charges to get enough money from the patient to compensate 
for low Medicare payments. A Medicare financial official said that the doctor 
is "probably right," but almost all hospital bills are approved as submitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Cross, for its part, makes sure that Medicare patients are not charged 
more than private patients, but it is not empowered to see if such charges are 
excessive. And it audits only 3.2% of the claims to make sure the services 
billed were provided. So almost all Medicare hospital bills are approved. In 
defense, Blue Cross says that its approvals are under constant scrutiny by 
government auditors.  
</P>
<P>
 Medicare patients rarely see their hospital bills, which go directly to 
Medicare or its agent. Patients, I was told, do not understand the technical 
terms used in these statements.  
</P>
<P>
 Private insurance companies have a strange role in this charade. They play 
along, although aware that their 20% of a patient's bill often amounts to more 
than Medicare's 80%. An AARP insurance executive told me that "insurance 
companies are obligated by law to pay their share on the full amount approved 
by Medicare. But it is an intriguing and troubling situation." It's even more 
troubling for the patient without insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing Medicare's payment formula, the hospital was not surprised when 
Medicare paid it only $1,600 instead of $12,000. It knew that its $15,000 bill 
would be approved by Blue Cross, and the patient or her insurance company would 
have to pay $3,000. So it would receive a total of $4,600, which it can live 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from giving a senior citizen a billing horror story to astound friends, 
why did the hospital let the patient believe that the $15,000 charge had been 
approved and paid? According to its business service manager, the hospital, 
even though operating in perilous financial seas, prefers to keep its 
"arrangements with Medicare confidential." Perhaps to protect its Medicare 
accreditation? 
</P>
<P>
 The manager added that overall Medicare payments are "50 cents or less on the 
dollar," but without Medicare patients, the hospital would close. This sounds 
like the merchant who claims to lose money on every sale but makes it up in 
volume. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a touch of Wonderland in our payment system," agreed a spokesman for 
the Health Care Finance Administration, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid 
payments. There may be a touch of Wonderland in a script that tells the 
uninformed Medicare patient, "Go gyre and gimble, Alice, your bill is taken 
care of." But the patronized patient pays for it later when Congress cuts 
Medicare or her insurance premiums rise. 
</P>
<P>
 But with doctor bills, I should note, there's no Wonderland in the system. 
Medicare tells the patient exactly how much of the bill it approved and paid, 
so our Alice knows to the penny what she owes. And it's a real 20%.  
</P>
<P>
 No one could explain to me why Medicare tells patients what it pays doctors 
but not hospitals. Can it be that hospitals trade on a Florence Nightingale 
image, which entitles them to a charitable wink? And their patients are 
required -- by law, remember -- to pony up in blissful ignorance. 
</P>
<P>
 This $75-billion irrationality with a heart of gold may not be fixed easily. 
The problem is shared responsibility. When everyone is responsible, no one is. 
It makes an art form of two-way finger pointing. The upshot is flimflam on a 
massive scale. For that reason alone, any proposed health-care plan seems to 
need a single responsible purveyor, whether Big Business or Big Government. 
</P>
<P>
 Because, as the poet observed, "no snowflake in an avalanche ever feels 
responsible."

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; SHELL: SKREPENAK WILL GET JOB BACK

<P>
 The Raiders can't seem to strengthen the weak link at right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 They began the season with Bruce Wilkerson, a starter on the offensive line 
for all but three games of the previous three seasons. When Wilkerson couldn't 
do the job, the Raiders switched to Greg Skrepenak after six games. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Sunday, with Skrepenak ineffective against the Denver Broncos, Coach Art 
Shell replaced him with Robert Jenkins in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing seemed to work offensively against the blitzing Broncos, who recorded 
five sacks against the Raiders, equaling the season high surrendered by them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shell says he'll go back to Skrepenak at right tackle for this Sunday's 
game against the Seahawks at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was struggling a little bit," Shell said of Skrepenak's performance, "and 
it seemed like it was snowballing. I didn't want him to lose confidence. I had 
intentions of putting him back in, but I made a decision at halftime to finish 
the game with Rob. But Strep will be back in there as a starter this week." 
</P>
<P>
 With center Don Mosebar playing on a twisted ankle for several weeks, Shell 
has been pulling him late in games and going with Dan Turk, the long snapper. 
Although he has started 88 consecutive games and his ankle has improved, 
Mosebar might have to continue to give up some of his fourth-quarter time to 
let the rested Turk play.

 Promoter Bob Arum flew to New York on Tuesday, bringing holiday cheer and 
videotapes to George Foreman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman will study action footage of Lou Savarese, Axel Schulz and Brian 
Nielsen -- a veritable "who's he?" of the heavyweight division -- and pick the 
opponent he wants to fight April 22 at the Superdome in New Orleans. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility is Tommy Morrison, who has defeated Foreman. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The three other guys have knocked out Bonecrusher Smith," Arum said, kidding. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman is in New York preparing for his next television appearance as host of 
"Saturday Night Live" this week. Arum will have a cameo. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Williams of Long Beach, Southern California's most promising 
heavyweight since Ken Norton, will fight either William Morris, no relation to 
the agency, or Rodolf Marin Jan. 6 on the Grand Olympic's first card of 1995. .

</P>
<P>
 On ESPN Monday night, both Joe Theismann and Phil Simms predicted that the 
Raiders will win the AFC championship. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 As you might have read, the other former NFL quarterback on ESPN's team, Ron 
Jaworski, isn't quite so bullish on the silver and black. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Bates, the safety from Texas A&M who was a first-round pick in 1993, 
might be the Raiders' next great defensive back. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 There is no Ram quarterback controversy because nobody outside the immediate 
families of Chris Chandler and Chris Miller cares about who will start Sunday 
against the Bears in Chicago. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Marino deserves to be selected as starting quarterback for the AFC in the 
Pro Bowl, but Drew Bledsoe wouldn't be a bad choice either. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Seau's injury -- and subsequent subpar performances -- has demonstrated 
how valuable he is to the San Diego Charger defense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 What wonderful insight to the game the driver of Don Shula's golf cart on the 
sidelines must be getting. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 As long as there is no instant replay, the NFL is going to have to live with 
lousy calls, or non-calls, such as the one that gave the Miami Dolphins a 
touchdown against the Kansas City Chiefs, although Gene Atkins stepped out of 
bounds after intercepting a pass and before lateraling to Troy Vincent. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 USC made a terrific hire in defensive line coach Rod Marinelli from Arizona 
State.A fiery type in the Marv Goux mold, Marinelli is highly regarded as a 
teacher and recruiter. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It was refreshing to see Terry Donahue quoted as saying that a national 
championship is one of his goals at UCLA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 News item: Santa Ana Mater Dei is elevated to No. 2 and Southridge High of 
Miami to No. 1 in the USA Today national prep football rankings. Reaction: How 
can anyone take high school polls seriously when the teams don't play 
intersectional games? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Freedom Bowl organizers are delighted to have Utah playing Arizona on Dec. 27 
at Anaheim Stadium. The Utes have beaten a Rose Bowl team, Oregon, and a 
Holiday Bowl team, Colorado State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Re-signing Tim Wallach was a smart move by the Dodgers. Next up should be 
Brett Butler. But they should have made an attempt to sign free agent Lee 
Smith, the closer they need. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If he had been commissioner then, Bart Giamatti would have kept Ty Cobb off 
the first Hall of Fame ballot. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Positive Speed is helping to speed the recovery of Robert Kerlan, who is 
convalescing from multiple surgeries. Kerlan watched from home via satellite 
last week when the 2-year-old filly he co-owns and bred won her second 
consecutive race at Hollywood Park. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Walton's son Adam is a 6-foot-9 forward at LSU but is redshirting this 
season as a freshman and won't play against UCLA on Saturday at Baton Rouge. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 The Big East comeback is being fueled by the two finest freshmen in the 
nation, Allen Iverson of Georgetown and Felipe Lopez of St. John's. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I wouldn't give up young talent or a first-round draft pick for Dennis Rodman. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
 If the Clippers traded for him, Rodman probably would join most of the rest of 
L.A. in boycotting the Sports Arena. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Sign of the times: Tuesday night's game in Dallas, shown by TNT, was the 
Lakers' first and only nationally televised appearance of the regular season. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble with baseball is that it doesn't have a commissioner, and the 
trouble with hockey is that it has a commissioner.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; CHARGERS' SEAU TO PLAY AGAINST JETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Medical tests on San Diego Charger linebacker Junior Seau were negative, and 
he is expected to play in Sunday's crucial road game against the New York Jets. 
</P>
<P>
 Seau underwent MRIs on his left knee, left shoulder and neck Monday. "They 
were all negative, and in comparison to previous ones, there wasn't a 
significant change," Coach Bobby Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ross will watch to see if knee and shoulder injuries inhibit Seau's 
ability to make tackles as they did in Sunday's 38-15 loss to the San Francisco 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (9-5), who have lost two consecutive games, need one victory to 
clinch the AFC West title for the second time in three seasons. The Jets are 
6-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Seau is leading the Chargers for the fourth consecutive year with a 
career-high 139 tackles. He's third with 5 1/2 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 He has had a shoulder injury the last four weeks, and played Sunday with a 
noticeably limp left arm that limited his ability to make plays. He bruised his 
left knee early in the second quarter but returned three plays later. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Natrone Means has inflammation in tendons on both sides of his 
left knee. He is stiff and might miss some practice time, but should be ready 
by game time, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers hope to get two key blockers back. Left guard Joe Cocozzo is 
still listed as questionable with a sprained foot, but Ross said he hopes the 
second-year pro can play. Tight end Duane Young, coming off two groin pulls, is 
listed as probable after sitting out the San Francisco game. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati Bengal Coach Dave Shula probably will return next season because 
Mike Brown, team president and general manager, says the team needs more 
playing talent, not better coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals were 8-24 in Shula's first two seasons and are 2-12 now. They 
would wind up with the franchise's worst record ever if they lose their 
remaining two games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't fault our coaches or what they're doing," Brown said. "We still need 
a few more guys to get us over the hump." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas owner Jerry Jones and Philadelphia owner Jeffrey Lurie predicted that 
former Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson will stay in broadcasting with Fox Television 
next year. Johnson will make his announcement Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Morning News, citing an unidentified source, reported Sunday that 
Johnson, who led the Cowboys to two Super Bowl victories before leaving, has 
narrowed his choices to coaching the Eagles or remaining at Fox for another 
season.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: FOR 89TH BIRTHDAY, VAUGHN WANTS TO CONQUER 
NAMESAKE

<P>
 Norman D. Vaughn expects to celebrate his 89th birthday in grand fashion, atop 
a mountain he last visited in 1928 -- one already named after the distinguished 
climber from Anchorage, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn and 13 others -- including his wife -- are expected to reach the summit 
of the 10,302-foot Mt. Vaughn in Antarctica on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the first time Vaughn has seen Mt. Vaughn since Admiral Richard E. 
Byrd named it in honor of his contributions during a geological expedition -- 
the first by Americans into the Antarctic interior -- nearly 70 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn was the chief dog-handler during that expedition across the Ross Ice 
Shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 If successful, this will be the first ascent of the mountain.

 Irvine Lake, thanks to the regular stocking of trophy-sized rainbow trout and 
catfish, has long been one of the Southland's most productive fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
 But that might change late next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Serrano Irrigation District, which owns the lake with the Irvine Ranch 
Company, next fall will begin dredging for saleable gravel and sand and to 
remove accumulated silt in order to regain lost storage space. The project 
could last 10 years, said Dave Noyes, general manager of Serrano Irrigation 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will gain about 9,000 acres," Noyes said.  
</P>
<P>
 The water in Irvine Lake supplies drinking water to Villa Park and is also 
used for agricultural purposes in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 But it is also home to the Southland's largest trout and catfish. How the 
dredging affects fishing remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a new experience for everybody," said Steve Miller, general 
manager of Outdoor Safaris International, which operates the concession at the 
lake. "Our attitude is that we're certainly going to try (to maintain a healthy 
and productive fishery). Our business is at stake." 
</P>
<P>
 Noyes said contractors at CalMat Co., in charge of the project, told him that 
a silt blanket will be used to keep the lake from clouding.  
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be just like there's a pier out there, that's all," Noyes said.  
</P>
<P>
 The pier will have a conveyor-belt with huge buckets attached, which will 
methodically dig material from the lake bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may just be that it will just force the trout to other areas," Miller 
said, trying to remain optimistic. 
</P>
<P>

 When a cougar, also known as a mountain lion, attacks and kills a human, as 
happened Saturday to a hiker in Cuyamaca Rancho State Park east of San Diego, 
experts go into action. It has happened a lot lately. 
</P>
<P>
 A chronology of what transpired after the attack on 56-year-old Iris Kenna, as 
told by Department of Fish and Game warden Bob Turner and reported by DFG 
information officer Pat Moore: 
</P>
<P>
 Kenna had parked her pickup truck at a Boy Scout camp just off a dirt road 
within the 26,000-acre park and set out on an early-morning hike. At 11 a.m., a 
backpack was found on an access road in a new area of the park by two women 
hikers. Thirty-five yards down the road, they discovered fresh blood, a hat and 
a pair of glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 The two women ran to a park office. 
</P>
<P>
 At 11:45 a.m., park rangers Earl Jones and Shane Cole discovered Kenna's body 
in a lush ravine about 40 yards off the road. The body had not been covered, 
perhaps because the lion was scared off by the two hikers. Mountain lions 
usually cover their prey before leaving it. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1:10 p.m., Turner was contacted. He arrived 10 minutes later but was denied 
access by San Diego County Sheriff's deputies, who were conducting an 
investigation. At 4 p.m., Turner was allowed in and confirmed what was already 
known -- that Kenna was killed by a cougar. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner then located and shot a doe to use as bait for the lion. At 7 p.m., the 
body was removed and the doe carcass was set in place. 
</P>
<P>
 A radio collar was attached to the deer carcass so Turner could receive a 
signal if the doe moved. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8 p.m., the doe moved. Turner, a houndsman with six dogs and four 
additional DFG wardens and four federal trappers, arrived 45 minutes later. 
Most of the doe had been eaten.  
</P>
<P>
 At 9 p.m., the dogs were set free, and at 9:30 p.m. a lion was treed and shot, 
about a half-mile from the site of the killing.  
</P>
<P>
 Based on findings of not only deer meat but human hair and scalp in the lion's 
stomach, it was determined Monday that the lion, a 116-pound male that showed 
no signs of sickness or disease, killed Kenna. 
</P>
<P>
 Wardens also said Kenna's death probably could have been avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that the backpack was untouched and 35 yards from the body indicates 
that she dropped the pack and started running for it," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That only triggers the instinct in the animal to attack." 
</P>
<P>
 Though human instinct might be to run from a menacing cougar, the best way to 
avoid an attack should an encounter occur, experts say, is to stand your 
ground, throw sticks or rocks at the animal and make as much noise as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With rockfish and whitefish providing most of the catch off local shores, many 
fishermen are venturing south of the border to get their big-fish fix. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Doreck is one. And the Long Beach angler had all he could handle while 
fishing off Cabo San Lucas aboard the Gaviota VIII.  
</P>
<P>
 Using a dead dorado as bait, Doreck hooked a blue marlin that worked him over 
for nine hours and 20 minutes before he managed to reel in the beast.

FISHING REPORT: DIAZ LAKE A WORTHWHILE SIERRA STOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Eastern Sierra trout season has been closed for more than six weeks, but 
some might find a trip to Diaz Lake worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 One of only a few year-round fisheries in the region, Diaz Lake, off Highway 
395 east of Lone Pine, will receive a bonus plant of 500 two-pound rainbow 
trout that had been used as brood stock at the Department of Fish and Game's 
Hot Creek Hatchery in Mammoth Lakes.

SKIING / BOB LOCHNER; LINDH, STREET TAKING PEEK AT EARLY SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB LOCHNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America's Hilary and Picabo Show will open its European engagement next week 
after a successful run in Colorado and Canada, where they somehow managed to 
avoid stepping on each other's lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilary Lindh and Picabo Street, opposites who don't exactly attract, are 
astounding ski racing's establishment as they prove, along with Tommy Moe, that 
the United States is now home to the world's fastest humans on skis. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there were those Olympic medals in 1992 and '94, but they were flukes, 
right? How many World Cup races have these three won? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, based on 10 days of recent high-speed downhill and super-G sliding, 
here's the updated answer: 
</P>
<P>
 -- After winning the World Cup downhill at Vail, Colo., on Dec. 2, Lindh was 
second -- to Street -- at Lake Louise, Canada, Friday, then won there Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Street won Friday's downhill and tied for third in Sunday's super-G at Lake 
Louise. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Tignes, France, reigning Olympic downhill champion Moe opened his season 
by placing second to '92 Olympic downhill gold medalist Patrick Ortlieb of 
Austria in a super-G Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We watch the races on television over here and see Hilary win, and the night 
before it was Picabo," Moe told the Associated Press. "It's definitely an 
inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindh, 25, and Street, 23, also seem to be inspiring one another, perhaps 
unintentionally. 
</P>
<P>
 While denying the existence of a feud, the quiet Lindh says: "We push each 
other, that's the main thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Street, who gained the Olympic downhill silver medal last February at 
Lillehammer, Norway, two years after Lindh performed the same feat at 
Albertville, France, describes their differences this way: "Hilary has a lot 
more experience and is a lot more patient than I am. I'm more bubbly and 
(spontaneous)." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she adds: "We've overcome the challenge of our personalities." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindh isn't so sure, telling AP after she finished behind Street Friday: "If 
Picabo wants to entertain everyone, that's up to her and that's her way. It 
doesn't happen to be mine. There simply are differences in our personalities 
and the way we do things. It's a bit hard to deal with at times, but that's the 
way things are." 
</P>
<P>
 Then after becoming the focus of media attention with her victory the 
following day, Lindh couldn't help but observe: "Yesterday, I finished second 
and spoke to virtually no one." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With snow still scarce in Europe, it's hard to say when the next women's 
downhill might be held -- the race requires a lot of real estate -- but a 
super-G is scheduled next Tuesday at Val d'Isere, France, following a giant 
slalom Saturday at Sestriere, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Zeller-Baehler of Switzerland tops the World Cup women's overall 
standings with 445 points, followed by Katja Seizinger of Germany with 329, 
Lindh with 304, Vreni Schneider of Switzerland with 257 and Street with 225. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning Monday night's slalom on his home slope at Sestriere, Alberto 
Tomba leads the men's circuit with 250 points, 101 more than runner-up Michael 
Von Gruenigen of Switzerland. Moe is 11th with 80. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup organizers hope to stage two men's downhills and a super-G this 
weekend at Val d'Isere.

 In California, the snow keeps falling. 
</P>
<P>
 Mammoth Mountain picked up another 12 inches of powder early this week, giving 
it 78 to 96 inches at the main lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most we've had in mid-December since possibly. . . . forever," 
spokeswoman Pam Murphy said. "Or at least in the 20 years I've been here. In 
fact, right now, we have more snow than we had at any time last season." 
</P>
<P>
 The current snow-depth champion, however, is Boreal, off Interstate 80 on 
Donner Summit, where 155 to 165 inches has already piled up. And winter is 
still a week away. 
</P>
<P>
 Southland mountains have received another light dusting, and with the help of 
cold night temperatures conducive to snow-making, four ski areas -- Snow 
Summit, Bear Mountain, Snow Valley and Mountain High -- continue to operate 
daily on up to 36 inches of packed powder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado resorts are gradually getting up to speed for their usual 
Christmas-New Year's holiday influx of skiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although reporting only a 34- to 38-inch base, Aspen Mountain is more than 90% 
open, as is nearby Aspen Highlands, and Snowmass claims at least half of its 
terrain is skiable. Vail and Beaver Creek have up to 32 inches, with most of 
their lifts running. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The 1995 Old Farmer's Almanac predicts a severe winter, but some weather 
forecasters believe a developing El Nino will mean reduced snowfalls in the 
West for the rest of the ski season, which traditionally runs through Easter -- 
April 16 in '95. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mountain High, where there has been skiing on the west side since Nov. 11, is 
making additional snow on its east side, and owner Terry Tognazzini hopes to 
have all runs open by Dec. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mammoth Mountain, which replaced its old Chairlift 16 with a high-speed 
detachable quad that considerably shortened one of the previously longest and 
coldest rides in the Sierra, has also provided another lift for beginners, No. 
27, which parallels No. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kyle Rasmussen continues to give the U.S. Ski Team some unexpected depth, 
finishing ninth in Sunday's super-G, but the recently married AJ Kitt was a 
disappointing 26th.

LOS ALAMITOS; AT 24, TAYLOR OFF AND FROLICKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY PIGOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heath Taylor, 24, could pass for any other successful member of Generation X. 
He earned a college degree, started a good job right out of school and is 
planning a spring wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 But you won't find Taylor behind a desk. He is more comfortable in the barn 
area at Los Alamitos, where he has accomplished something few people of any 
generation can boast about. In his first year as a trainer, Taylor is starting 
a horse in one of the most prestigious quarter horse races of the year, the 
$250,000 Champion of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, a native of Bedford, Ky., trains the former 2-year-old champion 
gelding Femmes Frolic. Femmes Frolic, now 5, earned one of the last two berths 
in the Champion of Champions by finishing second in the Z. Wayne Griffin 
Directors trial on Nov. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 In the $20,000 trial, Femmes Frolic turned in a game effort, finishing a neck 
behind Childish, who will be making his second Champion of Champions 
appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Femmes Frolic, owned by Roger (Sonny) Knight Jr., spent most of the early part 
of the year at Ruidoso Downs in Ruidoso, N.M., where he was conditioned by 
another young trainer, Bobby Merchant. There, Femmes Frolic won the 
All-American Gold Cup and ran second in the World's Championship Classic. He 
also won the Bayou City Handicap at Sam Houston Race Park in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 When the time came for Femmes Frolic to move to Los Alamitos, Merchant 
suggested his friend, Taylor, as the gelding's next trainer, and Knight agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first start of the year at Los Alamitos, Femmes Frolic ran third behind 
world champion contender Down With Debt in the California Challenge 
Championship.  
</P>
<P>
 "When he gets ready to run, the horse is aggressive, very aggressive," Taylor 
said. "He doesn't do anything wrong. He trains just super. He tells you when 
he's ready. All you have to do is take care of him. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong, sometimes he just gets beat by better horses, and 
sometimes he beats them. But very seldom does he make any mistakes. Usually 
when he gets beat, they just run faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor will be hoping that Femmes Frolic doesn't make any mistakes Saturday 
night and can run fast enough to earn a trip to the winner's circle of what is 
shaping up to be the race of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an honor and a pleasure to be in the Champion of Champions," Taylor 
said. "I think there's certainly some standouts in the race, but for anyone to 
confidently say that they're going to do this, this and this, is very 
unrealistic. There's nine or 10 horses in there that could win the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor has experienced a lot of winning lately. His stable has won nearly 
$130,000 since March, and horses he has saddled have finished in the top three 
better than 50% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Taylor, winning is only part of a love affair that began when his 
father, Michael, introduced his young son to the world of horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been involved in all facets of horse racing, breeding and training," 
Taylor said of his father. "But for the last 15 years, it's been all racing." 
</P>
<P>
 And no matter where Taylor was, he always found a way to be around horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always participated heavily in the horse side of it -- in high school, 
before and after school, in college. I played college basketball, and after 
practice I would drive to the ranch just to stay (involved with the horses). 
There's probably a very, very limited number of quarter horse racetracks I have 
not been to and/or raced or worked at." 
</P>
<P>
 But Taylor doesn't stake his whole future on making it as a trainer. He has a 
bachelor's degree in equine administration with a minor in business and law 
from the University of Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 He also completed an internship at Los Alamitos, where he did a patron survey 
on how to improve racing and service at the Cypress track. And after he 
graduated, he spent a year working for the Texas Quarter Horse Assn. as the 
director of racing programs.  
</P>
<P>
 Taylor knows that his experiences have given him a security not usually 
associated with training racehorses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got the degree and the experience, and age is on my side," he said. "I knew 
I could always go back to the administrative side of it if there was ever a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to try (training). But we all know this is a risky business, and 
it's always good to have that to go back to. I would entertain any offers, but 
at the same time, I'm very content right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor would probably be even more content to win the Champion of Champions. 
Among the horses Femmes Frolic might race are Down With Debt, Refrigerator, 
Brotherly, Childish, I Hear A Symphony, Sound Dash, Sheza First Down, Avison 
and Childish. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Visscher's Follow The Sign won the $20,000 Josie's Bar Handicap on 
Saturday, running 550 yards in 27.03 seconds. Follow The Sign, who had 
previously won the QHBC Far West Futurity, is trained by H.J. Visscher and was 
ridden by G.R. Carter.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; ECONOMIC DATA LEAVES STOCKS, BONDS MIXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Government reports indicating economic expansion with a mild degree of 
inflation left Treasury bond yields sharply mixed and blue-chip stocks slightly 
lower Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports cheered bond investors and boosted confidence among some that the 
Federal Reserve Board will again raise interest rates to cool down the economy. 
Buyers anticipating high rates during a time of low inflation flocked to 
long-term bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-term securities suffered because the prospect of higher rates makes them 
less attractive as investments. The yield curve between the two bond classes 
contracted to its narrowest point in several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The benchmark 30-year bond yield fell to 7.85% from Monday's 7.92%. Its price, 
which rises when rates fall, was up 24/32 point, or $7.50 per $1,000 in face 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the drop in long-term rates, the Dow Jones industrial average closed 
off 3.03 points at 3,715.34. In the broader market, however, advancing issues 
outnumbered declining ones about 11 to 9 in active trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Volume was 309.37 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Stock investors like to see rates fall because that reduces the cost of 
borrowing for companies and makes share prices more attractive relative to 
interest-bearing investments. 
</P>
<P>
 There were signs that the economy retains plenty of steam. The Commerce 
Department reported a stronger-than-expected 1.2% rise in retail sales, and the 
Labor Department said wholesale prices rose 0.5% in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "The implication of strong retail sales is that we'll see continued strong 
economic growth in the fourth quarter," said Rusty Vanneman, senior money 
market analyst at Technical Data. "That means the Fed will probably tighten 
rates soon." 
</P>
<P>
 The producer price index carried little sign of inflation, and that further 
bolstered investor demand for long-term bonds. Higher rates tend to make 
short-term bonds less valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bond traders think they have a win-win situation with lower inflation and a 
Fed tightening on the way," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Norwest 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Thursday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel ended 1/8 higher at 60 1/2, after tumbling 2 3/8 on Monday on news 
that International Business Machines Corp. was halting shipments of personal 
computers that use Intel's flawed Pentium chip. 
</P>
<P>
 * US Bioscience fell 4 3/8 to 2 after a Food and Drug Administration advisory 
committee recommended late Monday against approval of Ethyol, a drug developed 
to treat the side effects of chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 In overseas trading, uncertainty over the revolt in Chiapas sent Mexican 
stocks tumbling. In Mexico City, the Bolsa sank to 2,407.99, off 59.8 points 
and its lowest closing level in four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average closed down 99.62 points at 18,875.48. In 
Frankfurt, the DAX 30-share average ended 13.57 points lower at 2,011.25. 
London's Financial Times 100-share average ended the day at 2,946.4 points, up 
3.0.

 Walt Disney Co. Eyes Latin Sites: The company is considering building a theme 
park somewhere in South America early in the next decade, a company executive 
said."If we open a park in Latin America, it won't be in this decade but in the 
year 2000 and something," Stephen de Kanter, executive vice president for Latin 
America of Disney Consumer Products, said at a news conference. The park would 
be built in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay or Peru, he said.

 See no evil, hear a bit: We noticed that the Beverly Hills-based Playboy TV 
channel is the target of a protest by some high school students who plan to 
deliver letters to the Orange City Council. The letters will demand that 
"unwanted Playboy channels (on the local cable service) be blocked completely 
from their TV before the holiday break." 
</P>
<P>
 It reminds us of a previous protest by a minister who complained that even 
when the Playboy channel was scrambled on his set, he could hear the moaning if 
he listened very carefully.

 George Washington drove here? Peter Small of Whittier found an ad for a sturdy 
car engine that may well have helped carry Colonial troops into action. Or, 
given the make in question, Hessian troops, perhaps.

 Hollywood from a safe distance: If you're avoiding a visit to Tinseltown out 
of fear that the sidewalk will collapse under your feet, you might turn instead 
to Stephen Schochet's new tape, "Tales of Hollywood." Some of his anecdotes:  
</P>
<P>
 * L. Frank Baum, author of "The Wizard of Oz," reportedly came up with the 
name for that distant land from "the bottom drawer of his filing cabinet, 
letters O-Z." 
</P>
<P>
 * At the height of child actress Shirley Temple's fame, her father received 
numerous letters from women wanting to have children with him. 
</P>
<P>
 * Carl Laemmle is said to have come up with the name for Universal Studios 
after seeing a parked truck with the name, "Universal Pipe Cleaning." 
</P>
<P>
 * After purchasing property in Beverly Hills for his dream home, Charlie 
Chaplin, "a known skinflint . . . used studio technicians rather than real 
architects to build the home to save a few bucks. The studio men were used to 
building things that would be taken apart later, and Chaplin's house used to 
fall apart from the inside. The neighbors called it Breakaway. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * When Hollywood producer Samuel Goldfish changed his last name early in life, 
he combined Goldfish and Selwyn (the name of a former partner) and came up with 
Goldwyn. Naturally, Schochet points out, "he didn't want to be known as 
Selfish." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quake signs: You may recall the photo we published of Quake City Bank in 
Whittier -- the "r" having been clipped off the end of the first word, possibly 
during a shaker. Well, Mike Grundmann of Burbank found another sign symbolizing 
Southern California's not-so terra firma on the UCLA campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, though, we suspect the front letter fell off not through an act 
of God but through an act of a USC Trojan. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Maybe he mistook Santa Clarita for Santa Clara: The traffic was so backed up 
on the Long Beach Freeway on Tuesday that we fell into conversation with the 
driver of a passenger-less taxi in the next lane. "I got on the wrong freeway," 
he groused. 
</P>
<P>
 That was an understatement, considering that he was driving an orange San 
Francisco cab. But before we could ask for further explanation, the freeway 
suddenly cleared and the hack cut across three lanes to an off-ramp. We hope he 
escaped this Oz. miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 El Vez, the Mexican Elvis impersonator, is performing in a "Merry Mexmas" 
celebration with his faithful Memphis Mariachis at 10:30 p.m. Friday at Luna 
Park in West Hollywood. Then, on Sunday afternoon at 2, the Wadsworth Theater 
in West L.A. is staging a production of "Santa Claus Conquers the Martians." 
Next up: Santa Claus vs. El Vez? Mexmas, indeed.

STUART ROOSA; ASTRONAUT ORBITED MOON ON APOLLO 14 MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stuart A. Roosa, who piloted the command module that orbited the moon during 
the third lunar landing mission in 1971, died Monday at Fairfax Hospital at age 
61. The cause of death was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosa, who was president and owner of Gulf Coastal Coors Inc. in Gulfport, 
Miss., a beer distributor, served for 10 years in NASA's astronaut corps, 
logging all of his space flight time on the Apollo 14 lunar mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Durango, Colo., Roosa received his undergraduate degree in 
aeronautical engineering from the University of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 He served in the Air Force from 1953 to 1976, retiring as a colonel. Before 
joining the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in 1966, he was an 
experimental test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosa was a member of the support crew for the Apollo 9 space flight before he 
flew his sole mission -- Apollo 14 -- from Jan. 31 to Feb. 9, 1971. He piloted 
the command module that orbited the moon while astronauts Alan Shepard and 
Edgar Mitchell landed on the lunar surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Roosa served as backup command pilot for the Apollo 16 and 17 missions 
and was assigned to the space shuttle program until he retired in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 He lived with his wife, Joan, in Sessums, Miss. They had three children.

MAX BILL, 85; CONTROVERSIAL SWISS; ARTIST, SCULPTOR AND WRITER

 Max Bill, the controversial Swiss artist, sculptor and former politician, has 
died of a heart attack. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill, who was also an architect and writer, suffered a heart attack Friday at 
Berlin's airport as he was waiting for a flight to Zurich. He died en route to 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1927 to 1929, Bill was at Germany's famous Bauhaus school of architecture 
and applied arts, where he was influenced by the work of Paul Klee and Wassily 
Kandinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Described by the New York-based Art News magazine in 1989 as the "leading 
light" of the Concrete and Constructivist art movements, Bill applied what he 
called a "mathematical" approach to art. 
</P>
<P>
 His paintings and granite sculptures showed bold geometric designs in what he 
said was an attempt to "represent abstract thoughts in a sensuous and tangible 
form." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill, the son of a railroad official, lived and worked mainly in Zurich, where 
he designed his house. His home was a treasure trove of paintings by other 
prominent artists, most of them his friends, such as Klee, Kandinsky, Piet 
Mondrian, Alberto Giacometti and Fritz Glarner. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Museum of Art exhibited a retrospective of Bill's 
paintings and sculptures in 1974. Times art critic Henry J. Seldis said at the 
time that "Bill -- a professorial-looking bespectacled man of ideas -- 
certainly knows how not to waste his efforts as he pursues his multitudinous 
activities as artist, architect, parliamentarian and environmentalist with 
methodological calm and deep conviction." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill considered his myriad activities all related to changing the world's 
living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art is a kind of mode for life without compromise," he told The Times in 
1974. "Art is not something created in an ivory tower but rather a model for a 
more spiritual world." 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1950s Bill planned the construction of the Ulm Design College in 
southern Germany, which sought to continue the Bauhaus concept. He was its 
first rector, but stepped down in 1956 because of disputes within the school. 
</P>
<P>
 No stranger to controversy, Bill caused an uproar in Zurich in 1988 when he 
refused to attend a party the city threw to celebrate his 80th birthday. He 
said he was irritated by the fuss and felt special exhibitions organized by 
local museums to show his work were unrepresentative. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill wrote books about Le Corbusier, Kandinsky, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe and 
artistic theory. 
</P>
<P>
 His paintings are displayed in many museums around the world. His other 
architectural work included an office building in Germany, a radio studio in 
Zurich and a bridge in eastern Switzerland. His biggest sculptures are on 
display in Switzerland, Germany and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill was also involved in politics. He was elected to the Zurich municipal 
council in 1961 and was a Federal Parliament deputy from 1967 to 1971 as a 
member of the Independent Landesring Party. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his second wife, Angela, and a child, Jakob, an archeologist 
of international repute who also paints.

CLEVELAND FINISHED ALMOST FROM START; BASKETBALL: CAVALIERS SEARCH FOR 
POSITIVES AFTER 106-46 SETBACK AT CRENSHAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cleveland High's basketball team is struggling to find a starting lineup -- 
never mind an identity -- and thus Cavalier preseason games almost have to be 
considered practices in fancy uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, in a game like Tuesday's against Crenshaw, the goal is merely to 
make the loss respectable.  
</P>
<P>
 When you play the two-time defending state champion, you generally have to 
sift through quite a bit of wreckage to find a silver lining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers fell, 106-46, at Crenshaw, an outcome that surprised no one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody hopes to win, but you have to be realistic," Cleveland Coach Kevin 
Crider said. "I think of it as a building experience, where you try to make the 
kids execute what you practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Crider was entirely frustrated in the first half, as the Cougars' trapping 
defense immediately turned the game into a rout. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight Cougars scored in the first quarter, led by Raymond Palmer's nine 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland (1-7) scored the first four points of the second quarter, which made 
it 28-12. Then the Cavaliers watched the taller, quicker, stronger Cougars 
(7-0) run off 17 consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
 Crider exhorted his team to try to slow the tempo, make good passes and wait 
for a higher percentage shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, that didn't happen. Nearly every Cleveland possession ended 
with a Cougar steal, a turnover or a wild shot -- which was occasionally 
blocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw led at halftime, 58-14. 
</P>
<P>
 "They beat us because they ran up and down the court," said point guard Robert 
Serrano. "They're so tall that I couldn't pass over them. We'll just have to 
look forward to better things. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our first year that we've been together as a group. As the season 
goes on, we'll get better." 
</P>
<P>
 Better things happened in the second half. Crenshaw eased up on its ferocious 
full-court press and Cleveland didn't appear quite so overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers were only outscored by eight points in both the third and fourth 
quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They let some of the pressure off," Crider said. "Naturally, you play a bit 
better. I thought (Crenshaw Coach) Willie (West) could have demoralized us if 
he wanted to." 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland's James Brignac scored 16 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter, 
making two three-point shots and scoring on a variety of acrobatic shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Damian Willis scored 22 points for the Cougars, and Palmer and Corey Williams 
added 18.

DIGEST: PLAN SEEKS 3 LEAGUES OUT OF 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Football coaches in the Marmonte and Channel leagues have devised a tentative 
proposal that would split the leagues into three in all sports, with the five 
Oxnard Unified School District members -- Camarillo, Channel Islands, Hueneme, 
Oxnard and Rio Mesa highs -- forming their own league. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena, Ventura, Dos Pueblos, Santa Barbara and San Marcos would be grouped 
together, as would Agoura, Newbury Park, Royal, Simi Valley, Westlake and 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least within Ventura County, it seems to be looked on really favorably," 
said Rio Mesa football Coach George Contreras, treasurer of the Ventura County 
Football Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Contreras said the move would help more teams qualify for the playoffs in 
football. Because the Marmonte and Channel leagues are eight-team leagues, only 
six of the 16 teams are guaranteed playoff berths in football. Nine teams would 
qualify under the three-league plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Another benefit would be added importance to traditional rivalries in the 
Oxnard district, which are now split between the Marmonte and Channel leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is in the hands of football coaches, who are trying to convince their 
principals and fellow coaches the change would benefit all sports. If it is 
proposed at the next Southern Section releaguing meeting, set for late 1995, it 
could go into effect for the 1996-97 school year, Contreras said. JEFF FLETCHER

 Van Nuys High has hired Mark Pomerantz as the school's football coach, 
replacing George Engbrecht, who resigned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pomerantz, 39, has been an assistant at Van Nuys the past three years. 
Engbrecht is leaving the campus to accept a job at Hoover High as an assistant 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Molina, assistant principal at Van Nuys, said that Engbrecht's letter of 
recommendation was a strong factor in the selection of Pomerantz. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys finished 6-5, losing to Venice in the first round of the City Section 
3-A Division playoffs. Van Nuys advanced to the playoffs three consecutive 
years under Engbrecht.

SIDELINES; FOR ST. GENEVIEVE'S DONOVAN, 'PICKUP GAME' HAS NEW MEANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The search for an available gym has forced the St. Genevieve High boys' 
basketball team to hold 5:30 a.m. practices a couple of times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a big deal for Coach Dan Donovan and his crew -- with one exception. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his players, Emilio Gonzales, can't get a ride to the Panorama City 
area at 5:30 a.m., so Donovan interrupts his commute from Newhall to pick up 
Gonzalez . . . in Quartz Hill, 30 miles north of Donovan's abode. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only part that gets me is I'm on the road for an hour and I'm right back 
where I started," Donovan said. "But it's what we've got to do to find time." 
</P>
<P>
 To reach practice in the morning, Donovan leaves his home at 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Same time next year: Next year's opponents can't be too happy that Antelope 
Valley High's football team, which won the Southern Section Division II 
championship, loses only 14 seniors from its 39-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the team's 10 All-Golden League selections are juniors or 
underclassmen. The offensive backfield of quarterback Trymon Redick, fullback 
Justin Reinier and running back Jermaine Lewis are juniors. Lewis was the 
league player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Where's the Zamboni: After one boys' basketball game in the new bubble-top gym 
at Alemany High, the facility has at least one detractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake Coach Gary Grayson, whose team beat the Indians, 64-45, in the 
makeshift gym Saturday night, said it was so cold his players had to wear sweat 
pants during the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like the Great Alaskan Shootout," Grayson said. "It was like a 
football game. I tried to do my best (former Minnesota Vikings Coach) Bud Grant 
imitation. . . . Our kids didn't want to come out of the game because they had 
to sit on the cold benches." 
</P>
<P>
 Pound for pound: At 5 foot 1, 90 pounds, Edniesha Curry is barely a blip in 
the team picture, but the Palmdale High girls' basketball player made an 
impressive splash last weekend at the Jasper Place tournament in Edmonton, 
Canada. The sophomore averaged only seven points a game in the tournament, but 
was named the event's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 "They play a very fast international-style game," said Coach George Corisis, 
whose team won the tournament championship. "Their presses up there are 
unbelievably tenacious and Edniesha broke all of them and handled everything 
they threw at her." Stats 
</P>
<P>
 Some statistics from El Camino Real's crazy, 109-104 triple-overtime victory 
over Van Nuys on Monday: 
</P>
<P>
 -- El Camino Real's Jermel Jones scored 19 of his 35 points in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 -- El Camino Real made 26 of 55 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Van Nuys' Onaje Longmire scored 27 points and grabbed 21 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Van Nuys junior Jon Okui scored 33 points off the bench, including seven 
three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 -- El Camino Real's bench did not score a point. 
</P>
<P>
 No favorites: Only one of the eight Marmonte League boys' basketball teams has 
a losing record as the teams open league play today. The best are Simi Valley 
(4-0), Royal (6-1) and surprising Channel Islands (5-1). Newbury Park (2-3) is 
the only team with a losing record. Overall, the league is 28-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Streakers: Highland High, under first-year Coach Tim Knight, won seven of its 
first eight games, including a victory over Muir. The Bulldogs have two 
20-point scorers in junior forward John Burrell (averaging 21.4 points) and 
senior swingman Jamal Dedeaux (20.3). Feeding them the ball are Carl Biel (7.3 
assists per game) and Jason Carr (6.0 apg), who is used to passing -- he is the 
Highland football team's quarterback. Honors 
</P>
<P>
 Senior John Garcia is believed to be the first Notre Dame High student to have 
played on Southern Section championship teams in two major sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia was a running back on the Knights' football team, which won the 
Division III title Friday. As a sophomore, he was a guard on the school's 
basketball team, which won the III-A championship. Things to Do 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 wrestlers will converge at Rio Mesa High on Friday and Saturday in 
the fourth Rio Mesa 12-Way meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition figures to be keen, with wrestling powers from Nevada, Hawaii, 
Idaho, Washington and California scheduled to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Wooster High in Reno is the defending Nevada state champion and is ranked 13th 
in the nation by Scholastic Wrestling News. Iolani High of Honolulu is 
defending Hawaii state champion. Blackfoot High from Blackfoot, Ida., placed 
eighth in the state last season. Kennewick High from Kennewick, Wash., also is 
a perennial power. 
</P>
<P>
 Also entered is Arago High from San Mateo. Area teams scheduled to compete 
include Rio Mesa and Thousand Oaks. Registrar 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. Recreation and Parks Department is staging a basketball coaches' 
clinic Saturday at Balboa Recreation Center. Former UNLV Coach Jerry Tarkanian 
is the guest speaker. Long Beach State Coach Seth Greenberg and Pepperdine 
Coach Tony Fuller also are scheduled to attend.

 Mater Dei came into Tuesday's game against Edison hoping to get its first goal

give them a lift. 
</P>

 Neither happened as the nonleague girls' soccer game ended in a 1-1 tie at 
Mater Dei.

 "We've still got a long way to go," Mater Dei Coach Michelle Myers said. "It's 
frustrating to see the same players we had in the semifinals of the playoffs 
last year not getting it done this year."

 Edison, which lost Shauna Itri because of a serious knee injury in the opening

 The Chargers (2-3-2) scored when Samantha Craig punched a shot with her left 
foot out of a crowd three minutes into the second half for a 1-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Monarchs (1-2-2) tied the score midway through the second half, 
when Trisha Steiner led defender Kim Buccola with a perfect pass and Buccola 
beat goalkeeper Kim James up high. DAN ARRITT

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; LAGUNA HILLS' INEXPERIENCE SHOWS IN LOSS TO 
WESTMINSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There is no substitute for experience. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the lesson the Laguna Hills girls' basketball team learned Tuesday as 
the Hawks lost to Westminster, 65-51, in the first round of the Bolsa Grande 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills (4-1), which starts three sophomores, turned the ball over 18 
times in the first half, and 27 for the game in its first loss of the year. The 
Hawks' turnover problem allowed Westminster to take a 21-7 lead, and the Hawks 
were never closer than seven points after that point. 
</P>
<P>
 Twin towers Amber Farroux and Kristin Schult, both 6 feet 2, did the bulk of 
the damage for the Lions. Farroux, who has committed to Nevada Las Vegas, hit 
her first six shots and finished with 27 points and 10 rebounds. Schult, a 
junior, had 22 points and seven rebounds. Between them, they shut down Laguna 
Hills center Tayyiba Haneef. Haneef, at 6-5 the tallest player in the county, 
had four points. 
</P>
<P>
 "To see how far Amber has come, even just since last year, is remarkable," 
Westminster Coach Dick Katz said. "She had never played any sports before she 
came here, but you can really see how far desire has taken her." ERIC MADDY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lyle Phelps, the father of two Irvine High quarterbacks, Mike and Ryan Phelps, 
died at home Monday of colon cancer. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps, who followed Irvine football for more than 20 years, was profiled Oct. 
18 by The Times after the Vaqueros' 9-7 loss to Newport Harbor in the Sea View 
League opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Coach Terry Henigan started junior backup Ryan Phelps for the first 
series of downs in that game to allow Lyle the opportunity to hear his son's 
name announced as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, Carol, and Ryan and Mike, Irvine's all-time passing 
leader who is a redshirt freshman at Oregon, Lyle Phelps is survived by 
daughters Becky and Wendy, and a son from his first marriage, Bob, of Tustin.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Alamitos point guard Ali Ton and his teammates made a statement in a 60-47 
victory over Los Angeles Dorsey in the first round of the Tournament of 
Champions boys' basketball tournament Tuesday night at Ocean View High. 
</P>
<P>
 Ton had 17 points, 11 assists and six steals to help the Griffins (6-1) break 
open a close game by outscoring Dorsey, 21-9, in the fourth quarter.Los 
Alamitos plays the winner of the Tustin-Pasadena game in Thursday's 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the best we've played all season," Los Alamitos Coach Steve Brooks 
said. "I have all the confidence in the world in Ali. I think he's the best 
set-up point guard in the area. He took control of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Ton did most of his set-up work for 6-foot-7 center Jeremy Vandervoet and Cory 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Vandervoet finished with 17 points. He benefited from numerous assists when 
Ton drove down the lane and dished off to his center for layups. 
</P>
<P>
 When Dorsey tried to pressure the Griffins, Ton and guard Chris Glass knifed 
through the press in the fourth quarter and Johnson made the Dons pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson made four three-pointers in the final quarter, finishing with 17 
points, to help put away the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pleased with the effort tonight," Brooks said. "But it's just one 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos has lost only one game this season -- a 56-39 defeat Dec. 7 
against Mater Dei, the No. 1-ranked team in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey (1-1), ranked in the state preseason top 20, was led by Charles 
Johnson's 13 points and six rebounds. MICHAEL ITAGAKI

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: BIG WEST COMPETITION STARTS EARLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ready or not, Cal State Fullerton will get an early start in the Big West 
Conference men's basketball race Saturday night at Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 And, regardless of the early date, it hardly figures to be a typical 
conference opener. It will be the first home game for the Rebels under Coach 
Tim Grgurich, the longtime assistant under Jerry Tarkanian who returned as head 
coach after Rollie Massimino's controversial two years there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big West normally doesn't begin conference games until January, but UNLV 
wanted to play the game earlier because the Rebels are allowed only nine home 
games, all in the Big West, this season under the sanctions handed down by the 
NCAA in a case pending since 1987. Fullerton agreed to move the game from its 
original date in early February. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a little early to be playing your conference opener, especially with a 
team that's still developing," Titan Coach Bob Hawking said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't figure to be as difficult an assignment as last week's, when 
the Titans had to go against UCLA in Pauley Pavilion. Fullerton clearly was 
over-matched by UCLA's personnel. The second-ranked Bruins won, 99-65, although 
the Titans were down by only six points at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played one half of our best basketball of the year," Hawking said. 
"Unfortunately, our size and strength didn't allow us to stay at their level 
over the full 40 minutes . . . UCLA's depth was just overwhelming. They're 
really strong eight or nine people deep." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans were helped by a series of easy baskets by center Winston Peterson 
on the fast break in the first half. In the second half, when the Bruin defense 
tightened, the Titans shot only 25% from the floor, and UCLA turned the tables 
with its fast break. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was disappointed with our transition defense in the second half," Hawking 
said. "We need to continue to play defense with a lot of enthusiasm. If we do 
that, we can create offense from the defensive end." 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans rank last in the Big West in field-goal shooting percentage at 36%, 
and Hawking says his team still needs to shoot better than in the three losses 
that followed a season-opening victory over Cal State Northridge. "But I'm not 
going to panic, and pull back," he said. "The shots will start to fall. I have 
confidence in that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 UNLV has lost its first two games, taking some of the glimmer off Grgurich's 
debut in Thomas & Mack Center. The Rebels lost to Marquette, 82-74, in overtime 
in their opener and then lost to Seton Hall, 99-79, Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of respect for Grgurich, but I'm sure it's going to take a 
little bit of time for him to get that program going again, too," Hawking said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking and Grgurich go back to when Grgurich was recruiting for Tarkanian and 
Hawking was coaching at Simi Valley High. "He recruited Don MacLean, and UNLV 
was one of Don's final five. Travis Bice, who played for me at Simi Valley, 
played there, and Grgurich also recruited him," Hawking recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton women's basketball team is 1-3, and Coach Deborah Ayres is 
lamenting the fact that the Titans will have to go at least five or six more 
weeks without standout outside shooter Autumn Hollyfield after getting the 
inside attack going in the last three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Koko Lahanas has scored 32, 16 and 31 points in the last three games 
and is averaging 21.8 for the season. Shayla Bradshaw also has a 21.3 average, 
but the Titans miss Hollyfield, who led the nation in three-point field goal 
average last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a shame that we don't have Autumn right now because she gave us 
that strong threat from outside, as well as a third strong scorer," Ayres said. 
"We're just going to have to get more help from the other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollyfield, who had arthroscopic knee surgery last week, was averaging 17.5 
points before she re-injured the knee in a victory over Loyola Marymount. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Titan soccer Coach Al Mistri was surprised by the ease of Indiana's 4-1 
victory over UCLA in the semifinals of the NCAA soccer playoffs last weekend in 
Davidson, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched the game on television and I can't remember a game that one-sided 
on that level in a long time," Mistri said. Virginia won the national 
championship for the fourth consecutive year, defeating Indiana, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri remains optimistic about a good recruiting year on the heels of his 
team's second consecutive appearance in the final eight. 
</P>
<P>
 He also thinks the selection of two Titans, Alfred Partida and Joey Franchino, 
to practice with the U.S. under-21 team this month in North Carolina is another 
good sign the Fullerton program is being recognized nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Traditionally, 70% of this team goes on to make the Olympic team," Mistri 
said. "I think our team played just about everyone who was anyone in soccer 
this season other than Virginia, and we didn't see any young players of the 
caliber of those two in their positions. I think their chances are good of 
being selected." 
</P>
<P>
 Partida is a sophomore sweeper and Franchino a freshman midfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri has coached two players who made the Olympic team in the past, Rick 
Davis in high school at LaVerne and Mike Fox at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton center Winston Peterson leads the Big West in scoring with an 
average of 22.5 per game. He has scored 75 points in the last three games. The 
last Titan player to score that many points in three consecutive games was 
guard Aaron Sunderland, who also had 75 in three consecutive games in 1993 . . 
. The Titan men lead the Big West in one statistical category, blocked shots. 
Fullerton has had 18 in four games . . . Titan basketball recruit David 
Harrison from Mt. Hood (Ore.) College has completed academic work he needed to 
be eligible to enroll at the university and will start practice with the team 
Sunday. Senior guard Danny Robinson's status remains uncertain until a final 
exam grade is posted. Robinson could regain his eligibility in time for Tuesday 
night's home game against San Diego State.

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; IF YOU TAKE PRIVACY FOR GRANTED, DON'T; CROSSING OVER 
THE LINE: LEGISLATING MORALITY AND THE MANN ACT BY DAVID J. LANGUM ; UNIVERSITY 
OF CHICAGO PRESS $24.95, 304 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David J. Langum makes no effort to conceal the righteous fury that burns at 
the heart of "Crossing Over the Line," his scholarly monograph on the so-called 
Mann Act. Langum's book is dedicated to "the victims of the Department of 
Justice," and the very first line is an expression of the author's exasperation 
and indignation over the government's role in "legislating morality." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is hard to believe," he writes, "how things once were." 
</P>
<P>
 What has gotten Langum so worked up is an odd relic of American jurisprudence 
formally titled the White Slave Traffic Act, but more commonly known as the 
Mann Act. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was enacted in 1910 as part of a rather bizarre international crusade 
against white slavers who supposedly lured vulnerable young women into 
prostitution -- but Langum argues that the Mann Act was routinely used to 
criminalize even "purely consensual relationships, noncommercial in nature, 
between unmarried consenting adults." 
</P>
<P>
 All that was required for a conviction under the Mann Act in its original form 
was proof that a female, regardless of age, marital status or state of mind, 
was transported across state lines "for immoral purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 As Langum points out, the law criminalizes intent rather than conduct: " 
'Orwellian badthought,' plus transportation, defined the essence of the crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more celebrated victims of the Mann Act, as Langum shows us, was 
were Charlie Chaplin, whose radicals politics drew the attention of crafty 
federal prosecutors, and Frank Lloyd Wright, whose estranged wife used the law 
to leverage a favorable divorce settlement. But Langum argues that the Mann Act 
was (and is) a threat to everyone's freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost every adult American male . . . has violated the Mann Act at least 
once in his life," Langum writes. "Any man who has ever driven his girlfriend 
from New York to New Jersey, with the hope of sexual activities that evening . 
. . has committed a federal felony." 
</P>
<P>
 Langum explains how Americans whipped themselves into what he calls a "moral 
panic" over the imagined evils of a vast international trade in young women 
destined for service in brothels. 
</P>
<P>
 And he suggests that the hysteria was actually prompted by a kind of 
collective anxiety over "immigration, urbanization and changing sexual mores," 
all of which encouraged women to play a more liberated role in American life. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the original intent of the Mann Act, Langum demonstrates that a law 
intended to protect women from sexual predators was quickly turned into a 
weapon to punish "interstate adulterers or boyfriends and girlfriends" -- and, 
ironically, a tool for blackmailers who lured men into sexual liaisons and then 
threatened them with criminal prosecution if they did not pay hush money. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the Mann Act is something of a curiosity nowadays, but Langum 
insists that the outrages of the not-so-distant past are a healthy caution 
against more recent (and current) government attempts to punish people for how 
they conduct their private lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Langum, a law professor and historian, reminds us that the Mann Act is still 
on the books, although it has been modified and updated, and the government is 
still perfectly willing to prosecute men and women for purely private acts 
ranging from one's choice of reading matter to one's choice of sexual partners 
and sexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Congress has never had the courage to repeal an absurd law that has been 
used, and still could be used, to interfere with inoffensive activities or to 
persecute selected individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 "Crossing Over the Line" is a work of scholarship as wrought by a civil 
libertarian, and the text -- which is often quite technical -- sizzles with the 
passion of an ardent believer in real liberty under reasonable laws. And so 
Langum's book is a kind of wake-up call for Americans who may take their 
privacy and their personal freedom too much for granted.

ANGELS LAND A CLOSER; BASEBALL: ALL-TIME SAVE LEADER LEE SMITH AGREES TO 
TWO-YEAR, $4-MILLION CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Angels, who spent the last two seasons in anguish while watching their 
bullpen struggle, got the man they believe will make them an instant contender 
in the American League West, assuming there is a normal 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Smith, baseball's all-time saves leader, agreed Tuesday to a two-year, 
$4-million contract with the Angels that potentially is worth $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith will receive an $800,000 signing bonus, payable when baseball resumes, 
and a base salary of $1.5 million in 1995 and $1.7 million in 1996. He also can 
earn $500,000 a season for appearing in 55 games, and $500,000 for winning the 
Rolaids Relief award. The contract will become official after Smith passes a 
physical this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our club last year would have been a much, much better club with a 
closer," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said. "So obviously, I think we're a 
much better club with this signing. This was a major component missing in our 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 No one was actually predicting a pennant in the Angel offices, but considering 
the bullpen since the departure of Bryan Harvey . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I know he's not superman, he's not going to save every game," Angel Manager 
Marcel Lachemann said. "But you watch, he's going to make a difference of 10 to 
15 games. To have a guy of his caliber picks up the whole ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get into the ninth inning, we'll be in great shape. Obviously, we 
couldn't say that before." 
</P>
<P>
 The signing of Smith also may rectify the Angels' mistake of a year ago. They 
discussed signing Smith last winter but backed out when former General Manager 
Whitey Herzog received unfavorable scouting reports. 
</P>
<P>
 When Herzog resigned, Bavasi immediately brought up the prospect of signing 
Smith. Sorry, but this time Angel Manager Buck Rodgers wasn't interested. He 
wanted a bullpen-by-committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Smith saved a major league-leading 33 games in a strike-shortened 
season -- 12 more than the entire Angel bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last four or five years, I'm supposed to have been washed up," said 
Smith, 37. "So what's new about that? I've been written off since I was with 
the Cubs, and I was only 30 then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at my velocity; I look at the results." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his '94 performance, it wasn't until Monday that anyone else besides 
the Angels even bothered to submit an offer. The Baltimore Orioles -- fearing 
Smith's 0-4 record and 5.59 earned-run average after May 30 last season -- 
offered a one-year contract Monday for about $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have minded being back in Baltimore, but you can't always get what 
you want," Smith said. "I looked at the team, the options I had, and decided 
the California Angels were best-suited for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, they'll feel the same about me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are happy to have Smith, but there will be repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 They already have committed about $23 million of their $24.5-million budget to 
only 12 players, and say they have to trade center fielder Chad Curtis, who is 
making $1.9 million, and probably starter Chuck Finley ($4.5 million). 
</P>
<P>
 They removed left-handed reliever Bob Patterson from their roster Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals offered outfielder Mark Whiten and third baseman Todd Zeile for 
Finley, and the Blue Jays are willing to make an offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Signing Lee doesn't mean we're going to have to jettison our team," Angel 
President Richard Brown said, "but we might have to do some tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, you take everything with a grain of salt. I mean, what good is a 
Lee Smith or any signing without knowing when we'll be playing again." 
</P>

ORANGE COUNTY HALL OF FAME; A LIVING LEGEND; NOLAN RYAN TRIES, WITHOUT SUCCESS, 
TO LIVE THE QUIET LIFE AS A BANKER IN TEXAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The telephone relentlessly rings at The Express Bank in Alvin, Tex. Folks will 
sometimes call about their checking account. There are the occasional inquiries 
about the prime rate of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, most of the calls pertain to one man, leaving secretary Jill Bick 
scrambling each day just to uncover the mountain of messages on her desk. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, the owner of The Express Bank is Texas' own living legend, Nolan 
Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable around here," Bick said. "It's busier in the office now 
than when Nolan was still pitching. As soon as he walks in the office, the 
phone rings off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't matter to anyone that Ryan hasn't thrown a pitch in 15 months. It 
doesn't matter that he never will throw another no-hitter. It doesn't matter 
that the only time Ryan appears on television these days is pitching medication 
for headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll always be a hero to us folks," Bick said. "That will never change." 
</P>
<P>
 The requests are so numerous for Ryan's time that mail arrives in tubs from 
the Alvin post office. He does not give out autographs. He does not give 
speeches for money. He does not put on baseball fantasy camps. 
</P>
<P>
 He is simply a good ol' boy, who still tends to the cattle on his three 
ranches, who is still married to his high school sweetheart, who still dances 
the two-step with friends at the local country ballroom, and goes to 
Baskin-Robbins for those really big nights on the town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would I ever change?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said. "This is me. This is my life. And believe me, I've been blessed 
with a good one." 
</P>
<P>
 So it shouldn't surprise a soul that Ryan actually considers his induction on 
Sunday into the Orange County Sports Hall of Fame as an honor, although the 
magical one in Cooperstown, N.Y., still awaits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had a special place in my heart for the Angel organization and 
their fans," Ryan said. "I'll never forget them. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tend to remember what I did at the end of my career, but a lot of what 
I've accomplished is because of what I did in my eight years with the Angels. I 
look at Anaheim as the place where I established my career." 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly, the Angels and Orange County will never forget Ryan, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "He became the legend after the fact, but he always was an icon to the fans," 
Angel assistant general manager Tim Mead said. "He was what Angel fans could 
latch onto when Angel fans didn't have anything else to latch onto. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you watched Nolan Ryan, you were watching history, not just Nolan Ryan 
pitching a ball game." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan was with the Angels from 1972-1979, a period that was measured by the 
speed gun and the record book. He still holds or shares 20 club records, some 
that might never be broken. 
</P>
<P>
 He won at least 16 games six times with the Angels, and at least 19 games four 
times. He once won 22 games during a season in which the Angels went 68-94. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, of course, there were the strikeouts. He struck out 19 in a game four 
times as an Angel, 18 once, and 17 three times. He struck out 383 batters alone 
in 1973, a major league record that still stands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels once invited scientists from Rockwell International to time Ryan's 
pitches during a game against the Chicago White Sox. Ryan struck out Bee Bee 
Richard with a high fastball clocked at 100.9 m.p.h. . . . in the ninth inning 
. . . after having thrown more than 140 pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the fastest recorded speed in history, although Bob Feller insists he 
threw faster. Then again, Ryan also believes he has thrown faster on several 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the stuff of legends, but he became a folk hero in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitching at an age when he could have begun receiving his pension benefits, 
Ryan pitched his sixth and seventh no-hitters with the Texas Rangers, won his 
300th game, and struck out his 5,000th batter. 
</P>
<P>
 'You know how the media can make more of someone than is really there," former 
Ranger pitching coach Tom House said. "Well, Nolan was one of those superstars 
who was everything he appeared to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ryan: "I never anticipated staying around as long as I did, considering 
the style of pitcher I was. I expected my career to take the same course as 
most power pitchers -- somewhere in my 30s lose enough velocity that I would 
get out of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Ryan kept pitching and pitching and pitching and pitching. He wound 
up with a major league-record 5,714 strikeouts, seven no-hitters, and became 
the first to play 27 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the reason, of course, why former Angel General Manager Buzzie Bavasi 
forever has been haunted by the decision to allow Ryan to leave the Angels as a 
free agent in 1979. Bavasi blames no one but himself, but he simply was 
unwilling to become the first general manager to pay a player $1 million a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a Hall of Famer now," Bavasi said, "but I had to look at wins and 
losses, whether we were winning pennants with a pitcher who wanted $1 million, 
and it wasn't happening." 
</P>
<P>
 When Ryan left the Angels for the Houston Astros at the end of the 1979 
season, Bavasi looked at his 16-14 record, and uttered those infamous words: 
"All we have to do is find two 8-and-7 pitchers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan never forgot those words, but when he pitched his sixth no-hitter in 1990 
against Oakland, even he had to laugh upon receiving the following telegram 
from Bavasi: 
</P>
<P>
 "Nolan, some time ago I made it public that I made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to rub it in." 
</P>
<P>
 "No doubt about it," Bavasi said, "we should have kept him and I take full 
responsibility. But what people forget is that it was his option to leave, not 
ours. He could have still stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't give him that kind of money, not to a .500 pitcher. Listen, 
there's no doubt he's a Hall of Famer, but when he was with me, Nolan was a 
.500 pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "People love this guy, but please, (Sandy) Koufax is still the best I ever 
saw. Ryan might belong in the same class as Donald (Drysdale), but he isn't a 
Koufax. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, who could imagine there ever will be another Lynn Nolan Ryan Jr.?

BASEBALL TALKS EXTENSIVE, BUT BEAR NO FRUIT; LABOR: SIDES MEET UNTIL 2:15 A.M. 
AFTER PLAYERS REJECT TAX PLAN, BUT THEY ARE EXPECTED TO PRESENT NEW PROPOSAL 
TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It had to be the strangest scene yet in baseball's four-month-old labor 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 At 12:45 EST this morning, an amateur piano player named Donald Fehr took a 
practice break at a keyboard in the executive center where the final attempt to 
reach a negotiated settlement before the owners declare an impasse and 
implement their salary-cap proposal is taking place. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, Fehr wasn't playing "Taps" on the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 With the owners' negotiating committee still scheduled to leave today for 
Thursday's implementation meeting in Chicago, the two sides went past midnight 
for a second night in a row before finishing at 2:15 a.m. They indicated they 
would resume talks this morning, when the players have asked for an opportunity 
to present another proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Before adjournment for the night, union leader Fehr preached caution as he sat 
on the piano bench and said, "I don't know if this is going somewhere or if it 
is where it's going. Ideas sometimes come as the result of concentrated effort, 
and that's what we're attempting. We're analyzing, re-analyzing and 
re-analyzing, trying to see if there's a magic bullet there, some idea that 
will let the parties get through this. So far we haven't found it." 
</P>
<P>
 That they were still at it seemed amazing considering that the union had 
responded to the owners' deadline and fundamentally rejected their escalating 
tax plan during a joint meeting Tuesday morning. At that point, the talks 
seemed dead. Jerry McMorris, the moderate Colorado Rockies owner, said there 
was no sign of encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 Special mediator William J. Usery, however, launched a campaign of shuttle 
diplomacy, moving between the groups at opposite ends of the center here, and 
by late afternoon coaxed them together in smaller units. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners were represented by chief negotiator John Harrington, the Boston 
Red Sox chief executive officer; Philadelphia Phillie vice president David 
Montgomery, and two counsels, Chuck O'Connor and Rob Mansford. 
</P>
<P>
 The union reduced its team to Fehr, his brother Steve, a Kansas City attorney 
who has been working with the union since the strike began on Aug. 12; 
associate counsel Eugene Orza, and players David Cone, Tom Glavine and Jay 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 They met for about four hours before dinner -- during which Usery told a 
reporter that there had definitely been a development -- and for about two more 
hours before Fehr's piano break. After that they resumed talks, which some 
portrayed strictly as a show-and-tell performance on behalf of Usery and/or a 
demonstration of good-faith bargaining by both sides, knowing if the owners 
implement, the players will file a good-faith complaint with the National Labor 
Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're simply trying to exhaust all avenues," insisted Fehr, who at one point 
during the night, according to sources, brought up the possibility of 
eliminating salary arbitration in exchange for unrestricted free agency after 
two or three years of major league service, an idea rejected by owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Implementation will usher in a salary-cap system dramatically changing the way 
clubs do business, generate a series of legal challenges by the union, prompt 
the clubs to try to open spring camps with replacement players, reawaken 
Congressional interest in baseball's antitrust exemption and leave the union on 
strike this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 If Tuesday was D-Day in the crisis, the first salvo was fired in September 
1992 when the owners forced commissioner Fay Vincent out of office and opted 
not to replace him until a new agreement was reached to remove the threat of 
intervention by the industry's chief executive officer, as they felt Vincent 
had intervened to end the 1991 lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 They hired Richard Ravitch to analyze the industry's economic problems and 
design a new compensation system; voted to re-open bargaining talks a year 
early in December 1992; took 14 months to agree among themselves on a new 
revenue-sharing formula provided it was linked to a cap; voted to require 
three-fourths approval of a bargaining agreement rather than a majority, which 
made it more difficult for any one coalition to push through a settlement; 
unveiled their salary cap proposal on June 14; canceled the World Series for 
the first time in 90 years in mid-September ("the short-term pain is worth the 
long-term gain," acting Commissioner Bud Selig kept saying) and basically never 
strayed from their demand for cost certainty in a system that would reduce the 
players' share of the industry's $1.7 billion revenue from 58% to 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The system owners are expected to implement, the union has said repeatedly, 
will wipe out 25 years of negotiating gains, transfer millions from the players 
to owners by placing an artificial ceiling on the free market and virtually 
eliminate free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be phased in over four years, with no team allowed to have a payroll 
-- tabulated on the basis of many other expenses besides salaries -- more than 
100% above the 1994 average of about $34.8 million and all teams required to be 
within 88% of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Kasten, president of the Atlanta Braves and Hawks, referred to his NBA 
experience with a salary cap and said: "It won't take long for the general 
managers to figure how it works and the owners to get comfortable with it, but 
implementation doesn't really solve our problems . . . . We need a negotiated 
settlement. Until then we won't have baseball like we know it."

ANGELS GET THEIR CLOSER IN SMITH; BASEBALL: ALL-TIME SAVE LEADER AGREES TO 
TWO-YEAR CONTRACT, BUT FINLEY AND CURTIS PROBABLY WILL HAVE TO GO.

 The Angels, who spent the last two seasons in anguish while watching their 
impotent bullpen, got the man they believe will make them an instant contender 
in the American League West, assuming there is a normal 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Smith, baseball's all-time leader in saves, agreed to a two-year, 
$4-million contract Tuesday with the Angels that potentially is worth $6 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith will receive an $800,000 signing bonus, payable when baseball resumes, 
and a base salary of $1.5 million in 1995 and $1.7 million in 1996. He also can 
earn $500,000 a season for appearing in 55 games, and $500,000 for winning the 
Rolaids Relief award. The contract will become binding after Smith passes his 
physical. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our club last year would have been a much, much better club with a 
closer," General Manager Bill Bavasi said. "So obviously, I think we're a much 
better club with this signing. This was a major component missing in our team." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Manager Marcel Lachemann, "I know he's not Superman, he's not going to 
save every game. But you watch, he's going to make a difference of 10 to 15 
games. To have a guy of his caliber picks up the whole ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we get into the ninth inning, we'll be in great shape. Obviously, we 
couldn't say that before." 
</P>
<P>
 The signing of Smith also might rectify the Angels' mistake of a year ago. 
They discussed signing him then but backed out when former General Manager 
Whitey Herzog received unfavorable scouting reports. 
</P>
<P>
 When Herzog resigned, Bavasi again mentioned signing Smith, but by then, 
then-Manager Buck Rodgers wasn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith saved a major league high 33 games last season for Baltimore in a 
strike-shortened season -- 12 more than the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last four or five years, I'm supposed to have been washed up," said 
Smith, 37. "So what's new about that? I've been written off since I was with 
the Cubs, and I was only 30 then. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at my velocity, I look at the results." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his '94 season, it wasn't until Monday that any team other than the 
Angels submitted an offer. The Orioles -- looking at Smith's 0-4 record and 
5.59 earned-run average after May 30 last season -- offered a one-year contract 
for about $2.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have minded being back in Baltimore, but you can't always get what 
you want," Smith said. "I looked at the team, the options I had, and decided 
the California Angels were best suited for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are elated to have Smith, but there will be repercussions. 
</P>
<P>
 They have already committed about $23 million of their $24.5-million budget to 
only 12 players and say they have no choice now but to trade center fielder 
Chad Curtis, who is making $1.9 million, and probably left-handed starter Chuck 
Finley, who is making $4.5 million. They removed veteran left-handed reliever 
Bob Patterson from their roster Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Louis Cardinals offered outfielder Mark Whiten and third baseman Todd 
Zeile for Finley, and the Toronto Blue Jays are willing to make an offer. The 
Angels offered Curtis to the San Diego Padres and Chicago Cubs, but were 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "Signing Lee doesn't mean we're going to have to jettison our team," Angel 
President Richard Brown said. "But we might have to do some tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, you take everything with a grain of salt. I mean, what good is a 
Lee Smith or any signing without knowing when we'll be playing again?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Smith, who anticipates a free-agent signing freeze Thursday: "I'm not 
sure if we'll be worse off Thursday than we were Aug. 12 when this all started. 
It may be two years before we even play again, who knows?"

MIKE DOWNEY: SOME PIERCING STATEMENTS MADE IN RODMAN'S DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I came to work today with green hair. 
</P>
<P>
 There are tattoos on my arm from my wrist to my shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 I have three earrings in my left lobe and one in my nose. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody looked at me funny. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just what do you think you are doing?" asked my boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dressing like Dennis Rodman," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dressing like who?" asked my boss, who is not much of a basketball fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dennis Rodman," I said. "The Worm." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're dressing like a worm?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a worm," I said. "The Worm." 
</P>
<P>
 I explained that Dennis Rodman of the San Antonio Spurs returned to work last 
week after a protracted absence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was on the disabled list?" asked my boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe mentally," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is that supposed to mean?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dennis Rodman isn't physically disabled," I said. "He is psychologically 
challenged." 
</P>
<P>
 I explained that Dennis Rodman doesn't like to practice basketball, doesn't 
like to shoot the basketball and doesn't like to be coached in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does Dennis Rodman like?" asked my boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "He likes Madonna," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dennis is a Catholic?" asked my boss, who is not much of a music fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Madonna the singer," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Worm likes this singer?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "And she likes the Worm," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 I explained that Madonna apparently had a warm relationship with the Worm, 
which does not exactly make the Worm unique but at least puts him one-up on 
most of the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "Madonna likes men with green hair?" asked my boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Among other things," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So that's why you dyed your hair green?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Among other things," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 I explained that, like the Worm, I do not like to work, I do not like to take 
orders, and I do not like to be told how to look. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you can't do your job with green hair," said my boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why?" I asked. "The Worm does." 
</P>
<P>
 "But what if everybody came to work with green hair?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd dye mine orange," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 I explained that, like the Worm, I like to be different. I want famous singers 
to like me, and they like men who are different. They like men with green hair 
and tattoos and nostril rings. 
</P>
<P>
 "About those tattoos . . . " said my boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about my tattoos?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "One says 'MOTHER,' and the other is a woodpecker smoking a cigar," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's your point?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 I explained that Dennis Rodman has more tattoos than Robert De Niro did in 
"Cape Fear" and that it would take an average person more than 30 minutes just 
to read Dennis Rodman, unless that person had taken one of those speed-reading 
courses by Evelyn Wood. 
</P>
<P>
 "And those earrings . . . " said my boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "What about my earrings?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not in your ear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like wearing earrings in my nose," I said. "Tomorrow I might wear a nose 
ring in my ear. Or an ankle ring on my tongue." 
</P>
<P>
 I explained to my boss that freedom of expression is a fundamental birthright 
in this great nation of ours and that any government of the people, by the 
people, for the people permits me to wear green hair and tattoos, with liberty 
and justice for all. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you look weird," said my boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is to say who looks weird?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Could I wear red hair?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Red hair isn't weird," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is red hair weird on Dennis Rodman?" I asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rest my case," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 I explained that it shouldn't matter if my hair is pink and if I have more 
tattoos than the crew of the H.M.S. Bounty or if I have my bellybutton pierced. 
</P>
<P>
 "But why Dennis Rodman?" my boss asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why Dennis Rodman what?" I asked back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why make yourself look like him?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, see, I'm going bald," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah?" 
</P>
<P>
 "And I'm gaining weight," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So?" 
</P>
<P>
 "So, I need a role model," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're bald and overweight, but chose Dennis Rodman as a role model?" he 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I chose Charles Barkley, but he refused," I said.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; SHAW CALLS REPORTS OF DEAL INCORRECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram President John Shaw denied a published report Tuesday that there has been 
an agreement on the partial sale of the team, and dismissed the notion that he 
is closer to signing a lease to play in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The report is inaccurate," Shaw said. "There are several large unresolved 
lease issues and no deal is imminent." 
</P>
<P>
 It's known that talks between the Rams and St. Louis officials stopped more 
than a week ago. In an effort to re-open such talks, St. Louis directed a new 
proposal for Shaw's study Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Register reported Tuesday that the Rams had reached a 
"verbal agreement" to sell a minority share of the team to Missouri businessman 
Stan Kroenke. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said Kroenke has not agreed to buy a minority interest of the team, and 
Ram owner Georgia Frontiere has not agreed to sell a share of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only point we're at is that Georgia has met several times with Kroenke, 
and it appears they would be comfortable as partners," Shaw said. "Possible 
percentages and sales prices have been discussed, but nothing specifically has 
been agreed upon. Kroenke hasn't even agreed to purchase a minority interest in 
the team and Georgia has not signed off any such agreement because there is no 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we were to move to St. Louis and ownership decided to sell a minority 
share of the team, this is the guy with whom we would deal. But presently there 
is no deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Kroenke might prefer 100% ownership of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers rather than 
owning a share of the Rams with no say in team matters and no opportunity to 
gain majority interest at a later date. Kroenke met with the Buccaneer trustees 
in Tampa last weekend after visiting with Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no minority sale of the team until the team is in fact going to 
move," Shaw said. "The first step is the lease, and there are still a number of 
things to be discussed there." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw declined to provide a date when matters might be resolved, but it appears 
the team's future will remain in doubt until after the Rams' regular-season 
finale, Dec. 24 against Washington. T.J. SIMERS

LOS ALAMITOS' MELSBY COMMITS TO PLAY FOOTBALL AT UCLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Alamitos wide receiver Brad Melsby, The Times Orange County back of the 
year, has made an oral commitment to play football at UCLA next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby, who set Orange County records for career receptions, yards receiving 
and touchdown receptions, said he told UCLA Coach Terry Donahue during his 
visit to the Melsby residence Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to be Bruin," Melsby said. "UCLA just felt right. The coaches seem 
like class people, it's a solid program, it's a great academic school, and it's 
close to home." 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby, the Sunset League's most valuable player, caught 77 passes for 1,204 
yards this season and scored 14 touchdowns. During Melsby's three-year career 
at Los Alamitos, the Griffins were 39-1-1 and won two Southern Section Division 
II championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby, 6-1 and 183 pounds, also strongly considered Stanford, Minnesota and 
Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked all the schools," Melsby said. "UCLA just felt right. I figured that 
I know this is a good decision, so why should I wait? I think Coach Donahue was 
a little surprised when I told him." 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby's decision didn't surprise Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think UCLA is really excited to get Mels," Barnes said. "They've been 
wooing the heck out of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby finished his career with 185 receptions to break the county record of 
177 set by a former teammate, Los Alamitos' George Sagen (1990-92). Melsby's 
2,979 yards receiving and 35 touchdown receptions broke 19-year-old Orange 
County records set by Kennedy's Rick Parma.

PUTTING A PRICE ON THE TOP OF WORLD; SANTA MONICA MOTHER OF FIVE TAKES ON 
HIGHEST SUMMITS AT AGE 61, WHEN SHE ISN'T CLIMBING THROUGH GOLF BUSINESS, OTHER 
PURSUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the earth trembled and parts of the city crumbled last January, Dallas 
Price, like everyone else, was doing a whole lot of shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 But Price had no clue that a devastating earthquake was in progress. She was 
halfway around the world, shivering on the ice in Antarctica. 
</P>
<P>
 Price had just conquered Vinson Massif, which at 16,067 feet is the highest 
spot on the continent of Antarctica.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's minus-30, minus-40 all the time," Price recalled the other day from her 
home in Santa Monica. "And when the wind blows, which it does, it's minus in 
the 100s." 
</P>
<P>
 After their descent, Price and guide Pete Whittaker had to wait out a storm on 
a glacier for eight days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were low on fuel and food, but the real crisis was that we were running 
out of toilet paper," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 She made it back OK, only to find that her home, a multistory wooden house 
with huge glass windows, had not fared too well in the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 18 broken windows and all the cupboard doors had opened up and 
everything spilled out," Price said. "I had a major, major crystal collection. 
And it's totally gone." 
</P>
<P>
 She also had a major rock collection, which remained scattered on her wooden 
floors.  
</P>
<P>
 "The guys who came in to help put things back together didn't touch them 
because they didn't know where they're from," Price said, showing off the rocks 
that line her window sills, each next to a label indicating its origin. "And I 
thought, 'This is incredible; I know where these rocks go. I can put them in 
the country that they belong in.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And on the mountains from which they came. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinson Massif was special for Price because it was the seventh of the seven 
summits -- the highest elevation on each continent -- she has attempted. She 
says she has reached the tops of all but two -- Mt. McKinley because of poor 
weather and Mt. Everest because that was a team effort during the International 
Peace Climb in 1990. The United States, the Soviet Union and China climbed the 
mountain in stages and her group was not chosen for the summit climb. 
</P>
<P>
 In her tour of the continents' highest peaks, Price started in Africa and 
proceeded to Europe, Asia, South America, Australia, North America and finally 
Antarctica. She climbed Kilimanjaro in Tanzania in 1986; Mt. El'brus on the 
Russia-Georgia border in '89; Mt. Everest, the highest of the seven at 29,020 
feet, in Tibet in '90; Mt. Aconcagua in Argentina in '91; Mt. Kosciusko in 
Australia, the lowest at 7,310 feet, in '92; Mt. McKinley in Alaska in '93, 
then Vinson Massif last January. 
</P>
<P>
 What drives a 61-year-old mother of five to such heights? 
</P>
<P>
 "Like a lot of our clients, she tried it once, was bitten by the bug, so to 
speak, and decided to go around the horn," said Whittaker, who operates Summits 
Adventure Travel in Eatonville, Wash.  
</P>
<P>
 Whittaker, who comes from a family of mountaineers -- his uncle, Jim 
Whittaker, was the first American to successfully climb Mt. Everest -- then 
offered another possible explanation: 
</P>
<P>
 "She is just a remarkable woman, and one with the finances available to pursue 
such twisted adventures. She's one of those highly motivated, exceptional 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 This would seem difficult to argue. 
</P>
<P>
 As co-owner, vice president and board member of American Golf Corp., the 
world's largest golf operations company with 190 courses owned or leased in 
this country and abroad, Price works tirelessly. 
</P>
<P>
 Her latest project is a national effort to increase participation of women in 
the sport, both on the course -- by creating a more user-friendly atmosphere -- 
and in management positions. More than 25% of American Golf's 9,000 employees 
are women. 
</P>
<P>
 Price also owns California Design, Inc., which is responsible for the interior 
design of American Golf facilities. She is a founder and trustee of the Museum 
of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. She is a member of the Fellows of 
Contemporary Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Santa Monica 
Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband, David, were co-commissioners of basketball for the 1984 
Olympics. She is a member of the UCLA Foundation board of trustees and serves 
on the nominations committee. She helped establish the David G. and Dallas P. 
Price Chair of Law, the first endowed chair at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she has much more energy and strength than most people I know," said 
her husband, 62, founder and chairman of the board of American Golf. "I wish I 
had it. I have to take naps from time to time." 
</P>
<P>
 He certainly has no desire to go traipsing around the world on a whim. 
Especially when it means leaving the comforts of home behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried a couple of camping trips together, but they were bloody disasters 
because he hated it," Dallas said of David. "He just doesn't see a comfort 
level in sleeping on the ground in a sleeping bag on rocks and dirt and an 
uneven plane so . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 So Dallas Price heard about an Outward Bound women's program and thought, 
"That's perfect for me." 
</P>
<P>
 When someone in the group asked her to go trekking in Bhutan, Price was 
willing. 
</P>
<P>
 "A friend came up and said, 'Do you want to go?' I said, 'Where is it?' I had 
no clue. But I said, 'Sure.' I was really up to my tail feathers with a lot of 
work for the (1984) Olympics, so I had no opportunity to plan for it but I 
said, 'If you organize everything, I'll go.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She and six other women, led by a Bhutanese guide and porters, went their 
merry way, walking across the tiny country below Tibet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bhutanese man had never led a group of women before and he was absolutely 
panicked," Price recalled. "But as he got (to know us better), we had an 
incredible time. 
</P>
<P>
 "When (the porters) found out one of the girls was having a birthday, they 
baked a cake for her, but it was inedible. The sweet little things had done 
this marvelous job of baking this cake and -- the Bhutanese don't make cakes -- 
they put this frosting stuff on the top of it, but we couldn't cut it.  
</P>
<P>
 "All we had were our little Swiss Army knives and when we borrowed a knife 
from the kitchen supply we still couldn't cut it. So we ended up digging a hole 
and burying it. We didn't want to embarrass them." 
</P>
<P>
 When someone asked her if she wanted to climb Kilimanjaro, Price jumped at the 
chance. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though the mountain was littered with "a sea of toilet paper," she 
enjoyed herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she failed to reach the summit on McKinley -- making it to 17,000 
feet before snow and winds that "sounded like freight trains" sent her group 
back -- Dallas Price had become an accomplished mountain climber. 
</P>
<P>
 She also conquered Mt. Kenya in Africa and Mt. Cotopaxi in Ecuador, volcanoes 
Popocatepetl and Orizaba in Mexico and Mts. Hood, Rainier, Adams and Whitney in 
the western United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course all of that is behind her now. Her husband just bought her a 
motorcycle and she has been learning to ride it.  
</P>
<P>
 "She's really attacking it," David Price said. "She's going to be a Hell's 
Angel before you know it."

IT WAS A NIGHT TO FORGET, BUT MCKEON AND IACENDA CAN'T; HART PAIR HAUNTED BY 
MISCUES IN CHAMPIONSHIP-GAME SETBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Steve McKeon of Hart High has spent the past four days trying to 
put a bitter defeat into perspective, but the haunting persists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nightmare that you want to wake up from," he said this week. "I want 
to wake up from it and have it be Thursday evening and have Friday be game 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 But this is a living nightmare for McKeon, a junior who is the area's top 
quarterback. Sharing that nightmare is junior running back Ted Iacenda, who 
scored an area-record 41 touchdowns this season. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon threw three interceptions and Iacenda lost two fumbles in the first 
half as Hart, 13-0 and ranked No. 1 in The Times' area poll before Friday, was 
humbled, 36-15, by Antelope Valley in the Southern Section Division II 
championship game in front of 8,000 at College of the Canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to miscues by McKeon and Iacenda, the Antelopes (11-2) built a 29-0 
lead at halftime and the Indians' hopes for a third section title and the first 
perfect record in school history were gone. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, who entered the game with only seven interceptions in more than 200 
passes, had a seven-game stretch earlier this season in which he threw no 
interceptions. Iacenda had one fumble in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just shocked to see us go out in this fashion," McKeon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart players and coaches met for the first time since the game on Tuesday to 
look at game film. By then, McKeon and Iacenda had drawn their own conclusions 
for the Hart failure. "We panicked," Iacenda said. "They kept scoring and we 
kept making mistakes. We got apprehensive and our confidence went down." 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, who completed 61% of his passes this season for 2,925 yards and 30 
touchdowns, had triggered an offense that scored 51 and 55 points the previous 
two weeks. But against Antelope Valley, Hart's massive offensive linemen, who 
average 6-foot-4, 266 pounds, provided little protection against the quicker 
Antelope Valley defense when McKeon was forced to throw on nearly every down 
because of the early deficit. He was sacked seven times. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon wanted to throw deep, but a three-deep zone by the Antelopes prevented 
it. When he scrambled to avoid the rush, he threw a number of wobblers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to heave it every time we had to go deep," he said. "Who can't 
intercept a 50-yard duck?" 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon and Iacenda said they still believed they could win had they scored in 
the first half but the Indians squandered two chances in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart drove to the Antelope Valley 47-yard line, but on first down Iacenda was 
dropped for a two-yard loss. On the next play, McKeon seemed to get impatient 
and threw deep but his pass was intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the Indians had a first down on the Antelope Valley 34-yard line but 
McKeon was sacked as time ran out in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people went into halftime really down, because they thought it was 
over," Iacenda said. "Twenty-nine points is nothing in our (run-and-shoot) 
offense. Our coaches were telling us to relax. How many times have we scored 29 
points in less than a half?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hart scored two touchdowns in the second half to narrow the margin to 29-15. 
But Antelope Valley put the game out of reach by marching 80 yards in 11 plays 
for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still upsetting," Iacenda said. "I still get sick to my stomach when I 
think about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Iacenda suffered from a bad cold throughout the week. Because section rules 
require a player to attend school on game day to be eligible to play, Iacenda 
spent most of Friday sleeping in the nurse's office. 
</P>
<P>
 But a fever and fatigue weren't factors in the game, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to COC ready to play football," he said. "The sickness did not make me 
fumble twice or miss my blocks." 
</P>
<P>
 So where does Hart go from here? 
</P>
<P>
 Back to the championship game with a lesson learned, Iacenda said. It might 
happen. With 20 seniors on a roster of 49, Hart was a fairly young team. The 
biggest losses will be receivers Chris McCabe, Domenic DeLillio and Jeremy 
Seipel, and four big offensive linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm never going to forget (this defeat)," Iacenda said. "I am going to use 
it, hopefully, to my advantage next year. I am not going to let (my teammates) 
forget about it. We're going to learn from our mistakes. This is not going to 
happen again."

CSUN MAKING A CUT LIST, PUBLIC MAY CHECK IT SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A list of possible cuts being considered within the Cal State Northridge 
athletic department could be made public by the end of the week, a school 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Kopita, the Northridge dean of students, said that by Friday he and 
President Blenda J. Wilson might finalize a handful of budgetary scenarios that 
could result in the elimination of some athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 According to officials in the athletic department, Northridge is facing a 
budget deficit of about $700,000 in 1995-96. Northridge administrators have 
spent the past few weeks detailing a series of cuts and configurations in the 
department to offset the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson on Monday was presented with a list of scenarios that Kopita 
characterized as ranging from "A to Z." 
</P>
<P>
 "After we meet again, it'll probably be more along the lines of A through E," 
Kopita said. "We'd like to get this problem resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Kopita said that once Wilson pares the list of options, they will be made 
public and feedback will be sought. Wilson could make a final decision by early 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining enrollment and the defeat of two referendums that would have hiked 
student fees to subsidize athletics are largely to blame for the looming 
deficit, officials said.

GRIMSON IS HOPEFUL OF SETTLEMENT; HOCKEY: DUCKS' WINGER OPTIMISTIC THERE WILL 
BE GAMES BUT IS SURPRISED THE BOARD GRANTED BETTMAN THE POWER TO CANCEL SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Mighty Duck left wing Stu Grimson knows time is running out on the 1994-95 NHL 
season and wonders what the league's Board of Governors was thinking Monday 
when it empowered Commissioner Gary Bettman to cancel the season if 50 games 
and full playoff schedule could not be completed by July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But Grimson also remains hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even as bleak as it looks, and this is more hunch than fact, there is still a 
window of opportunity to get it done," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Ron Wilson joined Grimson, the Ducks' assistant player representative, 
in expressing optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hopeful and optimistic we'll have a deal done in a week to 10 days," 
Wilson said. "Maybe as we get closer to the cliff, it seems like it would be 
easier to jump over. But I think it would be harder to jump when you're right 
there (on the edge)." 
</P>
<P>
 So what happens if the season is canceled? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at a nuclear winter," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Wilson's optimism, Duck President Tony Tavares said, "I hope he's right. 
There's nothing that would cause me to be optimistic." 
</P>
<P>
 When pressed about the state of negotiations, Tavares added: "Until we get 
closer, even the whitest doves will not think about signing a deal based on 
what's on the table." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimson said he was shocked the board voted, 26-0, to give Bettman the power 
to cancel the season. He was concerned why the moderates would give up their 
votes to Bettman. 
</P>
<P>
 "You do have to wonder where it (their thinking) comes from," Grimson said. "I 
have no comment about the hard-liners. For the doves and moderates, it stems 
from what's on the table today. Most everybody understands there is a 
profitable future for the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not completely surprised. There's not a great deal of accountability on 
the other side. The players feel comfortable that if this thing goes down in 
flames, we can walk away without any worries. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's their (ownership's) thought process, everyone stands to suffer. The 
fans, the people who work at the concession stands." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman has not given a so-called drop-dead date for canceling the season but 
said the players need to make a better offer. He said the players' latest 
proposal was unanimously rejected at Monday's board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not about a league fighting with a union, this is about a league 
fighting for its future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimson wasn't buying that argument. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've conceded far beyond the point we ever thought we would," Grimson said. 
"Is there any further for the union to come?" 
</P>

<P>
 Michael O'Brien, a walk-on football player earlier this season at USC, is 
expected to be arraigned today for allegedly assaulting three students on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, 22, surrendered to police Tuesday.He has been accused of punching a 
female student in the face and breaking the jaw and eye socket of a male 
student on Sept. 16. On Dec. 5, O'Brien allegedly broke a male student's leg 
and ankle by throwing him to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien, who left the team in October according to a USC spokesperson, is 
being held on $120,000 bail and if convicted of the three counts of assault 
could be sentenced to 11 years in state prison.

NEW EVIDENCE LEADS JUDGE TO BLOCK SHOTPUTTER'S AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a copy of an alleged diary contradicting a key witness mysteriously 
surfaced, University of Georgia shotputter Brent Noon's $983,000 jury award in 
a suit against USA Track & Field was overturned Tuesday. A new trial was 
ordered in San Diego Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual decision, Judge Richard Haden ruled the diary, allegedly kept by 
Georgia assistant track coach Rolf Ubel, might have affected the outcome of 
Noon's civil suit against the national governing body for track and field. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon, of San Diego, sued USATF , claiming it illegally banned him from 
competition for a month in 1992 when he failed to appear for a random drug 
test. He alleged track officials did not properly notify him of the test, then 
tried to cover up the error by forging documents. The suit also said some 
officials spread rumors that the three-time NCAA champion used anabolic 
steroids. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest court action came after Bob Hersh, USATF general counsel, received 
a copy of the diary by mail from an anonymous source. The document contradicted 
parts of Ubel's trial testimony regarding when Noon was notified of the random 
test. Ubel denied knowledge of the document in a written statement to the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Haden said the new evidence was significant enough to perhaps result in a 
different verdict. A hearing is scheduled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Dean, one of Noon's attorneys, said he is preparing an appeal, 
contending the alleged diary might not have been admissible during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable," said Barbara Noon, Brent's mother. "To us, it's more of 
the same. It seems so unfair. All I know is what the truth is, and that's what 
is hurtful (about the decision)." ELLIOTT ALMOND

DEAL KEEPS ARLINGTON PARK OPEN; HORSE RACING: RACING DAYS REDUCED FROM 130 TO 
55 WHILE RIVAL TRACKS GET EXTRA DATES, PROMISE HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Illinois Racing Board on Tuesday approved a deal by Chicago-area track 
owners that will keep Arlington International Race Course open while limiting 
racing days in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the pact agreed to by Chicago-area track owners, Arlington will race 55 
days instead of its usual 130. Sportsman's Park dates will jump from 73 to 90 
and Hawthorne's from 73 to 84. Facing a possible shortage of horses, the tracks 
will race five days a week instead of the previous six. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, owners of Sportsman's Park and Hawthorne said that if Arlington's 
daily handle doesn't generate its 1994 level of $190,000 a day in purses, they 
will make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8-1 vote in favor of the plan ends a monthslong saga that included 
Arlington owner Richard Duchossois threatening to shutter his track in 1995 
unless the state gave him a riverboat casino license. He complained that he 
can't compete against the Elgin riverboat, which docks only 12 miles from his 
track. He was projecting losses at Arlington as high as $6 million because of 
competition from the riverboat. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse racing is a $1.3 billion industry in Illinois, with about 25,000 people 
breeding, training and racing horses. About 12,000 people work in related jobs. 
Arlington generates 4,500 jobs in Arlington Heights and supports other jobs in 
related businesses elsewhere in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners from Arlington, Balmoral Park, Maywood Park, Sportsman's Park in 
Chicago and Hawthorne in Stickney told racing board members that business 
siphoned off to casinos has caused purses to shrink. That, they say, sent the 
best horses out of state, where wagering is higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners promised to stick together to lobby state lawmakers for reforms of the 
state's racing laws and for a jointly held riverboat casino license. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will be on our Christmas list. Absolutely," said Charles "Stormy" 
Bidwill, owner of Sportsman's Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Duchossois, "Everything is competitive with everything else under the 
proper conditions, and what we're endeavoring to do is get those conditions so 
we have a level playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 Duchossois had estimated his daily purse would dip as low as $100,000 with the 
Elgin riverboat, which opened this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne and Sportsman's Park would subsidize Duchossois' operation because 
"the demise of Arlington would be swiftly followed by the demise of Hawthorne, 
Sportsman's, Balmoral and Maywood," Bidwill said.

THE TIMES 1994 FALL ALL-COUNTY TEAMS; COUGARS' SANCHEZ LEAVES REST OF FIELD IN 
HIS WAKE; RUNNER OF THE YEAR: SENIOR FROM CAPISTRANO VALLEY WINS COUNTY TITLE 
AND DOMINATES AREA COMPETITION DURING ANOTHER SUCCESSFUL SEASON.

 He was so much better than everyone in Orange County that he probably never 
thought about losing to a local runner. 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley's Adalberto Sanchez, The Times Orange County runner of the 
year, thoroughly dominated area competition with his aggressive style, running 
away with numerous invitational titles, in addition to another league crown and 
his first Orange County Championship title. 
</P>
<P>
 The beginning of his senior season was delayed when his first race -- the 
Laguna Hills Invitational -- was canceled because of excessive heat on the 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 The next week, Sanchez coasted to a divisional victory at the Woodbridge 
Invitational, then a week later, finished with the second-fastest time of the 
day at the Dana Hills Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14:37 in the latter race was the fastest by any county athlete on any 
three-mile course during the 1994 season. After finishing third in the county 
championships as a junior, Sanchez achieved one of his seasonal goals with a 
25-second victory over runner-up Glenn Busch of Orange in 15:13. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez won his third-consecutive South Coast League title after streaking 
undefeated through the league dual meets. He won the race by 31 seconds, in 
15:11. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Southern Section Division I preliminaries was the race that put him on 
the map, as he defeated a talented field, including two eventual members of the 
Foot Locker national team. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez cruised to a 15:08 clocking on a Mt. San Antonio College course that 
features rigorous hills, besting Camarillo's Eleazar Hernandez and Hart's Brett 
Strahan to stake his claim as one of the State's top runners. 
</P>
<P>
 The next week in the section final, Hernandez edged Sanchez by 1/2 second 
(14:54). 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez led the state's finest through the half-way point the next weekend in 
the Division I race at the State championships in Fresno, but faded to finish 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I went out a little too fast," Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Too fast. That's what most people think when they think of Adalberto Sanchez.

THE ROUGH RIDER; ENTREPRENEUR. PHILANTHROPIST. HELL'S ANGEL SONNY BARGER IS 
JUST A REGULAR GUY. UNLESS YOU CROSS HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERDrawing,

<TEXT>
<P>
 Draped above the door of Ralph (Sonny) Barger's little brown house on Golf 
Links Road is a cheerful cardboard banner with wreaths and holly and the words 
"Merry Christmas." A nearby window sports a foot-high, stained-glass, winged 
death's skull. 
</P>
<P>
 Such are the contrasts in a Hell's Angel's life these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, more than 700 supporters showed up at a party to celebrate Barger 
getting off two years' parole -- after the most famous Angel served four years 
in federal prison for his role in a nationwide conspiracy to blow up a rival 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the partiers was U.S. Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell (D-Colo.), who told a 
Bay Area reporter that the days when bikers were synonymous with trouble are 
past. "These clubs are much different now," he said. "They're very 
respectable." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Angels' role in society has never been that simple, as Campbell 
learned from the swirl of controversy back in Colorado that followed his 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Angels keep getting caught up in the sort of headlines that 
tend to raise respectable eyebrows: 
</P>
<P>
 On June 28, the vice president of a Rockford, Ill., club -- which law officers 
say is merging with the Angels -- was slain in his motorcycle shop; on Sept. 
25, two bikers were killed and eight injured in a wild gunfight between Angels 
and a rival club at an Upstate New York raceway; on Nov. 7, bombs exploded at 
the Chicago and Rockford headquarters of the Angels-affiliated club. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing: While Barger, 56, dismisses the club's notoriety for crime and 
violence as exaggerated, and characterizes incidents back East as something 
that could happen to anyone -- "Catholics probably commit more crimes than we 
ever thought of, probably politicians commit more crimes" -- he's clearly not 
keen on being lumped in with your run-of-the-mill "citizen." 
</P>
<P>
 Barger lives with Sharon, his wife of 21 years, in a house near the Oakland 
Zoo that he bought in the mid-'60s. His repair and parts shop, Sonny Barger's 
Oakland Custom Motorcycles, is a few miles away in a scruffier nook of the 
city, where beauty parlors, coin laundries and auto repair shops coexist with a 
smorgasbord of ethnic restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Barger's demeanor is relaxed, his manner polite, almost patrician, as he sits 
in his office, leaning back in a swivel chair draped with a black leather 
jacket emblazoned "Hell's Angels M/C." 
</P>
<P>
 From the shop he looks across the street to an Oakland landmark of sorts, a 
two-story building whose door is emblazoned with a bright brass skull with a 
winged headdress -- the Angels' copyrighted emblem. A brick wall sports a brass 
plate reading, "Clubhouse of the Oakland Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club, founded 
on April 1, 1957, by Sonny Barger and others." 
</P>
<P>
 Barger shrugs off the notion that he is a charismatic leader. If he inspires 
loyalty, he says, it's because of his basic philosophy: "I treat everyone 
exactly the way I want to be treated. If they treat me good, I treat them 
better. If they treat me bad, I treat 'em worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Barger's hair is close-cropped now, his face evenly tanned, his body compact 
from a daily workout and regular jogging. The blue tattoos decorating his arms 
have gone fuzzy with age. By appearances, most of the hard edges have softened 
from the young Barger shown in a poster-sized photo on the wall: tangled, 
shoulder-length hair, goat-like beard, tongue poking out in maniacal defiance. 
</P>
<P>
 Barger achieved the rank of outlaw legend in the '60s, as events and biker 
films conspired to mythologize the group. Even then, the club played an 
off-kilter role in the culture. During the Vietnam era, the Angels earned a 
national reputation for roughing up anti-war demonstrators -- proof of their 
patriotism, Angels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hell's Angels did embrace one '60s convention, though. By the '70s, law 
enforcers say, the sale of illegal drugs, especially methamphetamine, made the 
club increasingly rich and ruthless. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll notice," Barger says, "I was never in my life busted with 
methamphetamine. Ever. You'll also notice I spent most of the '70s in prison." 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't deny, though, that drugs had an effect. "I'm certain I went to 
prison because I used cocaine. . . . I don't know exactly how to explain it, 
other than that you do a lot of stupid things you wouldn't do if you weren't 
loaded." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the business side, he says: "I sold a few drugs myself, but I never 
made the multimillions they claim. If I did, I sure wouldn't be here working 
today. . . . As for anybody else, I'd rather let them speak for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, doctors removed Barger's cancerous larynx. To speak, he touches a 
small patch on his neck. His voice is a gentle growl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels belief system, he says, isn't complicated: "I just believe we have 
a right to do anything we want to do as long as we're not hurting anyone else, 
and if anyone tries to stop us, we have a right to step on them." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't happen often, Barger says, at least not to the mainstream 
citizens who fear the club: "99% of the violence Hell's Angels have been 
charged with was against other people in the same social and economic class 
we're in. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the criminal charges leveled against him over the years were 
justified, Barger concedes. But he argues that prosecutors have pushed for more 
severe sentences than the charges deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? "Because I was found innocent on murder," he says, referring to a jury's 
decision, in 1972, that prosecutors had failed to prove their allegation that 
Barger killed a man who had sold bad drugs to Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Barger says he has spent a total of "12 or 13 years" in prison -- "Not much, 
considering all the fun I've had. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think doing time is just part of growing up," he says. "There's just 
certain things you've got to do in your life. You've got to go to school, 
you've got to go in the Army, you've got to go to jail. It all helps you to 
have a well-rounded life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One wall of the group's clean and orderly clubhouse features framed 
black-and-white police mug shots of Angels, including Barger, and photos of 
apparently bad-to-the-bone biker dudes are a dominant decorative motif. 
Upstairs, surrounding two pool tables, is an array of arcade-style video games 
that keep members' kids busy during parties, Barger says. Just inside the door 
is a rack displaying 15 smoothly sanded ax handles -- a backup security system 
to supplement the video monitors that scan the building's exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 Laden as it is with retro biker memorabilia, the juke joint-style clubhouse, 
with its wooden bar and feathered skull carvings, could probably be franchised, 
like a faux-low rent variant of the Hard Rock Cafe. The outlaw chic ambience 
would likely attract hordes of rich, urban bikers -- "Rubbies" to some. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barger shakes his head at the suggestion. Sharon Barger does sell T-shirts 
featuring her husband ("Sonny Barger, American Legend" says the one with flames 
on the sleeves). And they've also started marketing Sonny Barger's Cajun Style 
Salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 But the only item the club itself sells to the public is an annual calendar, 
each month featuring a full-color portrait of a different Angel and his bike. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmakers have been trying to persuade Barger to tell his story for 30 years, 
but he hasn't cooperated, he says. And the Angels' rule against non-members 
wearing their "colors" has complicated things.  
</P>
<P>
 But the impasse may be over, Barger adds. Independent producer John Eastman 
confirms that a screenplay about Barger and the club, researched and written by 
a 70-year-old woman and approved by the Angels, is likely to enter the 
pre-production fray next year. The distinction between the club's reality and 
the show biz spin, will, presumably, become even more blurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Angels do successfully meld into the mainstream these days. Jim (Guinea) 
Colucci, an Angel for 20 years and a partner in Barger's shop, says he served 
as president of a Northern California Little League for two years and coached 
his son's team ("We went 0-10."). 
</P>
<P>
 No one knew he was an Angel, he says, until the day he showed up for practice 
on his "Hog." Even then, the league parents decided not to hold his Angel ties 
against him. His Moose Lodge brothers were equally understanding when they 
found out about his other club affiliation, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Barger, on the other hand, participates in charity rides but otherwise prefers 
to avoid mainstream society. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something that appeals to me," he says. "One of the things that has 
always amazed me about reporters during my whole life, 99% of them . . . will 
say, 'Gee, after talking to you I find that you're halfway intelligent. You 
could have been anything you wanted to be!' They don't realize, I am what I 
want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he refuses to say how many Hell's Angel members there are now, Barger 
says that the club is going through a growth spurt. To explain the continuing 
appeal, Barger recalls a conversation he says occurred at a Libertarian 
convention in Aspen, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 As Barger tells it, a woman asked: "I'd like to know what it feels like to 
walk into a room and know that every man in that room at some time in his life 
wished he was you." 
</P>
<P>
 Barger said, "I'm not that sure that's ever happened." 
</P>
<P>
 She said, "It happened when you just walked into this room a minute ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Barger said, "How do you figure that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "At some point in every man's life," she said, "there was a situation he was 
involved in, and he wished he was you so he could have handled it." 
</P>
<P>
 Barger thinks there is truth in that observation. "We are the type of people 
who handle situations, whatever they are." 
</P>
<P>
 In that sense, he says, the Angels are throwbacks to the Wild West. And the 
Wild West era was a better time to live, he figures: "I think people treated 
each other better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barger knows that a lot of people view the Angels not as romantic outlaw 
heroes, but rather as dangerous bullies from whom they are glad to be 
protected. 
</P>
<P>
 To his way of thinking, though, the government is the bully. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he has heard that he was on a list of targets who would put a feather 
in prosecutors' caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Who else was on the list? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," he says with a naughty-boy smile. "But I think Gotti might 
have been. I think anybody who stands out, anybody who's newsworthy is probably 
on the list . . . whether they're a good guy or a bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Barger into which of those categories he fits, and he maintains an even 
stare. "I guess it would depend," he says, fingers pressed to throat patch, "on 
who's looking at it."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: TALES OF MOVE-AWAY PARENTS NEED HAPPY ENDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You fall in love. You get married. You have a child. You get a divorce. You 
become the custodial parent, the parent who stays home when the child falls 
ill, who helps with homework, who cooks and cleans and plays. You are -- 
because this is just the way it is -- the primary parent. 
</P>
<P>
 You make the child available, per the legal agreement, for visits with your 
ex-spouse. Sometimes your ex-spouse doesn't show up. The court doesn't care 
about that. All the court cares about is that the child is made available . 
Whether the other parent shows up is irrelevant to the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a happy ending, but your life goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 You meet someone new. You fall in love. You get married. Your new spouse, a 
military officer, gets transferred to a different base. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you don't meet someone new, but you receive a long-sought promotion, 
requiring a move to a new city. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you are accepted to a doctoral program in a different state. 
</P>
<P>
 You ask the court to change the custody arrangement. Instead of every other 
weekend and one night a week, you suggest, your kid can live with the other 
parent for 10 weeks each summer and on holidays. Your ex objects. Rip my child 
away from me?  
</P>
<P>
 Never mind that if the non-custodial parent should choose to move to a new 
city -- for any reason whatsoever -- the court neither cares nor objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, after too much money is spent by both sides on lawyers' fees and 
psychological evaluations, the judge says you are free to accompany your new 
spouse, or take your promotion or pursue your education. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a hitch. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't take your child. 
</P>
<P>
 Not a happy ending and your life comes to a screeching halt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These scenarios describe what is called in family law circles "the move-away 
problem." Usually -- but not always -- the custodial parent is the mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Painful anecdotes are legion. Many are told in letters to Dorothy Jonas, who 
has worked on legislation that would allow custodial parents the presumption of 
being able to move with their children for legitimate (read: non-punitive) 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 A state Senate bill died last year, and the outlook is bleak. But Jonas, a 
co-founder of the Coalition for Family Equity in Los Angeles, isn't giving up. 
This time, the coalition will try for a bill that calls for a study. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever we come before legislative bodies," Jonas says, "they say, 'What are 
your statistics? How many cases?' You can't build the statistics except from 
the appellate level, but most mothers are too poor to get to that level. So we 
would look at lower-court rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have, in the meantime, are hundreds of anecdotes. Legislators don't 
like anecdotes, but that is what in large part women's lives are." 
</P>
<P>
 There's the mother of two in San Diego, whose ex-husband asked her to postpone 
entrance to graduate school in another state for one year to give him time to 
bond with his children. At year's end he took her to court to prevent her from 
leaving because he and the children had bonded. 
</P>
<P>
 She is still in San Diego, having abandoned her dreams of a doctorate. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's the mother of one in Ventura who was laid off when two banks 
merged, but was offered a job with the new company in Sacramento, along with 
the opportunity to keep her seniority and benefits. But a judge refused to let 
her move with her 4-year-old son, telling her that her work was only a "scut 
job" and that she should "pick up another." His ruling was reversed on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Without any guiding legislation, California court rulings have been wildly 
inconsistent. Judges, interested in preserving their discretion in individual 
cases, do not perceive this as a problem and opposed last year's move-away 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 If they could see beyond the combative parents sitting in their courtrooms to 
the larger picture, they might change their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Bowermaster, a professor at California Western School of Law in San 
Diego, can describe the big picture. She has studied 200 move-away cases and 
has found that mothers are usually penalized: "Denying permission to relocate 
reinforces the economic disparity created during the marriage when the primary 
caretaker performed the bulk of uncompensated child care and the secondary 
caretaker enjoyed unfettered market opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 These cases are difficult, she says, but not intractable. Instead of using 
some impossibly Solomonic way of treating divorced parents in custody disputes, 
courts need only recognize that the best interests of children are often 
inextricable from the best interests of the custodial parent. (How, for 
instance, does it serve the child's best interest to tell the custodial parent 
to go ahead and move, but without the child?) 
</P>
<P>
 The "frequent and continuing" contact to which a child is entitled with the 
non-custodial parent can certainly be accomplished with letters, phone calls 
and extended visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Supreme courts in several other states -- including Florida, Nevada, South 
Dakota, Tennessee and Vermont -- have acknowledged that simple fact in recent 
rulings. And, encouragingly, two recent California appellate court decisions 
have also allowed custodial parents to move. 
</P>
<P>
 But without guiding legislation or a state Supreme Court decision, family 
court judges may continue to rule in ways that punish (mostly) women. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of ways to maintain relationships long distance," says 
Bowermaster, who should know. Six years ago when she was offered a job in 
California, her then-13-year-old daughter opted to stay in the Midwest with her 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything," she says, "we have become closer." 
</P>
<P>
 It's just an anecdote, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 But if we got a bill passed turning it into a statistic, then maybe we'd be 
able to give these stories some happy endings.

THE TRAIN TO TOYLAND MAY SOON CHUG TO A HALT; STILL LOOKING FOR BARBIE OR 'LION 
KING' STUFF? WITH ONLY 11 DAYS LEFT, YOU MAY ALREADY BE TOO LATE.

 Bad news Mom and Dad: Not one Amav 6-in-1 -- a game table that lets players 
switch from pool to Ping-Pong to hockey, soccer or two types of basketball -- 
is left in the Western Hemisphere. (Or at least within driving distance of 
Southern California.) 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't gotten one of this season's unexpected hits yet, chances are 
you never will. Same goes for "Lion King" video games and Barbie's High Stepper 
Horse. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, despite cries of desperation from many parents, the latest White 
Ranger/White Tigerzord entries in the mega-hyped Mighty Morphin Power Rangers 
series can still be found in selected Toys R Us and Target stores, merchants 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 The popularity of the Amav table, recommended for ages 6 and up, came as a big 
surprise, says Alex Gerstenzang, zone merchant manager for Target. "We've had 
this table for three years. We only advertised it once. We had no idea it would 
take off the way it did," he says. "Nothing is outselling the 6-in-1." 
</P>
<P>
 Its price ranged from $129 at Target to $274 in F.A.O. Schwarz catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a really cool thing," says Roozbeh Kashani, 10, of Sherman Oaks. "It's 
educational, and you wouldn't have to waste money at the arcade. After you do 
your homework you have all these cool games to play." 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget the homework and do all the cool games," counters Kashani's friend 
Nicolas Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 With its 6-and-1 supply depleted, Target issued rain checks and offered its 
customers another table, the Fisher-Price 3-in-1. "But Fisher-Price was only 
able to ship half of the rain checks," Gerstenzang says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to avoid a similar run on its limited stash of new Barbies, Target 
pulled its Barbie ads early this month. Still, supplies of My Size Barbie, 
Gymnast Barbie, Dr. Barbie and Dance 'n' Twirl Barbie are low citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Consulting his computer in El Segundo, Joe Ordile of Toys R Us foresees a 
Barbie doll drought beginning this weekend. "We can go about one more week, and 
then there won't be any more product available," the inventory control manager 
says of the hottest-selling models. Barbie's High Stepper Horse won't last even 
that long, he predicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Other toys on the way out include Tiger's voice-altering Deluxe Talkboy; 
Kenner's Ricochet remote-controlled cars; Knex construction sets; Jumpsie, a 
doll that bounces on a trampoline; Fisher-Price's Great Adventure Castle, and 
Thomas the Tank Engine play sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Video games are also selling briskly, with Donkey Kong in the lead. It remains 
in good supply, but no one anticipated the demand for the game version of "The 
Lion King." Both the Sega System and Nintendo supplies are slipping fast. 
</P>
<P>
 And the selection will only get worse during peak week. "The hot things really 
start to decline (in supply) after the 18th," Ordile says. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, some parents have gone so far as to bribe stock clerks. "People will 
call me about Power Rangers stuff. If we have it, they'll say, 'I'll give you 
$100 to hold it for me,' " says Mason Hasson, manager of Kay-Bee Toys in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuy Iniguez, manager of the toy department in a North Hollywood Target, has 
had similar offers, "but by that time, I'm out of the toys and won't get 
anymore so I haven't collected. Not that I would." 
</P>
<P>
 Ordile suggests calling the stores or their regional offices before joining 
the frenzy to find out which location has the best supply of an item. Or try 
the larger swap meets, Gerstenzang says. Often, the most coveted items wind up 
there.

REAL LIFE: '90S FAMILY; CAREGIVERS FACE A CYCLE OF CHALLENGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Magnolia Manor, a Methodist retirement center and nursing home just down the 
road from Plains, Ga., would be perfect for her 89-year-old mother, former 
First Lady Rosalynn Carter said the other day. The only problem is, her mother 
doesn't want to go. Instead, she lives by herself, still driving somewhat 
precariously through the tiny town and depending on her children. 
</P>
<P>
 So Carter, the oldest of four siblings and the designated caretaker, worries. 
She feels responsible. Plus, she said, "I feel really guilty I can't be there 
with her all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, Carter can relate to the country's estimated 10 million 
caregivers, for whom she has co-authored a guidebook, "Helping Yourself Help 
Others" (Times Books, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 In a sweet and low but rapid Southern drawl, Carter, 67, reeled off facts 
about care-giving gleaned from the Rosalynn Carter Institute for Human 
Development in Americus, Ga., where she is a director: 
</P>
<P>
 * Eighty percent to 90% of people who require care in the United States are 
being cared for at home by relatives, many of whom suddenly inherited the role 
without preparation. More than just worrying, many provide nursing care, shop 
for groceries, cook, manage finances and navigate a confusing health-care 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eighty percent of caregivers are women, who are frequently exhausted and 
upset with relatives who aren't participating. When men are responsible, they 
take on a more managerial role, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 * The situation is becoming critical. With advances in medicine, more people 
are living longer, surviving serious illness and accidents, and need more care. 
At the same time, the caretaker pool is shrinking because of social changes. 
More women are working while fewer children -- caretakers of the future -- are 
being born. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this issue we're about in the same situation we were in with day care 
for children in years back," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her hopes for widespread, publicly funded respite care to relieve caregivers 
or an adult day-care system for the frail elderly, faded with the recent 
election of Republicans to most congressional seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she said, what caregivers want most is education -- about their 
loved ones' illnesses and whether or not they are doing the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing we can tell them to do is find a support group, to find some 
kind of outlet in their lives, to be with other people in the same situation," 
Carter said. "It makes so much difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Lonely and isolated, caregivers "feel they're the only ones in the world in 
that situation. They feel guilty and angry with the loved one. I want them to 
know that all of that is normal and there are resources in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of help caregivers receive depends on their willingness to ask for 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, they cannot avoid the dreaded nursing-home issue, a topic 
Carter believes is too personal for her to advise anyone. But she said she was 
a guest on a recent radio call-in show when a woman called and said that "her 
three sisters had all agreed her mother needed to be in a nursing home. One 
brother said, 'My mother does not need to go.' I told her she just had to be 
firm." 
</P>
<P>
 Easier said then done -- even for the former First Family. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Carter's widowed mother, "Miss Lillian," didn't want to go to a nursing 
home, nor did she want a nurse even after a succession of falls, Rosalynn 
Carter wrote in her book. Until a week before she died in 1983, Miss Lillian 
lived by herself in Plains, asking that the ex-President visit her every day. 
Rosalynn Carter said they went when they could. 
</P>
<P>
 Also insisting on independence, Rosalynn Carter's mother, "Miss Allie," would 
never want to live with her children, Carter said. "I think it was because she 
took care of my granddaddy until he was 95." They haven't even discussed 
Magnolia Manor. 
</P>
<P>
 As for herself, Carter said she, too, would never want to be a burden to any 
of her four children. "We're fortunate to have Mary," she said, referring to 
the family's longtime housekeeper, Mary Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just would rather go off by myself if I were in really bad shape," she 
said. Talking it over with her husband, she said she told him: "Just take me 
over to Magnolia Manor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I don't want to talk about it.' It's so typical."

'90S FAMILY; LET'S TALK ABOUT THE REFINER THINGS IN LIFE; ETIQUETTE: WITH A BIT 
OF PATIENCE, WILD LITTLE ONES CAN BE TAMED. SENSITIVITY AND RESPECT FOR OTHERS 
ARE NECESSARY -- BUT SO IS HAVING THE RIGHT ATTITUDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 First off, let's settle the olive thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Olives are not wee finger puppets to be eaten like plums a la little Jack 
Horner. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that it's OK to drop a bit of bread onto your plate and mop 
up Grandma's gravy -- as long as you use a fork. And you don't have to eat food 
you hate. Really. Not one bite. 
</P>
<P>
 You're relieved? Well, imagine how your kids will feel. Children initially 
take to etiquette and manners like horses to bits and bridles. Any license to 
skip Brussels sprouts is solace indeed. But taming children with a bit of 
manners needn't hurt -- even in time for the holidays -- if parents go slowly, 
respect children's attention spans and explain why a bunch of rules and 
regulations is important, etiquette experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Golden Rule is what manners are all about: respect for others and being 
sensitive to others and really not trying to embarrass others," says Diane 
Diehl, a graduate of the Protocol School of Washington, D.C., who teaches 
etiquette courses at the Biltmore in Downtown Los Angeles and at Nordstrom 
stores. "You want to make others feel comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 And make oneself comfortable. Children who start learning their way around the 
dinner table now won't have so far to go in the future when they sit down at 
business dinners, Diehl says. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry about confusing good manners for elitism or creating a stuffed, 
Victorian-style child, says Deborah Kane-Wood, an etiquette author and teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "Far more important than selecting the right fork is selecting the right 
attitude," says Kane-Wood, a California native who learned etiquette the hard 
way when she was sent to Queen Anne's School for Girls in England and on to 
finishing school at Surval in Montreux, Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Etiquette) has a snob appeal and elitism that just turns a lot of people 
off. A person with class is a caring human being. And a caring human being can 
be any kind of person. And also an uncaring person can be a rich lady in a 
limousine -- and very often is. We're talking about the heart," Kane-Wood says. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents should have heart, too, and not foist children into situations way 
beyond their abilities, says Terri Mandell, author of "When Good People Throw 
Bad Parties: A Guide to Party Politics for Hosts and Guests" (First House 
Press, 1994). Children can and should learn manners to suit their age, but they 
can't and shouldn't be expected to act like little adults, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people try to oppress the child too much," says Mandell, who lives in 
Los Angeles and is the mother of a 4-year-old boy. "They say, 'Just sit quietly 
on the couch and sip your glass of juice while the grown-ups talk.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Add to the formula those hot velvet dresses and little plaid bow ties and 
you've got trouble brewing. Better to leave the little prince or princess at 
home. Or, if you're the host, plan to set aside a room with toys, videos, 
finger food and a teen-age baby-sitter. The idea is not to shove children out 
of sight (well, maybe sometimes), but to give them a relaxed, welcoming 
environment, the hallmark of all entertaining, Mandell says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put them in the cute little dress, show them off for five minutes and then 
let them go be children," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But back to those dos and don'ts. Diehl rarely teaches etiquette classes for 
children under 7. When she teaches younger children, she covers only the 
"please," "thank-you" and "excuse me" basics. Introductions, phone etiquette 
and formal dining she saves for older students. 
</P>
<P>
 But at about age 6, most children can be taught to gracefully navigate a punch 
bowl, an especially handy skill this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really heartwarming to see really little hands being able to serve punch 
beautifully," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the technique: Take a cup, hold it over the bowl and gently ladle in 
the punch. Pick up a napkin and place it under the cup to catch any more 
wayward drips. Bring the cup toward yourself and sip, don't gulp. If you're 
serving, turn the handle of the cup toward the recipient, with the napkin still 
under the cup. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Make the learning fun, Diehl says. With young children, Diehl uses puppets, 
stories and role-playing to teach manners. At the Biltmore, students sit down 
for a formal two-hour luncheon. But they sometimes also have the treat of first 
working with chefs to create wonderful desserts. At the end of the meal, 
children delight in seeing their creations squired in by maitre d's. 
</P>
<P>
 Kane-Wood has fun with plastic bugs when she puts her students through a 
practice dining session. She'll slip a little critter into a salad to test the 
children for the appropriate reaction. (Discreetly remove it with your fork to 
the edge of your plate, keep quiet about the invader and carry on.) 
</P>
<P>
 What about those other icky things that show up on plates this time of year -- 
creamed onions, molded cranberries and fruit cake? The good news is you don't 
have to eat them. The bad news is, you can't scoot them off your plate once 
they're there. 
</P>
<P>
 The etiquette mavens say it's OK to use your fork and sort of noodle around 
with the offending item, just enough to make it look as if maybe you at least 
tasted it. But don't announce your distaste or go into a long medical history 
of all your allergies. 
</P>
<P>
 Kane-Wood and Diehl both say it's also important for children to learn to 
manage a formal dinner. Such a prospect can give parents the jitters. Many 
parents bumble when it comes to teaching this stuff because they tossed it onto 
the cultural scrap heap back when manners amounted to: If it feels good, do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it's time they rescued those old manners, says Kane-Wood, with not just 
a little disapproval for the attitudes that overthrew them to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 "Values, ethics, morals, manners. All of these build our character," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Manners, for now, is the bite she can chew. For parents who can't find their 
way to a library, hotel or department-store class, Kane-Wood has an 
audiocassette series. Distilled into three cassettes is everything she teaches 
in her workshops in Washington, California and to American children at the 
Westminster School in London. 
</P>
<P>
 She starts with the basics, knowing that many of her listeners will be as 
young as 5. She includes what's obvious even to us Yanks -- don't blow bubbles 
with your straw or dangle spoons off your nose. The only rude burp is a fake 
burp and the only rude, ahem, flatulence is faked flatulence. 
</P>
<P>
 It's up from there, though. She discusses finger bowls, wine stewards and 
garniture, a tony cousin of those parsley sprigs that children are so quick to 
flick away. (But, alas, shouldn't.) 
</P>
<P>
 A whimsical place mat accompanying the tapes uses a table-top family of 
animated cutlery and china to illustrate a very formal order of service rarely 
seen this side of the Atlantic, much less on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Listeners are advised to adapt the place mat to their family's need or 
traditions, but the point is made that this is another way it's sometimes done 
in the world. And the world is growing smaller, Kane-Wood says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto, Diehl says. The children spilling peas in their laps today may well be 
expected to someday perform with grace and ease at an international business 
dinner. Or properly introduce the head of a foreign corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 "International heads of state or presidents of companies could be genuinely 
offended if introduced improperly," she says. "Now here in good ol' America, we 
just let it all hang out. In a sense you have to think, that is fabulous that 
we are so easygoing. But on the other hand, you have to know that the rest of 
the world is not like us."

'90S FAMILY; YOU CAN RAISE A CONFIDENT, UNBRATTY CHILD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINA SAUERWEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not many parents want a bratty kid. Experts offer these tips on how to foster 
self-esteem without being a spoiler: 
</P>
<P>
 * Acknowledge when a child makes you angry, said clinical psychologist Robert 
Karen, author of "Becoming Attached: Unfolding the Mystery of the Infant-Mother 
Bond and Its Impact on Later Life" (Warner Books, 1994). "The truth is that a 
kid can enrage parents and make them want to throw the kid out the window. . . 
. Anger is not a bad thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Children are experts at reading -- and manipulating -- a parent's feelings, 
experts said. "They see through any disguises," Karen said. "Holding back anger 
is poisonous to the self-esteem of a child and parent." 
</P>
<P>
 * Apologize if you overreact or have an outburst. "It's OK for parents to make 
mistakes," Karen said. "A few times won't destroy a child's self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 "Heaven knows that most parents, no matter what their race or economic level, 
have wonderful intentions," added Susan Ginsberg, who teaches parenting classes 
nationwide and publishes the newsletter Work & Family Life. "Parents try like 
hell to do it right." 
</P>
<P>
 * Realize that with the enormous proliferation of parenting and self-esteem 
books, information will be contradictory, Ginsberg said. "It's best to use your 
common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 * Teach children empathy. Otherwise, Ginsberg said, they might grow up to be 
like the "young, spiffy-looking college student I watched on a train leaving 
New Haven (Conn.). He was tearing out inserts from a magazine and slinging them 
all over the train's floor. I finally said to him, 'This is not your train. 
What makes you think you can litter it?' He was so snotty and nasty about it. 
He was the quintessential spoiled kid who grew up to be an entitled brat." 
</P>
<P>
 * Resist comparing yourself to families in the '50s. "That time permeates the 
air in our culture. But it is a fantasy that produces guilt," Ginsberg said. 
"Stay-at-home parents then didn't spend all their time playing wonderful, 
educational games with their kids. They did other things, like cleaning the 
floors." 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not rely on schools to teach children self-esteem. A few years ago, 
Ginsberg worked in a preschool in Upstate New York. "One of the goals of the 
teachers was to develop students' self-esteem. Those are nice words. But none 
of the teachers called kids by their names." 
</P>
<P>
 * Rid yourself of needless guilt about being a single parent, a working parent 
or a divorced parent, said therapists Craig and Sandra Volgy Everett, authors 
of "Healthy Divorce" (Jossey-Bass, 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 Divorce, in particular, compels parents to spoil. "They're so worried about 
permanently harming the child," Craig Everett said. "It's more difficult to set 
firm limits and expectations and then follow through on them." 
</P>
<P>
 * Discipline in the early years, Sandra Everett said. "Parents make the 
mistake of allowing their 3-year-old to act like a tyrant because the child is 
cute. Well, a child is not so cute at age 10." By then, much of the child's 
personality has formed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid tiptoeing around kids' feelings, said Fred G. Gosman, a father of two 
and author of "Spoiled Rotten: Today's Children and How to Change Them" 
(Villard, 1992). "We don't have to shield a kid from every bad feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boomers put their children on pedestals. We bail them out of trouble, often 
when we shouldn't. We don't allow them to experience disappointment," he said. 
He knows parents who award trophies to kids who have lost a competition "so the 
kid won't feel worthless." And parents who give presents to all siblings, not 
just the birthday boy. This breeds "an attitude that the world will always owe 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 * Enforce family rules consistently. In most cases, Gosman said there's no 
need to negotiate. "Kids today think they have the right to filibuster."

RSVP; ONE FINAL FLING IN THE LAND OF LIBERACE

<P>
 Billing it as a "last chance" to see Liberace's Hollywood Hills estate, Gay 
and Lesbian Adolescent Social Services staged a fund-raiser at the late 
entertainer's aerie Sunday -- before its new owner erases much of its 
Liberace-ness. 
</P>
<P>
 For the occasion, the flocked-wallpaper-lined, nine-bedroom house (with enough 
chandeliers to convince you Liberace really did live here) was filled with 
music once again. Cabaret and lounge pianists tickled the ivory on rented baby 
grands in the living room, dining room, patio and even the master bedroom (gold 
wallpaper). The expected appearance of Michael Feinstein never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 The 400 or so visitors who paid $30 to $100 each to support GLASS' efforts -- 
including group homes, street outreach and placements for HIV-infected children 
and infants -- sipped champagne, ate bagels and cream cheese and roamed through 
the unfurnished, though still over-the-top house. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd definitely have to change the aqua carpeting and other things, but it 
has potential," said Sandy Edelstein, a mortgage broker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in this house several years ago," said comedy writer Bruce Vilanch. "It 
looked like Liberace's act with a view."

 There was no mistaking Liberace's longtime stage manager and producer, Ray 
Arnett. He was the glittery fellow in the rhinestone-studded tuxedo shirt, red 
bow tie and brown plaid suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Untangling a bit of Liberace lore, Arnett explained that the flamboyant 
pianist bought the house in the late '60s and lived in it for about 10 years 
until he moved to Las Vegas. There were more houses in Palm Springs and Lake 
Tahoe, but Liberace always maintained a local residence, the last one a 
penthouse above an office building he owned at Beverly Boulevard and Gardner 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But this abode had a special place in Liberace's heart. "It was really the 
first big house he had in L.A. and he saw the possibilities in it," Arnett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same possibilities that are putting Peter to bed," injected Stan Ziegler, 
president of GLASS and a friend of Peter Maurice, the new owner. What Ziegler 
meant was, Maurice has a lot of decor to dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to delete the aqua bar, the banana room, all the wallpaper except 
in the red room, and when I have the money together I'll probably demo the pool 
and make a really true lap pool," said Maurice, a 35-year-old realtor with an 
entertainment-industry clientele.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably leave the piano bar and the two cabanas with piano themes. I 
wanted a house I could renovate with some history and good bones."

 The Scene: Columbia Pictures' premiere of the Louisa May Alcott classic 
"Little Women," with its '90s dream cast headed by Winona Ryder, at the Mann 
Culver Plaza Theatres. A Concord, Mass.-style Christmas bash followed in a 
tented studio parking lot. Proceeds went to Town Hall Los Angeles and the Los 
Angeles Public Library (where one might possibly now find "Little Women," the 
novel "based on the motion picture screenplay," which guests received in their 
gift bags). 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: From the film, Ryder with her long-haired beau, Soul Asylum's 
Dave Pirner; co-stars Christian Bale, Claire Danes, Trini Alvarado, Samantha 
Mathis, Eric Stolz and Kirsten Dunst; director Gillian Armstrong; plus Jason 
Priestley, Diane Lane, Pia Zadora, James Brooks, Fran Drescher, Columbia 
Tri-Star Motion Pictures Co. Chairman Mark Canton and Wendy Finerman, and 
hordes of the usual suspects -- agents, lawyers and executives who left a 
spouse at home and brought along one of their progeny. For a momentary thrill, 
there was also a Madonna sighting, though it turned out to be a false alarm.  
</P>
<P>
 The Audience Review: Heartwarming. A three-hankie picture sure to find an 
audience. "I loved it, and I don't have anything to do with the movie," said 
one woman. As for casting, 15-year-old Diana Van de Kamp, daughter of Andrea 
and John, enthused: "Winona Ryder and Claire Danes are my idols. " 
</P>
<P>
 Self-Review: "I still think people like good stories and characters they care 
about and can be moved by," said director Armstrong. "Christian Bales said his 
father was sobbing next to him. It's a family film for people from 10 to 70." 
</P>
<P>
 Overheard: "Yeah. It was good, though not enough people died and there wasn't 
enough sex," cracked one male viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 You Should Know: The movie was dedicated to kidnap and murder victim Polly 
Klaas and Judy Scott Fox, Armstrong's agent who died during the filmmaking. 
Ryder -- who, like Polly, was raised in Petaluma and offered a $200,000 reward 
for information leading to the girl's return last year -- said of the Klaas 
dedication: "It was kind of appropriate. 'Little Women' was her favorite book. 
Her parents gave it to me." Ryder also pointed out that Polly's parents, Marc 
Klaas and Eve Nichol, were in the audience.

THEATER REVIEW; 'ARMS' FULL OF THANKS TO ALL ANGELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A standout scene in "Angel's Arms," a slight but sweet Christmas offering at 
Lamb's Players Theatre's new home here, involves a young girl who is prodded to 
play the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl consents grudgingly. Then an angel, seen by the audience, but not by 
the girl or her companions, sits beside her and plays. The delight in the 
girl's face as she plays with a virtuosity beyond her wildest dreams is 
infectious. In the spirit of "A Christmas Carol" or "It's a Wonderful Life," 
it's a tender thanks to heavenly forces that see us through when we least 
expect it. 
</P>
<P>
 The angel theme also reflects Lamb's current fortunes. The play unveils the 
company's glistening, newly refurbished 348-seat theater in Coronado's 1917 
Spreckels building -- a far handsomer facility than the 170-seat theater in an 
old National City church where the company had its start back in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, it seemed crazy to launch a $2.5-million fund-raising campaign to 
renovate the theater in the depth of a recession. But the company, which has 
refused to solicit any public funding, already is more than halfway toward that 
goal thanks to hard work, a year of extended hits and more than a few angels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paul and Ione Harter Stage, for instance, is named in recognition of a 
$300,000 gift from a Coronado couple. David McFadzean, a staff member of Lamb's 
from 1979 to 1985 and now executive producer of ABC's "Home Improvement," has 
given $350,000. Another donor, the Hotel del Coronado, gave $30,000 and is the 
site for Lamb's "An American Christmas," a Christmas feast with 
turn-of-the-century music, dances and stories. It continues through Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Angel's Arms," which continues through Dec. 30, is an original Christmas 
story by Kerry Meads, resident playwright of Lamb's, who has written all eight 
of the company's Christmas shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The plays, celebratory of the season, are traditionally more a darling of 
audiences than critics. They regularly sell out, and this one, now in its third 
outing, is no exception. There are very few seats left in this show's 
pre-Christmas performances. More are available for three of the post-Christmas 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Company member David Cochran Heath plays writer Jeffrey Scott, who has come to 
an old inn, "Angel's Arms," for inspiration to write a Christmas story. Once 
there he meets a mysterious Mrs. Boswell (Susan Hammons) who encourages him to 
tell her the story as he thinks it up. 
</P>
<P>
 As he talks, the characters literally come to life, energetic when his 
enthusiasm is high, fading when his inspiration fails. At one particularly 
witty point, a woman and a sailor try out different endings to their ill-fated 
romance to good comic effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The characterizations aren't very profound and are circumscribed by the need 
to fit in a number of beautifully sung Christmas carols and a Christmas 
message. Still, it is all done very adroitly, with some very funny lines. The 
message, while not new, is worth noting: There should always be room at the inn 
and in the heart for the stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 The performances are engaging, though Nate Peirson lacks energy as long-lost 
sailor John Shelley. Diane Addis brings dignity to Priscilla, the woman who has 
been looking for him for nearly 15 years. Jessica Cole (the girl on the piano) 
and Season Marshall give tart and funny performances as the nieces of fussy 
innkeeper Nicholas Cobham (David S. Cohen).  
</P>
<P>
 Real-life couple Paul and Vanda Eggington are amusing as upper-class twits 
slumming at the inn. Heath's writer expresses the cleverness of the creative 
process, though not the vulnerability that goes with it. Hammons brings a 
lovely voice and luminous presence to the whole. 
</P>
<P>
 While Mike Buckley's nicely detailed set does the job here, the play and a few 
of the actors seem a bit dwarfed by the larger stage and by the theater, which 
now goes seven rows back, instead of three.  
</P>
<P>
 Lamb's artistic director Robert Smyth explained that the company made this 
move because it needed to grow -- not just in the size of the audience it 
serves, but in its creative leaps and technical challenges. That's a vision 
that calls out for new works done in a fresh way. 
</P>
<P>
 It should be worth watching Lamb's face that challenge with an ambitious 1995 
season set to include: "She Loves Me," Feb. 10-March 26; "The Miracle Worker," 
April 28-June 4; "Tintypes," June 23-July 30, and "A Midsummer Night's Dream," 
Aug. 18-Sept. 24.

THEATER REVIEW; A 'MEMORY' SO VIVID IT COMES TO LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a season that overflows with Dickens, Truman Capote's "A Christmas Memory" 
is a simple, uncomplicated holiday treasure. Just being recognized as a 
Christmas classic, it hasn't yet worn the shine off the holly. 
</P>
<P>
 The production that Alternative Repertory Theatre offers as its Christmas 
card, directed by Joel T. Cotter, for the most part retains the simplicity in 
Capote's touching remembrance. It details one holiday the author spent as a 
7-year-old with his "friend," a distant cousin half a century older but close 
to his age mentally and in her ability to dream childhood's dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Her announcement each year that "oh, my, it's fruitcake weather" signals the 
bustling period during which they make a slew of cakes for "friends," among 
them the Franklin Roosevelts and a missionary in the South Seas. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a delightful journey for two actors who can relish the homespun dialogue 
and the trusting and loving relationship. Barbara Sorenson has an earthy 
sensitivity and the bubbling enthusiasm that attracts the boy and helps give 
his lonely life a shape. If her cousin is not as backward as she should be, the 
message is in the writing, and the actress and the text blend with infectious 
humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee J. Clark spends too much energy playing the child. His Buddy is too hyper, 
less in awe than he should be of his small corner of the world. But there is a 
sparkling joy in his performance that creates, if not the dreamy-minded Capote, 
a sort of Everyboy image. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotter's direction is full of movement, much more in fact than the piece 
needs, and Clark's approach may be part of that concept. It is a memory, 
though, and the text doesn't need as much visual action as Cotter has given it. 
Sorenson and Clark are at their best when they are still, the aged simpleton 
and the boy communicating in their personal and limited language. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half of the program, "Holiday Tales," is a refreshing compilation of 
Christmas bits and pieces as varied and delicious as the currants, citron and 
nuts of a plum pudding. An effervescent ensemble of Dina Bartello, Kathryn 
Byrd, Dick Harris and Jonathan Motil presents the literary snippets, both 
reverent and rash, with high style. 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Patricia L. Terry, this Christmas quilt of holiday humor and drama 
-- from Shaw and Dickens to Jack Prelutsky, from Betty Smith to Steve Martin -- 
is full of subtle contrast and high color, like the Victorian Christmas cards 
it resembles. 
</P>
<P>
 * "A Christmas Memory" and "Holiday Tales," Alternative Repertory Theatre, 
1636 S. Grand, Santa Ana. Thursday through Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sundays and Dec. 
24 at 5 p.m. Ends Dec. 24. $16. (714) 836-7929. Running time: 1 hours, 30

 Finally got around to seeing "The Lion King" the other night. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a great flick," I said to a friend the next day. "I loved how the cute 
little lion cub aced out his mean old uncle and the pack of hyenas and became 
king." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what you think it was about?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 My friend rolled his eyes. "The film was about taking responsibility," he 
said, sounding a trifle disappointed with me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole point of the movie was about taking responsibility for your 
actions. Simba thought he had done something terrible, and so he ran away from 
his problems. But by doing so, he created a much greater problem. Didn't you 
pick up on that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I may have been blinded by the colors. It was pretty great, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 "The film wasn't just about how creative Disney artists are," my friend said. 
"There was a story too. For example, do you remember early in the movie that 
Simba was told not to venture into the elephant graveyard, but that he did, 
anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure. That was scary for kids to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe so, but what was the lesson?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Obey your parents?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids know that already," my friend pointed out. "It was about being reckless 
and the consequences of false bravado. Mufasa told Simba the graveyard was 
dangerous, but he went, anyway, and risked not only himself, but Nala. It was a 
lesson about irresponsibility and putting others in jeopardy because of your 
bad judgment. Simba told his father afterward he was just trying to show he was 
brave, like him. But do you remember what Mufasa told him?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Something about being brave only when he needed to be. Didn't he tell Simba 
that being brave doesn't mean you go looking for trouble?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Right." 
</P>
<P>
 "Brilliant," I said. "By venturing into the elephant graveyard, where the 
hyenas gathered, Simba got in way over his head and was nearly eaten alive." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a genius," my friend said, with what sounded like a trace of sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the way," my friend said, "did you like the touch with the hyenas?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, they were brilliantly drawn," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You realize, of course, there was a reason they used hyenas instead of 
chipmunks? I hope if you took a child with you, you explained that it's easy in 
life to be a hyena, always running with the pack and interested in nothing but 
your own preservation. Having no conscience, worrying about nothing but your 
next meal. And, then at the first sign of trouble, turning on those who were in 
cahoots with you, even eating them, if you get the chance." 
</P>
<P>
 "I get the point," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good. Did you happen to pick up on another subplot?" my friend asked. 
"Namely, about learning from misfortune?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Uhh . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 My friend sighed. "Remember when Rafiki finally found Simba and hit him over 
the head with his scepter?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Unnecessarily violent, wasn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No, he was trying to make a point. Rafiki whacked Simba and then told him he 
couldn't take away the pain he just felt. But he told him he could avoid pain 
in the future if he learned from it. You do remember what happened the next 
time Rafiki took a swing at Simba, don't you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Simba ducked." 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly. Lesson learned." 
</P>
<P>
 By now, I was feeling a little sheepish. It's always embarrassing to have an 
allegory right in front of your eyes and not grasp it. 
</P>
<P>
 "By any chance, do you remember how the film ended?" my friend asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure. Simba had grown up to be a full-size lion and came back to regain his 
throne." 
</P>
<P>
 "Right, but what did he see when he returned?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That Scar had left the kingdom in ruins." 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly. At that moment, Simba realized that running away from your problems 
makes them worse. He understood you can't change the past, but you can build 
for the future. His kingdom cried out for leadership, and Simba assumed it 
after owning up to his mistakes. He saw that in the absence of courage and 
conviction, hyenas take over." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hmm, I wonder," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wonder what?" my friend said. "I hope I haven't ruined your enjoyment of the 
movie." 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite the contrary, " I said. "I'm just wondering if the Board of Supervisors 
have seen it." 
</P>

WEST COVINA OKS SCHOOL BREAKFAST PROGRAM; EDUCATION: RANCOROUS DEBATE PRECEDES 
3-1 VOTE BY DISTRICT BOARD. REPORTS OF CHILDREN TOO HUNGRY TO LEARN PROMPTED 
THE ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONIA NAZARIO, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Capping a weeks-long uproar over reports that some schoolchildren were coming 
to class too hungry to learn, the West Covina school board Tuesday voted for 
the first time in district history to take advantage of a longstanding 
government breakfast program. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-1 vote by the West Covina Unified School District trustees followed more 
than an hour of rancorous debate over whether the schools, in grappling with a 
growing number of hungry children in the classroom, should assume a 
responsibility many in the conservative district felt belongs to parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, board members said the program was necessary and long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are going to break the poverty cycle of these kids, we have to feed 
them," said trustee Pete Sabatino. "To learn, they have to have full tummies." 
</P>
<P>
 Although federally funded breakfasts for low-income students have long been 
available to school districts, thousands of schools nationwide have not taken 
advantage. Last month, in a series of articles in The Times on hunger that 
highlighted the situation, West Covina's Edgewood Middle School was profiled as 
an example of the 193 schools in Southern California that do not offer 
breakfast even though they have high proportions of needy children.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, many of the schools -- including eight in West Covina -- have 
joined a recent rush to apply for the program, administered by the state 
Education Department largely with federal dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Most schools that offer breakfast fully recoup their costs through government 
reimbursements, a California study showed. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Covina vote followed weeks of soul-searching and public debate for 
members of the suburban San Gabriel Valley community. At least one group took 
matters into their own hands in the wake of The Times' series, mobilizing their 
own, private breakfast effort at Edgewood Middle School.  
</P>
<P>
 Others stood firm in their philosophical opposition to such programs. Although 
the school breakfast issue had been brought up before in the district, faculty, 
administrators and one board member had contended that the board did not 
implement the program earlier because of its conservative philosophy regarding 
the role of schools.  
</P>
<P>
 Board President Mike Spence, who has contended in the past that subsidized 
school breakfasts are anti-family, reiterated his opposition Tuesday night in 
casting the lone no vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize what I'm saying isn't politically correct," Spence said. "But for 
the last 40 years, we have spent bazillions on anti-poverty and anti-hunger 
programs and it hasn't helped." 
</P>
<P>
 Spence said programs such as the private breakfast initiative were more 
appropriate for the community, and that Tuesday's vote will only create a 
dependency by the district on a program that may be slashed in the near future. 
The new Republican majority in Congress, in its "contract with America," has 
said it will terminate federal child nutrition programs and turn them over to 
the states, with sizable funding cuts.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Spence said, he recently visited a San Gabriel Valley school that 
has a government breakfast program and was "sickened" to see how much food is 
thrown away by children. He said the program is riddled with fraud because 
parents' declaration of income on the application form goes unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the majority of letters to the board and speakers Tuesday disagreed 
with Spence. One kindergarten student wrote simply, "I hope you never have to 
go hungry."  
</P>
<P>
 Edgewood parent Mercedes Gil urged the board "to nourish not only (children's) 
bodies, but allow teachers to nourish their minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Another resident, teacher Barbara Evleth, said: "We get a hefty tax bill from 
the federal government. I want my tax dollars to be spent here, on the children 
of West Covina." 
</P>
<P>
 The vote left longtime proponents of the program feeling vindicated. The 
district hopes to have subsidized breakfasts operating by Feb. 1 at eight of 
West Covina Unified's 11 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people against Big Brother," Sabatino said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's a social necessity for these underprivileged students. You can't get 
out of poverty if you can't get an education, and you can't get an education if 
you are hungry. It's basic." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Reymann, who calls himself the board's lone liberal, said he is elated. 
"Some people call it bad press. I call it an awakening to get these guys (his 
fellow board members) on to the fact that West Covina does have hungry 
children," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reymann, who teaches in El Monte's Valle Lindo School District, said he 
grappled with hungry children in his classroom before his school began a 
breakfast program several years ago. He fed them apples and oranges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not having kids hungry makes them more alert in the morning, more eager to 
learn," Reymann said. Last month, he donated his $240 monthly school board 
stipend to the private effort to feed children breakfast at Edgewood Middle 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Edgewood Principal Cathy Makin said the school -- which received 
more than 500 calls in the two weeks after publication of the story -- 
continues to receive assistance. On Tuesday night, the school received a $5,000 
donation from Kaiser Permanente for the private breakfast program, and the 
school has counted $7,500 in other large donations, including $5,000 from 
Citrus Valley Health Partners, parent company of Queen of the Valley Hospital 
in West Covina. Another $10,000 pledge has not yet been received, and the 
school has not tallied a flurry of individual donations, Makin said.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO TREAT REV. GRIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the Rev. Rosey Grier was minister of one of the town's biggest churches, 
would prosecutor William Hodgman treat him with more deference? 
</P>
<P>
 I wondered about that Friday when I watched on television as Grier, once a 
famous Rams football player, testified at the O.J. Simpson trial. Hodgman tried 
to pry from him details of a chat with the defendant that allegedly was 
overheard by one or more jailers. Just what the deputies overheard is unknown. 
But Hodgman seems to think it will help his case and the hearing will continue 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgman hammered away in true prosecutorial style. He called him "Mr. Grier," 
rather than Rev. Grier. His questioning was blunt and unrelenting. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgman asked if Grier knew Simpson before he was ordained in 1986. "I could 
have seen him in a lot of different places, I don't know where," Grier replied. 
"More than five times?" asked Hodgman. "No idea," said Grier. "Less than five 
times?" Hodgman asked. "No idea," said Grier. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people watching thought Hodgman was on the right track, that Grier was 
being evasive. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. disagreed. "This man has an absolute 
right to privacy," said Cochran. "He is here as a minister." 
</P>
<P>
 Just how much a member of the clergy must reveal is a complex issue. Judge 
Lance A. Ito allowed limited questioning of Grier, but if the jailhouse 
conversation becomes crucial to the Simpson murder trial, the issue no doubt 
will be carried to appellate courts. It might become a landmark church-state 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 But legalities aside, as I watched Grier's testimony and listened to a tape of 
it afterward, I felt I would have treated him differently had I been in 
Hodgman's place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I first became aware of Rosey Grier as a formidable person in 1968 when I was 
covering Sen. Robert F. Kennedy's campaign for President. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, I'd known he was a great football player, a member of the Rams' 
Fearsome Foursome mid-'60s defensive line. But to me he was just a player on a 
team I didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
 He was at Sen. Kennedy's side during the California primary campaign, as a 
friend of the family's, a campaigner in African American neighborhoods -- and 
as protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy spoke before huge crowds, bigger than anything seen today. He waded 
into the crowds, indifferent to danger. This was before Secret Service agents 
accompanied candidates, and Kennedy scorned security. Grier, 6 feet 5 inches, 
weighing 290 pounds, was by his side, a powerful visual and physical deterrent. 
</P>
<P>
 Not enough of a deterrent, of course, to save the senator's life. 
</P>
<P>
 The night Kennedy won the California primary, Grier was with him at the 
Ambassador. After his speech, Kennedy headed down a narrow kitchen corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Sirhan Sirhan opened fire, fatally wounding Kennedy. With the senator 
on the floor, a crowd in the corridor turned on Sirhan. Grier subdued him. As 
he testified at Sirhan's 1969 trial, "I folded his leg around my arm and put 
him on top of a table." The crowd moved in on Sirhan. Grier said he saw "one 
guy hurting his leg and some people coming at him from the front, so I swung on 
them and kicked the guy back and they seemed to realize we were trying to save 
the guy so they stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 Having covered the campaign, after seeing the senator taken from an ambulance 
into old Central Receiving Hospital, and, with many other reporters, standing 
the death watch, I felt that anyone associated with it, who had shared that 
experience, was entitled to respect. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a sentimental view not shared by all of Kennedy's old supporters, by 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 After the assassination, Grier retired from football and drifted from one 
thing to another. He was a singer and an actor. He wrote "Needlepoint for Men." 
He worked with inner-city kids but, as he told Times writer Mal Florence in 
1985, "I got so depressed working with those kids for so long I just knew why 
people killed themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, Grier became a member of the Crenshaw Christian Center and in 1986 
was ordained a minister. 
</P>
<P>
 As a minister, he runs a program for poor kids. But some of his other 
activities certainly aren't what Sen. Kennedy would have expected. 
</P>
<P>
 He endorsed conservative evangelist Pat Robertson for President and wrote a 
letter to The Times saying, "If the Rev. Pat Robertson's candidacy is such a 
terrifying church-state threat, why isn't the Rev. Jesse Jackson's?" 
</P>
<P>
 He backed Republican George Bush for President in 1992, and two years before 
that, campaigned with former President Ronald Reagan for the Republican state 
ticket. That same year, he wrote a letter to the court supporting Michael 
Milken, who was up for sentencing after pleading guilty to securities, mail, 
wire and tax fraud, conspiracy, market manipulation and maintaining false 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, a conventional view of consistency is not what guides Rosey Grier's 
political views. 
</P>
<P>
 And conventionality is not the guiding principle of his ministry. He's an 
unorthodox street minister with an unorthodox congregation, ranging from the 
delinquent young to the Christian right. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not be conventional piety, but who is to say it is not religion?

FORMER LT. GOV., CONGRESSMAN GLENN M. ANDERSON DIES AT 81; POLITICIAN: LONGTIME 
SOUTH BAY FIGURE LEAVES LEGACY OF PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Glenn M. Anderson, two-term California lieutenant governor and 12-term 
congressman who rose to the chairmanship of the powerful House Public Works and 
Transportation Committee, died Tuesday. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who chose not to run for reelection in 1991, died at San Pedro 
Peninsula Hospital Pavilion from complications of Alzheimer's disease, his 
stepson Evan Anderson Braude said. Anderson had undergone multiple heart bypass 
surgery in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Harbor ship channel and Interstate 105 bear Anderson's name, a 
testament to his prowess at winning public works projects for his 32nd 
Congressional District in the South Bay-Long Beach area. He was also 
instrumental in winning federal funds for Los Angeles' neophyte Metro Rail 
subway system. 
</P>
<P>
 But Anderson is probably best remembered in state political annals because of 
his delay in sending in the National Guard when the Watts riots broke out in 
August, 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was acting governor at the time because Gov. Edmund G. (Pat) Brown 
was in Greece on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-hour delay between the city of Los Angeles' appeal for the troops and 
the time they went into action led to an uproar against Anderson. He was 
accused of procrastination and labeled as the man "who fiddled while Watts 
burned." 
</P>
<P>
 Campaigning on Anderson's failure to staunch the rioting immediately, 
Republican Robert Finch swept into office in 1966, denying Anderson a third 
term as lieutenant governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Nixon, tutoring Finch's campaigners, said flatly: "I want everyone in 
California to believe that Glenn Anderson was responsible for Watts." 
</P>
<P>
 The McCone Commission, which investigated the riots, singled out Anderson by 
name for "hesitating when he should have acted." 
</P>
<P>
 However, some political observers believed that Brown's staff used Anderson as 
a scapegoat for their own indecisive behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, a World War II infantry sergeant, claimed that his Guard order was 
"the fastest call-up of the Guard in any state." 
</P>
<P>
 "My actions must be judged in context with the total situation, not only here 
but in the nation at the time," he said in response to the McCone criticism in 
1966. "The months immediately preceding the riots had seen . . . many 
disturbances between Negro citizens and state troopers. Like most Americans, I 
was shocked by the use of excessive force in some of these situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was therefore determined that a clear and responsible chain of command must 
exist and that any actions taken should be consistent with the American 
tradition of law and order." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was surprised by the Watts eruption because he had operated under the 
mind set that state legislative efforts to achieve equal rights would protect 
California from the riots occurring in other states. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe the transition to the full realization of equal rights (in 
California)," he said two years before the Watts riots, "will be free of much 
of the violence which characterizes the civil rights struggle in other parts of 
this country today." 
</P>
<P>
 A Hawthorne builder, Anderson remained popular in his area despite the 
criticism, and was elected to Congress in 1968, just two years after the 
Republican sweep of state offices. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the coveted chairmanship of the House Public Works and Transportation 
Committee in 1988, only to be stripped of the position 33 months later. He 
announced his intention not to seek reelection to Congress shortly after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson disparaged criticism that either he or his committee specialized in 
pork barrel projects to members' districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been building all my life," he said in 1988. "Public works pay for 
themselves. It's paying people to work on a project that makes the economy 
better, makes the region better, makes everything better." 
</P>
<P>
 His House colleagues claimed that Anderson's abilities slipped dramatically in 
the late 1980s because of his advancing age. State Democratic leaders went so 
far as to suggest reapportionment in 1991 that would carve up Anderson's harbor 
area district. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the district remained virtually unscathed, but Anderson chose to 
step down anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make the decision to leave public life," he said in late 1991, "so as to 
give the next generation of leaders the opportunity to pursue a career in the 
federal public policy arena." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's explanation for why his fellow Democrats ousted him from the 
committee chairmanship was that he was overly generous with the power of the 
position. He believed that his decision to share power with his five 
subcommittee chairmen fostered a false perception of weakness. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his soft-spoken, nonaggressive style, Anderson succeeded in politics 
over a long career that began with his election as mayor of Hawthorne in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his more than two decades in Congress, he continued to deliver 
federal public works projects to Southern California. Interstate 105, popularly 
called the Century Freeway because of its proximity to Century Boulevard, was 
named the Glenn Anderson Freeway Transitway in 1987 in gratitude to Anderson 
for securing federal funds. The 17.3-mile freeway, at $2.2 billion, is the most 
expensive freeway ever built. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Anderson's survivors is his wife, Lee, who served as his campaign 
leader.

A HOLIDAY FOR ALL; EDUCATION: L.A. PUBLIC SCHOOLS STRIVE TO FOLLOW FEDERAL LAW 
BY MAKING CHRISTMAS A CULTURAL LESSON INSTEAD OF A RELIGIOUS CELEBRATION. IT'S 
A NARROW PATH WITH MANY POSSIBLE PITFALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re-enactments of Christ's birth in the manger are out, but renditions of 
"Silent Night" -- which tells the tale of that event -- are OK, especially if 
sung in another language or buried amid more secular music. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are this year's practical interpretations of Los Angeles public school 
policy, which seeks to echo federal law by making Christmas a cultural lesson 
instead of a religious observation. 
</P>
<P>
 School productions formerly called Christmas pageants are now "winter 
programs" and "holiday celebrations." Music selections lean heavily on the 
marginally secular: "Jingle Bell Rock," "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" and 
"White Christmas" -- with a token Hanukkah song thrown in for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Broad Avenue Elementary School winter program in Wilmington last week, 
first-graders decked in handmade reindeer antlers gyrated to an upbeat 
"Reindeer Twist" and second-graders donned grass skirts and leis to sing a 
Hawaiian Christmas song. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally speaking, we do Christmas around the world. . . . It doesn't 
include everybody every year, but within three years we do most of the 
countries," said Broad Avenue Principal Lydia Shors, who characterized the 
school as about 85% Latino, with significant populations of Eastern Europeans, 
Samoans, Asians and African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Occasionally we'll have someone who felt left out or felt that too much was 
spent on one particular ethnicity," Shors said. "But any comment like that is 
very rare." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging the need to reflect a wider diversity, school music 
teacher Connie-Lu Berg remained a little wistful about the old days, when 
manger scenes and Christian carols were commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sort of bothers me because some of the best songs are religious," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some religious organizations go even further, saying the trend away from 
Christmas pageants deprives children -- Christian or not -- of a memorable 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're allowing our children to grow up without the beauty, the warmth -- 
Christmas is such a beautiful thing," said Sara DiVito Hardman, state director 
of the Christian Coalition, the political arm of broadcaster Pat Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified has based its holiday celebration rules on a 1980 federal 
court case involving the Sioux Falls, S.D., school district, which established 
guidelines for marking religious holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, found that holidays with 
both religious and secular foundations could be observed in schools if taught 
in terms of their history and origins. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have worked hardest to make schools aware of the exclusivity of 
Christmas pageants say Los Angeles Unified has applied the ruling better than 
many districts, but needs to be vigilant to ensure teachers do not substitute 
celebration of multiple religions for no religious observations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just adding a Muslim song and a Jewish song doesn't do it -- that just makes 
it more religious," said Heather Rothman, a director with the Jewish Community 
Relations Committee in Los Angeles. "The idea is not to be inclusive, it's to 
be secular." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet teachers and administrators say they find the Christmas season an ideal 
time to teach about religion and cultural heritage, a lesson they believe helps 
students respect each others' differences. 
</P>
<P>
 At the children's day-care center affiliated with Vanalden Avenue School in 
Reseda, a holiday crafts workshop for parents and children includes projects 
reflecting Hanukkah and Kwanzaa, a seven-day celebration observed by some 
African Americans, as well as Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bellagio Newcomer School in Brentwood, where students newly arrived from 
other countries spend their first year, nearly every major holiday around the 
world is celebrated near its actual day. In mid-December, Christmas becomes a 
lesson in American tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Cheri Katz said that even though most of Bellagio's students do 
celebrate some form of Christmas at home, Santa Claus is a new phenomenon for 
many. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bring in a model of a chimney to explain it," Katz said. "When I started 
telling them about Santa Claus going down the chimney, I had some . . . kids 
looking at me like I was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, one of Bellagio's classes will sing Silent Night, in Korean, and 
nearly 100 fourth- and fifth-graders will sing a song about lighting candles at 
Hanukkah. 
</P>
<P>
 The history behind the Jewish festival of lights, which commemorates the Jews' 
reclaiming of a temple from the Greeks, seemed to have been lost on 10-year-old 
Joshua Muhammab of Indonesia. He responded to the question, 'What is Hanukkah?' 
by holding up one of nine flashlights topped with red cellophane. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's this, this ," he said, turning the light off and on by pounding it into 
his palm. "It's candlelight." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, complaints about overly religious celebrations in schools have 
steadily declined in the past 10 years, said Marc Stern, a lawyer with the 
American Jewish Congress in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Most church-state separation advocates agree that they rarely receive reports 
now of overt faux pas -- like the call Stern received from a Midwest woman who 
was distraught that her son had been cast as Jesus in the Christmas play 
because he was the only Jew in his school. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles Jewish activists worry that a drop in reports may simply be 
evidence of middle-class flight from the inner city and from public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still get complaints from non-immigrant schools, because they know one can 
and should complain," said Carol Plotkin, director of the Jewish Congress' 
Pacific Southwest region. "Immigrants are not going to want to rock the boat 
that much. . . . We don't have the built-in watchdog in Los Angeles anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically these days, the few complaints about programs with too much 
religious music arise in smaller, suburban school districts, Plotkin said, and 
usually are solved by sending a letter requesting a copy of the district's 
holiday policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggest the simplest solution would be to forgo a December program 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite appropriate for schools to do nothing, to leave religious 
observances at home with the family," said Albert J. Menendez, author of The 
December Wars: Religious Symbols and Ceremonies in the Public Square. 
</P>
<P>
 But teachers and principals in Los Angeles Unified say that would hurt the 
poorest students the most, because the school's winter program may be their 
only celebration of whatever holiday they observe this time of year.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; BEQUEST BY 
WIFE OF ARMAND HAMMER VOIDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oilman Armand Hammer's wife was coerced into leaving her niece hundreds of 
millions of dollars in communal property in a rewritten will, a judge has 
ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Henry W. Shatford ruled that the bequest to Joan Weiss 
"was the product of threats, pressure and coercion and would not be enforced by 
the court," said Daniel Petrocelli, a lawyer for Hammer's estate and the Armand 
Hammer Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The order, announced Tuesday, was signed Dec. 6. The court said the property, 
including an extensive art collection, belongs to Hammer's estate and his 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Using Weiss' lawyer, the 86-year-old Frances Hammer changed her will in 1988 
to make her niece the beneficiary instead of Hammer. Frances Hammer died in 
1989 and her husband died a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling does not affect $15 million that Weiss and her husband received 
from Frances Hammer's personal estate, Petrocelli said. Weiss lost a lawsuit in 
1990 seeking half of the estimated $400 million in joint property that Hammer, 
the former chairman of Occidental Petroleum Corp., had amassed during his 
33-year marriage. In August, Shatford decided in favor of Hammer's estate, his 
trust and the Armand Hammer Foundation. Those entities then countersued Weiss.

SUPERVISORS TO STUDY PLAN TO TAKE OVER 8 STATE BEACHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest attempt to resolve a long-running battle over maintenance of 
local beaches, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to 
consider a proposal to take ownership from the state of eight beaches, 
including Malibu, Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The county began consolidating the operation of maintenance crews and 
lifeguard patrols at state and city beaches in the 1970s to bring uniformity to 
what had been a patchwork of services. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there has been an impasse over beach funding for years, with the 
cash-strapped county insisting that the beach cities and the state increase 
their share of maintenance costs. Service costs at all of the state beaches -- 
including Topanga, Dan Blocker, Point Dume, Las Tunas and Royal Palms -- amount 
to $4.3 million annually, with the state contributing virtually nothing for 
upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials and those who represent beach cities argue that beaches are 
used and enjoyed by county residents and are a regional responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 While the county has continued to negotiate the issue, it also has threatened 
to pull its lifeguards and maintenance crews from some of the most popular 
beaches on the West Coast in an effort to get the state and beach cities to 
ante up more money. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the board agreed to extend a service arrangement with the state 
beyond its Dec. 31 deadline through March while considering the cost of owning 
the beaches it already maintains. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of possible drawbacks to such a plan. Officials concede 
that initially it probably will cost the county more money. Continuing beach 
services until April 1, for example, will strip county coffers of about 
$500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 By taking ownership of the beaches, the county also could lose money that has 
been provided by the state in past years for capital improvements.

<P>
 Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky questioned whether liability costs the county might 
assume as owners would outweigh the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Deane Dana, whose 4th District covers much of the South Bay's 
coastline, argued that ownership of local beaches would give the county greater 
flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is negotiating with the cities of Los Angeles, Santa Monica, 
Torrance, Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach and Avalon about increasing their 
contributions for maintenance of the beaches. Service agreements with the 
cities are scheduled to expire on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 22 beaches operated by the county generate enough revenue -- 
mostly through parking fees, food stands, marketing deals and film permits -- 
to offset maintenance costs. But nearly half of the total is derived from only 
three beaches: Santa Monica, Will Rogers and Venice. CARLA RIVERA

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WINNER CHOSEN IN DESIGN 
CONTEST FOR VERMONT CORRIDOR PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even before Pepperdine University left 81st Street and Vermont Avenue for 
Malibu, its old Los Angeles neighborhood had been in decline.  
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, more than 20 years later, a winner was chosen in a politically 
controversial design contest that backers hope will revive the former 
Pepperdine property and spur other improvements along the troubled Vermont 
corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning proposal in the competition sponsored by First Interstate Bank 
would restore the 1931 Art Deco tower that housed Pepperdine's administration, 
add adjacent storefronts in a similar architectural style on a vacant Vermont 
lot and build 35 townhouses along rear courtyards. And, in a highly symbolic 
return of higher education to the site, USC has promised to locate an advisory 
service for small businesses there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are now embarking on a journey to once again make this site a flagship for 
this corridor," declared Los Angeles Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who 
represents the area. His comments came during a ceremony Tuesday afternoon in 
the turquoise Pepperdine building, which has been empty since the college moved 
in 1972. Ridley-Thomas was on the contest jury that selected the entry by San 
Francisco architect Daniel Solomon and the Caleb Development Corp., a 
South-Central firm, over two other finalists from an earlier pool of 66 
entries. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection came after much debate, highlighted by a squabble between 
Ridley-Thomas and U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who lives a few 
blocks away in the more upscale Vermont Knolls area. Waters and Vermont Knolls 
homeowners opposed the bank's original plan for 130 units of rental housing and 
demanded a solely commercial development that the congresswoman envisions as 
part of a central city version of Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the housing component was sharply reduced and switched to 
market-rate townhouses. But Waters and some neighbors remain upset and will 
continue to push a counterproposal of stores built in the style of an African 
village and fronted by a small park. LARRY GORDON

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; FIGHTING CRIME THE 
EXPLORER SCOUT WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the holidays, about 100 law enforcement Explorer Scouts fan out to 
shopping malls across the San Fernando Valley to help protect life, property 
and the peace and tranquillity of thousands of shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping fight crime during the holidays is a big part -- but not the only part 
-- played by the Police Explorers, teen-agers who often aspire to careers in 
police work. They are affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America, which added 
the law enforcement specialty to its Explorer program for older Scouts in 1962. 
But their uniformed presence at many special events links them in many people's 
minds with the Los Angeles Police Department, with which they work. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most importantly, however, the cadets, who are between 14 and 20 years 
of age, are the "eyes and ears" of the Police Department inside and outside the 
malls, because they patrol the parking lots too. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the duties they are asked to perform, they are still in touch with 
their Boy Scout roots, sometimes helping pedestrians through the maze of cars 
at the malls. 
</P>
<P>
 During his four years as a law enforcement Explorer Scout, Patrick Gilbert, an 
18-year-old senior at Birmingham High School, says he has grown to enjoy the 
challenges of the job and his role as a leader. Gilbert holds the rank of 
captain in the Explorers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have two uncles who are LAPD officers and they influenced me to look into 
law enforcement as a career," Gilbert said. "When I first came in the program, 
I didn't think I'd ever want to be a sergeant. Now I like the leadership role, 
and I'm comfortable with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert said he has grown accustomed to the jabs he takes from other high 
school kids who recognize him on duty and say things like "Hey, are you a 
narc?" 
</P>
<P>
 Neither narc nor nerd, Gilbert said, just a guy who wants to go to college, 
get into the Police Academy and join the department. 
</P>
<P>
 He gets the impression that regular officers appreciate the Scouts' work, 
Gilbert said. "They think it's cool that there are kids with their heads 
straight (who) want to do good things."  
</P>
<P>
 Law Enforcement Explorer Scout candidates must complete 136 hours of training 
at the Police Academy and they also participate in leadership conferences and 
are offered the chance to spend a week in police training at Camp Pendleton 
each summer, said Sgt. Walt Kainz, one of three Explorer program coordinators 
at the West Valley station. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the department's rules, Explorers are not supposed to confront suspected 
criminals, but instead summon patrol officers by radio for assistance. 
"Whenever they're out there, there is never a black-and-white too far away," 
according to Officer Nina Serna, who runs the Explorer program at the 
Devonshire division. 
</P>
<P>
 But as is common in police work, sometimes there just isn't time to do 
anything but react. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year at Northridge Fashion Center, explorers successfully arrested and 
detained a man armed with a pistol who had come to the mall and become involved 
in a quarrel with his girlfriend, an employee of one of the stores, Serna said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the month the Explorers were stationed at the Northridge mall, no 
crimes were reported there except for one purse snatching, Serna said. When the 
Explorers are not on the job there are about 12 vehicles stolen each month from 
the mall, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the professionalism and the uniforms the kids wear makes a 
difference, and the public just loves it," Serna said. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for the free holiday guard work, the malls make donations to the 
Explorer posts to fund summer trips for their members. 
</P>
<P>
 Explorer patrols attached to the West Valley division, for instance, get the 
proceeds from the fountain at the Topanga Plaza where shoppers throw coins for 
good luck, Kainz said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Explorer Posts have used the money to take trips to Washington, 
D.C., and Florida, where explorers from the Devonshire division toured the 
state's amusement parks last summer, Serna said. This year, the group hopes to 
go to to the nation's capital.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: POMONA; MAN CONVICTED 
OF KILLING EX-WIFE AND HER PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former U.S. Army Reserve recruiter was found guilty Tuesday of killing his 
ex-wife and her parents and shooting at a Covina recruiting station a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty phase in the trial of Richard Fontes will begin Thursday, after 
which jurors will recommend the death penalty or life without the possibility 
of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pomona Superior Court jury found Fontes, 27, of Fontana, guilty of the Oct. 
5, 1993, slayings of his former wife, Suzanne Fontes, 28, and her parents, 
retired El Monte Police Officer Charles R. Kelly, 66 and his wife, Rachel, 63. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were slain in the Kelly's Covina home. Authorities said that 
afterward, Fontes drove to the Covina recruiting station, fired four shots into 
the door and drove away. He later returned to the station, where he called 
police and handed over a handgun and shotgun when they arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Fontes' defense attorney had argued that the ex-Walnut High School football 
star was under excessive pressure in his job and faced mounting domestic 
problems, which caused him to lose control.

 In their statements, five jurors said they had talked about possible sentences 
in the parking lot, hallways and the cafeteria of the Criminal Courts Building

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: TORRANCE; OREGON MAN 
CONVICTED IN HOME-INVASION SLAYING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oregon man was convicted Tuesday of seven charges, including murder with 
special circumstances, for the May, 1993, home-invasion slaying of a Torrance 
man and the assault and shooting of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 After a trial during which his attorney called no witnesses, Randy Eugene 
Garcia, 24, of Portland, was convicted of killing Joseph Finzel and wounding 
Lynn Finzel.Deputy Dist. Atty. Sally Thomas said she would seek the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia was wearing the dead man's wedding ring when he was arrested. Lynn 
Finzel identified him as the killer, and several of Garcia's friends told 
police he had confessed to the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 On the last day of the trial, Lynn Finzel testified that Garcia entered her 
180th Place home on May 8, 1993. Garcia woke her up, and with her baby lying 
nearby, assaulted her, she said. When her husband, Joseph, arrived home, Garcia 
shot and killed him, then shot her twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynn Finzel spent the next two hours playing dead as Garcia ransacked the 
house.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; SEX OFFENDER 
SCHEDULED FOR PAROLE ON SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A convicted sex offender who committed most of his crimes in Pasadena is 
scheduled to be released on parole into Los Angeles County if he passes a 
psychiatric exam, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carnot Andre Lyles, 38, convicted of committing a sex act with a 9-year-old 
girl and other felonies in 1990 and raping and sodomizing a Pasadena woman in 
1978, is likely to pass the exam and would be released into south Los Angeles 
County on Sunday, Regional Parole Administrator Jerry DiMaggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyles, who has family in Pasadena, requested that he be paroled to that city 
so he could take care of his sick father, DiMaggio said. But Pasadena police, 
who were informed of Lyles' parole on Nov. 8, contacted six of Lyles' victims 
and had them sign the appropriate paperwork to keep the felon out of the city. 
Under state law an inmate on parole cannot be released within 35 miles of a 
victim or witness to a violent felony if they protest. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyles also has attempted murder, armed robbery and burglary convictions. In 
1976, he pleaded guilty to the rape of a 65-year-old Pasadena woman. Lyles 
appealed and the case was overturned because evidence had been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyles is being held at the R. J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, 
DiMaggio said.

DRUG DEALING ARRESTS SOAR AT SCHOOLS; CRIME: UNDERCOVER OFFICERS POSING AS 
STUDENTS HAVE APPREHENDED 201 THIS SEMESTER -- THE MOST SINCE 1988. POLICE CITE 
A RESURGENCE IN TEEN-AGE DRUG USE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reflecting a resurgence of drug use among teen-agers, undercover police 
officers posing as students at 10 Los Angeles high schools have arrested the 
largest number of suspected drug dealers in any semester since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The undercover "School Buy Program" resulted in the arrests of 201 people -- 
157 of them students -- accused of selling marijuana, crack and powder cocaine, 
LSD and peyote, according to Los Angeles Police Department officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of arrests was 47% higher than last fall, when 137 people were 
arrested in connection with campus drug sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's skyrocketed," said Lt. Bud Harper, who oversees the LAPD's Juvenile 
Narcotics section. "It's a phenomenon going on that a lot of people aren't 
aware of. It's just gone up so much in such a short amount of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the increase in arrests this semester mirrors a dramatic jump in 
the number of teen-agers caught with drugs citywide. From January to June, Los 
Angeles police arrested 1,579 juveniles -- a 37% increase over the 1,150 
arrests last year -- for possession or sale of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the department's annual School Buy campaign, young-looking officers posed 
as students since the first day of the fall semester on 10 campuses: Venice, 
where 27 students were arrested; Locke, where 20 were arrested; Cleveland, 
where 19 were arrested; Verdugo Hills, where 19 were arrested; Van Nuys, where 
15 were arrested; Canoga Park, where 13 were arrested; Narbonne, where nine 
were arrested; University, where six were arrested; North Hollywood, where four 
were arrested, and Pacific Palisades, where four were arrested. Other arrests 
were made off campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the arrested students will face drug sale charges and will probably be 
transferred to one of the district's alternative high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, a student was arrested on the Verdugo Hills campus after selling 
a handgun to an officer for $60. "We don't solicit guns, but the student 
brought it from home," Harper said. "The officer seized the opportunity to get 
the gun off campus." 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the undercover officers recovered nine guns and nearly $10,000 in 
cash. The officers also seized about $109,392 worth of drugs, including more 
than 30 pounds of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures reflect a continuing trend in the Los Angeles district, according 
to Wes Mitchell, chief of the Los Angeles Unified School District police. 
School police made 46% more arrests for drugs from July to September this year 
than they did during the same period last year, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old strategies that we used to reduce it or diminish it are not working 
with this group of kids," Mitchell said. "I think we're seeing a turn in the 
times. . . . It's back to drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 That same phenomenon is occurring on a national level. For the third straight 
year, marijuana use has risen among eighth-graders nationwide, and nearly half 
of all high school seniors say they have tried illicit drugs, according to a 
survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police said students are also selling larger quantities of drugs 
-- pounds rather than ounces of marijuana, for example -- than in the past, and 
that younger students are being recruited to handle the drug transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug dealers range from suspected gang members to students just dabbling 
in drugs to make some extra money, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 157 students arrested, about 25 will participate in the Police 
Department's drug diversion counseling program for first-time offenders in lieu 
of facing charges. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators confirm an increase in drugs on and around their 
campuses.

COMMON GROUND; HUMAN RIGHTS: FOREIGN ACTIVISTS TOUR SOUTHLAND, FINDING 
SIMILARITIES TO PROBLEMS IN THEIR COUNTRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Police brutality. Scapegoating of unpopular groups. Deprivation of civil 
liberties. 
</P>
<P>
 All are concerns distressingly familiar to Peter Volmink, a longtime South 
African activist, and fellow human rights crusaders worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, however, Volmink and civil rights monitors from Brazil, Zaire, 
Haiti, Bulgaria and Pakistan have been receiving a singular civics lesson, 
learning about similar vexing dilemmas right here in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation in South Africa and here is obviously not exactly the same, but 
there are parallels," said Volmink, who is known for his work in the "Street 
Law" program, which educates youth about their rights. 
</P>
<P>
 He and eight other monitors were honored Tuesday evening at the third annual 
Los Angeles dinner benefiting Human Rights Watch, the U.S.-based watchdog 
group. Barred from leaving their countries and honored in absentia were Moncef 
Marzouqi, who heads Tunisia's only independent human rights organization, and 
Bao Tong, currently imprisoned in China. Deborah LaBelle, a Michigan lawyer who 
defends prisoners, was also among the honorees.  
</P>
<P>
 Donors paid $250 a plate for the dinner at a Beverly Hills hotel. But the 
activists have spent time recently exploring humbler settings. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. laws usually offer greater protections than in the monitors' nations -- 
and there is clearly no U.S. equivalent to excesses such as the Mobutu Sese 
Seko dictatorship in Zaire or the unpunished murders of peasants in Brazil's 
Amazon region. Nor do U.S. activists generally face the life-threatening 
situations that are often the norm in many other countries. But the monitors 
found similarities during a wide-ranging tour that included stops in Watts, 
East Los Angeles and Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The similarities are real," said Jean-Claude Jean, who works for democratic 
reform in Haiti and noted disparities of wealth and poverty in both countries. 
</P>
<P>
 During a visit to Los Angeles' Japanese American National Museum, the monitors 
heard of the World War II-era internment of more than 120,000 people of 
Japanese ancestry. Inevitably, conversation turned toward Proposition 187, the 
successful ballot initiative that targets illegal immigrants. Proponents argued 
that the measure was needed to stem unlawful immigration, but Chris M. Komai of 
the museum staff had a different view. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of California, in my personal opinion, were looking for scapegoats 
for the bad economy," Komai said. 
</P>
<P>
 That theme was familiar to Dimitrina Petrova, a Bulgarian native who monitors 
rights issues in Eastern Europe. She cited the Gypsies, long a targeted 
minority, who have experienced renewed discrimination in post-Communist Eastern 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening to the Gypsies in my country is the same type of thing that 
is going on with immigrants here," said Petrova, who was a dissident under her 
country's former Communist regime. "Everyone wants to blame their problems on 
someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Mudumbi pointed out that civil war in Rwanda earlier this year sent 
about 1 million refugees fleeing into neighboring Zaire within a matter of 
weeks -- almost as many refugees as the United States admitted legally during 
the past 10 years. The influx far outstripped Zaire's limited infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need international aid for this problem," Mudumbi said. "It is too much 
for Zaire alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Police abuse was a main topic when the monitors visited the American Civil 
Liberties Union of Southern California. The ACLU, said the local branch's 
executive director, Ramona Ripston, was disparaged as the "criminals' lobby" by 
former U.S. Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese, reflecting a lack of popularity often 
shared by rights groups worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In her homeland, Petrova noted, there is a saying: "Bulgaria doesn't need 
foreign enemies as long as it has its human rights monitors." 
</P>
<P>
 I.A. Rehman, a former journalist who directs the Human Rights Commission of 
Pakistan, raised a different dilemma: "What about the rights of the family 
members of those convicted by the state?" These families, while blameless, 
often suffer economic ruin and social rejection, Rehman noted. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the monitors learned about gang violence and its effects from 
mothers at Dolores Mission Roman Catholic Church in Boyle Heights. Marta Sosa, 
whose 18-year-old son was killed in a gang-related incident last year, related 
how she now endeavors to promote peace among all area youths -- including 
members of the gang responsible for her son's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside a church day-care center, Father Ricardo Rezende, who works with 
peasants in the Brazilian Amazon region, was showing some black and white 
photographs of victims of violence in his parish to area residents. Delia 
Lopez, a 55-year-old mother, pointed to an image of a teen who had been shot in 
the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shot me too," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stray bullets intended for a gang member flew into her apartment one night in 
1991, one piercing her chest and lung. While the young perpetrators were very 
distinct from the pistoleiros of Brazil, Rezende said the shattering effects of 
their actions were much the same.

CHIEF TUNNEL ENGINEER ON SUBWAY ERRED IN REPORT, BOSS SAYS; METRO RAIL: 
SUPERVISOR CALLS THE INCIDENT AN INADVERTENT LAPSE. DESCRIPTION OF PROFESSIONAL 
STANDING IN STATE WAS MISSTATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The chief tunnel engineer for the Los Angeles subway project erred by 
identifying himself as a "professional engineer" in a report assessing 
excavation problems in Hollywood, according to his boss. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Rubin, board chairman of the Metro Rail engineering firm of Parsons 
Brinckerhoff, said he has conceded the error to officials of a state regulatory 
board that is investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a mistake," Rubin said in an interview, referring to the signing of 
an Aug. 30 report by the engineer, Timothy P. Smirnoff. Rubin described the 
incident as an inadvertent lapse on the part of Smirnoff, who he said has begun 
the process of applying for a California license. 
</P>
<P>
 California law prohibits use of the "professional engineer" designation by 
anyone not holding a state license to practice civil engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority requested a month ago that Rubin and 
a representative of another engineering service firm seek rulings from the 
California Board of Registration for Professional Engineers and Land Surveyors 
on whether the firms' engineers are required to hold California licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA's request was in response to a Times article Oct. 26 reporting that 
neither Smirnoff nor another engineer who approved the substitution of wood 
wedges for metal struts as bracing for the tunnels in Hollywood held a 
California engineering license. Engineering studies have found that the failure 
of the wedges contributed to surface sinkages of up to 10 inches along 
Hollywood Boulevard. An independent analysis prepared for the MTA concluded 
that substitution of the wedges for the stronger, metal struts was 
"inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times article also reported that Smirnoff had identified himself as a 
"professional engineer" and that eight of 10 "resident engineers" assigned to 
oversee construction of tunnels and stations do not hold state licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some MTA board members are now questioning why so many of the engineers are 
unlicensed, when the agency has paid nearly $600 million for engineering 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe for a project of this type and size, the MTA should insist on 
registration, regardless of what the state board says," said MTA board member 
Nick Patsaouras. "We are paying top fees, so I'm sure we can find qualified 
people who are also registered." 
</P>
<P>
 An executive of the state board said Tuesday that his staff will try to 
determine by the end of January whether certain engineering responsibilities 
assigned by the MTA to Rubin's firm and to the other engineering firm, 
Parsons-Dillingham, require California licensing. The "resident engineers" are 
employed by Parsons-Dillingham. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern we have," said Harold L. Turner, executive officer of the state 
board, "is whether engineering is being practiced without a license or without 
being" under the direct supervision of a properly registered engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work of engineering a tunnel would obviously fall under the definition of 
civil engineering and would require registration," Turner said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it will take until later next year for his staff to determine whether 
the "actual work performed," including the approval of the wood wedges by 
Smirnoff and the other engineer, Stephen J. Navin of Parsons-Dillingham, 
amounted to the unlicensed practice of engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of Parsons-Dillingham have said Navin and the firm's other 
resident engineers defer to Smirnoff's group and have not practiced what the 
law defines as civil engineering. Speaking on behalf of Smirnoff's group, Rubin 
said: "We have never done engineering without a license."

JAMES FLANIGAN / ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; 
CALIFORNIA'S FAULTY TAX SYSTEM LIES AT THE ROOT OF THE MESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that the loss in Orange County's investment fund has been estimated at 
$2.02 billion, or 27% of its original $7.4-billion principal, city managers and 
superintendents of school districts that lost money can begin looking for ways 
to make up the shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 But they don't have far to look. For most, fund losses that may logically clip 
27% from each city or district's investment will mean yet more tightening of 
the belt and making do. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the fourth year of downsizing for local government in California, a 
state where predatory public finance has become routine and a screwed-up tax 
system qualifies as a root cause of the Orange County disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, voters in national elections who favor downsizing government -- or 
"reinventing government," as the nobler phrase has it -- should look at 
California to see what distortions can result from abrupt, unthinking tax 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gullibility can result. One reason city managers were so unquestioning of the 
exaggerated returns in Treasurer Robert L. Citron's Orange County investment 
fund is that they needed the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Local community governments in Orange County and throughout California have 
been surrendering revenues to Sacramento for years as the state has tried to 
balance its own budget, so far unsuccessfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Most local property taxes no longer are available to finance police and fire 
departments because a ballot initiative four years ago directed their use 
increasingly for schools and because the state has taken them away to alleviate 
its own budget problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "People continue to expect first-class police and fire services because they 
pay their property taxes," says one city manager. "They don't realize the 
property tax no longer pays even police salaries." 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of cigarette taxes and various fees that used to finance local 
communities have been transferred to the state budget. The state has 
transferred responsibilities to local communities but only a share of the sales 
taxes with which to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 And sales taxes themselves, as they have become popular with government at all 
levels in the 16 years since Proposition 13 limited the growth of property 
taxes, have made public services in California more vulnerable to recession. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason the state's credit rating fell during the recession from 
AAA, the highest, to A, a rank that adds $30 million a year to interest 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, what is happening to local government is only the cutting edge of a 
fiscal decline in California. A state that once boasted greater-than-average 
public revenues and expenditures long ago fell below the national average on 
investment in roads, education and public services, according to a report of 
the California Business-Higher Education Forum, a panel of industry and 
university leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 California has become a model of the anti-government state, favoring less 
public investment and strict limits on the power of elected officials and civil 
servants, explains John Elwood of UC Berkeley's School of Public Policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether this has "helped or hurt California," Elwood says, depends on your 
political philosophy. As California has fallen below other states in public 
investment, "individual Californians have been able to retain a greater 
percentage of their personal income than they did before." 
</P>
<P>
 But before Californians decide that this trend is just dandy, they should keep 
two things in mind. One is that the current trend to deny funds for public 
service is a repudiation of a tradition dating to Gov. Hiram Johnson and the 
1911 Reform movement that launched California on the road to greatness. 
</P>
<P>
 And the second is that whatever your political philosophy, the current tax 
system -- which has resulted from more than a decade of ballot initiatives and 
competition for funds among various levels of government -- is an inefficient, 
often counterproductive mess. 
</P>
<P>
 You only have to listen to local government officials in Orange County to 
realize that. 
</P>
<P>
 Most see three to four years of cutbacks and compromises to rebuild financial 
reserves lost in the county fund. All have cut back city employment in recent 
years but without cutting municipal services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finance in this state is such a complex matter now that all we really do is 
put a new Band-Aid on every year," says James Armstrong, city manager in 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Voters really have no idea where the property tax is going now," says Richard 
Barnard, a Huntington Beach administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 But all report that voters don't want to see cutbacks in public services. So 
instead cutbacks happen by default, and Southern Californians will endure a 
public landscape that is a little poorer for the freeway not widened, the 
school class not offered. "We'll be stretching out public projects further," 
says David Ream, city manager of Santa Ana, which has $150 million in the 
county fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a better solution? Sure. Conscious choices by an informed electorate 
and government officials. "I hope Orange County leads to a real effort at 
reform, with the governor and Legislature and local bodies sitting down and 
working out a more intelligent tax system," says Fullerton's Armstrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately the only response from state government so far is a 
lock-the-barn-door call by grandstanding politicians to restrict investments by 
local government officials. Dealing with symptoms won't cure the illness. 
</P>
<P>
 But will real reform come? "Maybe, maybe not," says Eugene Smolensky, UC 
Berkeley's dean of public policy. "How long after an earthquake do the good 
intentions last?"

NEWS ANALYSIS; THE CUTTING EDGE; STANDARDS FOR QUALITY MAY BE COMPUTERS' NEXT 
ADVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The personal computer industry remained divided Tuesday over the significance 
of the flaw in Intel's Pentium microprocessor, but hardware and software 
companies will probably be united soon on the need to improve product quality 
and reliability standards and to better serve less-sophisticated consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer makers have long been accustomed to racing to market with the latest 
innovations, and some industry executives acknowledge that that has often 
resulted in unfinished, unreliable and bug-ridden products reaching the market. 
As PCs move into the home, they are increasingly being purchased by consumers 
who aren't aware of this history -- and aren't much interested in $3,000 
machines that don't work properly. 
</P>
<P>
 That reality is part of the reason that a flaw in the Pentium chip that Intel 
regarded as insignificant has become something of a scandal. IBM said Monday 
that it would stop shipping Pentium machines, though most other PC 
manufacturers, along with Microsoft Corp., are backing Intel's claim that most 
PC users need not worry. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the Pentium dispute blows over, the broader issue will not. In a 
survey of nearly 100,000 readers reported last month in PC World, an industry 
publication, 44% of the respondents said they had at least one problem with 
their computers, and 6.7% said their computers were "dead on arrival." 
</P>
<P>
 "In any other industry this would be unacceptable," scolds Rick Thoman, an IBM 
senior vice president, in speeches around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitive pressures are partly responsible. "Intel is rushing to get new 
generations of products out to stay ahead of the competition," says Michael 
Cusumano, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who has studied 
corporate efforts to improve software quality. "They back themselves into a 
corner with their short delivery times." 
</P>
<P>
 Software, which is basically a set of logical instructions that controls the 
functions of everything from missiles to microprocessors and telephone systems, 
has always faced problems as new improvements have been offset by the 
software's growing size and complexity. It is often nearly impossible to 
predict what will cause a software program to go awry. 
</P>
<P>
 Capers Jones, a Burlington, Mass., expert on software productivity, likes to 
tell the story about an American jet fighter that would turn upside-down every 
time it crossed the Equator because of a flaw in its software. 
</P>
<P>
 Although leading computer, telecommunications and software companies have 
substantially improved the quality of their software over the past decade, 
Jones says, the average piece of software is still "embarrassingly bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Quality problems, which are serious enough in critical business applications, 
are being magnified a thousandfold as computers are sold to millions of 
consumers who aren't accustomed to defects in spanking-new products. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft announced Tuesday, for example, that it was making available a 
"patch" for the Pentium chip that would prevent it from causing errors on its 
Excel spreadsheet program. But customers who want the fix have to download it 
from an on-line service. That's easy for a technically astute user. But a 
novice may wonder why he has to spend his own valuable time figuring out how to 
get onto a computer network so he can download fixes for a brand-new computer. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare its products better for the expanding consumer market, Microsoft 
has revamped its approach to testing new products to make sure those that make 
their way onto the desktops of novices will be easy to use and relatively 
flaw-free. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tolerance people have for things not working is much lower" among 
novices, says Carl Stork, director of Microsoft's Windows hardware program. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft has delayed delivery of its new operating system, Windows95, for 
more than a year, in part to put it through a vigorous testing program. Stork 
says Microsoft hopes to have Windows95 at the quality level more typical of a 
third-generation product when it is released to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Although individual companies may implement rigorous quality-control programs, 
there is still no objective standard on which consumers can judge products. 
Garr Di Salvo, senior project leader for electronics at Consumers Union, the 
publisher of Consumer Reports, says that after years of effort, Consumer 
Reports still hasn't found an effective way to grade personal computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The industry is very dynamic. Perhaps too dynamic," says Di Salvo.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; FISCAL QUAKE IN O.C. CAUSES TEXAS TREMORS; PANIC: 
STATEWIDE FUND HAS LOST 40% OF ITS DEPOSITS IN A WEEK. COUNTIES AND AGENCIES IN 
OTHER STATES HAVE ALSO REPORTED LOSSES. 
</P>

<P>
 Jitters over Orange County's fiscal crisis continued to ripple across the 
country Tuesday, as nervous officials in Texas resumed their run on a statewide 
investment pool that has lost 40% of its deposits in the past week. 
</P>
<P>
 TexPool, which manages investments for more than 1,300 school districts and 
municipalities across the state, has been sapped of $1.5 billion since the 
Orange County debacle began unfolding. Though many local officials believe the 
fund is sound, they say the stampede of withdrawals has forced them to pull out 
their own deposits to avoid getting stuck with any losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a panic out there," said Ft. Bend County Treasurer Kathy Hynson, who 
Monday withdrew $4.4 million of her government's $20.4 million in TexPool 
deposits. "If everything cools down, I think we'll be fine. But I just wanted 
to be sure that if the bottom fell out, I'd at least have some funds left 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to calm anxious officials, Texas Treasurer Martha Whitehead on 
Tuesday reiterated her pledge to insure the $2.2 billion now left in the 
TexPool account. By using state funds to buy TexPool securities, Whitehead 
said, she could guarantee that no investor would lose money or be denied access 
to deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am confident we will weather this storm," she said. "My top priority is to 
reassure participants that they will not lose a dime." 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts agree that TexPool's problems have been largely psychological. 
The fund, founded five years ago to give small municipalities the same 
investment options as large governments, usually hits a low in November or 
December anyway, as agencies withdraw revenues traditionally deposited at the 
beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop-off, which has tended to run between 30% and 50%, was sharper this 
year because higher interest rates lured away many investors, experts said. 
Even before Orange County declared bankruptcy, TexPool's assets had dropped 
from a high of $10.8 billion in February to $3.7 billion last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came Orange County's woes and a critical article in last Friday's 
Wall Street Journal, which suggested that TexPool's investment strategies were 
similarly suspect. State officials decried the story as "unfair and 
irresponsible," saying 90% of their investments are in the low-risk U.S. 
Treasury market. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, however, the rush was on. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors yanked $369 million on Friday, $662 million on Monday and $463 
million on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a herd mentality," said Richard Scott, a former Texas treasury official 
who now runs his own investment group in Dallas. "People are withdrawing funds 
without the economic rationale to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Counties and other public agencies in Ohio, Wisconsin, Maine, Alaska, Georgia 
and West Virginia have also reported significant losses in investment 
portfolios in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn S. Goldberg, a managing director of Standard & Poor's, the bond-rating 
agency, said that despite these woes, Orange County is an extreme case. 
Nonetheless, S&P has expedited a review of the riskiness of other local 
government investment pools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority invest in very to relatively safe securities, many of which 
have no leverage and no derivative securities," Goldberg said. "But you're 
always looking for the exception." 
</P>
<P>
 (In leveraging, a fund borrows money in the hope of investing it at a higher 
rate of return. Derivatives are complex securities whose value is based on the 
movement of other financial indicators, from interest rates to oil prices. Both 
figured in the Orange County debacle.) 
</P>
<P>
 One exception was Auburn, Me., a city of 24,000 north of Portland. It has lost 
$6.5 million out of $15.5 million in derivative investments, due to rising 
interest rates. Auburn's investments totaled $18 million; its entire budget is 
$44 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't have an investment policy," acting City Manager Patricia A. 
Finnigan said. "We didn't have sufficient internal controls to know what we 
were investing in." 
</P>
<P>
 Auburn had planned to use the investment funds to cushion the city's share of 
the cost of a new regional waste-to-energy incinerator. With the losses, 
Finnigan said, taxes may be raised as much as 10% -- a blow to a city 
unaccustomed to double-digit hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, she said Auburn's plight is far from being as bad as Orange 
County's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County was highly leveraged in that they borrowed money to invest, and 
we weren't doing that," Finnigan said. "We're not going to have to declare 
bankruptcy. We're going to have to watch things a lot more closely. We can live 
with that." 
</P>
<P>
 In Alaska, the state's Permanent Fund, set up in 1976 to preserve Alaska's oil 
wealth from boom times, has incurred paper losses of more than $1 billion since 
February, a spokesman said Tuesday. The market value of the fund -- which has 
paid each Alaska resident a dividend every year since 1982 -- is $14.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In Alaska, as in Orange County, the losses are in the fund's bond portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise in interest rates this year, which has sharply diminished the value 
of bond holdings, "has been eating up our unrealized gains, but we're not too 
excited about it," spokesman Jim Kelly said. The fund includes no derivatives, 
and "we didn't do any leveraged buying," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're meeting our cash needs. Eventually the rates will go down" and the bond 
fund will again show strength, Kelly predicted. "We've just got to ride it 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Katz reported from Houston and Miller from Washington. Times researchers Doug 
Conner in Seattle, Edith Stanley in Atlanta and Lianne Hart in Houston also 
contributed to this report.

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Getting Municipal Bonds to Market 
</P>
<P>
 The normally low-profile municipal bond market has been pushed into the 
spotlight by Orange County's bankruptcy, which followed deep losses on bond 
held in its investment pool. Here are soe key dimensions of the muni market: 
</P>
<P>
 How the Money Is Used Top uses nationally, by market share in 1994: General 
purposes: 27% Primary and secondary eduation: 12% Water and sewer facilities: 
8% Acute-care hospitals: 7% Single-family housing: 6% Higher education: 4% 
Public power: 4% Pollution control: 4% Multifamily housing: 3% Airports: 3% 
</P>
<P>
 Top Issuers of Bonds By market shares in 1994: California: 4.0% New York 
State: 2.2% Los Angeles County: 1.3% New York State Medical Care: 1.0% New York 
State Dorm Authority: 1.0% 
</P>
<P>
 The Deal Makers 
</P>
<P>
 Bond deals are put together by special departments of major brokerage houses. 
They have been profitable sources of business for Wall Street. Top undersriters 
in 1994, by market share: Merrill Lynch: 11.6% Goldman Sachs: 10.2% Lehma Bros: 
8.9% Smith Barney: 7.3% CS First Boston: 5.6% 
</P>
<P>
 Types of Municipals 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal bonds are eiter "general obligation," meaning they are backed by the 
general credit of the goerment or agency, or revenue bonds, backed by the money 
produced by the project being financed, such as bridge tolls or public housing 
rents. Normally, general obligation bonds are considered less risky and pay 
lower yeilds. But because of the bankruptcy, Orange County's revenue bonds are 
now considered less risky. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond type, Revenue: 36.4%, General obligation: 63.6% 
</P>
<P>
 What They Pay Investors 
</P>
<P>
 The great majority of municipal bonds are held by mutual and money market 
funds, banks, insrance companies and wealthy individuals, either directly or in 
trusts. The investor appeal is that the interest is exempt from federal taxes. 
One key measure of municipal bond interest rates looks at the average yeild on 
the top 40 municipal bonds.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; FUND'S LIQUIDATION STRATEGISTS LAY OUT 6-MONTH 
PLAN TO SELL; Q & A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, now a consultant to Orange County, and 
William D. Rifkin, a managing director of mergers and acquisitions with Salomon 
Bros. in New York, laid out their strategy Tuesday for liquidating the county's 
investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 When they are done, Rifkin promised, "it's all going to go." While some 
experts question that strategy, county officials and their advisers say it may 
be the only politically palatable option, ridding the county of its holdings of 
controversial derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Government agencies invested about $7.4 billion in the pool; Salomon estimates 
the holdings would fetch $5.4 billion if they were sold today. 
</P>
<P>
 Working around the clock since Friday, a 30-member Salomon team developed the 
preliminary strategy that may include some type of hedge against rising 
interest rates for the more volatile, hard-to-sell securities left in the 
portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it won't conduct a fire sale, the county intends to sell its remaining 
securities within 180 days, Hayes and Rifkin said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How will the county restructure its portfolio? Can you hedge against the 
risk? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Hayes: I'm not saying we are going to hedge or not. That's certainly an 
option. Our goal is to, as orderly as possible, execute trades that will reduce 
the risk and volatility in the portfolio. And that will shorten the time frames 
and make the fund more consistent with what I believe should be in a short-term 
money fund for a government. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. So you want to start liquidating the fund immediately? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Hayes: Correct. We are going to do it prudently. If there is something to 
do (today) that makes sense, we are going to do it. If it doesn't, we won't. I 
want to be upfront with the people in the financial community that this is not 
a fire sale. And I don't want to create the atmosphere of a fire sale. Orange 
County is still a very economically viable county, and we are going to take 
full advantage of that in how we deal with the portfolio.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What particular assets would you attempt to sell first? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Hayes: I think we're working on everything simultaneously, and we will make 
our decisions on what is in the best interest for the fund and the people in 
Orange County. Relative to what we will do first, it will depend on what the 
market is. If we see something that comes along very quickly that will shorten 
the average maturity of the (bonds of) government agencies in the portfolio, it 
might be first. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Rifkin: There is very little in the portfolio now that will be there when 
the process is completed. It's all going to go. So it really doesn't matter 
what we sell first. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why not hold on to the government and Treasury bonds in the portfolio until 
maturity? Won't that reduce losses? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Rifkin: It's too long-term. It has got an average maturity of four years, 
and that's just too long. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Won't selling this huge portfolio in 180 days or less be extremely 
difficult? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Hayes: It will be complex, it will be difficult, but I think we're up to 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Rifkin: The value we put on the (remaining) portfolio, the ($5.4) billion, 
is the value at which we think it can be sold. We factored into the price that 
it is a very large portfolio and that a number of these instruments are not 
conventional instruments. We are confident we can sell the securities at this 
price if interest rates do not change. If interest rates change, it may be 
worth more, it may be worth less. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. One of your options is selling the entire portfolio at once. How likely is 
that? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Hayes: It depends on the price. It certainly is not an option we are going 
to discount. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Who do you see as likely buyers? Insurance institutions, mutual funds? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Rifkin: All of the above, and other dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How short should the Treasury maturities be in the restructured portfolio? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Hayes: I can go back to when I was state treasurer. I had a portfolio that 
was about 180 days in length. I thought that was appropriate for a state money 
fund. I think for this fund, we will bring the maturity down even lower than 
that. You need shorter maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Let's talk about portfolio value. Last week it was valued at $7.8 billion 
in actual contributions by the pool participants. Now you are saying they 
contributed $7.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Hayes: I don't know where that (higher) figure came from. We are confident 
in these numbers, but they are unaudited numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Rifkin: We have a portfolio list from Bank of America, the trustee, and we 
are reasonably confident of what is in the portfolio. But it has not been 
audited. So we hope it's right. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How damaging was the $11.4-billion sale of collateral by brokerage firms 
last week? (Brokerages that lent the county money to buy more bonds redeemed 
their collateral when the county began failing to make loan payments.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Rifkin: I don't think it was all that material. It reduced flexibility. But 
from a value standpoint, it really was a small factor. The real culprits are 
increased interest rates and leverage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Wouldn't it be tough to sell this security by security?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Rifkin: Well, there are only on the order of 85 to 90 securities in this 
portfolio. The principal amounts are large. We aren't talking about 
$1,000-denomination bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What are your other options? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Rifkin: We could approach Sallie Mae (the Student Loan Marketing Assn., 
which provides a secondary market for student loans), and I am using them as an 
example. We would approach a federal agency and see if there is a way -- at no 
economic cost -- whereby we can turn their structured note into a more 
conventional security. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, when an agency issues an inverse security, it isn't interested 
in selling inverse floaters; it's trying to raise money at the lowest possible 
cost. So it would combine that issuance with some sort of other instrument, 
like an interest rate swap, and turn it into a more conventional borrowing with 
a fixed or floating rate. It's possible for us to put the two pieces back 
together and then have the agency issue a more traditional, more conventional 
security. Then we would sell that. Now, that's not to say we can't sell the 
inverse floater; we can. But we may be able to get a better deal this way.  
</P>
<P>
 We've approached some of the agencies and they seem receptive. I don't want to 
say which ones. I'm not trying to say we're dependent on the agencies -- we're 
not -- but it would be nice if they would assist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. But wouldn't that involve more derivatives? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Rifkin: No, we would not do a derivative. The agency has already done a 
swap, so if we could convince them to combine the swap with the (underlying) 
instrument and reissue a more conventional security, that would be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. And who would pay the costs for these new issues? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Rifkin: There wouldn't necessarily be any issuance costs, because you would 
be dealing directly with the agency. Now, these are just ideas, ideas we're 
kicking around. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Initially, there appeared to be discrepancies in the portfolio, securities 
that didn't exist. Has that been cleared up?  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. Rifkin: When we first went through it, we found discrepancies, but we found 
explanations. So that seems to be accurate.

WHOLESALE PRICES RISE MODESTLY IN NOVEMBER AS RETAIL SALES SURGE; ECONOMY: IN 
LIGHT OF THE GOVERNMENT FIGURES, ANALYSTS SAY THE FED STILL COULD RAISE 
INTEREST RATES AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wholesale prices rose moderately and retail sales surged in November, the 
government reported Tuesday, indicating that the economy is still expanding but 
without a bout of worrisome inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department said its producer price index rose 0.5%, in line with 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a big increase in the index would normally stir inflation concerns, but 
analysts dismissed the rise as a bouncing back after two big consecutive 
monthly declines. They noted that a measurement of so-called core inflation, 
which excludes the often-volatile food and energy sectors and which economists 
believe more closely reflects underlying price pressures, edged up a barely 
perceptible 0.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, analysts suggested that another rate hike by the Federal Reserve 
Board is possible. "The Fed's inclination to tighten or not to tighten at the 
Dec. 20 (policy-making session) is probably not altered by these data," said 
Ray Stone of Stone & McCarthy, a financial markets research firm in Princeton, 
N.J. "The Fed is looking into 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 "On balance, inflation still appears slight at the finished-goods level, but 
the economy is clearly growing fast enough to lead to further Fed tightening," 
said Bruce Steinberg, macroeconomics manager for Merrill Lynch & Co. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts said they expect Fed policy-makers to leave interest rates 
unchanged when they meet Dec. 20, but said that another increase would be more 
likely at the next meeting, on Jan. 31 and Feb. 1. However, some other analysts 
said the strong tone of virtually all recent economic statistics could persuade 
the Fed to move this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department reported that retail sales surged by 1.2% in November 
after making a gain of 1.3% in October, suggesting that the holiday shopping 
season got off to a solid start. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market responded in a mixed way to the reports, with the yield on the 
30-year Treasury bond easing to 7.85% from 7.92% on Monday. But short-term 
interest rates rose -- sharply narrowing the gap between short- and long-term 
rates -- indicating investor beliefs that the Fed will raise short-term rates 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 The mild gain in the wholesale inflation figure was propelled by a 4.5% rise 
in gasoline prices. The jump was caused in part by a requirement for 
cleaner-burning fuels in metropolitan areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The wholesale price rise followed a 0.5% decline both in September and October 
as the industry continued to digest higher production and commodity price 
increases.  
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley, said the moderate increase 
"continues to indicate that despite the pressures at the upstream stages of 
production, there is an inability to pass (price increases) through at the 
finished-goods level." 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for goods at the intermediate level of production rose 1.1%, whereas 
so-called crude goods at the commodity level were up 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, inflation at the wholesale level has been rising at a 
moderate annual rate of 1.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Food prices rose a moderate 0.2% in November, after having declined 0.2% in 
October. Overall energy prices were up 2.1%, primarily because of the increase 
in gasoline prices. It was the largest jump since February, when the figure was 
2.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department said passenger car prices rose 1.0% and tobacco prices 
fell 0.4%. Beef prices rose, but vegetable prices declined substantially. 
</P>
<P>
 The retail sales picture gives ammunition to those who argue that the U.S. 
economy is growing quickly. The Commerce Department report showing a 
stronger-than-expected gain, to a seasonally adjusted $194.2 billion, follows a 
revised 1.3% gain in October. 
</P>
<P>
 November was the sixth straight month for rising retail sales figures, and the 
1.2% increase was more than twice the 0.5% that Wall Street economists had 
forecast. Warm weather for much of the month had been expected to curb demand 
for many items, particularly clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 However, apparel sales increased last month by 0.6%, following a big 2.2% jump 
in October. 
</P>
<P>
 General-merchandise stores, where sales fell 0.1% after a 0.3% rise in 
October, was the only category in which sales declined from October. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of new cars rose 14.6% in November. New cars account for about a fifth 
of total retail sales, so swings in demand strongly influence the overall 
monthly figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Retail sales excluding cars increased 0.9% last month after rising 0.5% in 
October.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; HIGH-INTEREST EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's loss-ridden investment portfolio, now shrunk to $5.4 billion, 
is extremely sensitive to hikes in interest rates -- and to news that makes the 
markets fear higher rates ahead. Each 0.01 percentage point rise in rates will 
cost the fund another $3 million, according to Salomon Bros., the county's 
financial adviser.Some economic news that county officials will be watching: 
</P>
<P>
 TODAY * November consumer price index, industrial production and capacity 
utilization. Interest rates could rise if this data points to a faster-growing 
economy. * Size of two- and five-year Treasury note auctions announced. A 
larger-than-expected auction could drive interest rates higher, since traders 
worry whether there will be enough buyers to purchase the new issues. In 
effect, higher yields will be needed to attract buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 FRIDAY * November housing starts. Signs of strong building activity could 
drive rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
 DEC. 20 * Meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, which will decide 
whether the Fed should boost rates again. * Two-year Treasury note auction. 
</P>
<P>
 DEC. 21 * Five-year Treasury note auction.

 San Diego Firm Buys Furniture Chain: Arnold's bought the assets of Breuners 
for an undisclosed amount and assumed a small portion of the liabilities, 
primarily customer deposits and outstanding orders.Arnold's did not assume the 
core liabilities of John Breuner Co., which will use revenue from the sale to 
pay off debt. Breuners is a 138-year-old Northern California furniture chain 
that recently went through bankruptcy proceedings. Arnold's has three outlets 
in the San Diego area, and the new operation will be based there.

 Federated Sets Date for Merger: The department store chain said it aims to 
close its proposed merger with R.H. Macy & Co. on Monday. Under the plan, the 
combined company would issue about 55.6 million shares of common stock and 
about 18 million warrants to Macy's unaffiliated creditors. Federated said any 
change in the proposed closing date could affect the number of shares and 
warrants issued.

 Bond Refinancing Delayed Irvine Apartment Communities Inc. said it will delay 
plans to refinance $327.3 million in tax-exempt bonds until it can determine 
how Orange County's bankruptcy filing will affect the area's real estate 
industry. The Newport Beach company had scheduled discussions on refinancing 
the debt for Dec. 6, the day the county filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy 
protection, said Richard Moran, the company's chief financial officer.The debt 
is backed by letters of credit from money-center banks and some of the 
company's apartment properties, Moran said. Though the bonds are not tied to 
the county's finances, he said, the company still wants to refinance them to 
lengthen the maturities. Irvine Apartments was spun off earlier this year from 
Irvine Co., Orange County's largest real estate company.

ZZZZ BEST'S MINKOW WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO HALFWAY HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barry Minkow, the San Fernando Valley entrepreneur who made millions with the 
carpet-cleaning company he founded in his parents' garage before being exposed 
as a fraud, was scheduled to be transferred from a federal prison today to a 
halfway house after serving more than five years of his sentence, his lawyer 
and prison officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Minkow, 28, will be moved from the Lompoc Federal Prison Camp and sent to a 
halfway house in North Hollywood, said Randy M. Long, a Reedley, Calif., lawyer 
who represents Minkow in civil matters.Minkow's release date from the halfway 
house is tentatively scheduled for April 12, Lompoc spokesman Dennis Grossini 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The halfway house is not far from Minkow's boyhood home in Reseda where he 
started ZZZZ Best Co. at age 16. He subsequently rode its stock to riches in 
what became one of the biggest scams ever to hit Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Minkow's scheme -- in which the money from one set of investors was used to 
pay off others -- was uncovered in 1987. In 1989, he was sentenced to 25 years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Minkow was a model prisoner, officials say, which accounts for his early 
release. While in prison, he completed graduate degrees in religion by 
correspondence after converting from Judaism to fundamentalist Christianity. He 
also wrote an as-yet-unpublished autobiography. PATRICK LEE

 Optimism on Tuesday that the Federal Reserve Board will win the war against 
inflation caused yields on some longer-term Treasury securities to move lower 
than the yields on securities with shorter maturities. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's five-year note closed at 7.83%, compared to 7.82% 
for the Treasury's 10-year issue.Such an inversion last occurred in September, 
1989, said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 This partial "inverted yield curve" indicates that "investors believe the Fed 
will be successful in slowing the economy and controlling inflation," Johnson 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Bond investors have driven up shorter-term rates in lock step with the Fed as 
it has moved to push up short-term rates, saying it was doing so to slow the 
economy and reduce the risk of inflation. Expectations of a low rate of 
inflation have resulted in longer-term rates not rising as fast.

 FDIC to Review How Banks Sell Mutual Funds: The Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. announced plans to send decoys to banks to make sure bank representatives 
are properly informing customers about the risks involved in owning mutual 
funds and annuities.This marks the first time the federal government has 
initiated a "mystery shopper" program to review the way banks sell mutual 
funds. The FDIC suspects some banks are misleading customers about the risks of 
investing in mutual funds. In some cases, it says, customers think they're 
buying something that is federally insured. Banks deny the allegations. The 
FDIC said it plans to review the sales practices at 3,000 to 4,000 bank offices 
nationwide.

JUSTICE PROBE TARGETS CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY; CONSUMERS: ANTITRUST DIVISION SAYS 
PRELIMINARY INQUIRY IS FOCUSED ON QUESTION OF PRICE FIXING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department has begun an antitrust investigation of pricing 
practices in the nation's $500-billion credit card industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The antitrust division is looking into possible anti-competitive practices 
that may have reduced competition in certain aspects of the credit card 
industry," division spokeswoman Gina Talamona said. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry, led by Visa and MasterCard, has doubled in size in the last six 
years as consumer borrowing has increased. At the end of last year, there were 
288 million credit cards in the United States alone, with balances totaling 
about $197 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Bankers Assn. received a Justice Department civil investigative 
demand, the civil equivalent of a subpoena, in early November. 
</P>
<P>
 Visa said it received a request for information from the department in June, 
though it didn't get a subpoena. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Justice Department has requested information from scores of companies in 
dozens of industries," Visa spokesman David Brancoli said. "We have absolutely 
no reason to believe price fixing is the subject of this inquiry." 
</P>
<P>
 Both MasterCard and Dean Witter, Discover & Co., which issues the Discover 
credit card, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 People familiar with the probe said the investigation is preliminary. If the 
government finds what it believes to be violations of the law, it could bring a 
civil suit or criminal prosecution. Civil cases are more common and most cases 
are settled. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation may not focus on issuers of credit cards such as banking 
companies or corporations. The Justice Department declined to provide specifics 
of the probe.  
</P>
<P>
 The investigation comes as card use is surging this holiday shopping season. 
Visa, with more than 368 million cards in use, said Monday that shoppers in the 
United States rang up more than $11 billion in Visa card purchases from Nov. 25 
through Dec. 10, an increase of 23% from the same period a year ago.

L.A. COUNTY SHOWS 1ST SIGNS OF A COMEBACK; ECONOMY: UCLA BUSINESS FORECASTING 
REPORT SAYS STATE WILL GAIN MORE THAN 200,000 JOBS THIS YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESUS SANCHEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With California's economic recovery continuing to exceed expectations, Los 
Angeles County -- which has lost more than 500,000 jobs since 1989 -- has begun 
to show the first faint signs of a turnaround, according to two economic 
forecasts expected to be released today. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County retailers should report higher sales this year -- the first 
annual increase in five years -- and job growth "appears imminent" over the 
next few months after years of declines, according to a report by the UC Santa 
Barbara Economic Forecast Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The promise of a regional turnaround comes as the state's economy has expanded 
much more quickly than expected. The UCLA Business Forecasting Project, which 
will release its quarterly economic report today in tandem with the UCSB 
survey, says the state will add more than 200,000 jobs this year -- almost 
twice the estimate UCLA made three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's economy will grow even more quickly next year, when it will add 
more than 440,000 jobs, before the rate of growth declines again in 1996 as the 
national economy slows, according to the UCLA report.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, California should continue to add more than 200,000 jobs in 1996 and 
'97, UCLA said. 
</P>
<P>
 The expected national slowdown "prevents California's growth in 1995 from 
becoming a full boom," said Tom Lieser, associate director at the UCLA Business 
Forecasting Project. "But it is still a very good forecast." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Los Angeles County, there were recovery signs throughout Southern 
California, with San Diego, Santa Barbara and Ventura counties also projected 
to experience job growth soon. In fact, the number of jobs in Orange County 
increased in September after being relatively flat for 22 months, but that was 
well before the county's financial crisis was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The nascent comeback in Los Angeles County, however, remains fragile and will 
most likely continue to lag the statewide recovery, according to forecasts by 
UCSB and others.  
</P>
<P>
 Continued layoffs in the aerospace industry and the slump in commercial real 
estate pose major economic hurdles for the county, First Interstate Bank 
economist Adrian Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 In past recoveries, growth in real estate and aerospace have pulled the area 
out of its slumps, said Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Economic Development 
Corp. of Los Angeles County.  
</P>
<P>
 This time around, however, it is the strength of the trade and entertainment 
industries that is expected to help add 11,000 jobs to the county this year -- 
the first increase since 1990.

 Hughes Aircraft to Send Computer Work Outside: The Los Angeles-based concern, 
looking to further cut costs, plans to hire an outside company to perform its 
data-processing tasks.The work is currently handled by 1,500 Hughes employees, 
most of them in Southern California, but it's likely the vast majority of them 
will join whichever firm acquires the Hughes contract. Hughes, a unit of 
General Motors Corp., declined to say which companies are negotiating for the 
pact or what the contract's potential terms are. But the trade publication 
Information Week said Computer Sciences Corp. of El Segundo is in final 
negotiations with Hughes. Computer Sciences declined to comment.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; ECONOMIC DATA LEAVES STOCKS, BONDS MIXED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Government reports indicating economic expansion with only mild inflation left 
the bond and stock markets mixed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorter-term interest rates rose on the assumption that the economy's 
continued growth makes it likely the Federal Reserve Board will tighten credit 
again soon. 
</P>
<P>
 But long-term bond yields, which respond more to the inflation outlook, fell 
after the government reported that November wholesale inflation was in line 
with expectations -- and apparently under control. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average eased 3.03 points to 
3,715.34, but winners topped losers by 11 to 9 in active trading on the NYSE. 
Most broader market indexes rose. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market's split personality was evident in the changes in yields on 
one- and 30-year Treasury securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-year T-bill yield rose to 7.33% from 7.29% on Monday, while the 
30-year T-bond yield dropped to 7.85% from 7.92%. 
</P>
<P>
 In economic news, the Commerce Department reported a larger-than-expected 1.2% 
rise in retail sales in November, a sign of healthy consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
 "The implication of strong retail sales is that we'll see continued strong 
economic growth in the fourth quarter," said Rusty Vanneman, senior money 
market analyst at Technical Data. "That means the Fed will probably tighten 
(short-term) rates soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Labor Department said wholesale prices rose 0.5% in November, 
after declining for two months. Despite the increase, analysts said wholesale 
prices in general did not appear poised to rise sharply, even as the economy 
grows. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can we have steady growth without inflation? It certainly looks like it," 
said Andrew Brenner, senior trader at Nomura Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market, however, is having trouble deciding whether the benefits of 
lower long-term yields offset the negatives of higher short-term rates, 
analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bank stocks rebounded, drawing strength from optimism that interest rates 
overall may be close to peaking. J.P. Morgan rose 3/4 to 59 1/8, Mellon Bank 
climbed 1 to 31 3/4, Wells Fargo surged 2 5/8 to 146 1/2 and Bankers Trust 
gained 1 3/4 to 58 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Intel inched up 1/8 to 60 1/2 after tumbling 2 3/8 on Monday on news that 
IBM was halting shipments of personal computers that use Intel's flawed Pentium 
chip. 
</P>
<P>
 * US Bioscience fell 4 3/8 to 2 after a Food and Drug Administration advisory 
committee recommended late Monday against approval of Ethyol, a drug developed 
to treat the side effects of chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, uncertainty over the simmering revolt in Chiapas state 
sent Mexican stocks tumbling. The Bolsa index sank to 2,407.99, off 59.8 points 
and its lowest closing level in four months. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average closed down 99.62 points at 18,875.48. 
In Frankfurt, the DAX index eased 13.57 points to 2,011.25. London's FTSE-100 
index added 3.0 points to 2,946.4.

BUSINESS COMPUTING / RICHARD O'REILLY: IT MIGHT BE TIME TO LOOK AT A NEW WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The incredible shrinking personal computer is not yet small enough to strap 
onto your wrist, but a couple of new products from two venerable watchmakers, 
Seiko and Timex, are pointing in that direction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seiko MessageWatch, $80 to $120, not only provides absolutely accurate 
time, all the time, but also is a pager that can display telephone numbers, 
sports scores and stock market data. 
</P>
<P>
 The Timex Data Link watch, $130, comes with Microsoft software allowing you to 
program the watch from your computer screen. It can store appointments, 
telephone numbers, a to-do list and other data -- and beep you with timely 
reminders. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this might be more than you want in a watch. But if you already carry a 
pager or a personal organizer such as a Sharp Wizard, these watches can help 
you reduce your electronic baggage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seiko MessageWatch is an ingenious device that has only one major flaw: It 
is available only in Southern California, Seattle and Portland, Ore. Seiko does 
not yet have paging networks set up anywhere else, though it hopes to have most 
major cities around the world covered within a couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
 The stiffness of the watchband, which also serves as the pager antenna, is the 
only clue that this Seiko is not an ordinary watch. It contains a tiny FM radio 
receiver that scans the FM band for so-called sub-carrier signals bearing 
messages for that particular watch. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, Seiko Communications of America Inc. has so far 
contracted with 11 radio stations to broadcast its pager signals. By early 
1995, the watch should be able to pick up pages from Santa Barbara to Palm 
Springs to San Diego, with East Coast installations to begin next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The paging system gives the watch one rather spectacular feature: It 
automatically synchronizes itself every half-hour by radio signal with the U.S. 
Bureau of Standards atomic clock, so you always have the right time to the 
second. When the full paging system is in place nationally and worldwide, the 
watch will automatically set itself to the current local time as you fly from 
one city to another. A dual-time feature lets you keep a second time display 
constant. 
</P>
<P>
 The MessageWatch comes in three models, but all have the same internal 
electronics, built around what Seiko calls the Advanced Communications and 
Timekeeping Technology (ACTT) chip set. The watch can store up to eight 
messages, four of which can be saved as long as you wish. Seiko says you're 
more likely to receive all your messages than you would with a standard pager 
because the system broadcasts each message four times over the whole network of 
FM stations they have contracted with to serve the area. The monthly paging 
service is $8.95, and for another $5 you can also have voice mail (you call 
your pager number to hear the messages). 
</P>
<P>
 There are three free information services included when you buy the watch -- 
automatic time updating, and morning and evening weather forecasts. For $2.49 a 
month, you get daily Dow Jones, Standard & Poor's 500 and New York gold 
closings; the prime interest rate, and lottery numbers. If you also want sports 
scores, the air pollution index and the ultraviolet exposure index, add another 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you're all rigged up for paging, you might still want a way to keep track 
of your appointments, so consider strapping the Timex Data Link watch onto your 
other wrist. The Timex has four data modes, which are controlled from entries 
you make in the Windows software that comes with the watch. The watch has 
enough memory for about 70 items. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment mode stores the date, the time and a description of up to 15 
characters. A tone will sound, and a reminder will appear on the watch face 
prior to the appointment. You control how many minutes before this should 
happen, but it must be the same for all messages. 
</P>
<P>
 In the anniversary mode, you store the dates, times and 15-character 
descriptions of annual events. An icon depicting a string tied to a finger 
reminds you of the events a specified interval ahead of time, and flashes to 
remind you again on the days of the events. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also use the watch as a phone book with the phone number mode, and 
there's a to-do list mode, complete with five priority levels and a way to mark 
completed tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the Windows Data Link software is quite easy. After you've entered the 
data on your PC, you push a button on the watch to put it into "comm mode," 
then click on the appropriate button on the computer screen. You hold the watch 
face about six to 12 inches from the screen to receive the data. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer is accomplished by a Timex-engineered system that causes thin 
bars of light to flash on the computer monitor. It will work with virtually any 
cathode ray tube monitor, but not with laptop liquid crystal display screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Is either watch the perfect answer? Probably not. Neither, for instance, has a 
timer or stopwatch. The Seiko has only one alarm, not five as the Timex does. 
And it lacks Timex's wonderful Indiglo night lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Timex time is only as accurate as the clock setting on my PC, because 
the software sets watch time to PC time when you transfer data. And with the 
Timex, I'd still have to carry a separate pager. 
</P>
<P>
 So here's my strategy: I'm going to wear the Seiko while I'm in town and can 
receive pages. But when I travel, it'll be the Timex loaded with my schedule 
and all the telephone numbers I need. At least that's the compromise until 
Seiko can offer service in cities I visit.

IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; PLASMA TREATMENT MAKES MONEY LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN WIEGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Making money last is not just a problem for holiday shoppers. The U.S. 
Department of the Treasury's Bureau of Engraving and Printing would like paper 
currency to stay in circulationlonger. Along with a major overhaul of the 
design of U.S. currency next year, the Treasury hopes to improve its quality. A 
study led by Raymond A. Young, a University of Wisconsin at Madison forestry 
professor, has found a way to stretch the wallet-life of the greenback. The 
main problem with aging bills is the tendency of ink to fade or wear off. The 
Madison study found that treating currency paper with gaseous materials known 
as plasmas not only significantly improved the paper's ability to absorb and 
hold ink, but did not produce any visible changes on the surface of the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Plasma-aided manufacturing involves the use of electrically charged particles 
to produce new materials with unusual and superior properties. The plasmas are 
formed by adding a gas to an electrical field, which causes the gas molecules 
to split apart and form radically new compounds. The process is already used in 
a number of ways, including treating automobile parts to improve the adhesion 
of paint and for etching more precise semiconductors. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers tried out three different gases -- oxygen, silicon 
tetrachloride and carbon tetrafluoride -- for the currency-treating plasma. The 
first two gases worked fine. Unfortunately, the carbon tetrafluoride created a 
Teflon-like coating, making the paper totally impenetrable to ink. The Treasury 
hopes that plasma-treated currency paper will not only last longer, but might 
help foil counterfeiters too. 
</P>
<P>
 Do You See What I See: In the classic Japanese film "Rashomon," viewers 
grapple with the question of why the characters remember different and often 
mutually exclusive details about the same scene. Neuroscientists have also 
wrestled with this question. And a new study published by researchers from the 
University of California at Davis, and Otto von Guericke Technical College in 
Magdenburg, Germany, provides at least a partial answer. 
</P>
<P>
 The team found that the way an individual brain registers and processes visual 
information depends on where the person was directing his attention. Paying 
attention to one part of a complex scene effectively boosts those visual brain 
signals while weakening signals from other parts of the scene. This selective 
attention keeps us focused on the most important items at the moment -- say, 
the road ahead when we're driving -- but may cause us to miss a stop sign on 
the side of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The study showed that selective attention kicks in as fast as 80 milliseconds 
after the retina at the back of the eyeball sends an exact copy of the visual 
world to the brain for processing. The selected images receive enhanced visual 
processing. The results of the study are important in efforts to eventually 
diagnose and treat neurological diseases and disorders. But they may also have 
practical applications for human performance. Airplane cockpits, for example, 
are already designed to incorporate knowledge about where we focus attention. A 
better understanding of selective attention would help prevent perceptual 
failures during the highly demanding tasks required of the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood Bubbles: Many organizations, including pharmaceutical companies, the 
U.S. Department of Defense and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, 
have been seeking substitutes for blood. The substitutes have several 
advantages over the human kind: They have a longer shelf life, they don't carry 
diseases like AIDS, and they don't have a "type" that renders them useless for 
some people. But the only blood substitute currently approved by the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration, Fluosol-DA 20%, can carry only a quarter of the oxygen 
that whole blood can. 
</P>
<P>
 Now researchers at the University of Illinois have come up with a substitute 
that carries 50% more oxygen than is carried by the same volume of whole blood. 
The substitute was created by beaming ultrasound waves on the surface of a 
water solution containing hemoglobin. The waves inject small bursts of air into 
the protein solution, creating a froth. The heat generated by the sound waves 
also creates hot spots in the liquid, intense enough to break the chemical 
bonds of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 The elements so produced react with the amino-acid residues on the surface of 
the hemoglobin molecules, linking them into spherical bubbles roughly 50 times 
smaller in diameter than a human hair. These bubbles satisfy the main criteria 
for red-blood-cell substitutes: They bind to oxygen molecules in the lungs and 
efficiently unload oxygen in the tissues. And they remain chemically stable for 
months when kept cool. 
</P>
<P>
 While the tiny bubbles are half the size of red blood cells, they are not so 
small that they cause damage to the kidneys or other organs the way the smaller 
proteins of most earlier substitutes did. The substitute has not yet been 
tested in mammals, though, and thus is still some years away from being 
available.

POSTCARD FROM CYBERSPACE / DANIEL AKST: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / 
TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; BEYOND YULETIDE CAROLS AND EGGNOG

 Ho ho ho and so forth. 'Tis the season to be jolly, and so off we went, 
searchlight and sandwiches in hand, to scour all of cyberspace for holiday 
cheer. I'd already e-mailed Santa at santa@northpole.net, warning that, since 
the quake, what looks like a regular chimney in Los Angeles is likely to be a 
framed metal pipe barely wide enough to accommodate an elf, never mind the Big 
Man. 
</P>
<P>
 My good deed for the year done, I headed for Prodigy, where the jumpword 
holiday took me to a Christmas-oriented bulletin board. Gen X-ers will want to 
steer a wide berth: The topics include Bob Hope, Rosemary Clooney and Andy 
Williams. On the other hand, Prodigy's Just Kids area does have a nice feature 
on making homemade wrapping paper using stencils and other tricks, complete 
with step-by-step instructions and a handy bibliography about stencils and 
holiday crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 On CompuServe, I used the IBM File Finder (go IBMFF) with the keyword 
christmas to find more than 250 files, including animated Christmas cards, 
Christmas puzzles, season's greetings in Chinese and Japanese, Christmas 
screensavers, words and music to Christmas carols, and more. The Religion 
Forum, for instance, offers "The First Christmas Story," billed as a free 
electronic book complete with sound (if you have a sound card) about the birth 
of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 On ZiffNet, reachable via CompuServe, fun Christmas freebies include the 
complete text of "A Christmas Carol," by Charles Dickens, and for the more 
allegorically minded, "The Pilgrim's Progress" by John Bunyan. Both are 
copyright-free and available thanks to Project Guttenberg, the volunteer effort 
that is putting more and more classics of this kind on-line. For game-lovers 
addicted to DOOM II, ZiffNet offers a free Christmas module described as 
follows: "A sinister gang of mutants and mercenaries has converted Santa's 
sub-permafrost toy factory to nuclear weapons production. You must clear them 
out so that the world's kids don't wind up with plutonium in their stockings on 
Christmas morning!" The file is said to include cheerful holiday colors and "a 
climactic battle inside a Christmas tree." All decked out for the season, 
America Online has established AOL Holiday Central (keyword holiday), which 
brings together a variety of holiday offerings, including shopping and message 
forums. There is also a nice collection of Christmas images and things for 
downloading, including a multimedia Christmas card that will play a few holiday 
songs while you look at the pictures (assuming, again, that you have a sound 
card). The file to look for is amm xmas.zip. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on AOL, do a software search with the keyword christmas. I found 371 
files, including images, sounds, even seasonal tiles for computerized mah-jongg 
games. But when I trudged wearily into the AOL Holiday Chat Room Sunday 
afternoon, exhausted from racing around cyberspace, I found myself all alone 
without even a single reindeer, elf or inebriated middle-manager with whom to 
wax sentimental. 
</P>
<P>
 My mood somewhat darkened by this experience, I headed out to see how the 
holiday might be making itself felt on the Internet's anarchic expanses. Eager 
to erase the taste of saccharine, I headed straight for alt.bitterness, where 
the very first posting I read seemed to say it all: "I'm not a habitue of 
alt.bitterness. I prefer to be bitter on alt.angst, but my wife now lurks there 
. . . Yeah, this one's gonna be bitter. Flame me to hell and back if I don't 
follow local rules; I don't care. But bitterness you'll get. Why am I bitter? 
First, it's none of your business. I don't care anything about you." 
</P>
<P>
 It was signed Happy Holidays. The Schadenfreude high I always get from 
visiting alt.bitterness was dampened this time around by the posting of one 
"brianbitterly," who wrote of finding "a new group that I like quite a bit, 
alt.suicide.holiday . . . it's about how nice it would be to die. The group's 
long on technology, with some 'I want to die!,' 'You shouldn't!,' etc., etc., 
threads." 
</P>
<P>
 I went over there, and he was right; there was even "the semi-famous 
alt.suicide.holiday Methods File." By now my mood was so bad that I ftp'd over 
to ftp.mantis.co.uk (pub/alt.angst), where I downloaded a perpetual calendar of 
angst. Its academic orientation makes it an especially suitable present for any 
despairing and underemployed instructor on your Christmas list. The message for 
Dec. 11, for example, concludes: "I would not mind dying tomorrow. What I fear 
is living out my life always finding it just barely tolerable enough to go on, 
such that in the end I will never have been happy." 
</P>
<P>
 I decided that maybe I'd better get help, so I messaged joe@samaritans.org, 
complaining that I always feel even more alienated than usual during the month 
approaching Christmas, "especially here in the Sunbelt, what with the 
remorseless sunshine and all. This year I find my thoughts increasingly 
occupied by death." 
</P>
<P>
 The Samaritans, based in England, say their e-mail is read and answered daily 
by a group of trained volunteers using the pseudonym Jo. Sure enough, they 
messaged back: 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello, Daniel 
</P>
<P>
 Glad you made contact. Do you know why you feel alienated? I can see that 
constant sunshine can be a problem, although its not one that we are familiar 
with here! 
</P>
<P>
 Does your preoccupation with death mean that you are suicidal? 
</P>
<P>
 I hope you will write again and tell me some more about your feelings and what 
you think may be causing your unhappiness. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, take care and remember we are always here for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo" 
</P>
<P>
 Wow, I thought guiltily, cheered that such good people live in the world and 
sheepish that I'd tested them with a complaint about sunshine. It struck me 
that the Samaritans and their project exemplify much of what is best about the 
Internet. But then again, I thought, so does alt.bitterness.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; FORUM; READERS VOICE 
BEEFS WITH BUGS IN PC SOFTWARE, HARDWARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week, The Cutting Edge asked readers for their views on the problem of 
bugs in PC hardware and software products. Specifically, we asked whether 
readers felt the PC industry did a worse job than other industries in 
maintaining quality, and what the industry might do better. 
</P>
<P>
 The query drew dozens of comments, with many people relating stories of 
frustration with PC products: Poor technical support was a particularly common 
complaint. Below are excerpts from a some of the responses we received: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The computer industry is definitely guilty-as-charged when it comes to selling 
products with known defects. One thing that would enhance its respectability in 
this regard: Use the registered user databases to actually communicate with 
users! 
</P>
<P>
 There hasn't been a single computer product, hardware or software, that I've 
used in 15 years of computer experience that has not come with a registration 
card and an admonishment to "Register now! Registering entitles you to 
notifications of product updates, etc., blah blah blah." Usually these are 
merely market research surveys and mailing list builders disguised as bona fide 
support tools. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer product manufacturers should use this database to notify users of 
known product problems. Why is it that every user has to discover these 
problems on their own, either through word of mouth or bad experience?  
</P>
<P>
 TODD RUSTON 
</P>
<P>
 Pomona 
</P>
<P>
 It appears that the emphasis on quality control isn't the same for each 
company. Maybe standardizing quality control (through standards organizations 
such as ANSI and VESA) could help filter out some of the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 If a company believes in their product, they should offer a "10- or 30-day 
customer satisfaction guarantee or your money back." 
</P>
<P>
 DEAN MENES 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme 
</P>
<P>
 One of the great contributions the software industry could make would be to 
adopt a standard practice on support phone calls, such as "first five minutes 
free, after that we charge by bug category." Suggested categories: Stupid 
mistakes we made. Stupid mistakes you made. Stupid mistakes in the operating 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 HUGH WAHLIN 
</P>
<P>
 Covina 
</P>
<P>
 The PC industry does a much better job of producing quality, cost-effective 
products than almost all other industries in this country. I'm afraid that if 
the industry were forced to produce bug-free products, the pace of hardware and 
software innovation would slow to a crawl. I'm not willing to pay that price. 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT W. DUCKSON 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of observations after years of working in quality assurance: 
</P>
<P>
 * A secondhand source at Intel responded to a co-worker's question about the 
Pentium problems. He said: "What's the problem? The 486 had hundreds of defects 
and so does the Pentium." Past indifference to product quality is used to 
justify present indifference rather than confronting the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * If the automotive industry were run as the computer industry is, then most 
new model cars would have the wheels fall off driving from the showroom, at 
which point the car maker would issue an new car with secure wheels but with 
brakes that malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
 JEFFREY CONTOMPASIS 
</P>
<P>
 Placentia 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who purchases a personal computer as a right to expect it software to 
function properly. All too often, however, it does not, prompting numerous 
back-and-forth phone calls to hardware and software manufacturers to correct 
problems.  
</P>
<P>
 I suggest that the computer and software manufacturers continue to work toward 
universal standards in the design of computer equipment and production of PC 
software, especially multimedia titles. For instance, is it too much to ask 
that the software industry to develop a standardized installation (or "setup") 
program which is the same for all multimedia titles running under Windows?

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; APPLE'S PIPPIN PLAYS 
VIDEO GAMES, PLUGS INTO TV SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Apple Computer Inc. announced here Tuesday an effort to expand the multimedia 
market with a device that purports to straddle the gap between the video game 
player and the personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
 The new device, called Pippin, is a trimmed-down Apple Macintosh computer: it 
will use a modified version of the Macintosh's Mac OS software and the new 
PowerPC microprocessor and will plug into a television set. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, at least, Apple will not build the Pippin, but will license it 
freely to other electronics makers. The first licensee, named Tuesday, is 
Japanese toy manufacturer Bandai Co. Ltd., a major publisher of CD-ROM software 
and creator of the "Power Rangers" action toys. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bandai's Power Player version will sell for about $500 when it is introduced 
in stores worldwide late next year, Bandai President Makato Yamashina said. 
Bandai also is to design Pippin-compatible software for educational, 
entertainment and information purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the simplest level the Pippin will serve as a video game machine or player 
of CD-ROM videos and music, but it will be possible to upgrade it by adding a 
keyboard, floppy or hard disk drive, modem and additional software. With the 
additions it would be capable of word-processing or communications functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Bandai is aiming for annual sales of at least 500,000 machines, Yamashina 
said. The Power Player will compete with powerful new game machines from Sega 
Enterprises Ltd., Sony Corp. and 3DO at one end of the scale, and with personal 
computers with CD-ROM drives at the other end. 
</P>
<P>
 Satjiv Chahil, vice president of Apple's New Media Group, predicted the Pippin 
will be the forerunner of multimedia equipment capable of bringing text, video 
and audio into millions of households that have held back from buying personal 
computers because of their cost or complexity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This technology has been restricted so far to people who are familiar with 
the personal computer," Chahil said, "(but) when you introduce a product like 
this, it is totally unintimidating. You attach it to your TV the same way you 
attach your VCR, and all of a sudden, you're in the world of multimedia and the 
computer -- but you don't know it. It's easier to use than your VCR. There are 
a few buttons, which (let) you navigate."

AMERICAN EAGLE PLANE CRASHES IN N.C.; 10 KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An American Eagle commuter plane carrying 19 people to Raleigh-Durham 
International Airport crashed about four miles southwest of the airport 
Tuesday, killing at least 10 people. At least six people survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight 3379 was en route from Greensboro, N.C., to Raleigh-Durham when it 
crashed in foggy, rainy weather about 6:40 p.m. EST. It was the second crash of 
an American Eagle plane in less than two months and the second American Eagle 
crash at Raleigh-Durham. The plane was not one of the ATR aircraft that were 
recently grounded because of icing concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're told it is down four miles southwest of Raleigh-Durham," said Don 
Bedwell, a spokesman for American Airlines, American Eagle's parent airline. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen passengers and three crew members were aboard the Jetstream Super 31 
turboprop, said Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen. 
</P>
<P>
 At least six survivors were taken to hospitals, and rescuers were searching 
for other possible survivors late Tuesday, said airport spokeswoman Teresa 
Damiano. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina State Police spokesman Greg Whitehouse confirmed that 10 people 
had died. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the survivors were taken to Rex Hospital in Raleigh and another four 
were taken to University of North Carolina hospitals. Their conditions were not 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was on approach to the airport in 37-degree weather when it went 
down in a rugged, wooded residential area just outside the small town of 
Morrisville, between Raleigh and Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 It broke into two large pieces, with wreckage scattered over a 500-foot area, 
Damiano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the rain and the rugged terrain, rescuers had to use four-wheel 
drive vehicles to get to the area, said fire marshal spokesman Chris Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board were en route to 
the crash site Tuesday night, Damiano said. 
</P>
<P>
 American Eagle grounded all 41 of its ATR commuter airplanes at Chicago-O'Hare 
International Airport on Saturday, a day after the government banned the 
turboprop from flying in icy weather, and began shifting the planes to service 
in warm-weather areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice forming on the wings has been suspected in the Oct. 31 crash of an 
American Eagle ATR-72 in Roselawn, Ind. The official cause of that crash, which 
killed all 68 people aboard, is still to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the ATR groundings, American Eagle on Tuesday ferried the first 
of several Saab aircraft to O'Hare to resume service later in the week to major 
Midwestern cities from Chicago. The airline also announced the permanent 
shutdown by January of its Raleigh-Durham hub. 
</P>
<P>
 The hub has struggled financially in recent months. American Eagle employs 778 
people at Raleigh-Durham airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the October crash in Indiana, American Eagle flights have been 
involved in at least three other fatal crashes in the past seven years: 
</P>
<P>
 * On June 7, 1992, all five people aboard were killed when an American Eagle 
plane crashed during a heavy rainstorm into a swamp at Mayaguez, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Feb. 19, 1988, all 12 people aboard were killed when an AVAir commuter 
plane, flying as American Eagle Flight 3378, crashed in a wooded area about a 
mile from the runway after departing in dense fog from Raleigh-Durham airport. 
</P>
<P>
 * On May 8, 1987, the pilot and co-pilot were killed when an American Eagle 
commuter plane crashed and burned at Mayaguez. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 7, a Jetstream 41 crashed near Columbus, Ohio, killing five people. 
The NTSB ruled that pilot error, unfamiliarity with a new type of plane and 
inadequate training were the probable causes of that crash. 
</P>
<P>
 As of June, American Eagle had 60 of the British Aerospace-built Jetstream 
Super 31s in its fleet of 279 planes. 
</P>
<P>
 The commuter carrier's smallest plane, the two-engine Jetstream seats 19 
people and has a 52-foot wingspan. This type of plane began service at American 
Eagle in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four carriers that operate under the American Eagle name, only Wings 
West, based in Los Angeles, and Flagship Airlines fly Jetstream Super 31s. 
Raleigh-Durham is one of Flagship's hubs.

<P>
 A Chinese court sentenced five people, including two firefighters and a Hong 
Kong businessman, to prison Tuesday in connection with a toy factory fire a 
year ago that killed 87 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The November, 1993, blaze at the Zhili Handicraft Factory was the third in 
four months in or near Shenzhen, a Chinese boom town bordering Hong Kong, 
pointing to neglect of industrial safety as China rushes for economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentences ranged from two to 17 years.

MAX BILL, 85; CONTROVERSIAL SWISS ARTIST, SCULPTOR AND WRITER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Max Bill, the controversial Swiss artist, sculptor and former politician, has 
died of a heart attack. He was 85. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill, who was also an architect and writer, suffered a heart attack Friday at 
Berlin's airport as he was waiting for a flight to Zurich.He died en route to 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1927 to 1929, Bill was at Germany's famous Bauhaus school of architecture 
and applied arts, where he was influenced by the work of Paul Klee and Wassily 
Kandinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Described by the New York-based Art News magazine in 1989 as the "leading 
light" of the Concrete and Constructivist art movements, Bill applied what he 
called a "mathematical" approach to art. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Museum of Art exhibited a retrospective of Bill's 
paintings and sculptures in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 No stranger to controversy, Bill caused an uproar in Zurich in 1988 when he 
refused to attend a party the city threw to celebrate his 80th birthday. He 
said he was irritated by the fuss and felt special exhibitions organized by 
local museums to show his work were unrepresentative. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill was also involved in politics. He was elected to the Zurich municipal 
council in 1961 and was a Federal Parliament deputy from 1967 to 1971 as a 
member of the Independent Landesring Party. 
</P>
<P>
 He is survived by his second wife, Angela, and a son, Jakob.

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Madame Alix Gres, who discreetly reigned for 50 years as one of the great 
French fashion designers, uncharacteristically made news Tuesday when her death 
was disclosed 13 months after it occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 She died on Nov. 24, 1993, at a nursing home in southern France.She was 90. 
Her death was concealed by her daughter, Anne Gres, who said she acted "out of 
love" for her mother and out of resentment toward a fashion industry that she 
felt had neglected one of its greatest creators. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper Le Monde disclosed the death Tuesday, and municipal authorities 
in Paris subsequently confirmed it. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Germaine Krebs in Paris, the designer was known to the fashion world as 
Madame Gres. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1937, she started a shop with a partner and called the shop and herself 
Alix. After World War II, she set up a couture salon alone as Madame Gres. 
</P>
<P>
 She was highly respected for draping her favorite fabrics of jersey, silk and 
wool into fashions that resembled ancient Greek sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 An ardent champion of haute couture, she was president for many years of the 
Federation Francaise de la Couture, the powerful fashion syndicate. 
</P>
<P>
 She designed frequently for the theater and films, and was known for attending 
big fashion parties wearing her trademark turban. 
</P>
<P>
 Madame Gres developed a line of men's accessories in 1957, launched a perfume 
company in 1959 and custom-designed jewelry for Cartier in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fashion house was bought by businessman Bernard Tapie in the 1980s and now 
belongs to the Japanese group Yagu Tsusho.

ALYCE (LISA) WILLIAMSON; ARTIST ACCOMPLISHED IN MANY MEDIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alyce Marie (Lisa) Williamson, the great-great-granddaughter of Times founder 
Harrison Gray Otis, has died at the age of 34. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Williamson died Sunday at her home in Pasadena, said her mother, Alyce 
Williamson, after "a courageous 21-month battle" against breast cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 An artist in many media, Miss Williamson was identified early as a gifted 
child who began painting at the age of 3. As she grew up, she mastered fine 
line drawings, lithographs, ceramics and pottery as well as oil painting. 
</P>
<P>
 A private person, Miss Williamson resisted suggestions by her family and 
admirers that she stage any retrospective exhibitions of her work. Most of her 
art, with a special emphasis on animals and botanically precise renderings of 
plants, is in private collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Williamson, an ardent environmentalist, also grew prize-winning orchids 
at the family's St. Malo Beach home in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Los Angeles, Miss Williamson was educated at Polytechnic School in 
Pasadena and at UC Santa Barbara, where she studied art. 
</P>
<P>
 She made her bow with her father, Warren Williamson, at Las Madrinas, the 
Pasadena Guild of Children's Hospital and the Valley Hunt Club debutante balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Williamson is survived by her parents, Warren and Alyce Williamson; two 
sisters, Sandra Fallat, of San Anselmo, and Dr. Ruth Chandler Williamson, of 
Pasadena; one brother, Henry de Roulet Williamson, of South Pasadena, and two 
nieces and two nephews. 
</P>
<P>
 Private services for the family and close friends will be conducted today. The 
family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the USC-Norris Cancer 
Center, 1420 San Pablo, C-100, Los Angeles, Calif. 90033.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Librarians, city officials and business operators are holding a public forum 
Jan. 12 to explore ways to finance new libraries and make existing libraries 
more self-sufficient in response to declines in funding. 
</P>
<P>
 State Librarian Kevin Starr will provide an overview of the future, current 
entrepreneurial library experiments and today's social and economic problems 
facing libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Forum for Entrepreneurial Libraries" will take place at the Embassy 
Suites Hotel, 900 E. Birch St., from 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideas to be discussed will include using libraries in shopping centers and 
offering conference areas, business services and determining how libraries can 
capitalize on urban redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 A library technology exhibit will be displayed and brainstorming sessions will 
take place as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, a case study on how a San Francisco library generated $30 million 
through philanthropy will be presented. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the event predict the demise of libraries without creative 
innovations to generate operating funds to save them. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is open to the public. Cost to register is $35 before Dec. 30 and 
$50 after that date.

 Trees and computers: they go together in Irvine. The Public Works Department 
keeps a detailed computer record of each of the city's 38,000 trees, including 
when each tree was last trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
 During fiscal 1994-95, the city will trim 4,658 trees in the villages of 
University Park, Turtle Rock, California Homes and the Ranch. Some 1,446 
eucalyptus trees, planted to form windrows in the city, will also be trimmed in 
the villages of El Camino Real and Woodbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 As the number of trees increases in the 23-year-old city, tree counters in the 
Public Works Department have found it cumbersome to keep track of them on the 
city's mainframe computer. They're currently downloading all tree records into 
a PC-based system. Today

 The Orange Coast College Wind Ensemble and Concert Choir will perform holiday 
and classical favorites at 6:30 p.m. in the Rotated Square at John Wayne 
Airport. The square is on the airport's upper level in front of the Orange 
Grill restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is free to this third annual concert. 
</P>

 The wind ensemble is directed by Dana Wheaton, and the choir is directed by 
Charlie Clark.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CENTRAL; GARDEN GROVE; YES, THERE IS A SANTA -- FOR RENT

<P>
 Santa will make house calls this Christmas season -- for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Services Department will be offering the Santa visits to 
residents.A 15-minute visit from the rotund man in the red suit will cost $20. 
For 30 minutes, the charge will be $30. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa will be available from 6 to 9 p.m. on weekdays and from noon to 9:30 
p.m. Saturdays and Sundays starting this Saturday through Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials insist they have not put Santa to work to make money. Garden 
Grove is one of only two Orange County cities that have not invested in the 
troubled county investment pool. There's no urgency for a fast buck; the fee is 
simply to recover the cost of the service, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 To reserve a visit from Santa, contact the city's recreation office at 11391 
Acacia Parkway or call (714) 741-5200. BERT ELJERA

<P>
 Security Environmental Systems Inc. said Tuesday it does not expect to file 
its most recent annual and quarterly reports with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission until early in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also said it will report a "sizable loss" for the fiscal year 
ended June 30 as well as a loss for the first quarter of its current fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In a press release, the Huntington Beach-based company tied the reporting 
delay to an ongoing review by its independent auditors. 
</P>
<P>
 Security Environmental also announced several management changes. Jess Turner 
was appointed chairman, succeeding Alfred Grossman, who was removed as chairman 
of the board on Oct. 10. John Wheeler, chief operating officer, was also 
appointed to the board. Ellen L. Batzel was appointed chief executive officer 
of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are working with our auditors to locate and supply information and 
documentation," Batzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Security Environmental, founded in 1972, offers waste management, remediation 
and transportation services to government and industrial generators of waste.

INVESTMENT TRUST PUTS OFF REFINANCING; BONDS: IRVINE APARTMENT COMMUNITIES IS 
UNABLE TO PROCEED BECAUSE OF O.C.'S BANKRUPTCY FILING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Irvine Apartment Communities Inc. said Tuesday that it has shelved plans to 
refinance $327.3 million of its tax-exempt bonds until it can determine how 
Orange County's bankruptcy filing will affect the area's real estate industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds for the refinancing normally would be issued by Orange County, but "you 
can't do a refinancing when the issuer is in bankruptcy," said Richard Moran, 
chief financial officer of Irvine Apartment Communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The real estate investment trust, based in Newport Beach, was in refinancing 
talks Dec. 6, the day Orange County filed for protection under Chapter 9 of the 
U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Although the company stands by its statement last week 
that it will not be affected in the long run by the county's situation, Moran 
said, it put off the refinancing because now "is just not the right time to 
consider it." 
</P>
<P>
 Moran said that about two-thirds of the bonds were issued by Orange County but 
are backed not by the county but by letters of credit from banks and some of 
the company's apartment properties. That means the debt isn't tied directly to 
the county's finances, Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company wants to refinance eventually, Moran said, to lengthen the 
maturity of the debt as a hedge against any further interest-rate rises. There 
is no rush, he said, because the bulk of the bonds do not mature until 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days following the county's bankruptcy filing, Irvine Apartment 
Communities' stock was among those hit hardest by the news, sinking to a 
52-week low of $14.73 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the company set out to calm Wall Street's fears about its ability 
to keep up the pace of its apartment development by releasing a statement 
saying that the bankruptcy would not have a significant effect on the company 
or its projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock regained ground through Monday but fell 38 cents Tuesday to close at 
$15.75 a share in heavy trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Apartment Communities was spun off earlier this year from the Irvine 
Co., the county's largest real estate company. It has the exclusive right to 
develop apartment communities for 15 years on the Irvine Ranch, which 
encompasses more than a sixth of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The company now owns 43 apartment complexes containing a total of 11,300 units 
on the ranch.

WHEN THE HOLIDAY HAS MORE RED THAN GREEN; SPENDING: THE KEY TO MANAGING CREDIT 
IS KNOWING HOW MUCH DEBT YOU CAN REASONABLY CARRY -- AND WHAT TO DO IF YOU GET 
IN OVER YOUR HEAD.

 In the next few weeks, after the gifts have been opened, the tree taken down 
and party decorations packed away, some less cheery reminders of Christmas will 
linger as holiday bills arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Free spenders may find themselves unable to handle their mounting debts. But 
financial experts warn that falling behind with payments can be expensive and 
jeopardize future borrowing plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's a rare occurrence, it probably won't be a problem, but if a pattern 
develops, it's likely to be reflected (negatively) on your credit report," said 
Jonathan Pond, a Boston-based financial consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Pond and other financial advisers recommend that people with financial 
hangovers first concentrate on getting household expenses paid in a timely 
manner, especially the mortgage or rent, before trying to wipe out credit card 
balances. These consumers must also avoid taking on new debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're playing this game, it's also probably better to be delinquent on 
those loans that don't report to the credit bureaus," Pond said. Some 
utilities, for example, might not report to credit bureaus, although they could 
eventually suspend services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key recommendation here is to make the minimum payment on credit card 
bills, even as repugnant as I hope that is to people," he said. "That's one of 
the flexibilities of credit cards. If you run short, you can make the minimum, 
but realize . . . you're buying time at a great expense." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not known how many debtors will end up on this financial treadmill. About 
two-thirds of all cardholders do carry a balance each month, while 2.56% have 
delinquent accounts, the American Bankers Assn. said. 
</P>
<P>
 The general rule of thumb among banks and other creditors is that total 
indebtedness per household should not exceed 36% of take-home pay each month, 
according to Robert Fazzini, president of commercial lending at Busey Bank in 
Bloomington, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Fazzini said individuals who run into financial difficulties should contact 
their creditors immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most bankers appreciate it if you're going to be late with payments to call 
and tell them and explain why," he said. "What we don't like is not knowing." 
</P>
<P>
 So, when is a payment treated as late? "Banks don't usually consider a payment 
late until it's a week behind," Fazzini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers say they make that determination based on when a check is received, 
not when the mailed payment is postmarked. 
</P>
<P>
 Fazzini said many banks are willing to overlook one late payment provided all 
others throughout the year were on time. Late customers are often contacted 
around two weeks following one missed payment; the credit reporting agencies 
that keep track of all individuals' credit histories are contacted after 30 
days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your credit report is like a little shadow that follows you. If it notes you 
were late in payments, that tells (future) creditors you were a reluctant 
payer, and thus, would be a bad credit risk," said Beverly Tuttle, president of 
Consumer Credit Counseling Service of Connecticut.

'HOOKED ON PHONICS,' FTC REACH ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County-based producers of "Hooked on Phonics," a program designed 
to help people learn to read, have reached agreement with the Federal Trade 
Commission to settle charges of misleading advertising, "Dateline NBC" reported 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The FTC scheduled a news conference today to announce the charges against 
Gateway Educational Products in Orange, which owns "Hooked on Phonics," and the 
settlement of those charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the consent decree, the company does not admit wrongdoing but can no 
longer make claims it can't prove. If it does, it could be fined up to $10,000 
per ad, NBC said. 
</P>
<P>
 FTC spokeswoman Bonnie Jansen refused to comment on the charges Tuesday night, 
citing an agreement with the company that neither side would comment until 
Wednesday. Calls to the company late Tuesday were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian White, head of the FTC consumer division, said on NBC that the 
evidence submitted by the company did not support the claim made in the "Hooked 
on Phonics" commercials, "that the product was quick and easy to use and would 
address reading and comprehension problems in many difficult instances, 
including individuals with learning disorders." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the information the company had about its products did not 
support the claim that the typical 6-year-old child could learn to read from 
the "Hooked on Phonics" program, which cost about $230 and consists of 
workbooks, flash cards, reading booklets and a set of eight cassette tapes of 
phonics lessons.

BILL GEIST HAS A SPECIAL 'EYE' FOR THE OUTRE; ENTREPRENEURS: RED-HAIRED TV HOST 
AND AUTHOR, AN ASTUTE OBSERVER OF BUSINESS TRENDS, SPREADS MESSAGE THAT THERE 
IS WISDOM IN THE WEIRD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's said that behind every joke and funny story there's a ring of truth. And 
so it is with Bill Geist. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Geist is known to viewers of the CBS programs "Sunday Morning" and "Eye to 
Eye" for his red hair, wry humor and knack for finding the oddball and 
outrageous things that people do, like pose for romance novel covers or go to 
the U.S. Tennis Open and drop $500 on food, clothes and souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also, perhaps unconsciously, an astute observer of business trends. 
Several years ago, he was ahead of the pack in uncovering the espresso and 
caffe latte boom in Seattle that's now spread across the country. In his fourth 
book, "Monster Trucks & Hair-in-a-Can," a compilation of stories about people 
in strange businesses, he unwittingly uncovers principles that any would-be 
entrepreneur would want to know. 
</P>
<P>
 The message: There is wisdom in the weird. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Geist's stories is about Jim Reid, who dove into a water hazard on a 
Florida golf course one day and came out with 2,000 golf balls. Reid quit his 
$250-a-week job at Disney World and started a million-dollar company that 
recovers, washes and sells used balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Rick Clunn, an erstwhile systems analyst at Exxon who became a 
bass fisherman and made $1.5 million in prize money on the pro fishing tour. 
</P>
<P>
 And Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, who made millions from doodles of four 
reptiles that turned into the Teen-Age Mutant Ninja Turtles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the people Geist profiles have jobs or own companies that might seem 
offbeat or inconsequential. A closer look shows some of the entrepreneurs have 
as much business acumen as the CEO of a Fortune 500 firm. 
</P>
<P>
 In a piece about nail salons (including one in Dallas with 68 manicurists 
caring for 1,500 people a week), Geist talked to Kym Lee, a nail technician 
(not manicurist) and nail products marketer, who reveals the secret of success 
in her business -- just listening to clients as they unburden themselves while 
having their nails done. 
</P>
<P>
 "They sit down, relax and tell us everything that's happened to them since 
they were 3 years old," she told Geist. And we thought nail salons made money 
by just filing, buffing and applying polish. 
</P>
<P>
 Geist also tells of a miniature golf course operator in Myrtle Beach, S.C., 
who knows his business so well he can tell you to the second how often people 
tee off and how many sodas they buy. His computer helps him keep track. 
</P>
<P>
 Geist's entrepreneurs have succeeded by keeping their eyes open and going for 
the unusual (actually, that's also how Geist put his book together). 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Calvert figured out that Chestnut, Ill., is the geographical center of 
the state and decided to turn the town into a tourist attraction. The general 
store in town is now selling T-shirts, bumper stickers, pins, mugs and caps. 
</P>
<P>
 The author observes: "It's the perfect industry for the '90s: Doesn't make a 
thing but money. All you have to do is think up some reason -- just about any 
old reason will do -- to attract people to your town." 
</P>
<P>
 As the book title suggests, Geist's subjects also include Bob Chandler, who 
became a millionaire after putting oversized tires on a truck, crushing a car 
and then doing it at a tractor pull. Monster truck shows were born. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of facetious," Geist said in a recent interview. But "monster 
trucks create jobs -- new jobs that were never there before." 
</P>
<P>
 Geist noted that many of these business people found their niche in the 
growing entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these people in this book do not manufacture or make anything that 
you would call socially redeeming or necessary products," he said. They're 
trying to "make the best of what's around today and bring an element of 
individuality to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Geist even sees his own place in this new age. 
</P>
<P>
 In an essay in which he kids himself for flying cross-country to interview 
"Entertainment Tonight" host Mary Hart about her legs, Geist notes, "It's not 
just the occupations that are changing in the '90s, it's the jobs themselves." 
Instead of writing down what the mayor has to say, reporters are now trying to 
find out what actress Shannen Doherty had for lunch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Geist, 46, grew up in Champaign, Ill., and went to the University of Illinois 
there. After serving as a combat photographer in Vietnam, he attended the 
University of Missouri's graduate journalism school. 
</P>
<P>
 Then for "eight long years," he worked on the suburban section of the Chicago 
Tribune. Tiring of that, he applied to several big newspapers including The New 
York Times, which was intrigued by his stories about things like garage door 
art contests. He went to the Times in 1980, writing first about the suburbs and 
then about off-beat subjects in the "About New York" column. Seven years ago he 
moved to CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "Monster Trucks & Hair-in-a-Can" is Geist's third compilation of tales. His 
last book, "Little League Confidential," dealt with his career as a Little 
League coach in Ridgewood, N.J., where he lives with his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Geist's cramped office at the CBS Broadcast Center is exactly what you'd 
expect from someone who spends his time ferreting out the weird. An Elvis doll 
and Popeye sculpture, sent by public relations people hoping for a plug, rest 
in unopened packages, one on a shelf, the other nestled among packing boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Laughing, he showed off mementos -- a Christmas fruitcake from a report four 
years ago and a metal plate from a story marking the 40th anniversary of the TV 
dinner ("That's a historic artifact. The Smithsonian has one.") 
</P>
<P>
 Geist said during the interview he often starts out poking fun at his 
subjects, only to end up liking and even admiring them, often because they have 
the guts to strike out on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 While he didn't set out to write a book of sage business advice, he 
acknowledged that some wisdom may find its way into his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some things I do are are just funny. but I think the ones I like to do the 
best -- writing the 'About New York' column -- there was always a little bit 
more to it than that . . . something to think about."

O.C. MUSIC; TRADING INVESTMENTS FOR THE BATON; EX-BANKER RICHARD WESTERFIELD 
WILL LEAD PACIFIC SYMPHONY IN 'MESSIAH' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Westerfield has bartered cigarettes for chickens in Romania and has 
worked at a major investment banking firm in New York, helping Latin American 
countries gain access to capital. Not your average background for a conductor. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in New York City in 1957, Westerfield -- who will conduct the Pacific 
Symphony in Handel's "Messiah" in Costa Mesa on Saturday -- grew up in a family 
that had little interest in serious music. But he did, and he pursued it. The 
turning point in his life came when he was 17: He was singing the Celebrant in 
his high school's production of Leonard Bernstein's Mass, and since it was the 
first non-professional production of the work, the conductor came. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met Lenny then," Westerfield recalled on the phone recently. "I really got 
turned on to conducting." A formal student-teacher relationship didn't develop 
until years later -- 1985 -- when Westerfield spent a summer in Tanglewood, 
Mass., at the invitation of Boston Symphony conductor Seiji Ozawa, who had 
noticed him at a conducting competition in Tokyo. At Tanglewood, Westerfield 
renewed his acquaintance with Bernstein and met Carl St.Clair, the future music 
director of the Pacific Symphony. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, his degrees and honors were mounting. He won a Fulbright to 
work with Mircea Cristescu at the Bucharest Philharmonic. ("It was easy to get 
a Fulbright" to go there, Westerfield says. "No one wants to go to Romania.") 
</P>
<P>
 Just before going abroad, he met his future wife, Helen, who was studying 
German before leaving for Stuttgart to study choral conducting with Hemuth 
Rilling. Westerfield "signed up for the same program and spent the summer in 
Stuttgart. Then I went up to Bucharest. We met whenever we could in Vienna. I 
took the Orient Express. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds romantic but the train is overrated. . . . There was no toilet 
paper, for instance, and no heat." 
</P>
<P>
 He spent two years in Bucharest, getting "great freedom to have to fend for 
myself." That's where he learned to trade cigarettes for chickens. "I would 
wait in block-long lines (to buy food) and there would be nothing. It was 
completely impossible. But being a Fulbright scholar, I had access to the 
diplomat store. I could buy cigarettes and soap there, and trade those for a 
chicken in a bag. It would still have its feathers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Romanians never believed I was a conductor anyway," he added. "They 
thought I was a spy. I was followed; my room was miked. I would always go to a 
park to talk about things. But I felt such a feeling of privilege when a 
Romanian family invited me into their home. We would talk. They had nothing -- 
no concept of a supermarket, of being free and speaking your mind." 
</P>
<P>
 When he got back to the States, he found "no one willing to offer me a 
conducting job with Romanian credentials. So I went back to Yale to study with 
Otto Werner Mueller, the best conducting teacher in the country. He basically 
tore me apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Mueller was very strict. "You had to do it just this way," Westerfield said. 
"His real strengths were in analyzing the score. He had a great understanding 
of form, of classical architecture. No question but that I learned so much from 
him. But the notion that there is only one way to go with any one musical 
phrase -- it's almost a crushing kind of dogmatism." 
</P>
<P>
 So Westerfield ricocheted between "Bernstein and Seiji in the summertime and 
Otto Werner Mueller in the fall." He took a job at Brown University, teaching 
and conducting the university orchestra. "But I just wasn't growing. The most 
important thing for any artist is to be fresh, to have new ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I don't know what happened to me. My first child, Stephen, was born. I 
turned 30. I thought, 'What the heck, I'll take a break from this.' I applied 
to Dartmouth (School of Business Administration) and got a scholarship." 
</P>
<P>
 With a Masters of Business Administration degree, he went to work for J.P. 
Morgan and Co. on the very day his daughter Joanna was born. He stayed at the 
investment banking firm from 1990 until 1993. "I always had this weird ability 
with numbers. I think it's something that helps me do music. I have a 
photographic memory, I conduct from memory. At J.P. Morgan I could analyze 
things well. I could do the work and didn't have to pretend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would study my Mahler symphonies on the plane. People would poke fun at me. 
But a lot of people there can do weird things. It was really stimulating to be 
around people like that. It put hair on my chest, professionally. I learned to 
be responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 And the company was extremely accommodating. "They let me take leaves of 
absence to go conduct. But after a while, as I started to have more 
responsibility, I couldn't just waltz off and conduct. At about that time, I 
got this break with the New York Philharmonic, and the cat was out of the bag." 
</P>
<P>
 Erich Leinsdorf had to bow out of a concert because of a back injury. As a 
cover conductor for the orchestra, Westerfield had been sitting through several 
rehearsals and was ready to take over the remaining ones. Someone else could 
have been called in for the actual concert, but the orchestra committee went to 
management and expressed its confidence in Westerfield. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was so affirming to me," he remembers. "My nerves were gone. I felt 
great." He conducted Strauss' "Ein Heldenleben," Weber's "Preciosa" Overture 
and Britten's Nocturne. And then -- just like in the movies -- his phone 
started ringing, right? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I wish! But in the classical music world, orchestras are booked well in 
advance. So kind of nothing happened, at first. But it did get a lot of press. 
A lot of TV networks called. There were these stories about this banker at the 
Philharmonic. That was kind of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 He continues to work as one of the Philharmonic's cover conductors and guest 
conducts in the United States and Europe. "It can be very frustrating," he 
said. "By the time the concerts are over, you've finally proved yourself to the 
orchestra and they have proved themselves to you. Then it's on to the next 
place. But it's good experience, and every orchestra is different and really 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Westerfield will conduct the Pacific Symphony and the Pacific 
Chorale in Handel's "Messiah" Saturday at 3:30 p.m. at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. Soloists will 
include soprano Andrea Matthews, mezzo-soprano Melissa Thorburn, tenor Stanley 
Cornett and bass William Parcher. $15 to $35. (714) 556-2787.

'TO LIVE': A SWEEPING SAGE OF MODERN CHINA; POLITICS: BEIJING'S DECISION TO BAN 
THE FILM AND LIMIT MEDIA ACCESS TO ITS PRINCIPALS HAS CREATED PROBLEMS FOR THE 
MOVIE'S U.S. RELEASING COMPANY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD NATALE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Zhang Yimou's new film, "To Live," which opens today, has been banned in 
Zhang's native China, a situation that's become a thorn in the side of the 
Samuel Goldwyn Co., which is releasing the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldwyn bought the rights to release "To Live" in the United States when it 
was still in script form. Company Chairman Samuel Goldwyn Jr. had been 
impressed by Zhang's previous films such as "Ju Dou" and "Raise the Red 
Lantern," both of which were nominated for best foreign-language film. 
</P>
<P>
 An intimate epic about a family's survival, during and after the Chinese 
revolution, the film reminded Goldwyn of "Gone With the Wind"; to him, "To 
Live" was "positive" and life-affirming. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese government came to a different conclusion, however. Initially 
Zhang and the film's stars, Gong Li and Ge You, were allowed to leave the 
country to attend last May's Cannes Film Festival, where it won the Grand Jury 
Prize and the best actor award. When it came time for Zhang to speak about the 
film in Paris, though, he was told he was not allowed to do so, nor to attend 
the festival. Zhang returned home. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the about-face? "I think they did it to humiliate him," Goldwyn says.  
</P>
<P>
 Goldwyn says he's never been clear as to what exactly the Chinese government 
objects to in "To Live": "It had to have approval when it was filmed. Half the 
Chinese army is in this film." Also, he says, there is no criticism of the 
current regime and such past events as the Cultural Revolution have already 
been publicly discredited in China. 
</P>
<P>
 For five months Goldwyn has been trying to get Zhang as well as Gong Li and Ge 
You to the United States to help promote the film. "But every time I try to 
talk to someone, this curtain descends." The Chinese Film & Export Committee 
would not return The Times' repeated requests for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular Gong Li -- who according to a recent profile in the New Yorker is 
the seventh most recognized person in China (Zhang, with whom she lives, is 
sixth) -- had tentatively agreed to answer questions about the film by 
telephone but has since declined, citing her nervousness about the political 
situation, according to a Goldwyn spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not surprising, says Goldwyn. Even though she was allowed to attend the 
Cannes Festival, after Zhang was called home, Gong Li became very circumspect 
about media inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation since then has worsened. "To Live" has been barred from release 
in China and production on Zhang's "Triads," a gangster film, was recently shut 
down, says Goldwyn. The director was reportedly asked to make changes in the 
script, which is being financed by mainland Chinese sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Further complications arose when the Chinese government declined to submit "To 
Live" to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences in the best 
foreign-language-film category. To be eligible, a film must officially be 
submitted by the country of origin. China had previously submitted "Raise the 
Red Lantern" and then withdrawn its support. But once it was submitted, the 
academy stood firm and the film was nominated. (In a similar incident, Poland 
withdrew Andrzej Wajda's "Man of Iron" in 1981, but the academy nominated it 
anyway.) 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, "Strawberry and Chocolate," which is critical of the Cuban Communist 
government, has been submitted by that country as its official Oscar entry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese are pretending the film isn't there," says the academy's 
executive director, Bruce Davis. "It's caused some hand-wringing here," he 
admits. "There's not much we can do if a country clamps down on a film and 
refuses to submit it." 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is some Hong Kong money in the film, Goldwyn had been hoping to 
persuade Hong Kong to officially submit the film, as it had done last year with 
another banned Chinese film, Chen Kaige's "Farewell My Concubine." At first 
they agreed. "Then they backed down," says Goldwyn. "The pressure on them is 
enormous." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldwyn's only alternative is to submit the film in the general categories 
(best picture, etc.) "which would put us up against 'Forrest Gump,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
 While Davis agrees that few foreign-language films ever make the cut for best 
picture (Ingmar Bergman's "Cries and Whispers" in 1973 was the last), 
nominations in other categories (acting, directing, writing, technical awards) 
are less rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldwyn hasn't given up hope on the academy entirely. "I just wish they'd let 
me show it to their foreign film committee. They have no provision for films 
that are not submitted by a totalitarian government." 
</P>
<P>
 But to reverse itself, Davis says, the academy itself would have to draft the 
movie. "And to draft the movie would imply that we'd seen all the films made in 
China for the year and decided this was the best," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And Goldwyn hasn't given up on getting Zhang to the United States to talk 
about "To Live" and perhaps even to make a movie here. "The man is in a class 
with other world-class filmmakers, Bergman and Fellini. He is a genuine voice." 
</P>
<P>
 But, for now, a muffled one.

PALLADIUM SECURITY REFLECTS THE REALITY OF ROCK 'N' ROLL 
</P>

 Tracey Stahl dumped the contents of her purse onto a small table, as ordered 
by a uniformed security guard. The 28-year-old bartender from Ventura had 
already been through a body pat-down and was searched with a hand-held metal 
detector. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the guard was sifting through her belongings, looking for potential 
weapons among the items on a key chain and checking a small pump bottle of hair 
spray to make sure it wasn't Mace. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Stahl wasn't about to board a jet for a world trouble spot. She was merely 
going to a concert -- a recent Hollywood Palladium performance by the hot 
punk-rock band the Offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the search procedure at the Palladium is so slow that the line into 
the historic ballroom stretches far down Argyle Avenue. At a Hole concert last 
month, even some early arrivals were forced to wait so long that they missed 
the opening act. 
</P>
<P>
 This night, Stahl passed through the procedure quickly. But anyone in the 
capacity crowd of 3,800 who was in possession of anything deemed potentially 
harmful to either person or property -- from knives to bottle openers -- was 
forced to take it back to their car or toss it into a garbage can. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK," said Stahl after stuffing her belongings back into her purse. "I 
mean, I don't want anybody with guns going inside. There are a lot of weirdos 
around -- especially in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 That urban paranoia seemed to be carried by most fans coming to the show, who 
accepted the search as a necessary evil in a modern city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palladium security may be the most stringent in town for rock concerts, 
but that's largely because it has been the venue most associated with trouble 
in recent years. Indeed, the multiuse hall was closed down by the Los Angeles 
City Council in February, 1993, after a series of incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Since reopening two months later with tighter security provisions, trouble has 
been relatively infrequent. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 20 months, not one person has been hurt by anything brought in from the 
outside," said Alan Shuman, president of the historic Palladium, a onetime home 
to the top big bands and also the site over the years of shows by such major 
rock performers as the Rolling Stones, David Bowie and the Clash. "That's the 
first time it's been that way here in 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Police and neighborhood representatives confirm the improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing what is reasonable to control the problems they had," echoed 
Lt. Mark Savalla, the night watch commander for the LAPD's Hollywood Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The turnaround at the Palladium is being monitored by managers of other rock 
venues. The Downtown Variety Arts Center has just hired Dan Sullivan, who 
designed the security system for the Palladium, to supervise security for its 
rock shows, and the Universal Amphitheatre now searches fans at selected shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, which sometimes hosts alternative-rock 
shows, hires armed, off-duty police officers to handle crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're never going to see the days again when you can just go anywhere," said 
Sullivan, a retired LAPD deputy chief and owner of the Investigative Services 
Corporation. "Those days are gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the fans interviewed, a representative of Goldenvoice, a promotion firm 
that specializes in alternative-rock acts, sees the tight security as a 
necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best place in town for the kind of acts we do, so we're glad just 
to have it open," says Paul Tollett, co-owner of Goldenvoice, which produced 
the Offspring concert. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, the future of rock 'n' roll at the Palladium looked dim. 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of violent incidents and public disturbances at the ballroom, 
the Los Angeles City Council voted in February, 1993, to close the facility. 
Among the key problems: inadequate security. 
</P>
<P>
 Attention was first drawn to the Palladium's troubles in 1986 when fans unable 
to get tickets to a sold-out show by the Ramones broke windows in the 
neighborhood and clashed with police riot squads called to quell the 
disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, a gang fight disrupted a concert by the rap group U.T.F.O., 
leading Palladium management to cancel a Run-DMC show. Fights and stabbings 
plagued a variety of subsequent Palladium events. Neighborhood businessmen and 
residents also complained repeatedly of vandalism and rowdiness before and 
after concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 After the council's action, the facility seemed doomed. There was even a 
possibility it would be torn down to make way for a parking garage. But Shuman, 
a Los Angeles lobbyist, soon stepped in. He offered to refurbish the run-down 
ballroom and hired Sullivan to design a new security plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the Palladium, under Shuman's management, has hosted a variety of 
events, from Persian dances to boxing matches to punk-rock shows. The amount of 
security also varies, depending on the nature of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Rap concerts are prohibited, as are radical punk bands whose fans are 
skinheads -- the jack-booted contingent that has been associated with violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Shea, president of the Ivar Hill Neighborhood Assn., cheers the changes. 
"The difference is like night and day," says Shea, who credits the tighter 
security measure for an overall decrease of vandalism and other crimes in the 
area. "Today there are virtually no offenses to people and property occurring 
anywhere around the Palladium and very little inside." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though fans at the Offspring show seemed patient moving through the 
search lines, they were sometimes surprised by many of the items that were 
confiscated -- including fountain pens (they can be used as weapons) and gum. 
</P>
<P>
 Gum? 
</P>
<P>
 "We just spent a million dollars fixing up the place," explained Shuman. "You 
know how hard it is to get gum out of the carpet? We have a black-tie dinner 
here in three days, and we couldn't clean up the gum by then."

SCR'S GIFT OF THE 'MAGICA'; HOME OF THE PERENNIAL 'CHRISTMAS CAROL' PRESENTS A 
NEW TAKE ON THE HOLIDAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On South Coast Repertory's Mainstage, a 15-year tradition is again unfolding 
with this season's staging of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol." 
</P>
<P>
 But a few steps away, in the more intimate Second Stage, a different Christmas 
is about to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepherds, lighted candles, the strumming of guitars and a magnificent pinata 
amid a sea of lanterns and papel picado banners herald the arrival of "La 
Posada Magica." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on Las Posadas, the Latin American custom of going from home to home in 
search of shelter for Mary and Joseph, SCR's newest play, which opens tonight, 
is the company's attempt to show a different side of Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't think for a moment that this is your run-of-the-mill "let's find 
shelter and rejoice" Posadas celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, commissioned playwright Octavio Solis and composer Marcos Loya have 
used their childhood memories of Las Posadas to produce a thoroughly 
contemporary musical play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't really play on the religious aspect," said director Jose Cruz 
Gonzalez. "We play on the culture, the art, the music and the story. This piece 
has a lot of crossover. . . . It has all the elements of 'A Christmas Carol' 
but told in a different voice." 
</P>
<P>
 The voice is that of Graciela, a Latina teen who has suffered an enormous loss 
right before Christmas and is mad at herself, at life and at God. 
</P>
<P>
 When the posada comes to her door, she grudgingly decides to join. But when 
the procession mysteriously loses its way, the journey becomes one of renewal 
and self-discovery and the magic takes over. 
</P>
<P>
 "My plays deal with very, very dark themes," said playwright Solis, whose 
brooding "Man of the Flesh" also was produced by SCR. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'La Posada' was hard for me to write because I can't write a happy Christmas 
play. There's so little merriment (in Christmas), which I think is gratuitous, 
commercial and based on false themes of joy. I felt the need to write something 
for people who can't afford to buy presents, who find it difficult to be happy, 
who have to deal with very big things like poverty, disease and death." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, "La Posada" is no downer. This is, after all, a Christmas play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love its message," said Mexican actress Ruth Livier, who plays Gracie. 
"That if you're going through rough times, there is always another way. You 
just have to be receptive to the people around you . . . and this play is 
different because it has elements of Mexican folklore and Marcos Loya's music." 
</P>
<P>
 Loya conceived the music to "La Posada" as an integral part of the story, just 
as music is an essential element of any Posadas event. Thus, the play's three 
musicians (including Loya, who also is music director) are constantly onstage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a combination of styles," said guitarist Loya, who is known as a theater 
and film composer and who recently released his first solo jazz album. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've written it in the tradition of the Posadas and also added a couple of 
contemporary songs and folk pieces." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything about "La Posada" is a blend of old and new: an old tradition lived 
by a young girl (Gracie is 14); English dialogue peppered with Spanish phrases; 
a completely bilingual cast; a musical score where the Mexican requinto (the 
small guitar) joins forces with jazz- and pop-infused guitars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our objective was to create a piece the company and the community would be 
proud of," Gonzalez said. "My feeling is this piece will be performed across 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez has wanted to stage an original Latino Christmas play at SCR for more 
than 10 years, when he was still a graduate student at UC Irvine and obtained a 
directing fellowship at SCR. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez was one of the founders of SCR's prestigious Hispanic Playwrights 
Project, which he directs today and whose objective is to develop plays by 
Latino writers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've devoted my life to Hispanic theater," Gonzalez said. "We need literature 
and a body of work. . . . I can look up African American artists (in the 
library) and there's volumes of literature. But there are none of our stories 
there. We live in this country, but where are our stories?" 
</P>
<P>
 This is not say there are no other Latino Christmas plays. But the two 
standards -- Luis Valdez's "La Virgen del Tepeyac" and the traditional 
"Pastorelas" -- are both associated with El Teatro Campesino.  
</P>
<P>
 "So we decided to create our own," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis, Loya and Gonzalez had previously worked together in SCR's adaptation of 
Solis' "Man of the Flesh." With a $30,000 grant from the Lila Wallace-Reader's 
Digest Fund, Solis and Loya began working on "La Posada Magica" in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 When production time came around, the fund provided an additional $80,000 
which allowed ample rehearsal time needed for fine tuning. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before previews began last week, Solis was still making minute 
changes to the script. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gracie, you're our angelita, " said George Galvan, reading one of his lines 
as Josecruz. Said Solis: "No, that doesn't sound right. Try it in Spanish: 
'Gracie, eres nuestra angelita. ' " 
</P>
<P>
 Solis is not worried about non-Spanish speakers being unable to follow the 
dialogue. "It's a Latino play in English," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An eclectic playwright, Solis has not limited his work to the Latino 
experience, but credits people like Gonzalez with opening his eyes to Latino 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a wonderful rediscovery to write about characters like me. One of 
the fallacies people believe about Latino plays is that they're about gang 
members or farm workers," he said. "My characters are all middle-class people." 
</P>
<P>
 This premiere staging of "La Posada Magica" numbers 10 characters, between 
actors/singers and musicians. It's the minimum number of people the play can be 
done with, said Solis, who envisions making "La Posada Magica" an epic 
production with huge choruses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, it will play on SCR's Second Stage until Dec. 24. During its 
run, it also is being performed three times in area high schools, with proceeds 
going to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you how exciting (taking the play to the community) is for me," 
Gonzalez said. "We not only have to pass the torch down, but also the love and 
appreciation for what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 * "La Posada Magica" by Octavio Solis opens tonight on South Coast Repertory's 
Second Stage, 655 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. 7:30 p.m. Through Dec. 24. $15 
to $22. (714) 957-4033.

 HOW'S THEIR TIMING? Fate dealt a good hand to Cypress in the county's 
investment crisis. A report by Finance Director Richard Storey shows the city 
removed about a third of its $8.7 million in the investment pool a day before 
losses were revealed. . . . It wasn't the pool's health that bothered city 
officials.They just needed $2.9 million on Nov. 30 to pay city bills. "It was 
just because we needed the money," says Storey. 
</P>
<P>
 RUGGED & BROKE: With national attention focused on what USA Today calls 
"Orange County's blunder," the usual assessments of the county were inevitable. 
Cable News Network says you can expect something different from a county that 
names its airport after John Wayne: "Orange County is rugged, rich, and 
Republican." . . . Newsweek mentions the "palm-shaded battlefront." And U.S. 
News headlined: "Trouble in Paradise." 
</P>
<P>
 LEMONY MARKET? Joseph Wambaugh, who skewered the local elite in his 1990 novel 
"The Golden Orange," doesn't find the county crisis very funny. "I'm still 
trying to sell my house in Newport Beach. This is not helping a bit," jokes 
Wambaugh. . . . In five years, his Linda Isle home has gone down in price from 
$3.3 million to $1.29 million. . . . "That's bargain-basement time; now these 
clowns have to pull this," he says. "The Golden Orange is a lemon right now." 
</P>
<P>
 ELEPHANT WALK: If you like to keep track of local celebrities, check out the 
new movie "Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book." One of the stars is Tai, the 
elephant that's a regular at the Santa Ana Zoo for children's rides. . . . If 
you can't wait for the Christmas Day movie opening, the zoo hosts a screening 
($7) tonight at 7:30 at AMC/Main Place in Santa Ana.

 CRIME: It almost doesn't matter where you park your car in the Valley -- 
you're always taking a risk. Figures from a 1993 FBI report, above, show that 
motor vehicle theft can happen anywhere. . . . Today's Valley Briefing (B5) 
reviews local crime statistics in a number of categories. 
</P>
<P>
 ELECTION: The City Council seat left vacant when Zev Yaroslavsky joined the 
Board of Supervisors will be filled by an election, not by appointment (B1). . 
. . The council's action effectively kills a proposal by a coalition of Valley 
and Westside leaders to name an interim replacement. Said Joel Wachs: "Anyone 
who serves on the City Council voting for the people should be elected by the 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 RATING ENCINO: December's Los Angeles magazine rates 20 places to live in L.A. 
It says Encino has some strengths, but they're "overshadowed by a pathetic 
smattering of culture, arts and entertainment, low shopping convenience, an 
undesirable climate and surprisingly poor dining." Honorary Mayor Ronnie Schell 
fires back: "I didn't know L.A. magazine wrote fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 HARD TO PLEASE: The magazine also rips Van Nuys, describing it as " '50s 
housing tract meets prefab strip mall." . . . Don Schultz, president of the Van 
Nuys Homeowners Assn., doesn't exactly disagree. But he does blame the L.A. 
City Council and says "the magazine needed to point out whose fault it is that 
it became this way." . . . The magazine does have a few kind things to say 
about Burbank, Glendale and Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 THANKS LOVEY: Mrs. Howell, it seems after all, didn't leave her millions on 
"Gilligan's Island." Natalie Schafer, who played the rich castaway on the 
popular TV series, left $2 million to the Motion Picture and Television Fund in 
Woodland Hills (B2). . . . The donation made it possible for its hospital on 
Tuesday to open a renovated outpatient wing.

BOARD COULD VOTE TODAY ON WETLANDS DEVELOPMENT PLAN; BOLSA CHICA: PROPOSAL FOR 
AS MANY AS 3,300 HOMES IN SENSITIVE AREA IS PART OF RESTORATION COMPROMISE. 
LATEST VERSION OF PROJECT HAS DIVIDED ENVIRONMENTALISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The fate of the largest unprotected stretch of coastal marshland south of San 
Francisco may be decided today by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting during a special session scheduled for the purpose, the board is 
expected to take a brief respite from the financial crisis to consider, and 
possibly vote on, a long fought-over plan for the development of the Bolsa 
Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel confident that we're ready," said Tom Mathews, the county's planning 
director. "We appreciate the concerns that have been voiced and we are ready to 
make our recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
 Those recommendations include the construction of as many as 3,300 homes on 
1,600 acres of land in and around the ecologically sensitive area, which forms 
a natural habitat for dozens of species of fish, mammals and birds including 
some considered endangered. In exchange for permission to build the houses, the 
landowner -- Koll Real Estate Group -- has agreed to spend about $48 million to 
restore 950 acres of degraded wetlands, much of it now used for oil production, 
by, among other things, constructing a functioning tidal inlet connecting the 
marsh to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a milestone in a 24-year public planning process," Lucy Dunn, Koll 
senior vice president, said of today's meeting. "The process works in that 
development has been minimized and the environmental gains maximized." 
</P>
<P>
 That view doesn't sit well with some. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them is Connie Boardman, president of the Bolsa Chica Land Trust, an 
environmental group that has led opposition to the development.  
</P>
<P>
 "The land trust doesn't believe that Bolsa Chica is the appropriate site for 
3,300 homes," she said. "This is not the appropriate place for a small city; 
it's the last remnant of the way the coast of Southern California used to be 
and we would like to see it remain that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's discussion and possible vote by the supervisors has been a long time 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1970, when Signal Landmark, now a subsidiary of the Koll company, 
acquired the property, no fewer than 100 development plans for the 1,600-acre 
Bolsa Chica site have been prepared and discussed, according to Dunn. Only one 
of them, however, has previously made it as far as the supervisors' boardroom: 
an ambitious plan, first proposed in 1972, that included 5,700 homes, a 
1,300-slip marina, two 2,000-foot jetties and an array of oceanfront hotels, 
shops and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as now, the development was strongly opposed by many environmentalists. 
So, after winning approval from the supervisors in 1985, the project got bogged 
down in legal and political challenges, most notably from a group called Amigos 
de Bolsa Chica, which at the time was the voice of the environmental community. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in an attempt to break the logjam, Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder and 
then-Huntington Beach Mayor John Erskine formed a coalition that included 
representatives from the developer, state, city, county and Amigos de Bolsa 
Chica. Meeting regularly for six months -- from November, 1988, until May, 1989 
-- the group developed an agreement that eliminated the proposed marina, hotels 
and restaurants, significantly reduced the number of planned houses and sharply 
increased the number of wetland acres the developer would restore. 
</P>
<P>
 It was from that 1989 agreement, called the Bolsa Chica Planning Coalition 
Concept Plan, that the current proposal evolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The balance has tipped to where the environment is the key part and the 
housing is only a small element," said Adrianne Morrison, executive director of 
Amigos de Bolsa Chica, which now supports the development plan. "The whole 
scale has shifted; there have been adequate public hearings and adequate 
testimony, and the board now needs to make a decision to move forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all environmentalists agree, however. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, opposed to what they saw as the Amigos' capitulation to developers' 
interests, other environmentalists formed a new organization called the Bolsa 
Chica Land Trust with the goal of eventually raising enough money to purchase 
the wetlands and preserve it as open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, supported by many environmentalist groups, the trust has held 
discussions with the Department of the Interior regarding the possible federal 
purchase of the area or a land swap to save it from development. The trust 
wants to preserve the marsh and surrounding upland in part because it is 
habitat for five endangered bird species: the light-footed clapper rail, 
Belding's savanna sparrow, California least tern, peregrine falcon and brown 
pelican. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental reasons are not the only ones cited by critics of the plan. 
Opponents have raised a host of other objections ranging from the destruction 
of ancient Native American burial grounds to the existence on the site of 
historic World War II military bunkers. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Koll company itself may have contributed to a long delay in the 
planning process by switching its development application two years ago from 
the city of Huntington Beach to Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dunn, the change was made to utilize the county's greater 
expertise in wetlands restoration, but critics charge the company with jilting 
Huntington Beach in the hopes of getting a better deal from the more 
developmentally minded supervisors. The switch was possible because Bolsa 
Chica, though close to the city, is in unincorporated county territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the reasons for the change, the plan has generated at least eight 
public hearings -- some of them highly emotional -- in the last two years, as 
well as two environmental impact reports prepared by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Board of Supervisors approves the development today, Mathews said, it 
will still need the approval of the California Coastal Commission and the Army 
Corps of Engineers before bulldozers could begin digging, perhaps as early as 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
 But today's consideration by the supervisors, both sides agree, is a major 
step. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will kill the wetlands," Bruce Monroe, a spokesman for the Sierra Club's 
Save Bolsa Chica Task Force, said of the board's possible approval of the 
massive project. 
</P>
<P>
 Countered the Koll company's Dunn: "We're ready and the project is ready. It's 
time to stop planning and start restoring."

GROUP PROTESTS RESTAURANT'S 'WILD ANIMAL' MENU SPECIALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE SEO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To chef Leo Holczer at the Aurora Restaurant, the alligator is a delicacy 
that's best served braised with a slightly spicy tomato sauce on a bed of 
spaghetti. 
</P>
<P>
 To members of Orange County People for Animals, the alligator is an endangered 
species that should remain off any restaurant's list of specialties. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesting what they consider the illegal commercialization of wild animals, 
about 25 members of the animal-rights group picketed Holczer's restaurant 
Tuesday, demanding that he remove such exotic dishes as "alligator pasta," 
"grilled kangaroo chop," "elk loin with wild berries," and "lion roast" from 
his pricey and ever-changing menu. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned that the restaurant is selling bodies of the kangaroo, 
antelope and alligator, which are all listed as endangered species under the 
California Penal Code," said Ava Park, founder of the 2,000-member animal 
rights group. "We feel that there's plenty of animals to eat without including 
wild animals. Wild animals are a symbol of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Holczer, standing in front of the restaurant wearing a white chef's hat and 
jacket, disputed assertions that he has violated the law, saying he buys his 
meat from companies that are licensed to breed animals for commercial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all managed through an efficient game system," said the Swiss-born and 
trained chef, who has owned the restaurant on Euclid Avenue for 13 years. 
"Plus, as long as man has been on this Earth, we've eaten meat. The Bible says 
this is the way we eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the state does prohibit the selling of alligators, antelopes, 
kangaroos and a number of other endangered species, it tends to prosecute cases 
only if the animal is on the federal list of endangered species, said Jack 
Edwards, deputy chief of law enforcement at the state Department of Fish and 
Game in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "For example, the feds now allow the commercialization of most types of 
alligators, kangaroos and antelopes," Edwards said. "Even though it's 
technically illegal in California, if we write a violation, no district 
attorney would file a case because we've lost so many cases in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 The animal-rights activists, however, say they are hardly satisfied with the 
state's response to the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we're concerned, the law is the law," said Park, who became an 
animal-rights activist after she visited a university research lab in 1982 and 
said she saw cats being tortured as part of an experiment. "And we will go to 
the ends of the Earth to see that it is enforced." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Holczer plans to continue to serve up such entrees as alligator 
meat, which he describes in his menu as the "chef's specialty." Although 
alligator and elk are standard entrees at the restaurant, Holczer offers other 
exotic meats only as they become available. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why they're protesting, because we're not doing anything 
illegal," he said. "It's just meat, and it's available." 
</P>
<P>
 While the animal-rights protesters waved signs reading, "Orange County says no 
to lion dinners," and "Leave wild animals alone," customers continued to arrive 
at the restaurant. "These protesters don't have the foggiest idea what they're 
doing," said Bob Snow, a Fullerton resident who has dined at the restaurant for 
12 years. "It's illegal to sell hunted wildlife, but all of these animals are 
ranch-raised." 
</P>
<P>
 Said fellow diner Earl Salter of Fullerton: "The food here is no different 
than what you eat at McDonald's. This is not stuff that had been running around 
wild. I'm constantly bringing clients here, and I know they'll have a great 
meal and that they won't be disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Aurora Restaurant serves fish, beef and other conventional 
entrees, Holczer said it has built its reputation on its more exotic offerings. 
Every year, the restaurant holds a three-day event called "Festival of the 
Hunt," at which patrons can sample such dishes as "ostrich with cognac plum 
sauce" and "moose loin." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was horrified when I found out he was selling these exotic animals," said 
Hannah Ryan, communications director of the animal-rights group. "I think he 
puts it on the menu just for novelty reasons."

NATIVITY SCENE ENTHRALLS VISITORS TO GARAGE TABLEAU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE SEO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the day, Domenico Masdea's four-bedroom Tustin home is hardly 
distinguishable from the other neat but unpretentious dwellings on this quiet 
cul-de-sac on Caper Tree Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 But at night, Masdea's home is transformed into a Christmas decorator's 
Shangri-La. Passersby first notice the rows of colorful lights hanging from the 
46-year-old handyman's roof and bushes. But visitors wanting a closer view 
stare in wonder when they see the elaborate Christmas tableau he built inside 
his two-car garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Glistening red lava made of aluminum foil seeps from a volcano, constructed on 
a conveyor belt and rotisserie grill. Water gushes out of two miniature 
waterfalls, while a Nativity scene and hundreds of Christmas figurines adorn 
the sand- and snow-covered scene. To add to the effect, music boxes chiming 
Christmas tunes and recorded sounds of thunder, rain and chirping birds play in 
the background. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, Masdea's holiday spectacle attracts more than 1,000 visitors to 
2351 Caper Tree. As soon as the sun sets, onlookers make their way through the 
maze of streets leading to his home, lured by a sign that urges, "Visit the 
Nativity." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it's something all right," said Carl Kasalek Sr., who recently came to 
look at the decorations with his son and grandson. "I might do it too, but I 
don't have shares in the electric company." 
</P>
<P>
 From the intricate display, it's easy to imagine Masdea as an ostentatious and 
somewhat eccentric Christmas enthusiast. But Masdea is quiet and low-key. He 
wears comfortable, plain sweaters, and he doesn't talk much unless he's asked 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 And every night, from 5 to 11, he stands outside his front door, greeting 
anyone interested in peeking into his garage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want it to be open to whoever wants to see it," he said. "I make sure 
someone's home every night so that no one is disappointed. One time, a 
97-year-old woman in a wheelchair stopped by and said she had never seen 
anything like it. It made her so happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Masdea has built Christmas scenes for the past 13 years -- first in his dining 
room, but for the past three years in his garage. Every year, he changes the 
scene to keep visitors from getting bored. Although waterfalls and lava flows 
don't exactly epitomize Christmas, Masdea added them for dramatic effect. 
</P>
<P>
 He learned how to build Christmas scenes from his father while growing up in 
Italy, he said. He decided to carry on the tradition here, although he knows 
his son and daughter probably won't do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the only one who has the patience," he said. "When I die, this will die." 
</P>
<P>
 It took Masdea three weeks to complete this year's Christmas project, which he 
unveiled after Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's spectacle, perched on a plywood platform, stands about 20 feet 
wide and 17 feet long. The tableau's paper walls and ceiling resemble the 
interior of a cave, while two large mirrors sit across from one another to give 
the project a 3-D look. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny homes constructed out of cereal boxes sit in the back of the display, 
while homes made out of toy banks are perched in the front. To illuminate the 
scene, Masdea installed hundreds of lights, requiring him to add two new 
electric breakers near the garage. He also used at least 2,000 pins to 
construct the tableau. 
</P>
<P>
 Masdea doesn't pay attention to the electric bill during the holiday season, 
but he does admit to spending between $200 to $400 each year for new supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just buy things that I like," he said. "I just use my imagination and try 
to figure out how it could fit into the scene." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, Masdea's family support his efforts and welcome people to 
their home. But Masdea's 18-year-old daughter, Liliana, said that sometimes the 
all-consuming family project wears on her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it," she said. "But sometimes I wish he was inside with us, rather 
than out here." 
</P>
<P>
 And what do his neighbors think about his annual spectacle? 
</P>
<P>
 "He's sparked the whole neighborhood to get in the Christmas spirit," said 
Carl Kasalek, who has lived across the street for seven years and now decorates 
his own lawn with hundreds of lights and ornaments. "We had a couple (strings 
of) lights when we first moved in, but he's encouraged us to do more and more." 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha Lindsey, another neighbor, also began adding lights to her home after 
seeing Masdea's display. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we saw his decorations, we wanted to do it too," she said 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, every home along the cul-de-sac is trimmed with holiday lights and, in 
some cases, large Christmas ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you live in a neighborhood where no one comes through, you wouldn't be 
encouraged to do this," Kasalek said. "But people start driving by around 
Thanksgiving, asking when the display is going to be ready. You want your house 
to be part of it too."

STORM SHOWS OFF; WEATHER: WATERSPOUTS AFFORD SPECTACULAR VIEW ALONG THE COAST 
AS SYSTEM PASSES THROUGH. THERE'S A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN AGAIN THURSDAY. 
</P>

 The tail end of a storm system that passed through Orange County on Tuesday 
created unusual waterspouts off the coast of Newport Beach, giving observers 
along a bluff in Corona del Mar a spectacular view of one 1,500-foot funnel 
cloud.  
</P>
<P>
 "You could see water flying all around," said Marine Safety Officer Gordon 
Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 Others along a bluff in Corona del Mar watched as the larger of two 
waterspouts danced above the ocean's surface shortly after noon.  
</P>
<P>
 "You could see the water swirling and being pulled up into the clouds. A 
sailboat was real close to it, and we thought it would get blown away," said 
Roger Muscente, 31, of Mission Viejo, a real estate appraiser who shot pictures 
of the 1,500-foot funnel cloud. Neither waterspout touched land, and no damage 
was reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically described as an "ocean tornado," a waterspout is a spinning funnel 
of air that picks up water. It is, however, usually weaker in velocity than a 
land tornado.  
</P>
<P>
 Meteorologists believe the two waterspouts formed from the leftover energy of 
a storm system that was moving through Southern California and passed through 
Orange County late Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, there's instability behind a cold front, and all the moisture, 
clouds and upper level energy from the jet stream can form waterspouts," said 
Curtis Brack, a meteorologist at WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,500-foot waterspout was spotted half a mile offshore of Newport Beach's 
jetty entrance by marine safety officials at 12:10 p.m. It lasted for about 15 
minutes. The second spout was smaller and formed closer to Laguna Beach shortly 
after the first. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see spouts once every couple years," Reed said. "The one we saw today was 
spectacular because it was well-defined from what I've seen over the last 25 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Buechi and another friend were with Muscente on their way to lunch 
when they spotted the waterspout and pulled their car over to watch from a 
nearby bluff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Elegant is probably the best way to describe the waterspout," said Buechi, 
33, of Mission Viejo. "The bluff was the closest spot you could be to that 
funnel unless you were in a boat." 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 other observers on the bluff watched as the spout crept closer to 
three boats, but dissipated before directly crossing their paths, said Buechi. 
</P>
<P>
 Waterspouts usually create high waves within a half-mile radius of their 
funnels. 
</P>
<P>
 The spouts last only a few minutes and are rare, with only five to 10 forming 
along the Southern California coast each year, said Brack. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Orange County, Monday night's showers dumped nearly half an inch 
of rain in some parts and created slick roadways for Tuesday morning's commute, 
with a higher than normal number of traffic accidents reported by the 
California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an unusual amount of accidents between 6 and 7 a.m.," said CHP Officer 
Kari Keul in Santa Ana. "Obviously, oil and water don't mix, but motorists just 
need to decrease their speeds when it rains because it's going to take longer 
to stop when the road is wet as opposed to dry." 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster CHP officers also responded to a number of accidents during their 
normally quiet period of the night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had four collisions right after midnight," said CHP Officer K. Canzano. 
"And while I can't tell you if it can be blamed on the rain, that's an unusual 
amount, so I can imagine the rain had something to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The cold front that brought Monday night's showers came from the Gulf of 
Alaska and headed toward San Diego late Tuesday. The showers began about 11 
p.m. Monday and ended about 5 a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 8 a.m Monday and 8 a.m. Tuesday Santa Ana received .31 inches of rain; 
Villa Park Dam .24 inches; Santiago Peak .43 inches; and Costa Mesa .24 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters predict today will be partly cloudy, with cool temperatures and no 
rainfall. Thursday will be partly cloudy with a 10% to 20% chance of rain. 
Skies will clear up Friday, with warmer temperatures in the upper 60s and sunny 
skies expected for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Highs through Friday will be in the upper 50s to mid-60s. Coastal areas should 
expect temperatures in the upper 50s to mid-60s, inland valleys will be in the 
upper 50s, and areas in upper elevations should expect temperatures in the 40s. 
</P>
<P>
 On the coast, five-foot swells and one- to three-foot waves are expected, with 
west to southwesterly winds at 5 to 15 m.p.h.

WEST COVINA BOARD OKS MEAL PLAN FOR STUDENTS; EDUCATION: RANCOROUS DEBATE 
PRECEDES 3-1 VOTE. REPORTS OF CHILDREN TOO HUNGRY TO LEARN PROMPTED THE ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Capping a weeks-long uproar over reports that some schoolchildren were coming 
to class too hungry to learn, the West Covina school board Tuesday voted for 
the first time in district history to take advantage of a longstanding 
government breakfast program. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-1 vote by the West Covina Unified School District trustees followed more 
than an hour of rancorous debate over whether the schools, in grappling with a 
growing number of hungry children in the classroom, should assume a 
responsibility many in the conservative district felt belongs to parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, board members said the program was necessary and long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are going to break the poverty cycle of these kids, we have to feed 
them," said trustee Pete Sabatino. "To learn, they have to have full tummies." 
</P>
<P>
 Although federally funded breakfasts for low-income students have long been 
available to school districts, thousands of schools nationwide have not taken 
advantage. Last month, in a series of articles in The Times on hunger that 
highlighted the situation, West Covina's Edgewood Middle School was profiled as 
an example of the 193 schools in Southern California that do not offer 
breakfast even though they have high proportions of needy children.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, many of the schools -- including eight in West Covina -- have 
joined a recent rush to apply for the program, administered by the state 
Education Department largely with federal dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Most schools that offer breakfast fully recoup their costs through government 
reimbursements, a California study showed. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Covina vote followed weeks of soul-searching and public debate for 
members of the suburban San Gabriel Valley community. At least one group took 
matters into their own hands in the wake of The Times' series, mobilizing their 
own, private breakfast effort at Edgewood Middle School.  
</P>
<P>
 Others stood firm in their philosophical opposition to such programs. Although 
the school breakfast issue had been brought up before in the district, faculty, 
administrators and one board member had contended that the board did not 
implement the program earlier because of its conservative philosophy regarding 
the role of schools.  
</P>
<P>
 Board President Mike Spence, who has contended in the past that subsidized 
school breakfasts are anti-family, reiterated his opposition Tuesday night in 
casting the lone no vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize what I'm saying isn't politically correct," Spence said. "But for 
the last 40 years, we have spent bazillions on anti-poverty and anti-hunger 
programs and it hasn't helped." 
</P>
<P>
 Spence said programs such as the private breakfast initiative were more 
appropriate for the community, and that Tuesday's vote will only create a 
dependency by the district on a program that may be slashed in the near future. 
The new Republican majority in Congress, in its "contract with America," has 
said it will terminate federal child nutrition programs and turn them over to 
the states, with sizable funding cuts.  
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Spence said, he recently visited a San Gabriel Valley school that 
has a government breakfast program and was "sickened" to see how much food is 
thrown away by children. He said the program is riddled with fraud because 
parents' declaration of income on the application form goes unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the majority of letters to the board and speakers Tuesday disagreed 
with Spence. One kindergarten student wrote simply, "I hope you never have to 
go hungry."  
</P>
<P>
 Edgewood parent Mercedes Gil urged the board "to nourish not only (children's) 
bodies, but allow teachers to nourish their minds." 
</P>
<P>
 Another resident, teacher Barbara Evleth, said: "We get a hefty tax bill from 
the federal government. I want my tax dollars to be spent here, on the children 
of West Covina." 
</P>
<P>
 The vote left longtime proponents of the program feeling vindicated. The 
district hopes to have subsidized breakfasts operating by Feb. 1 at eight of 
West Covina Unified's 11 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of people against Big Brother," Sabatino said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's a social necessity for these underprivileged students. You can't get 
out of poverty if you can't get an education, and you can't get an education if 
you are hungry. It's basic." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Reymann, who calls himself the board's lone liberal, said he is elated. 
"Some people call it bad press. I call it an awakening to get these guys (his 
fellow board members) on to the fact that West Covina does have hungry 
children," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reymann, who teaches in El Monte's Valle Lindo School District, said he 
grappled with hungry children in his classroom before his school began a 
breakfast program several years ago. He fed them apples and oranges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not having kids hungry makes them more alert in the morning, more eager to 
learn," Reymann said. Last month, he donated his $240 monthly school board 
stipend to the private effort to feed children breakfast at Edgewood Middle 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Edgewood Principal Cathy Makin said the school -- which received 
more than 500 calls in the two weeks after publication of the story -- 
continues to receive assistance. On Tuesday night, the school received a $5,000 
donation from Kaiser Permanente for the private breakfast program, and the 
school has counted $7,500 in other large donations, including $5,000 from 
Citrus Valley Health Partners, parent company of Queen of the Valley Hospital 
in West Covina. Another $10,000 pledge has not yet been received, and the 
school has not tallied a flurry of individual donations, Makin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is putting the donations into a special account to be used in the 
private breakfast feeding effort, which has supplied more than 200 hungry 
children per day with a morning meal. Bernell McBride, a retired executive who 
spearheaded efforts to start the privately funded breakfast program at 
Edgewood, said: "These kids are happy and eating. They feel the love of people 
trying to help. That's all."

A HOLIDAY FOR ALL; SCHOOLS STRIVE TO MAKE CHRISTMAS A CULTURAL LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY PYLE, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re-enactments of Christ's birth in the manger are out, but renditions of 
"Silent Night" -- which tells the tale of that event -- are OK, especially if 
sung in another language or buried amid more secular music. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are this year's practical interpretations of Los Angeles public school 
policy, which seeks to echo federal law by making Christmas a cultural lesson 
instead of a religious observation. 
</P>
<P>
 School productions formerly called Christmas pageants are now "winter 
programs" and "holiday celebrations." Music selections lean heavily on the 
marginally secular: "Jingle Bell Rock," "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" and 
"White Christmas" -- with a token Hanukkah song thrown in for good measure.

 At the Broad Avenue Elementary School winter program in Wilmington last week, 
first-graders decked in handmade reindeer antlers gyrated to an upbeat 
"Reindeer Twist" and second-graders donned grass skirts and leis to sing a 
Hawaiian Christmas song. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally speaking, we do Christmas around the world. . . . It doesn't 
include everybody every year, but within three years we do most of the 
countries," said Broad Avenue Principal Lydia Shors, who characterized the 
school as about 85% Latino, with significant populations of Eastern Europeans, 
Samoans, Asians and African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Occasionally we'll have someone who felt left out or felt that too much was 
spent on one particular ethnicity," Shors said. "But any comment like that is 
very rare." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging the need to reflect a wider diversity, school music 
teacher Connie-Lu Berg remained a little wistful about the old days, when 
manger scenes and Christian carols were commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sort of bothers me because some of the best songs are religious," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some religious organizations go even further, saying the trend away from 
Christmas pageants deprives children -- Christian or not -- of a memorable 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're allowing our children to grow up without the beauty, the warmth -- 
Christmas is such a beautiful thing," said Sara DiVito Hardman, state director 
of the Christian Coalition, the political arm of broadcaster Pat Robertson. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified has based its holiday celebration rules on a 1980 federal 
court case involving the Sioux Falls, S.D., school district, which established 
guidelines for marking religious holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, found that holidays with 
both religious and secular foundations could be observed in schools if taught 
in terms of their history and origins. 
</P>
<P>
 Music, literature and drama with religious themes could be used as teaching 
aids, the ruling found, as could symbols such as crosses, menorahs and creches. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is just to promote an environment of respect for other people's 
holidays, instead of trying to force people to observe things they don't 
believe in themselves," said Shel Erlich, a Los Angeles Unified spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have worked hardest to make schools aware of the exclusivity of 
Christmas pageants say Los Angeles Unified has applied the ruling better than 
many districts, but needs to be vigilant to ensure teachers do not substitute 
celebration of multiple religions for no religious observations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just adding a Muslim song and a Jewish song doesn't do it -- that just makes 
it more religious," said Heather Rothman, a director with the Jewish Community 
Relations Committee in Los Angeles. "The idea is not to be inclusive, it's to 
be secular." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet teachers and administrators say they find the Christmas season an ideal 
time to teach about religion and cultural heritage, a lesson they believe helps 
students respect each others' differences. 
</P>
<P>
 At the children's day-care center affiliated with Vanalden Avenue School in 
Reseda, a holiday crafts workshop for parents and children includes projects 
reflecting Hanukkah and Kwanzaa, a seven-day celebration observed by some 
African Americans, as well as Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bellagio Newcomer School in Brentwood, where students newly arrived from 
other countries spend their first year, nearly every major holiday around the 
world is celebrated near its actual day. In mid-December, Christmas becomes a 
lesson in American tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Cheri Katz said that even though most of Bellagio's students do 
celebrate some form of Christmas at home, Santa Claus is a new phenomenon for 
many. 
</P>
<P>
 "I bring in a model of a chimney to explain it," Katz said. "When I started 
telling them about Santa Claus going down the chimney, I had some . . . kids 
looking at me like I was crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, one of Bellagio's classes will sing Silent Night, in Korean, and 
nearly 100 fourth- and fifth-graders will sing a song about lighting candles at 
Hanukkah. 
</P>
<P>
 The history behind the Jewish festival of lights, which commemorates the Jews' 
reclaiming of a temple from the Greeks, seemed to have been lost on 10-year-old 
Joshua Muhammab of Indonesia. He responded to the question, 'What is Hanukkah?' 
by holding up one of nine flashlights topped with red cellophane. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's this, this ," he said, turning the light off and on by pounding it into 
his palm. "It's candlelight." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, complaints about overly religious celebrations in schools have 
steadily declined in the past 10 years, said Marc Stern, a lawyer with the 
American Jewish Congress in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Most church-state separation advocates agree that they rarely receive reports 
now of overt faux pas -- like the call Stern received from a Midwest woman who 
was distraught that her son had been cast as Jesus in the Christmas play 
because he was the only Jew in his school. 
</P>
<P>
 Or the time Carol Plotkin, director of the Jewish Congress's Los Angeles 
office, learned a principal of a school outside Denver was reading The Night 
Before Christmas in his office. Kids who weren't interested, he reasoned, could 
go home early. 
</P>
<P>
 But Plotkin and other Los Angeles Jewish activists worry that a drop in 
reports may simply be evidence of middle-class flight from the inner city and 
from public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still get complaints from non-immigrant schools, because they know one can 
and should complain," said Plotkin. "Immigrants are not going to want to rock 
the boat that much. . . . We don't have the built-in watchdog in Los Angeles 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically these days, the few complaints about programs with too much 
religious music arise in smaller, suburban school districts, Plotkin said, and 
usually are solved by sending a letter requesting a copy of the district's 
holiday policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggest the simplest solution would be to forgo a December program 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite appropriate for schools to do nothing, to leave religious 
observances at home with the family," said Albert J. Menendez, author of The 
December Wars: Religious Symbols and Ceremonies in the Public Square. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But teachers and principals in Los Angeles Unified say that would hurt the 
poorest students the most, because the school's winter program may be their 
only celebration of whatever holiday they observe this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a large number of students who are really hard up," said Lila 
Dawson-Weber, a teacher at Fulton Middle School, where teachers help coordinate 
a gala December party for needy students, hosted by a local business, Western 
Bagel Baking Corp. "This is a hard time of year for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, teachers say, the sheer joy children get from performing holiday 
shows makes the sometimes complicated planning negotiations worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 As 6-year-old Rudy Hernandez prepared to enter the Broad Avenue auditorium, 
his reindeer headdress only slightly askew, he laughed and fidgeted with fellow 
performers. Was he nervous at all? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh no, not me," he said.

APRIL VOTE PLANNED TO FILL YAROSLAVSKY SEAT; ELECTIONS: COUNCIL DECIDES NOT TO 
NAME AN INTERIM REPLACEMENT TO REPRESENT THE DISTRICT FOR SIX MONTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to hold a primary election in April 
to fill the seat left vacant when Zev Yaroslavsky joined the County Board of 
Supervisors, setting the stage for what is expected to be an expensive, 
hard-fought election. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote simultaneously kills a proposal by a coalition of San Fernando Valley 
and Westside residents and business leaders to appoint an interim replacement 
to fill the seat until the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several names have been proposed to fill the six-month vacancy, the 
council opted against making an appointment partly because there was little 
consensus on a candidate and because an appointment was likely to spark a 
divisive debate in the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there were eight votes (on the 15-member council) for an 
appointment," said Councilman Joel Wachs, a Valley representative who has 
opposed an appointed replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs said he opposes a political appointment because "anyone who serves on 
the City Council voting for the people should be elected by the people." In 
addition, he said he is content to rely on the traditional city practice of 
assigning a city bureaucrat to watch over vacant districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick said she supported the idea of an interim appointment 
but did not make a motion to that effect because there was not sufficient 
support for a particular candidate. "I wasn't about to play a role in choosing 
a candidate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leading contenders for the temporary slot were Mike Jimenez, a former 
legislative aide to Yaroslavsky, and Bob Geoghegan, a former deputy to 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, whose retirement set off the domino-effect that created 
the vacancy for Yaroslavsky, who was elected to the post in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of an appointed representative say the district, which stretches 
from Sherman Oaks to Westwood, was hard hit by the Northridge quake and needs a 
voting representative to oversee its recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a permanent replacement is elected, Avak Keotahian, a longtime 
legislative analyst, will respond to the day-to-day problems in the district 
but will have no vote on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the race for the highly coveted seat is beginning in earnest, with 
several major candidates already rounding up endorsements and tapping 
contributors in hopes of building robust campaign war chests. 
</P>
<P>
 The top candidates include Barbara Yaroslavsky, the former councilman's wife; 
Roberta Weintraub, a former school board member; Jeff Brain, a Sherman Oaks 
realtor; Michael Feuer, former head of a legal services agency, and Lea Purwin 
D'Agostino, a deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Political consultants and City Hall insiders say Barbara Yaroslavsky already 
has an advantage in the race based on the enormous name recognition built by 
her husband in his 19 years on the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has 100% name recognition," one prominent political consultant said. "You 
can't buy name recognition like that. Zev Yaroslavsky is one of the most 
popular elected officials in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Lichtenstein, a Westside consultant, agreed. "Barbara still has to be 
the candidate to beat for name ID alone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub is also expected to take advantage of her name recognition developed 
over 14 years on the Board of Education. Lichtenstein said Weintraub is also 
likely to rely on her campaign experience that helped her keep the school board 
seat for so long. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for endorsements, D'Agostino picked up key support in October when 
she won the backing of the Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union that 
represents the rank and file of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The league, which clashed often with Zev Yaroslavsky when he was on the 
council, vowed to oppose Barbara Yaroslavsky. Union members promised last week 
to picket her first major fund-raiser, but only a handful of officers showed 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub, who is expected to gain most of her support in the Valley, has 
picked up endorsements from several current and former politicians, including 
council members Jackie Goldberg and Richard Alarcon, state Sens. Quentin L. 
Kopp (I-San Francisco) and Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), and former state 
Sens. Ed Davis and David A. Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 Brain, a prominent Sherman Oaks activist, has the backing of the Los Angeles 
Assn. of Realtors and the San Fernando Valley Assn. of Realtors as well as 
several Sherman Oaks business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Feuer, a Harvard law graduate and former head of Bet Tzedek, a Westside legal 
aid center, has the backing of several business and community leaders, 
including Bruce Corwin, president of Metropolitan Theaters; Marsha Volpert, a 
Department of Water and Power commissioner; Marc Platt, president of Tri Star 
Pictures, and David Kalish, an LAPD commander.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NORTH; BREA; COMPUTER SYSTEMS WILL BE UPGRADED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More elaborate and sophisticated computer terminals are being installed in the 
city's police and fire vehicles to improve safety and communication. 
</P>
<P>
 The new computer system is expected to be in full operation by next month, 
said Brea Assistant City Manager Tim O'Donnell.The new computers will be bought 
with funds from Proposition 172. The statewide measure, approved by California 
voters in 1993, authorizes a half-cent sales tax hike to augment public safety 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea has received about $330,000 in Proposition 172 money, of which $262,000 
has been set aside for the new computers. The current computers are 8 years old 
and not compatible with technology that will be used nationwide by law 
enforcement agencies by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 A major advantage of the new system, O'Donnell said, is increased safety for 
police officers in the field. The mobile terminals will give officers direct 
access to a statewide law enforcement database. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way the license plate number can be punched in and information comes 
back in about 20 seconds," O'Donnell said. "It's a big safety improvement for 
officers." 
</P>
<P>
 The new computers are also expected to increase the police department's 
efficiency by allowing officers to electronically file reports from the field. 
Currently, reports have to be filed at the station. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will also use Proposition 172 funds to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchase radio headsets for firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Train public safety dispatchers to give lifesaving information to 911 
callers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Retrofit two fire engines so they can pump foam as well as water. 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchase a digital camera that will allow the Police Department to link up 
with a countywide mug shot database. 
</P>
<P>
 The public safety expenditures were unanimously approved this month by the 
City Council. ALAN EYERLY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NORTHWEST; CYPRESS; DEVELOPER WITHDRAWS WAREHOUSE PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The developer of a controversial warehouse project unexpectedly withdrew the 
proposal late Monday night after many residents spoke against it at a City 
Council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer, Brian Harvey, told the council he was scuttling plans to build 
a 153,000-square-foot food distribution warehouse in a business park at 11261 
Warland Drive.The project, on 8.2 acres, called for 24-hour activity and truck 
deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents protested the proposal for weeks, charging that the warehouse 
would cause noise and traffic problems and ruin nearby residential areas. City 
Council chambers overflowed Monday night as about 225 people packed a public 
hearing on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 They included Ingrid Kline, who presented the council with a petition she said 
was signed by 2,293 city residents opposed to the warehouse. "Heed the will of 
the people," she told council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other residents also testified during the council session, including Tony 
Smith, spokesman for an anti-warehouse group called the Citizens Assn. for 
Sensible Development of Warland Center. 
</P>
<P>
 That organization opposes another large warehouse approved by the City Council 
in September, and is challenging that project in Superior Court lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday, Smith praised Harvey's decision to withdraw the 
warehouse proposal. "Brian Harvey recognized he faced tremendous opposition, 
and he made a good business decision" in withdrawing the project, Smith said. 
"The community wants to work with him in finding an acceptable use of that 
land." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said Cypress residents have proved they can successfully band together 
to oppose development they consider harmful. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a clear-cut example of grass-roots organization in a small 
community," he said. BILL BILLITER

VALLEWIDE FOCUS: 65-YEAR-OLD MAN TRAINS FOR POLICE RESERVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ISAAC GUZMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At an age when most people are thinking of retirement, 65-year-old Donald 
Absey of Woodland Hills is planning on holstering a gun and heading out into 
the mean streets to fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past 17 weeks, Absey has been scaling walls, studying criminal law and 
practicing cardiopulmonary resuscitation in preparation for his graduation 
today from the South Bay Police Reserve Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 A retirement pension actuary during the week, Absey traded his three-piece 
suit for a reservist's uniform while attending a paramilitary boot camp for 
trainees nights and weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Saturday, Absey and his classmates spent hours running wind sprints, 
doing push-ups, practicing self-defense and pushing their bodies to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a grind, believe me. That was the worst 17 weeks of my life . . . but in 
a good way," said Absey, who recalls undergoing equally relentless training 
before he flew Banshee jets for the Navy during the Korean War.  
</P>
<P>
 For many in his class, the rigorous physical training, challenging criminal 
justice courses and stringent background checks were too much: only 49 of the 
94 who showed up the first night of class made it to today's graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Absey, a gray-haired, bespectacled father of five children and grandfather of 
two, has lived in Woodland Hills for 27 years with his wife, Patricia. His 
favorite hobby is flying biplanes in aerobatic competitions, at which pilots 
perform stunt maneuvers before nit-picking judges. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he first got interested in becoming a reserve officer, which he admits 
worries his wife, after talking to a business associate, attorney Robert 
Ridley, a lieutenant in the South Pasadena Police Department Reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a noble profession," said Absey about adding police work to what seems 
an already full life. "It's kind of exciting. I just assumed I could do it and 
that it would be tough and I was right." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the difficulty of the training, Absey managed to distinguish himself 
in the eyes of his instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a dedicated, goal-oriented, determined gentleman," said Mike D'Amico, 
director of the South Bay Academy.  
</P>
<P>
 D'Amico considers Absey an ideal reservist. "He came into the academy and knew 
he was competing against people half his age, and he was willing to put himself 
into those circumstances and he did exceptionally well." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduation, Absey hopes to join his friend Ridley in the South Pasadena 
police reserves. He looks forward to putting in the 500 hours of field work 
that might merit him his own patrol car, but admits he still has a lot to 
learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real training starts when you hit the street," Absey said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Absey's good-natured, gentle demeanor and abundant life experience are 
bound to serve him well. He is the kind of person police departments say 
they're looking for: someone concerned about people. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a sense of compassion and understanding, yet when he needs to be 
forceful, he can get the job done," said D'Amico. "He's outstanding. If every 
officer had all of his traits, we would be very well off." 
</P>
<P>
 The multiplicity of agencies training reserve officers makes it hard to say 
that Absey is the oldest reserve graduate in Los Angeles history. But the 
largest reserve academies -- including the South Bay, Los Angeles Police 
Department and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department academies -- have no 
record of any line reserve graduate anywhere close to Absey's age. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been the chief of police and director of the academy for the last 15 
years and he is the oldest graduate we've had out of the last 2,000," D'Amico 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had somebody 58, but that's it. If there is anybody else I'm unaware of 
it and I've been around a long time." ISAAC GUZMAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; SERVICE GROUP GIVES JACKETS TO PUPILS IN NEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a chilly early afternoon as Julianne Campbell, a kindergarten and 
first-grade teacher at Justice Street Elementary School in Canoga Park, made 
her way from the main office to the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 She was stopped several times by children, all with the same question: "Do we 
get our jackets today?" 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a question that Campbell has had to deal with for about a month, 
ever since the school got word that it would get winter coats for its needy 
children from the Assistance League of the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Campbell could finally say, "Yes, the jackets are here." 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two years, the league has fitted Justice Street Elementary School 
children with new shoes, and given them backpacks for the last four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other local schools -- Tarzana Elementary, Capistrano Avenue and Hamlin 
Street -- will also receive jackets for their needy children as part of the 
league's Operation School Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the jackets fit, in this, the first time that the league has given 
them to children at Justice Street. A handful of the children had to go away 
empty-handed because there were not enough jackets in their size. But Jeanette 
Devine, an Assistance League member, promised: "These kids will all get their 
jackets." 
</P>
<P>
 The colorful, reversible jackets were purchased with proceeds from a 
fund-raising luncheon last month. League officials were not sure how soon the 
remaining children will get jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 jackets were handed out Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like this one," a fourth-grade girl said as she tried on a brightly colored 
jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are pretty, aren't they?" said Virginia Cobb, another Assistance League 
member as she helped the girl, who said she was looking forward to wearing the 
jacket when she goes skating Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it because of the colors and how it changes back and forth," the girl 
said. Now, she said she could return an oversized jacket that her cousin had 
loaned her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take good care of this," said a 9-year-old third-grader who said she had 
been wearing the same jacket since she was 6. "I feel warmer already." ED BOND

 Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude said he is leaning against a city 
proposal to erect lighted traffic signs on Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am opposed to billboards and the proliferation of commercial signs or any 
kinds of signs obstructing the public right of way," Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Department of Transportation wants to erect three signs -- similar to 
those along the freeway that warn drivers of traffic ahead -- on Ventura 
Boulevard, part of which is in Braude's district. 
</P>
<P>
 One would be east of Haskell Avenue facing eastbound traffic; another would be 
east of Beverly Glen Boulevard facing westbound traffic in Sherman Oaks, and 
the third would be west of Sylvia Avenue in Tarzana facing eastbound traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs would be installed overhead and be about 15 feet long and 6 feet 
wide, about 40% smaller than overhead freeway signs, said John Fisher, the 
city's principal transportation engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Boulevard Plan Review Board -- a citizens board that oversees the 
street's master plan -- opposes the signs as being unsightly and out of 
character with the boulevard, which board members would like to see become more 
pedestrian-oriented. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said his department is to make a decision on whether to put up the 
signs by the end of the month, and that it would not put in signs against the 
community's wishes.  
</P>
<P>
 He said Braude has not yet indicated his approval or disapproval of the signs 
to the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The signs would coordinate traffic on Ventura and Sepulveda boulevards, and 
the Ventura and San Diego freeways. According to Fisher, they would alert 
drivers to traffic problems and recommend alternative routes. 
</P>
<P>
 They are part of an overall traffic management program that includes timed 
traffic lights. Each sign would cost about $750,000 and be paid for by state 
Proposition 111 funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think signs hanging over the boulevard are ugly, but they are large 
and we're aware of that," Fisher said. "But if you desire to inform motorists 
of traffic conditions. . . that is the only way we know of effectively 
accomplishing that goal." Braude, however, said maintaining the appearance of 
the boulevard is also important. KAY HWANGBO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; HOSPITAL MARKS OPENING OF WING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Motion Picture and Television Hospital on Tuesday celebrated the opening 
of a renovated outpatient wing, made possible through a $2-million donation 
bequeathed by actress Natalie Schafer. 
</P>
<P>
 Schafer, who played Lovey Howell, a millionaire's wife on the television 
series "Gilligan's Island," was a longtime supporter of the Motion Picture and 
Television Fund, which operates the 256-bed hospital, said Ann Thompson-Haas, 
the organization's vice president of development. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a very generous, wonderful human being, and very loyal to her 
friends, and I think we can see that through her relationship to the fund," 
Thompson-Haas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schafer died of cancer at age 90 at her Beverly Hills home in 1991. She had 
requested that any memorial donations be given to the American Cancer Society 
or the Motion Picture and Television Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization operates five facilities in the Los Angeles area for people 
who work in the entertainment industry, officials said. Free care is available 
for those who can't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people in the industry who, from time to time, fall on hard times, 
and they need the services of the organization," said Al Newman, spokesman for 
the hospital. "If people don't have insurance, there are ways for services to 
be given to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit organization was founded in 1921 by pioneers of the movie 
industry, including Mary Pickford, Charlie Chaplin, Douglas Fairbanks and D. W. 
Griffith, organization officials said. Today, there are an estimated 500,000 
people, including children, who are eligible for the health care services 
provided through the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The new outpatient wing, which will be named after Schafer, will provide 
specialty care, including an HIV-screening program, dermatology, breast care, 
and orthopedic and neurology services, officials said. The hospital is in 
Woodland Hills off the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the hospital, the organization operates four outpatient health care 
facilities, in West Los Angeles, Burbank and Hollywood, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the $2 million has gone into renovating the facility, according to 
Thompson-Haas. The rest has been put into a special trust fund that will 
benefit the Motion Picture and Television Fund. FRANK MANNING

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NORTHWEST; LOS ALAMITOS; SYLVIA IS UNANIMOUS CHOICE FOR 
MAYOR

 Newly elected Mayor Charles E. Sylvia said this week that while the city's 
financial situation is not grim, residents must brace themselves for the tough 
times ahead in the wake of Orange County's filing for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in for rough times," Sylvia said. "This will take efforts from all of 
us to overcome all the difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
 Police and fire services are not in danger of being cut, but street repairs, 
park upgrades and other projects that would need some county funding could be 
put on hold, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly seated council Monday elected Sylvia as mayor, the third time that 
the 61-year-old electronics engineer has held the largely ceremonial post. He 
also was mayor in 1983 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia's election as mayor was expected, but he interpreted the council's 
unanimous vote as a willingness on the part of his colleagues to work together 
to weather the city's financial difficulties. Sylvia was mayor pro tem last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has $2.2 million invested in the frozen county investment pool, 
according to City Manager Robert C. Dunek. But he assured council members that 
city operations will not be immediately affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunek said a budget review in late January will provide a clearer picture of 
the city's financial condition. The city is expected to receive its share of 
property taxes Sunday, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't anticipate a cash flow problem for the balance of the year," Dunek 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia, who was first elected to the council in 1975, said that the city has 
not issued bonds since it was incorporated in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very conservative fiscal policy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert P. Wahlstrom, Alice Jempsa and Marilynn M. Poe were sworn in as council 
members. It is the third term for Wahlstrom and Jempsa and the first for Poe. 
</P>
<P>
 Wahlstrom, 61, director of purchasing for a restaurant chain, was elected 
mayor pro tem.BERT ELJERA

 Linda Moulton Patterson is leaving public office, but she's not about to say 
she won't be back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to say never to anything," said Moulton Patterson, who forwent 
a bid for reelection to City Council last month for a race for the County Board 
of Supervisors. She was defeated by fellow council member Jim Silva, whose 
mid-term departure in January will create a vacancy on the seven-member 
council. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson said that "if the council wanted me, I would certainly 
consider it." 
</P>
<P>
 The council has decided to accept applications from the public to fill the 
vacancy and will make an appointment by late January. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson said leaving public office and giving up her vote on the 
California Coastal Commission, on which she also sits, is "the heartbreak of 
this thing." She was appointed to the commission in 1991 and can only hold the 
post if she remains in elected office. She plans to serve on the commission 
until February. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such an important commission," she said, adding "its charge is to 
protect the coast and ensure public access so that everyone can enjoy the 
beach." 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County had not had a representative for 10 years, and it's a shame 
Orange County is going to lose their only local representation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson was elected to the Huntington Beach Union High School 
District Board of Trustees in 1983 and served until her election to the council 
in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she is proud of a number of council accomplishments, including not 
allowing three restaurants to be built on the beachside: "They would have 
ruined views." 
</P>
<P>
 She also played a leadership role in a restaurant no-smoking ordinance, a gift 
ban ordinance for public officials and the creation a task force to meet the 
needs of the city's youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson said that local government has become more accessible to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have really listened to the public," she said. "I think it's important 
that the citizens get a chance to be heard. I'm proud to be part of a city 
where there is not apathy, where people come down and express their opinions, 
and I certainly see that in Huntington Beach."DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH; MISSION VIEJO; COUNCIL'S VOTE 
AGAINST DAY-CARE HOME EXPANSION SPARKS ANGRY CONFRONTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A dispute over the proposed expansion of a neighborhood day-care home turned 
ugly in City Council chambers Monday, with threats of violence prompting city 
officials to call sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 However, confrontations between neighbors were limited to words, and most 
participants left before patrol units arrived at City Hall.No arrests were 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 The name-calling and finger-pointing were prompted by a 4-1 council vote to 
not overturn a Planning Commission decision to deny the proposed day-care 
expansion last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmen Altamirano had applied to increase the number of children she watches 
at her Woodcreek Street home from six to 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a city study showing that traffic would not increase appreciably, the 
commission turned down the expansion because the center's cul-de-sac location 
lacked curbside parking. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, a council majority agreed with the commission, saying that 
forcing parents to back out of the center's driveway was hazardous for the 
estimated 31 children in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently elected Councilwoman Sherri M. Butterfield, who voted against the 
expansion as a planning commissioner before taking office, said the commission 
"was concerned about blind spots" when parents backed away from the day-care 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 In her last meeting as mayor, Susan Withrow sided with Altamirano, pointing to 
the positive traffic study. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tough call," Withrow said. "My heart goes out a little bit more to 
these parents whose children need day care." FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; OLD CHURCH TAKES LOOK AT HISTORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A small group of families who first met for prayer in 1869 moved from building 
to building over the decades. But they remained together, and last weekend the 
congregation observed the 125th anniversary of the oldest Protestant church in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Congregants of the Spurgeon United Methodist Church celebrated by opening a 
time capsule and applauding those families from throughout the county who have 
stayed with the church for up to six generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear a lot about American society being so mobile, but there are a lot of 
roots," said Katherine Gara, who has been pastor of the church and its 250 
members for several years. "I think it's unusual to have so many families that 
have been in one place for so many generations." 
</P>
<P>
 Gara led up to Sunday's festivities with about six weeks of "historic" 
services that recalled various periods in the church's history. One Sunday she 
preached as Maggie Newton Van Cott, ordained in 1969 as the Methodist Church's 
first female minister. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the time capsule, from the church's 100th anniversary in 1969, 
also gave the party a historic feel. 
</P>
<P>
 The capsule was largely filled with predictions, few of which came to pass, 
said Judy Cobb, chairwoman of the church trustees. A few optimistic souls 
predicted that by 1994 an astronaut would have reached Mars and war would have 
been abolished, Cobb said. Another predicted that Memory Lane, where the church 
sits, would be a major thoroughfare, which did come true, Cobb said. 
</P>
<P>
 The church plans to open the time capsule every 25 years, Cobb said. "It does 
keep a sense of connectedness to your past and your future that is motivating," 
she said. LESLEY WRIGHT

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; NEW 'FLEX' SCHEDULE SET FOR POLICE OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Burbank police officers will soon begin a new work schedule designed to make 
their lives a little easier -- even though the number of hours they will be on 
the streets per day will increase from eight to 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Dec. 29, 75 officers, sergeants and lieutenants in the Burbank 
Police Department's patrol unit will switch to a three-day work week with 
12-hour shifts.  
</P>
<P>
 The change will not only cut commuting time for officers who live in outlying 
communities, but it will also give the department the flexibility to put more 
officers on patrol during the evenings and weekends when they are most needed, 
police officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will result in some increased levels of service for the city," 
said Police Capt. Thomas Hoefel. "We will be able to deploy more officers 
during peak periods. It's actually a more efficient work schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the remaining 157 members of the police force will remain on the 
current "9/80" work schedule, in which they have a three-day weekend every 
other week.  
</P>
<P>
 On the new schedule, patrol officers will have four consecutive days off every 
week, although they will be required to work one extra 12-hour shift every four 
weeks to ensure they work 40 hours per week during the month, Hoefel said. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be three different shifts on the new patrol schedule. Most officers 
will work either a day shift from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. or a night shift from 6 p.m. 
to 6 a.m., while a few will work a "mid-watch" shift from 3 p.m. to 3 a.m., 
Hoefel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank Police Officers Assn. bargained for the new work schedule during 
negotiations for the officers' current contract. The new schedule is modeled 
after similar programs that have been successful in Glendale, West Covina and 
other cities, department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police will begin a three-day workweek in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's done for a lot of reasons," said Lt. Steve Campbell of the 
Glendale Police Department, which implemented the three-day, 12-hour shifts in 
January, 1993, and currently has about 125 officers, sergeants and civilian 
employees on that schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "It helps the department meet the (South Coast Air Quality Management District 
trip reduction) requirements, and it benefits the officers because they don't 
have to make as many commuting trips. It also gives you more officers on patrol 
when you need them. But there is a trade-off in that it makes for a very long 
day," Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank police officials said they are now working with the police officers' 
association to establish guidelines for evaluating the effectiveness of the 
schedule during an 18-month trial period. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoefel said one criteria will be whether the longer shifts prove too tiring. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's everyone's first impression and I think we all are very concerned for 
the safety of the officers and our citizens, but experience has shown in a lot 
of other (police departments) that those fears have not been realized," Hoefel 
said. STEVE RYFLE

 Erika Beltran, 12, placed one hand on a silver metal globe and waited 
apprehensively while her classmates watched. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, children erupted into laughter as Erika's long brown hair began 
to levitate and stand on end. 
</P>
<P>
 Erika was one of about 120 students from Lathrop Intermediate School in Santa 
Ana who visited the Launch Pad on Monday to learn about the effects of 
electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 During a demonstration, Erika gripped a Van de Graaff generator, designed to 
create large negative charges of static electricity. As the machine whirred to 
life, her body became so charged that her hair began to rise, sticking out in 
every direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like my hand was vibrating and my hair just went up. It was fun. It's 
better for us to learn in fun ways," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 During another demonstration, Forrest Love, who works at the Launch Pad, 
showed the seventh-grade class a Tesla coil -- a squat machine that crackled 
and spat sparks into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 With the device, Love broadcast electrical power through the air and lit up a 
florescent light bulb even though it was several feet away and unconnected to 
the coil. 
</P>
<P>
 Trini Luken, 14, said he learned that science can be interesting, a notion of 
which he was skeptical before visiting the Launch Pad. "I got more into it" 
because of the demonstrations, he said. "They're good." 
</P>
<P>
 The Launch Pad, the preview facility for the Discovery Science Center, is on 
the third floor of Crystal Court at South Coast Plaza, 3333 Bear St., Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 After-school science sessions for youth are open through Dec. 23 and from Jan. 
2 through April 7. For more information, call (714) 546-2061. JON NALICK

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: LAKE VIEW TERRACE; EQUESTRIAN CENTER OPERATOR SUES L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ex-jockey Eddie J. Milligan, operator of the Hansen Dam Equestrian Center, has 
sued Los Angeles in Small Claims Court for a $5,000 deposit he paid the city 
for the right to run a concession at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the first legal skirmish in what Milligan, 65, predicts will be a long, 
litigious war with the city over 20 acres of land between the Big and Little 
Tujunga washes in Lake View Terrace. Milligan has operated the center on behalf 
of the city since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Milligan says the city rejected his request to return the $5,000 deposit he 
paid for the right to operate an equestrian concession on the property. The 
city leases the land from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which owns the 
property because it is on a federally regulated flood plain.  
</P>
<P>
 But after tangling with the corps for years over environmental and other 
issues -- including his right to live on the property -- and after investing $3 
million of his own money in improvements there, Milligan said last month that 
he wants out. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote to city parks commissioners and Mayor Richard Riordan, among others, 
demanding compensation for his investment, but received no response. Last week, 
he requested his original $5,000 deposit back. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're telling me there's no deal between us, that they don't have to return 
the deposit to me," Milligan said. The city has allowed Milligan to operate the 
center under a lease renewed every month since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "In good faith, I have waited five years for a more permanent deal with the 
city to run this place. I have built a superior equestrian center with my own 
money. And I am no closer to a deal with the city today than I was five years 
ago. They (the city) rejected my claim, so we'll see what the judge has to say 
about it. This is just the first showdown in court," Milligan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noelia Rodriguez, Riordan's press secretary, said the city is unaware of any 
suit brought by Milligan. "We've apparently been working with Mr. Milligan and 
the corps to resolve all the issues; it's been a long process. However, I 
checked with our attorneys and we have no record of being served with any legal 
papers from him." 
</P>
<P>
 A Dec. 8 letter from the city parks department to Milligan rejected his claim, 
stating: "Upon the advice of the City Attorney, the Department is unable to 
return the cashier's check at this time."  
</P>
<P>
 Milligan said the city's inability to confirm the legal action he has taken 
against it is an example of "the left hand not knowing what the right hand is 
doing. It's a good example of what I've been dealing with for five years."

BURBANK; POLICE WIDEN INQUIRY IN HIT-AND-RUN DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Burbank police have stepped up efforts to find the driver whose car struck and 
killed a Glendale High School student as she and her date were walking to their 
car after a homecoming dance at The Castaway restaurant last month. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 300 students at the high school were interviewed last week, and 
hundreds of letters have been sent to students' parents as police search for 
clues to who caused the death of Lili Barajas, an 11th-grade student.  
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred just before midnight Nov. 11 -- Lili's 16h birthday. She 
died the following day. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is still no suspect in the case, police say they hope the 
interviews will help lead them to the driver of the dark gray 1980s Chevrolet 
Camaro Z-28 that struck the girl and her escort, Gonzalo Espinozo, who suffered 
a broken arm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're following up on the interviews," Officer Manny Garcia said 
Tuesday. "Some students gave us the names of other students who may know 
something or may have heard something, so we're following up on each one. 
There's a lot of leg work involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Lili and Espinozo had left the dance and were walking back to the car along an 
access road leading to the hilltop restaurant when they were hit. Witnesses 
have told police that the car that struck the couple was weaving erratically 
and police believe the driver may have been intoxicated, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 The high school had rented one of three banquet rooms at the restaurant for 
the dance. The other two rooms were rented by a group of Armenian students from 
UCLA and a wedding party.  
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA students concluded their function that night about 1 a.m., and police 
have sent 297 letters to people who attended in hopes of finding new 
information. Police have also contacted people who attended the wedding 
reception but, because that event ended about an hour before the accident, it 
is unlikely that the suspect was one of the attendees, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale High School Dean of Students Hasmik Danielian said the school is 
doing its best to help police bring the suspect to justice. During the student 
interviews, which lasted all week, police used the school's offices and 
conference rooms, Danielian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Danielian said she does not think the suspect was one of Lili's classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything is possible, but we know there was no drinking at our party. None 
whatsoever," Danielian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia added that, based on their interviews with the students, police also 
think it is unlikely that a fellow student is responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our impression was that if it was someone from Glendale High, the students 
would have turned them in," he said. STEVE RYFLE

INVITE STUDENTS TO SPEAK

 Students soon may be invited to speak at City Council meetings under a special 
program that will allow them to deliver three-minute updates on what's going on 
at high school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's something in their craw, maybe we could let them talk about it," 
said Tony Petros, a Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce education committee 
representative who suggested the idea to council members at Monday's study 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 All five council members said they liked the idea of having students speak at 
the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The only question left unanswered was whether the students would talk before 
or after the oral communication time reserved for the rest of the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed program, juniors or seniors from Estancia, Costa Mesa and 
Back Bay high schools would take turns speaking at every other council meeting, 
offering information on recent campus activities, including academics, sports 
and art. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Joe Erickson liked the idea but noted jokingly: "Three minutes is a long 
speech if you're in high school." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will vote on the proposal at its next meeting, scheduled for 
Monday. TOM RAGAN

OKS REVISED CITY WORKER CONTRACTS

<P>
 The City Council has approved contracts that trim some health benefits for two 
city employee unions to allow for pay raises for some employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The council last week approved the agreements with the San Juan Capistrano 
Management Employees Assn. and the San Juan Capistrano City Employees Assn.The 
two unions represent more than 70 employees and include every city worker 
except department heads. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreements were based on a compensation study done for the city. The study 
found that 19 of the city's union employees made more than comparable employees 
in the private and public sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 Those employees' salaries will be frozen this year, said Cynthia Pendleton, 
director of administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
 Pendleton said that the contracts will expire June 30, 1995, and that salary 
increases will be retroactive to Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The health benefits savings to pay for the salary increases will be about 
$100,000, Pendleton said. JEFF BEAN

CRASH SPILLS CHEMICALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two people suffered minor injuries in a collision that caused 20 gallons of 
swimming pool chemicals to spill on El Toro Road and shut down traffic for 
about an hour Tuesday morning, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A pickup truck driven by Sang You, 34, and a car driven by Juan 
Vargas-Palomeque, 25, collided at Aliso Park Drive and El Toro Road about 7:20 
a.m., Sheriff's Lt. Bill Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
 You was carrying the pool chemicals in the back of his pickup. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard said one of the drivers ran a red light but it hadn't been determined 
whether it was You or Vargas-Palomeque. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Department spokeswoman Kathleen Cha said four gallons of muriatic 
acid and 16 gallons of chlorine were spilled in the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 When mixed, the two chemicals produced toxic vapors that can be "a real 
powerful respiratory irritant," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Muriatic acid, a common industrial cleaning agent, can cause irritation to the 
eyes and skin. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's hazardous materials unit and firefighters used soda ash to 
neutralize the acid and washed it down with water.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CENTRAL; TUSTIN; ACCORD REACHED ON CITY ATTY. STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has reached a compromise on requirements of a possible new 
city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Thomas R. Saltarelli, Councilman Jim Potts and City Manager William A. 
Huston had all proposed slightly different versions of a request for 
qualifications that will be sent out to legal firms after the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Saltarelli's main concern was that Tustin should establish high standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we make these qualifications too minimal," Saltarelli said, "we'll have a 
sea of applications coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin is seeking an attorney who has practiced at least seven years and is 
familiar with the issues facing a general-law city. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than three decades, Tustin has contracted for legal services from 
Rourke, Woodruff & Spradlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Potts said that after such a long time, the city needs to "see what's out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney representing the city would need to be experienced in a wide 
variety of legal matters. Among the complex issues facing the city in coming 
years will be the reuse of the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government may close the helicopter training base as early as 
1997. ALAN EYERLY

GANG MEMBER WILL SERVE 7 YEARS IN SLAYING OF YOUTH 
</P>

<P>
 A gang member convicted of first-degree murder in the killing of a church 
choirboy was sentenced Tuesday to 25 years to life, but will only serve about 
seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge David O. Carter gave Tu Anh Do, 18, of 
Garden Grove a chance at rehabilitation, in part because he had no history of 
violence and because of his limited role in the Aug. 6, 1993, killing of Lozaro 
Omar Acosta Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta, a sophomore at Century High School and a church choirboy, was sitting 
in his parents' car in convenience store parking lot in Orange when rival gang 
members opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
 A stray bullet struck and killed Acosta, who was about to depart on a weekend 
church retreat with his parents. His parents were in the convenience store 
buying snacks for the retreat when the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Do was a juvenile at the time of the killing but was tried as an adult and 
convicted of first-degree murder and an additional charge for belonging to a 
street gang. Do was not armed and did not participate in the shootout. But 
under state law he was held as culpable. 
</P>
<P>
 Do has prior arrests for petty theft and burglary. The California Youth 
Authority concluded that Do would be a good candidate for CYA treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robin Park wanted Do sentenced to 25 years to life in state 
prison. But Carter sentenced Do to the CYA, which releases inmates upon their 
25th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Do's defense attorney could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other gang members have been sentenced or await trial in Acosta's 
killing.

COUNTY RECEIVES $3.9-MILLION GRANT FOR HEALTH TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleven months after the Northridge earthquake wrecked buildings and rattled 
nerves, Los Angeles County received a federal grant Tuesday that will allow it 
to dispatch mobile health teams to treat people suffering from lingering 
quake-related health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials admitted that timing of the $3.9-million grant -- which has 
been held up in Washington since February -- is not the best. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jonathan Freedman, the county's deputy director of public health programs, 
said late money is better than no money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in an odd dilemma," he said. "Do we not take this money? I think we can 
do a lot of good with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The grant, originally part of the federal government's $3-billion earthquake 
relief bill, will be used to hire about 25 nurses, counselors and community 
outreach workers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams will travel hard-hit neighborhoods in vans, inquiring about the 
physical and psychological health of residents, Freedman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the target populations, he said, will be elderly people and the homeless 
-- two groups that might have been overlooked immediately after the quake and 
have not had access to health care since. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't respond very well to their needs right after the quake," Freedman 
said. "And a lot of elderly people, in particular, have chronic conditions. 
What we want to make sure is that check-ups regarding those conditions have not 
been interrupted." 
</P>
<P>
 The mobile clinics will offer on-the-spot check-ups and counseling, Freedman 
said, but people with more serious problems will be referred to clinics and 
other health care providers. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is similar to one that has been operating in south Florida since 
Hurricane Andrew struck the area two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials hope to have the local mobile clinics operating within 60 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 The vans will drive around the San Fernando Valley, Santa Monica, the 
Hollywood and Wilshire areas, and South-Central Los Angeles, officials said.

L. A. COUNCIL OKS PLAN TO AID QUAKE VICTIMS IN 2,400-ACRE AREA; RECOVERY: IT IS 
THE FOURTH ZONE AUTHORIZED IN MONTH. SIMILAR PROPOSAL FOR NORTHWEST VALLEY 
COMES UNDER FIRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council voted Tuesday to use redevelopment powers to aid 
quake victims in hard-hit neighborhoods of Canoga Park, Reseda and Winnetka, 
the fourth such recovery plan approved in the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, 2,400 acres in the west San Fernando Valley will be included 
in an emergency redevelopment area so that tax dollars can be siphoned away 
over a 45-year period to provide quake assistance funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment area is expected to generate $10 million over five years, 
money that will be used for residential and commercial loans and funds to 
rebuild public structures such as libraries and bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be watching this effort like a hawk to make certain that the process 
remains driven by the community and that the programs meet the needs of our 
residents and businesses," said Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents the 
neighborhoods within the redevelopment area. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same meeting, a proposal for a similar but much larger redevelopment 
project in the northwest Valley continued to be harshly criticized by area 
residents as well as council members and redevelopment officials. 
</P>
<P>
 That proposed emergency redevelopment project would include 21,000 acres of 
residential and commercial neighborhoods in Northridge, Chatsworth, Granada 
Hills, Porter Ranch and North Hills, the hardest hit areas of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The contentious hearing Tuesday was the second for the project, which would be 
the largest of six redevelopment efforts proposed for the Valley and Hollywood. 
A final vote is not expected until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, which was designed in large part by a committee of appointed 
residents from the area, is limited in scope, generating $25 million that would 
be used as loan-guarantee funds to make it easier for quake victims to get 
traditional bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike four previously approved redevelopment projects, none of the money 
raised by the northwest Valley's project would go toward repairing public 
structures. 
</P>
<P>
 Several critics complained that the project area was too vast, including 
nearly an entire council district, and that it would take a disproportionate 
share of tax dollars away from schools, and police and fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson, who represents the area proposed for the redevelopment 
project, said the project is large because his district suffered about 80% of 
the city's quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason the project is throughout the district is that the damage is so 
extensive there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A report from the city's Community Redevelopment Agency said all six proposed 
redevelopment programs are expected to divert a total of $417 million in 
property taxes over the next 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment project for the northwest Valley would divert $245 million 
over the same period, according to the report. But the report said the money 
would be raised by diverting only 6.6% from the available tax stream, the 
smallest percentage of all six projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several council members were concerned about how much the plan would 
cost, some were confused by the slew of cost figures provided by opponents and 
supporters at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm questioning the numbers as provided by the CRA," said Councilman Mike 
Hernandez, who has said he will vote against the project unless his concerns 
about the costs are addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg agreed. "I'm very concerned with the numbers 
game," she said. "I don't feel comfortable with the dollars and cents." 
</P>
<P>
 Bobbi Fiedler and Cynthia McClain-Hill, members of the CRA board who spoke 
against the project, said the plan was drafted with too many restrictions, some 
of which made the entire project illegal until city lawyers rewrote the plan 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the hearing, a frustrated Bernson said he was willing to review 
the plan to make changes to address some of the criticisms. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that he is willing to kill the entire project if he is unable to 
reach an agreement between his committee of appointed residents and critics on 
the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's either going to be narrow and tailored for my council district . . . or 
I don't want it," he said.

VALLEY BRIEFING: CRIME BY THE NUMBERS; NEW FBI REPORT DETAILS CRIME IN VALLEY 
REGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The crime rate dropped across the nation in the first half of 1994, and Los 
Angeles and San Fernando Valley-area cities were part of the trend. 
</P>
<P>
 Citywide, 378 homicides were reported during the first six months of this 
year, contrasted with 532 during the same period in 1993. For all eight crimes 
covered in a recent FBI survey, the decrease was 13%, surpassing an average 6% 
drop for U.S. cities of more than 1 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lancaster, there were 12.3% fewer crimes; in Santa Clarita, 3.7% fewer 
crimes, and in Glendale, 8.8% fewer crimes. Overall, crime reported to the 
nation's law enforcement agencies in cities of more than 100,000 residents was 
down 3% for the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But how frequently do crimes occur in cities in the San Fernando Valley 
region? The rates vary. In another FBI study released this month, this one 
assessing crimes in 1993, Los Angeles logged 8,873 crimes per 100,000 people. 
By contrast, suburban Santa Clarita had 3,253 crimes per 100,000 residents that 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a breakdown, from the 1993 report, of major crime categories in the 
Valley region: Murder and Non-negligent Manslaughter 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Hills: 0 
</P>
<P>
 Burbank: 5 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas: 1 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale: 9 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster: 7 
</P>

 Los Angeles: 1,076

POLICE IDENTIFY PEDESTRIAN STRUCK, KILLED ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pedestrian who was struck and killed while trying to cross the San Diego 
Freeway during rush hour was identified Tuesday as Jack Alan Hall of Santa Ana, 
the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, 42, was struck by a car that was heading north on the freeway at 55 
m.p.h. about 5:30 p.m. Monday, CHP Officer Joan Rivas said.He was pronounced 
dead at the scene, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators do not know why Hall had been trying to cross the San Diego 
Freeway north of Beach Boulevard, Rivas said. The driver was not cited. 
</P>
<P>
 The car-pool lane was shut down for more than an hour as officers investigated 
the accident, slowing down traffic for afternoon commuters on a four-mile 
stretch of the freeway, Rivas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident was the second this week in which a pedestrian crossing an Orange 
County freeway was struck and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, Steven Moreno, 13, died while running across the northbound lanes 
of the Santa Ana Freeway at Broadway in Santa Ana. Moreno was taking a shortcut

MAN CONVICTED OF MURDERING AGED MOTHER; COURTS: JURY MUST NOW DECIDE IF HE WAS 
INSANE AT TIME OF SUFFOCATING HER.

<P>
 Jurors convicted a San Clemente man Tuesday of first-degree murder, but now 
must decide whether he was insane when he killed his 76-year-old mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford L. Burgess, 45, has pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity in the 
Sept. 6, 1992, suffocation of Mary Burgess. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Superior Court jury deliberated about four hours Tuesday 
before convicting Burgess of murder based on evidence that included fresh 
scratches on his face and a blood splatter linked to the victim, according to 
prosecutor Carolyn Kirkwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury must reconvene today to begin hearing evidence about Burgess' mental 
state at the time of the killing. Defense attorney Jack Earley said the 
evidence will show Burgess has a history of depression and had intended to kill 
himself when he decided to also kill his mother so she would not be left with 
no one to care for her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved his mother very much, they had lived their whole lives together," 
said Earley. "He wanted to be with her in heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 After killing his mother, Burgess slashed his wrists but did not die. Several 
hours later, he called police, who arrived at their house and found Mary 
Burgess' body.

LAGUNA MAN ARRESTED IN UNLICENSED INSURANCE FIRM CASE; CRIME: THE COMPANY SOLD 
WORTHLESS AUTO POLICIES, WITH PREMIUMS TOTALING $11.2 MILLION, AUTHORITIES SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Authorities have arrested the former owner of a Laguna Beach insurance firm 
accused of selling 15,000 worthless auto insurance policies, state officials 
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert M. Granafei, 46, of Laguna Beach surrendered to authorities Monday on 
suspicion of running an unlicensed insurance company, which officials said left 
nearly 500 claims unpaid, according to state Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi. 
</P>
<P>
 Granafei, released on $10,000 bail, is to be arraigned Jan. 9 on a felony 
count and three misdemeanor charges of illegal operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Insurance shut down the Underwriters Reserve Ltd. in 
May, 1993, on suspicion that it had sold worthless auto policies costing a 
yearly average of $750. The department also seized affiliates in Fountain 
Valley, Downey and Lakeside. Insurance Department spokeswoman Candysse Miller 
said it and the Orange County district attorney's office have been 
investigating the case in the year and a half since then.  
</P>
<P>
 "They've been looking at the case since that time, tracking money and also 
sorting out the business," she said. Granafei faces a maximum of three years in 
jail if he is found guilty. The law doesn't require him to pay the money back, 
but Miller said investigators are trying to find ways to have policyholders 
reimbursed as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The company operated for nearly a year, collecting $11.2 million in premiums, 
Garamendi said. Authorities have seized nearly $2 million in assets, most of 
which were in a Swiss bank account, Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said the company violated state law barring unlicensed California 
firms from selling insurance. The company claimed to be based in the Caribbean 
island of St. Kitts, but investigators found it was run from Laguna Beach, 
Garamendi said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said unpaid claims from 472 policyholders total $4.8 million.

INS AGENT SHOOTS HIMSELF IN THE LEG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal immigration officer accidentally shot himself in the leg Tuesday at 
the target range, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based Immigration and Naturalization Service agent, whose 
identity was withheld by authorities, was wounded in the upper leg while 
holstering his 9-millimeter handgun during routine training, said INS spokesman 
Rico Cabrera. 
</P>
<P>
 The agent, assigned to the deportation branch, was treated at Huntington Beach 
Medical Center and released, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's fine," Cabrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agent was among a group of INS officers shooting at a range owned by the 
Huntington Beach police officers' union when the accident occurred shortly 
before 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach police were not investigating the incident, said Police Lt. 
Chuck R. Poe.

ANAHEIM MAY FACE SPECIAL ELECTION FOR COUNCIL SEAT; VACANCY: THE FOUR MEMBERS 
DEADLOCK ON MAKING AN APPOINTMENT TO THE POSITION. THAT COULD RESULT IN SPECIAL 
BALLOTING THAT WOULD COST CITY ABOUT $100,000. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The city appears headed for a special election, after the City Council on 
Tuesday failed to agree on who should fill a vacant seat on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the council will try to make the appointment again next week, council 
members Bob Zemel and Lou Lopez said the vacancy should be filled by a vote of 
the people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the right to vote for the citizens of Anaheim. . . . I can't do 
it," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 A motion by Councilman Frank Feldhaus to appoint Shirley A. McCracken, the 
third-highest vote-getter in the Nov. 8 election, was supported by Mayor Tom 
Daly but not by Lopez or Zemel. 
</P>
<P>
 Zemel, in a lengthy and detailed presentation, said McCracken should not be 
appointed simply because she placed third and that the most qualified person 
might be someone who didn't even run in the election. 
</P>
<P>
 If the council cannot reach a consensus by Jan. 29, which is 60 days after the 
seat became vacant, a date for a special election will be set, probably in 
June, at a cost of about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Several McCracken supporters urged the council to appoint her. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing we cannot do is spend any additional money," said former 
Councilwoman Miriam Kaywood. 
</P>
<P>
 And unless the council appoints a fifth member, she said, it will experience 
"turmoil . . . with 2-to-2 split votes. It's crucial that the city not be 
handicapped and be able to act." 
</P>
<P>
 McCracken would not say whether she would run in a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult time for a special election not only for the city but for 
candidates who have to go out and raise money," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the third-highest vote-getter in the November election, in which the 
top-two finishers in a field of 16 candidates were elected to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 McCracken's total of 10,866 votes gave her only a slim lead over fourth-place 
finisher Paul V. Bostwick with 10,613 votes and Sharon A. Ericson, who finished 
fifth with 10,533 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Bostwick urged the council to appoint him, while Ericson's 
supporters called for a special election. 
</P>
<P>
 The vacancy was caused by an election quirk that arose after a 1992 charter 
amendment changed the mayoral selection process. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, mayoral candidates had to be sitting council members, and they 
competed for two-year terms. This was the first year that the mayor was elected 
at large for a four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Daly was in the middle of his council term when he was reelected Nov. 
8, two years of his council tenure remain. His seat had to remain vacant during 
the election in case he lost the mayor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's current financial crisis was mentioned often Tuesday night as a 
reason for the council to act quickly. But Zemel disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's imperative that before an appointment is made, we get to the 
bottom of our financial problems," he said. "The city is in the most uncertain 
time in its history, and we need to show leadership. We need to stay focused on 
the task at hand and not let this appointment get in the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said he was disappointed that the council was unable to reach a consensus 
and asked that the item be placed on next week's council agenda so the group 
could try again. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many important decisions that have to be made in the coming 
weeks and months," Daly said. "My concern is that without a full council, we 
won't have the benefit of complete discussion and a full range of views."

POLICE TO EXPLAIN PARTY ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newport Beach Police Chief Robert J. McDonell and Sgt. Andy Gonis will host an 
informational community meeting tonight about the city's new party ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance was tentatively approved Monday night and is expected to get 
final approval in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the city bills residents $150 if police have to go to the same 
address more than once in 30 days to quiet loud parties. Under the new 
ordinance, fines would range from $250 for the second party call to one address 
in a year to $500 for the third call and $750 for the fourth and each 
subsequent call. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be at 7 p.m. at Newport Beach City Hall, 3300 Newport Blvd.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA'S NEW MAYOR OUTLINES HER GOALS 
FOR YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jo Anne Darcy began her second stint as Santa Clarita's mayor Tuesday night, 
stating her goals for the upcoming year and urging residents to become more 
involved in local issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your participation . . . will spell the difference between our success and 
failure as a community," Darcy said, after receiving the council gavel from 
outgoing Mayor George Pederson and a standing ovation from about 100 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Darcy, 62, presented a list of 10 goals she wanted to pursue in her first 100 
days as mayor. They include appointing citizen advisory panels for the city's 
redevelopment agency, developing revitalization plans for the east Newhall and 
Canyon Country areas, creating a youth master plan, planning an east-west 
traffic corridor and launching business incentive programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a hard year," said Darcy. "We've got some things we've got 
to get moving on." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Clarita mayor's job goes each year to the council member who got the 
most votes in the last election, but the mayor has no more formal authority 
than the other council members. The mayor does chair the biweekly council 
meetings, however, and makes ceremonial appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Carl Boyer was named mayor pro tem Tuesday, as next in line, he 
will serve as mayor in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Darcy was first elected to the council when the city incorporated in December, 
1987. She also serves as a field deputy to Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 Darcy was decisively reelected in April to her third City Council term. More 
than half of the 10,252 voters cast one of their three ballots for her, and she 
was the top vote-getter in 40 of the city's 51 precincts and among the absentee 
ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson, 70, will continue to serve on the council. His mayoral term was 
dominated by the Northridge earthquake and Santa Clarita's efforts to recover 
from it, including the creation of a controversial redevelopment plan that has 
been bogged down in legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been a very active year," said Pederson. "The most important thing was 
trying to ensure that this community felt and knew that the city was working 
hard for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson's efforts included manning phone banks that were set up in Santa 
Clarita's quake-battered City Hall, working alongside city workers who had been 
displaced from their offices.

 Antelope Valley Union High School District officials had pushed for the use of 
the old jail, hoping that the facility's grim surroundings would scare wayward 
kids straight. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will have a tremendous visual impact on the kids there," said district 
Trustee Bill Olenick. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal approved by the supervisors calls for the county, which owns the 
jail site, to provide classroom space to the high school district within 30 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 The district will pay no rent, but the agreement is subject to cancellation at 
any time in case the facility is needed for other purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Supervisor Mike Antonovich has suggested that the jail could be 
used as a detention center for illegal immigrants before their expulsion from 
the United States. Other officials have said that because of an increase in the 
number of prisoners due to the "three strikes" legislation, Mira Loma might be 
forced to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 The jail was closed last year because of county budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley district will likely have plenty of students to send to 
Mira Loma. Because of its tough "zero tolerance" policy on major offenses, 
Antelope Valley schools expelled 200 students last year. School officials have 
said they were uncomfortable having the former students wandering the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Olenick said many of those former students would do anything to get back into 
school, even if the school is in an old jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich, who introduced the measure to the supervisors, said the use of 
Mira Loma as a last-chance school was a good way to reintroduce the students to 
the mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity to give these kids a second chance," Antonovich said. "If 
they fail, then at least the community gave them that second chance." 
</P>
<P>
 The facility has space for about 100 youths, Olenick said.

THE BATTLE FOR BREANA'S LIFE; FOR 23 MONTHS, THE MCDONALDS OF IRVINE HAVE 
JUGGLED HOPE AND DESPAIR. EVEN AS THEIR DAUGHTER'S LEUKEMIA SURGES, MEDICAL

 The shudder lifted Frank McDonald's head off the pillow. He rolled over but 
couldn't drift back to sleep. Something's wrong, he thought, as he sat up and 
looked around the dark room in Children's Hospital of Orange County in Orange.  
</P>
<P>
 Frank and his wife, Jan, had learned much in the past year while shuttling 
their gravely ill daughter from one doctor's office to the next. They could 
rattle off obscure medical terms or navigate through a morass of insurance 
forms and regulations. More than that, they could recognize that cold whisper 
of dread that signals trouble. When you have a child on the edge, no sleep is 
deep. 
</P>
<P>
 On that Friday after Thanksgiving, Frank stepped toward the bed of his 
23-month-old daughter, Breana. In the dim light he saw his child atop the 
starched white sheet, surrounded by a shadow. He flicked on the light and saw 
she was lying in a pool of blood that had trickled out of a transfusion device 
feeding into her chest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I about lost it," the 34-year-old U.S. Marine said. "I pushed the button for 
help and ran out into the hallway shouting for the nurses." 
</P>
<P>
 Help arrived in time, and Breana, again, had dodged a bullet. "I was sure we 
had lost her, after all that's happened, all we've been through," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shadows have been around beautiful Breana Kay McDonald since the day she was 
born, so slight and weak, with Down's syndrome and a hole in her heart. Her 
first year was rough, marked with harrowing seizures, but her prognosis after 
corrective heart surgery in April, 1993, was decent. Then the news came earlier 
this year, landing with a numbing thud in the hearts of her parents: Breana had 
the early stages of leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that day, the odyssey for the Irvine parents and child has been 
alternately inspiring and wrenching. The battle to save Breana, a battle not 
yet resolved, will only be won if she has her cancerous bone marrow replaced -- 
an area of medicine that has seen some landmark advances and successes in 
recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 The McDonalds only have to look in the room next door to Breana's room at CHOC 
to see the benefits of these cutting-edge techniques. Her neighbor is Aida 
Jacinto of Glendale, a 6-month-old who is recovering nicely from an 
experimental procedure performed by Breana's doctor to halt her leukemia with a 
megadose of marrow cells. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther away but even closer in situation is 5-year-old Christy Schwartz, a 
Cleveland girl getting a second chance at life thanks to her newborn sister. 
Doctors plan to replace Christy's tainted marrow with an infusion of rich, 
marrow-producing blood culled from the umbilical cord delivered during her 
sister's Nov. 22 birth. 
</P>
<P>
 Breana was slated last month to receive that very same treatment, which has 
been performed fewer than 70 times worldwide. Frank and Jan had their second 
child, Mariana, on Nov. 1, and specialists were on hand to collect, test and 
freeze the cord blood that was a close genetic matched to Breana. But before 
the transfusion could be performed, Breana's leukemia, which had been dormant, 
surged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know; I was kind of expecting it," Jan, 25, said the day after the 
test results arrived with the worst news possible. "Something told me not to go 
buy a turkey at the commissary. Something told me we'd be spending Thanksgiving 
at the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Breana will be at CHOC throughout the holidays. She is a couple of weeks into 
two months of chemotherapy, a treatment she may not survive because of her weak 
heart. If she does weather the barrage of chemicals and radiation, and her 
leukemia goes into remission, she will again be eligible for the extraordinary 
cord blood procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 The technique has the potential to change the way leukemia and other marrow 
disorders are treated, eliminating lengthy searches for donors and the painful 
process they undergo to surrender marrow. Evidence also suggests that cord 
blood, taken from afterbirth that is typically discarded, makes for a safer 
transplant, reducing the chance of rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 For the McDonalds, the dazzling promise of the cord-blood technique was a 
high-tech life preserver they clung to during the months before Mariana's 
birth. They coped with Breana's roller-coaster health by reassuring themselves 
that everything would be fine, just as long as the leukemia stayed dormant 
until they had the cord blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these things were going on, the pregnancy and keeping an eye on Breana," 
Frank said. "The clock was ticking. Then we got the cord blood, but before they 
could use it, well, I guess we just ran out of time. Now we have to see if she 
can make it through the chemo. It's all in God's hands, again." "We Would Do 
Whatever We Had To." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan McDonald knew even before she looked at her firstborn for the first time. 
She had known for three days, since the dream. She had seen a giggling girl, 
maybe 4 or 5 years old, standing beside a Christmas tree surrounded by brightly 
wrapped gifts. The child's face was familiar, somehow, and it was different 
than most youngsters'. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could see she had Down's syndrome," Jan remembered, trailing a finger 
down her own cheek. "Her face. . .You could just tell. That's when I knew." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, the delivery room team was busy over the minutes-old child, 
who had swallowed a great deal of blood during the delivery. Jan looked past 
their gloves and pump and studied her daughter's features. "I told Frank right 
then. He looked but wasn't sure, but I was." 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had been married for four years. His stint as a Marine helicopter 
mechanic had taken them from South Carolina to Hawaii and then, in 1992, to 
Orange County. They were scared when doctors confirmed Jan's intuition. "We 
didn't know anything about it all, what it meant really for us or Breana," Jan 
recalled. "We knew we loved her, though, and we would do whatever we had to." 
</P>
<P>
 Breana was a month old when her parents watched her stiffen and go wide-eyed 
for the first time. The seizures were part of the medical baggage that often 
accompanies Down's, as were the coronary problems. The troubles worsened two 
months later when a wall separating chambers in Breana's heart blew out. 
</P>
<P>
 The McDonalds were seeing their world change. Other matters were quickly 
eclipsed by the onslaught of medical problems. They were far from their 
families back East, so they managed on their own. Some good friends and Marines 
stepped forward to help. The couple found themselves edgy most of the time, 
tired and drained, living day to day, clinic to clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Marine Corps was sympathetic and helpful -- a program for parents of 
ill children allowed Frank to juggle his schedule and remain at home when his 
unit was shipped overseas -- the government's insurance programs were less 
cooperative. Jan spent long, tense hours on the phone trying to sort out the 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
 A toll was being taken on the couple. Their relationship was tested by 
short-fuse frustrations, and they found little time for themselves. On Jan. 28, 
though, they set aside some rare time for each other. They didn't know it at 
the time, but they were creating their second child and, maybe, a second chance 
for Breana. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor called later that same night, and we had to rush off to the 
hospital because Breana's blood work came back," Frank said. "When they said 
'leukemia,' the room started spinning for me. I had to grab a chair to keep 
from failing over." 
</P>
<P>
 The clock was ticking. The cancer was in a latent stage but could surge at any 
time. Doctors hurried Breana into a second heart surgery they had hoped could 
wait until she was older and stronger. There was no time to wait. They needed 
her heart to be ready for the arduous months ahead, should chemotherapy be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Bone Marrow Registry in Minnesota began screenings to find a 
potential match for Breana. The playful, tow-headed girl would need a 
transplant to quell the leukemia, doctors agreed. Jan and Frank and their 
relatives underwent DNA tests, but they didn't offer the perfect match doctors 
were seeking. Then, when Jan discovered she was pregnant, a new, better option 
-- the cord blood technique -- became available. Envisioning Two Healthy 
Daughters 
</P>
<P>
 The big day, Nov. 1, began badly. Jan was scheduled to undergo a Cesarean to 
deliver her second child at 2 p.m., but the McDonalds arrived at the hospital 
early in the morning. Breana, fidgety and cranky, needed her weekly blood work 
to chart the status of her nascent leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as Breana saw one of the brightly decorated, closet-sized phlebotomy 
labs at CHOC, she began to squirm and wail. She recognized the room, and the 
familiar feel of the rubber strap wound around her arm, and she wanted no part 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the hardest things is watching her get poked and prodded all the 
time," Frank said, as he caressed Breana's head and nuzzled her bright red 
cheek. "We can't explain to her either why all this is going on, why Mommy and 
Daddy let her get hurt all the time. Some days are worse than others, but it's 
never easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Breana's face was flushed as the lab technician, a woman with a gentle voice, 
tried to win over the little girl with offers of candy and a colorful sticker. 
Breana threw the candy back at her. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan held onto Breana's legs as the technician probed the crook of the little 
girl's elbow, searching for a vein. "She's been irritable the past few days," 
Jan explained. "I think she senses something big. She can tell we're anxious, 
and it makes her anxious, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 After three tries, the needle found a vein. But after a few moments, the woman 
shook her head disapprovingly as she tapped the small vial. "I didn't get 
enough. We'll have to try the other side." 
</P>
<P>
 As the edgy parents watched, the tech worked on the other arm. Finally, it was 
over. Frank and Jan were visibly drained as they made their way past the 
parents and children in the noisy hallway. Breana was withdrawn, sobbing and 
half asleep. "Not a good way to start the day," Jan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents dropped a sleeping Breana off at the house of some friends and 
headed back to the hospital. They were worried, because the child had never 
been away from them before, and wondered how she'd take it when she woke up and 
they were not there. 
</P>
<P>
 The excitement and anxiety that surround any birth were doubled by the stakes 
riding on the cord blood collection and matching. In the end, though, 
everything went off without a hitch. Mariana, 9 pounds, 6 ounces, announced her 
arrival to the entire nursery with a set of very healthy lungs. The doctors 
were all smiles as they filed out of the delivery room with a hearty amount of 
cord blood, ample for their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank beamed behind his surgical mask as he watched his new daughter grip one 
of his fingers. "She's beautiful, isn't she?" he asked of everyone in range. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariana met her sister the next morning. Jan held the tightly bundled baby 
next to her on the hospital bed as Breana pointed at the newest family member 
and giggled. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests began on the cord blood. Early indications were that the match was not 
perfect but was close enough to proceed. Dr. Mitchell Cairo, director of bone 
marrow transplantation at CHOC, said the infusion could take place after a few 
weeks of tests and preparation. The McDonalds envisioned a Christmas with two 
healthy daughters. The Mood Was Gray 
</P>
<P>
 No one noticed the lump in Breana's cheek until some family friends visited 
the McDonalds on Nov. 5, Frank's birthday. The visitors had with them their 
little boy with a round face that drew coos from Frank. "Your daughter has 
chubby cheeks, too," the boy's mother cheerfully countered. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really surprised me," Jan said, "because Breana's always been so thin, 
we're trying to fatten her up. We looked and, sure enough, from where they were 
sitting, it looked like she did. It was just one chubby cheek, though." 
</P>
<P>
 Breana stuck her tongue out playfully the next day when a new specialist 
peered into her mouth and studied the growth. It could be a side-effect of 
tooth formation, he said, shining a light in the girl's mouth. Or, the parents 
knew without hearing it, it could announce the arrival of full-blown leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood was gray when the worst news comes back. "We were just a little 
late," Frank said aloud, but to himself. Any cord blood miracle would have to 
be put on hold. The couple tried to put on their best face when Jan's mom, Kay, 
arrived from Georgia to help out and to, as she said before her voice trailed 
off, "see Breana, just in case. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before Thanksgiving -- and a day before Breana was readmitted to the 
hospital for her first bout of chemotherapy -- the McDonalds and Kay took 
Breana to CHOC for a battery of tests and preparation procedures. They were 
joined by a friend, Michelle Vallens of Los Alamitos, who brought burgers and 
fries. The weary parents took turns eating at a concrete picnic bench outside 
the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at the table, Jan stared up at the afternoon blue skies and offered a 
halfhearted smile. "Frank and I both know that she might not make it," she 
said. "But we just tell ourselves that if she goes, she goes to God, to heaven, 
where she won't suffer anymore. It comforts me; it makes it easier. I don't 
know that I could make it any other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Vallens, a friend who met the McDonalds through church, was sitting across 
from Jan. Vallens lost her son, an 8-year-old with cerebral palsy, last year to 
chronic renal failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I was (at the hospital) was the night my son, Jonathan, died," 
Vallens said. "This is like a nightmare revisited. I came down when I heard 
about Breana, but it's not easy being here. Even if you have strong faith, it 
is so hard to understand how these things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Jan nodded. "I know." Heaven Was Guaranteed  
</P>
<P>
 The next day Breana was checked into a sterilized, "clean room" on the third 
floor oncology ward at CHOC. Before entering the ward's glass-walled rooms, all 
visitors scrubbed thoroughly and donned a surgical mask, made less ominous by 
its pink and blue teddy bear design. 
</P>
<P>
 The McDonalds adopted a new schedule: Frank worked all day at the Tustin 
Marine Corps Helicopter Air Station while Jan stayed at the hospital with 
Breana and Mariana. In the evening, Frank arrived for his shift and spent the 
night while Jan and the infant headed home. The couple saw little of each 
other, and their fatigue and worry was visible. 
</P>
<P>
 The first round of chemotherapy had little visible impact on Breana. While her 
health was fragile, she retained an impish love of getting into things. She 
giggled wildly each time she tried to pull the surgical masks off nurses and 
visitors in her version of peek-a-boo. To someone who didn't know her, only the 
medical gear and tubes suggested she was ill. That would change, the doctors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said her hair will start falling out after the next round of chemo," Jan 
said while fetching the toys Breana had gleefully scattered across the floor. 
"So far, though, the only thing we've seen is her appetite go down. She won't 
eat fruits or vegetables anymore. She still likes ice cream, though." 
</P>
<P>
 The McDonalds have to don gloves to change Breana's diapers or risk skin 
burns, a chilling fact that hammers home exactly how powerful are the chemicals 
coursing through her system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, and there's one other thing . . . she has these now," Jan said, pointing 
to freckle-like dots that formed a triangle on Breana's right cheek. The dots 
are tattoos that will help guide radiologists when they begin bombarding the 
lump with radiation. The radiation can damage healthy body tissue and lead to 
painful sores, so the doctors want to target it precisely. 
</P>
<P>
 While Jan and Breana played, several television camera crews filed past the 
door on their way to see the little girl in the next room, a 6-month-old 
Glendale girl named Aida, also in the care of Dr. Cairo, who had been in all 
the newspapers that morning because an experimental bone marrow technique had 
saved her from leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
 The technique used for Aida was different from the cord blood procedure Cairo 
and company plan to use on Breana, but Jan could only see similarities between 
the two sick girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a coincidence, huh? Right next door," Jan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan joked that the media would be visiting both rooms if things had been 
different. Then, "I hope everything works out for that family." 
</P>
<P>
 As the camera crews adjusted their bright lights and tried to coax a smile 
from the infant, Jan craned her neck to get a glimpse of the beautiful child, 
who was being held by a nurse. "I hate cameras, so I guess it's just as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank, ever gregarious and outgoing, had met another youngster on the ward, an 
11-year-old named Brian who was at CHOC for his second bone marrow transplant. 
The first failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met him one day, and the next he was standing in our room when I woke up," 
Frank said. "He said he was bored. I could tell he was lonely, so I played with 
him a while, and we talked. He's a sweet little kid." 
</P>
<P>
 The precocious youngster, a veteran of the hospital scene, had plenty of 
advice to share. "He told me about different painkillers, what to tell the 
nurses and what effect the medications would have on Breana, all kinds of 
stuff. Breana can't tell us what's going on with her, so he helped me 
understand it a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the boy asked Frank for some advice. He said in a matter-of-fact way that 
he knew he would die if his second transplant failed. What he was wondering, he 
said, was if he would go to hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank was taken aback, then reassured his new friend that he was in no danger 
of going to hell. When it was Brian's time to go, Frank continued, heaven would 
be his destination. Guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed to feel better after that. I felt like it was a good thing for me 
to be there when he needed someone. I felt like I gave him something," Frank 
said of the boy, who still awaits a transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank paused and thought for a moment about that gift, and about the dozen 
youngsters on the ward where his daughter will spend her Christmas, maybe even 
her Jan. 4 birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing I pray for is that God would heal every kid in the hospital or at 
least not make them feel the pain, even if it's just for a little while," Frank 
said. "There's a lot of pain there. Too much." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Transplant Alternative 
</P>
<P>
 When bone marrow becomes diseased, it must be replaced. Harvesting blood 
cells, called cord blood, from umbilical cords and placentas offers patients 
with cancer or genetic disorders an alternative to the traditional bone marrow 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Removing Cord Blood 
</P>
<P>
 Cord blood extraction harms neither the newborn nor the mother. It is 
performed after birth and typically culls about 8 ounces. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Placenta and umbilical cord are moved to the lab; syringes are inserted and 
blood withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Blood is processed to isolate stem cells, which contain the building blocks 
necessary for regenerating blood and marrow. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Stem cells are stored until needed and then intravenously infused into 
patient, normally in the chest area. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cord Blood over Bone Marrow 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike bone marrow, stem cells culled from cord blood are not genetically 
encoded and therefore can be used with less closely matched recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 Other advantages: 
</P>
<P>
 * Cord blood is less likely to have graft-versus-host disease, when immune 
cells from transplant attack the patient. 
</P>
<P>
 * Patients with smaller donor pools, including minorities, have access to 
larger donor pools through cord blood banks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Siblings are more likely to be donors. Deep in the Bone 
</P>
<P>
 Bone marrow, a soft, fatty tissue found in bone cavities, is the body's blood 
factory. It is either red -- consisting of red and white blood cells and 
platelets -- or yellow, mostly connective tissue and fat.

 About 1,000 looky-loos visited the exclusive Bear Brand Ranch community in 
Laguna Niguel for a peek inside four distinctive homes decked out for the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Staged by the Chopin Chapter of the Guilds of the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center, the 10th annual Christmas by the Sea event turned out to be an 
all-day affair Saturday that featured the holiday home tour and boutique, a 
luncheon at the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point and fashion show. Guests paid $25 
for the tour and $40 for the luncheon, raising about $35,000 for the center. 
Knocking on Doors 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our treat. We do this once a year, and we want to spend the whole 
day" together, said Maria Sanz, event co-chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 After doing some holiday shopping at a boutique stocked with jewelry, handbags 
and crafts at Salt Creek Beach Park, guests boarded shuttles that took them to 
nearby Bear Brand Ranch. Once inside the gates, they ogled the massive custom 
homes situated on large lots and panoramic views of the surrounding canyons and 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Bear Brand Ranch was chosen for this year's tour because most homes have an 
ocean view -- in keeping with the Christmas by the Sea theme -- and the 
residents were willing to open their doors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's difficult to get people to open up their houses. We had 
another neighborhood chosen but they absolutely would not let us in," said Jill 
Scheetz, event co-chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheetz and company found more than enough friendly residents at Bear Brand 
willing to participate. Committee members chose four homes for their 
distinctive architectural style and decor, and each was spruced up for the 
holidays by a local floral designer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They opened their doors to us," Scheetz said. "These are friendly people 
wanting to support the arts." Open Houses 
</P>
<P>
 Donning blue hospital booties to protect the homes' lush carpeting, guests 
roamed freely about each of the premises, peeking into bathrooms and boudoirs. 
At the 8,000-square-foot Italianate-style estate of Tom and Janet Brown, they 
admired a massive black marble fireplace in the living room, towering white 
columns supporting high ceilings and hand-painted Italian furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Decorating this home was challenging -- and exciting," said Rob Esterley, the 
Laguna Beach floral designer who created lavish garlands and decorations in 
taupe and gold for the home. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sam and Jean Inman's Old World country manor, guests admired a large 
collection of antiques, including an 1800 Taylor & Farley melodeon in the 
living room. Floral designer John Hertrick used ivory topiaries in cast-iron 
urns, French ribbon and ivy mosses to decorate the home. 
</P>
<P>
 The French Normandy-style home of Jim and Sue Slusher featured a Ralph 
Lauren-Polo interior, an oversized living room with a grand piano and 
decorations of hydrangea, ivy, kale and berries intertwined with ribbon -- the 
work of floral designer Anita Rohloff.  
</P>
<P>
 At the French country-style home of George and Tina McFarlin, guests got a 
look inside the huge formal dining room that was designed to seat 22 people,

CITY MUST HOLD SPECIAL ELECTION FOR COUNCIL SEAT; THOUSAND OAKS: OFFICIALS 
DEADLOCK ON WHETHER TO APPOINT A NEW MEMBER TO REPLACE FRANK SCHILLO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With city leaders hopelessly deadlocked, Thousand Oaks must hold a special 
election in June to fill a City Council seat left vacant this fall with Frank 
Schillo's election to the county Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 After hours of intense debate Tuesday evening, City Council members were 
unable to reach a consensus on how to fill the vacancy, splitting 2 to 2 on the 
decision that could ultimately affect the outcome on key development projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of Thousand Oaks residents pleaded with the City Council on Tuesday to 
fill the vacancy with an appointment, rather than a special election, which 
would cost the city $100,000 and threaten to revive the acrimony of this fall's 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
 But others stepped forward to say that replacing Schillo without an election 
would leave residents without a say on a key swing vote who could decide some 
of the biggest development issues facing the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city spent $75,000 for the grand opening party for the Civic Arts Plaza," 
resident Phyllis Evry said. "It spent $150,000 for the copper curtain hanging 
on the outside of this building. I feel we should be able to spend $100,000 for 
the voice of democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 But about 300 residents signed a petition urging the City Council to appoint a 
new member. About 25 residents spoke in favor of the appointment Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 They argued that too many important issues lie in front of the council to put 
off the decision. "Six months of a lame-duck council does us no good," said 
Newbury Park resident Ron Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Councilman Bob Lewis, who came into office in a special election in 
1989 after Councilman Lee Laxdal resigned in the middle of his term, said he 
favors an appointment. In this case, he said, a special election is not 
warranted because voters were aware that Schillo might be leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "All informed voters knew that if Frank Schillo was elected to the Board of 
Supervisors, he would have to resign," Lewis said. "You have an expression of 
the majority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel we need to waste $100,000 on a special election," said Bill 
Williams, who was a council candidate in November. "Let's take the $100,000 and 
hire a new full-time policeman or fix some of the potholes around the city." 
</P>
<P>
 The obvious choice for an appointment, many said, would have been police 
Detective Mike Markey, who finished fourth in November's election. Markey, 
appearing nervous, sat silently in the audience while the question of his fate 
was debated. 
</P>
<P>
 During the election, Markey was endorsed by former Mayor Alex Fiore and 
Schillo, who are both aligned with the council's pro-business, pro-growth 
majority. He received 8.8% of the ballots cast. Incumbent Councilwoman Elois 
Zeanah, who placed third, was reelected with 10.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 But Markey, who declared his intentions to run, may face stiff competition. 
Trudi Loh, who lost by a narrow margin to Schillo in November's supervisor's 
race, said she is considering a run for the fifth council seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "My phone has been ringing off the hook in the last week," Loh said. "Many of 
the people who supported me in the supervisor's race are asking if I will run 
for City Council. A lot of the issues that were of concern in the supervisor's 
race are certainly the same here. I promised them I would consider it." 
</P>
<P>
 The county Board of Elections estimated the cost of holding a special election 
would be at least $98,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Jaime Zukowski said before the meeting that she had been threatened with 
a recall if she voted against the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it very interesting that that would be the kind of approach used," 
Zukowski said. "It's rather hypocritical if cost is really the issue to the 
city since recalls are expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is a power grab going on, it is the factions that are worried they 
may lose the status quo," Zeanah said. "If they're afraid of a special 
election, maybe we should have one." 
</P>
<P>
 In a move seen by some as sheer stubbornness and others as politically savvy, 
Zukowski and Zeanah went into Tuesday's meeting favoring a special election, 
while Councilwoman Judy Lazar and new Councilman Andy Fox wanted to appoint 
Markey to fill Schillo's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a clear decision from the council, the city is mandated to hold a 
special election. Because it is too late to make the filing deadlines for a 
March election, the soonest the election can be held is June 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 All four members have said they fully expect to split 2-2 on many important 
development issues. The fifth person is therefore viewed as a key swing vote on 
upcoming decisions, including developments on the Seventh-day Adventist and Dos 
Vientos properties. 
</P>
<P>
 During the debate, two new options were presented to the council. Zeanah 
suggested that each council member be allowed to nominate up to two candidates 
to fill the spot. At the council's first regularly scheduled meeting in 
January, all four council members would have an opportunity to question and 
consider the nominees before deciding on one, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But her offer, which she described as a compromise, was quickly rejected.

BID TO SCRAP PLANNING BOARD IS CRITICIZED; OXNARD: COUNCIL POSTPONES ACTION ON 
A PROPOSAL TO REPLACE THE COMMISSIONERS WITH A HEARING OFFICER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Former Oxnard council members and planning commissioners Tuesday slammed a 
proposal to abolish the city's Planning Commission, calling it a developer's 
dream, a recipe for corruption and an affront to citizen participation in 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council postponed a decision on whether to dissolve the 
five-member Planning Commission, which city officials characterized as a body 
of amateurs slowing down progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers and small business owners have complained that their projects are 
being delayed without cause -- mainly because planning commissioners are not 
experts in the field and misunderstand what they are expected to do, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, the commission would be replaced with a single hearing 
officer, preferably a planning expert or a lawyer, said City Atty. Gary Gillig. 
</P>
<P>
 But former commissioners and council members, as well as community leaders and 
representatives of environmental and political groups, questioned the true 
motives of the plan, the way it was presented, and the effect it would have on 
politics in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very offensive to me for the city to present these massive changes, 
without warning, at a time when people are too busy to be keeping track of 
their government," said former Oxnard Mayor Jane Tolmach, who also served on 
the Planning Commission. "Why are you afraid to discuss these drastic 
proposals? The way it is presented tells us how much public involvement there 
would be without a Planning Commission." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials scheduled no public hearings on the proposal. It was 
mentioned in passing on the council agenda -- which was released to the public 
Thursday afternoon -- as part of a report on an unrelated subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Chatman, chairman of the Tierra Vista neighborhood council, said doing 
away with the Planning Commission would break Oxnard's recent promise to 
involve more residents in running the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're constantly talking about bringing citizens into the system, making them 
part of the system," Chatman said, "and now we're going to abolish the most 
prestigious commission in the city?" 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, a hearing officer would certify environmental reports and 
process permits the way planning commissioners do, and would hold public 
hearings as frequently as the Planning Commission has, if not more often, 
Gillig said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hearing officer would do a more efficient job, and provide less 
opportunity for naysayers to disrupt the development process without good 
cause, argued City Planner Matthew Winnegar. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Maron, who served for 25 years as a planning commissioner and council 
member, said a hearing officer who could single-handedly decide the fate of 
development could create problems the council has not anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 "He becomes more powerful, I hate to tell you, than any individual council 
member," Maron said to the council. "And there is a great potential for 
corruption." 
</P>
<P>
 She later added that the Planning Commission closely scrutinizes the details 
of a developer's proposal, and doing away with the panel would result in less 
oversight on planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The developer will not have to adhere to some of the tougher rules," Maron 
said. "The public process of the Planning Commission is where the nitty gritty 
gets done. The council would not have time to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Tom Holden said he experienced the Planning Commission's 
bureaucratic red-tape when it took him two years and a $3,000 appeal to the 
City Council just to get an office in town. He said the current system simply 
does not work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not just talking about Shopping at the Rose or factory outlets; we're 
talking about small businesses," Holden said. "The time frame is just too 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Andres Herrera said he does not think the Planning Commission needs 
to be abolished. But, he said, it has overstepped its bounds in recent years 
and its parameters need to be redefined. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maron, Tolmach, and Planning Commissioner Edward Castillo said the result 
may be a Planning Commission made up of citizens who have no power at all.

GROUP LEAVES FOR D.C. TO LOBBY FOR BASES; NAVY: DELEGATION MEMBERS SAY THEY 
WILL FOCUS ON MILITARY LEADERS IN HOPES OF KEEPING THE POINT MUGU AND PORT 
HUENEME FACILITIES OFF A CLOSURE LIST. 
</P>

 A Ventura County delegation left for the nation's capital Tuesday, saying its 
members will concentrate on military leaders in this first lobbying trip to 
make sure neither the Point Mugu nor Port Hueneme Navy bases ends up on the 
Pentagon's list of recommended closures. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Department of Defense wants to close you, you have a 90% chance of 
getting closed," said Cal Carerra, co-chairman of a special countywide task 
force that dispatched the group to Washington. "You don't want to be on that 
list." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-member delegation will spend most of today meeting with an array of 
Navy admirals and Defense Department officials to point out the unique military 
value of retaining the two bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Although an independent Base Closure and Realignment Commission will not 
determine the final hit list until July, the commissioners have relied heavily 
in previous rounds on Pentagon leaders' recommended base closures. Those 
recommendations will be released March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation decided to go to Washington now so it could have a say before 
Pentagon leaders make their final decisions, said county Supervisor John K. 
Flynn, who is leading the delegation with Supervisor Maggie Kildee. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our first stab at it," Flynn said at a news conference before leaving 
for Washington. "We will probably have to make two more trips." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor said other communities have also sent lobbying groups to 
Washington, but he believes Ventura County's BRAC '95 Task Force is better 
prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force of public officials, defense experts and business leaders has 
spent weeks preparing briefing booklets that emphasize the unique assets of the 
two bases, including Port Hueneme's deep-water port and Point Mugu's expansive 
sea-test range used to test missiles and other weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have 20,000 people whose jobs are at stake here, we have to get 
involved," Flynn said. "We can't ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day trip is not designed exclusively to defend the county's bases 
from potential closure, Flynn said. Instead, the delegation plans to point out 
there is room for expansion at Point Mugu and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to be positive and not put down other bases," Flynn said. "We 
are going to invite other (military) activities to come to our bases." 
</P>
<P>
 As in the past rounds of base closures in 1988, 1991 and 1993, Washington 
officials will close some bases and send their operations to other 
installations. It's possible that either or both bases could wind up with more 
operations and more employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In various scenarios being considered by the Navy, both Port Hueneme and Point 
Mugu are being examined as sites to receive some additional military 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Defense Department officials are looking at weapons testing centers to 
consolidate because of perceived duplication among the Army, Air Force and Navy 
in testing missiles. As a result, Point Mugu's Naval Air Warfare Center, 
Weapons Division, is considered vulnerable to closure or realignment. The Naval 
Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme faces less of a threat. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation bound for Washington knows of Point Mugu's position and is 
prepared to make the technical arguments why its weapons-testing operations 
should remain where they are. 
</P>
<P>
 To help build the case, the county's delegation is bringing its own defense 
experts: Bob Conroy, a Camarillo defense contractor and former naval aviator 
who used to help run operations in Point Mugu's sea-test range, and Ted Rains, 
recently retired technical director of the Naval Surface Warfare Center at Port 
Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of the delegation include: former U. S. Rep. Robert J. 
Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), Moorpark Councilman Bernardo Perez, business leader 
Carolyn Leavens, county government administrators Richard Wittenberg and Penny 
Bohannon, and BRAC '95 Task Force coordinator Bill Simmons.

COUNTY TO ISSUE HOSPITAL CERTIFICATES; CONSTRUCTION: SUPERVISORS FIRST WANT A 
REPORT ON THE SOUNDNESS OF FINANCING FOR THE MEDICAL CENTER EXPANSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although worried about the potential effects of Orange County's investment 
debacle, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved issuing 
$51 million in bond-like certificates to build a new wing at the county 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board directed county Auditor-Controller Thomas Mahon to report on the 
soundness of the finances for the Ventura County Medical Center expansion 
before the certificates are actually sold to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The report is due in March and the certificates would have to be sold by 
September, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what's happened in Orange County has been a red flag that we need to 
be more careful than we've been in the past," Supervisor Vicky Howard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahon assured the board that while there may be some fallout from the Orange 
County mess, he did not expect any lasting harm to Ventura County's credit 
rating or borrowing practices. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've always been able to distinguish Ventura County from the rest of 
California" in terms of its credit rating, Mahon said. "We have been able to 
get our rating upgraded despite the fact that the state and other counties have 
gone down." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet taxpayer advocates urged the board to reconsider or delay the sale of the 
hospital certificates because the county has no guarantee that the state will 
pay 70% of the project's costs, as promised. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been talk about this 70% reimbursement, but whether or not that is 
a specific ongoing commitment is still not clear," said Michael L. Saliba, 
executive director of the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor is it clear, Saliba said, how the Orange County situation will play out or 
how many illegal immigrants will stop using the county hospital because of 
Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1988 state law provides funding for public hospital projects based on the 
percentage of poor patients treated. To qualify for the funding, a hospital 
must have a patient load that is at least 50% indigent or Medi-Cal insured. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of such patients at the county hospital is 70%, which accounts 
for its 70% rate of reimbursement. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saliba and others argued that since the state reimbursement must be 
approved each year, it could be reduced or disappear altogether because of an 
uncertain economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mahon told the board that state officials have assured the county that it 
will receive its money, half of which would come from federal Medicaid funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "At present, the information we have is that this is as good as it gets as far 
as money coming from the state and federal government," Mahon said. He said, 
however, that he would include additional information about the state funding 
in his March report. 
</P>
<P>
 Saliba also voiced concerns that Proposition 187 -- the voter-approved 
initiative that bars non-emergency health care to illegal immigrants -- could 
mean fewer patients and reduce the need for a new hospital wing. 
</P>
<P>
 But hospital officials said the number of illegal immigrants treated at the 
hospital is so small that the initiative will not affect state funding. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, two hospital physicians urged the board to move quickly on the 
expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm training physicians in buildings that will soon fall down," said Dr. 
Lanyard Dial. "The rains leak through every day, and yesterday was no 
exception. It's been a mess. We have to do something. We can't delay this a 
year or two or I'll be practicing in a parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Backers have long said the new wing is needed because portions of the existing 
hospital are 70 years old and uninhabitable. Much of the new space would 
replace condemned buildings or house services now offered in leased buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 No one showed up from rival Community Memorial Hospital to argue against the 
project, but county hospital physician David Mackenzie chided Community 
Memorial for its lawsuit that charges the county with competing for private 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's elitist because it tries to prevent a modern state-of-the-art 
annex from being built when the aim of the annex is to facilitate treatment to 
the poorest of the poor, the mentally disabled and the homeless," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald L. Benton, a Community Memorial trustee, said in an interview that 
Mackenzie's comments were misleading. He said Community Memorial had to sue the 
county hospital because it is competing directly for patients by setting up 
clinics around the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Benton said the county is taking a big gamble that it will win the lawsuit. He 
said it would be prudent for the supervisors to postpone issuing the 
certificates until the case is settled.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY FLEET STUDIED FOR WAYS TO CUT SMOG

<P>
 The Ventura County Sheriff's Department and other county agencies will be 
encouraged to purchase vehicles running on alternative fuels to help improve 
the county's air quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors approved a six-month study Tuesday that will explore 
ways to expand the use of alternative fuel vehicles in the county's fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors John K. Flynn and Susan K. Lacey recommended the study, saying the 
county should take a leadership role in reducing air pollution in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The county owns eight vehicles that run on cleaner-burning methanol. But 
because the fuel is not widely available, departments should explore vehicles 
that run on compressed gas, electricity or reformulated gasoline, supervisors 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county General Services Agency, which will conduct the study, is scheduled 
to provide a progress report by March 31 and a final report to the Board of 
Supervisors by June 30. CARLOS V. LOZANO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; LOT OPERATORS HANG HOPES ON SELLING 
TREES

<P>
 When Mark Strecker asked daughter Shelby to choose a Christmas tree, the 
2-year-old threw open her arms as if to sweep in every noble fir in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen-year-old Michael Winkler, a tree-lot employee armed with a long 
plastic pole to measure the trees, gave a wide smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to tap such boundless dreams, half a dozen proprietors have staked out 
their piece of dirt or asphalt off Thousand Oaks thoroughfares to sell the 
perfect tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It pays for a vacation every now and then," said Camarillo resident Don 
Harmon, 43, a Los Angeles firefighter who has operated a tree lot under a 
landmark oak on a vacant parcel on Thousand Oaks Boulevard since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Harmon is the dean of tree-lot operators in Thousand Oaks and represents the 
second of three generations who have warmed their hands over trash-barrel 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of Harmon's children, 14-year-old Corey and 10-year-old Travis, help out 
at the lot after school and on weekends, he said. As a boy in the early 1950s, 
Harmon assisted his own father, Hugh, who owned lots along Ventura Boulevard in 
the west San Fernando Valley before moving the seasonal business to Thousand 
Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 To Christmas tree aficionados in the San Fernando and Conejo valleys, the 
Harmons' lot is practically an institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Courtney, by contrast, has opened a Christmas tree lot for the first time 
this year on Avenida de Los Arboles. "It's different than an ordinary job. . . 
. It's great to be outside, and it's great to see people with their families," 
said Courtney, 42, co-owner of a lot in the Albertson's grocery store parking 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
 But selling trees can be a deceptively tough business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been involved with businesses for 20 years, and Christmas trees are 
really the hardest," said Will Miller, an employee of Greg Cole's Christmas 
Trees at Thousand Oaks and Westlake boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 "You prepare for 11 months, and it comes down to rolling the dice for 18 days, 
so your homework better be right," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harmon, who has seen the best of times and the worst of times, said the trick 
is anticipating how many trees -- typically about 3,000 -- to purchase from his 
growers in Corvallis, Ore., and Shasta County. 
</P>
<P>
 Order too many, as Harmon did during the recession year of 1991, and you must 
pay to have the unsold trees chipped and hauled away after the holiday. At 
about 600 unsold trees in 1991, the disposal costs easily soaked up profits, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weather, too, can be difficult, particularly the drying winds that raked lots 
last year, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We turn on (the lot's sprinklers) at night, trying to make the trees think 
they're back in Oregon, where it's raining," Harmon said.GREG RIPPEE

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: EXPERTS PREDICT GROWTH, BETTER ECONOMY IN '95

 Citing a drop in unemployment, a rise in housing permits and a pro-business 
shift in government, two experts in real estate and banking Tuesday predicted 
that 1995 will bring a gradual improvement in the economy in Ventura County and 
throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "We truly believe the slide has ended, but we want to caution ourselves that 
there are going to be these head winds," said Charles Jackson, executive 
director of Mellon Financial Group in Pasadena, who addressed a group of real 
estate agents at a meeting in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The economic rebound could be stalled, he said, by higher interest rates, 
heavy government regulations and a migration from California. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to an upswing will be replacement of jobs lost to aerospace and other 
defense-related industries, he said. Already, the entertainment, computer 
software and biotechnology industries have helped diversify the region's 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Sands, founder and president of Fred Sands Realtors, also spoke during 
the Tower Club meeting. He said he believes that real estate prices in Ventura 
County will creep up during the coming year, following the lead of properties 
in more affluent areas.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite a significant number of foreclosures in Ventura and Oxnard, buyers 
moving from Los Angeles will continue to boost the real estate market in 
Ventura County, Sands said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prices are not going to run away," he said. "But you've got the benefit of 
the flight out of Los Angeles." JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; HOMELESS MAN WINS REPRIEVE OVER SHACK 
</P>

<P>
 The homeless man whose house-on-wheels was to be towed off a Thousand Oaks 
street won a 24-hour reprieve Tuesday morning because the two-story, one-ton 
structure was too ungainly for city equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The new deadline for removing it from Foothill and Sunset drives is today. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is still there at 8 a.m., a private contractor hired by the city of 
Thousand Oaks will haul the towering creation of David M. Russell to the city 
impound yard, said David Pimentel of the Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to preserve Russell's dream, however, a neighboring towing firm 
said workers Tuesday evening would try to tow the sturdy house of scraps to a 
site where the 41-year-old man could find peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave's a good guy," said Todd Campbell of Conejo Valley Towing and Transport. 
"We're going to see if we can move it down the street first. We want to give it 
a test run and see how easy it is to move." 
</P>
<P>
 The structure, which began as a small lean-to on shopping-cart wheels, grew in 
layers as the months went by, finally reaching its current dimensions -- about 
10 feet long, 9 feet wide and more than 15 feet high -- in a parking lot behind 
a technology firm. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city said the patchwork of discarded materials violated building 
codes, so workers towed it off the parking lot and against the curb last 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the city says the bulky shack must be removed because it poses a traffic 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's obviously a talented carpenter. . . . We just want to make sure we don't 
just summarily move it and destroy it," Deputy City Atty. Jim Friedl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with his housing future in doubt, Russell busied himself Tuesday with 
raking leaves from the gutters along Foothill and Sunset: property owned by the 
city that might destroy his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyplace we stay in we leave as clean or even better than it was before we 
got there," Russell said. GREG RIPPEE

 Thousand Oaks police arrested a man Tuesday on suspicion of attempted murder 
when he returned to the scene of his alleged crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they arrested 27-year-old Dane Lee Perry in the back yard of a 
house in the 2100 block of Calle Camelia, where he allegedly shot Craig Moran 
on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Moran, 38, of Thousand Oaks, had gone to the home of his estranged wife 
Saturday to pick up some belongings, police said. Moran and his wife argued, 
and Perry intervened, shooting Moran in the right thigh, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, described by authorities as a transient, fled from the house but 
returned Tuesday, police said. They found out that Perry had returned when an 
anonymous tipster called the Crime Stoppers line. 
</P>
<P>
 Moran was in stable condition Tuesday night at Los Robles Regional Medical 
Center. IRA E. STOLL

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; KAISER NURSE FILES SUIT FOR 
DEFAMATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A nurse at Kaiser Permanente's clinic in Thousand Oaks -- who is also a 
patient there -- filed a lawsuit Tuesday against the medical facility and eight 
of her colleagues, claiming invasion of privacy and defamation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, the licensed vocational nurses who worked with her staged a one-day 
strike, citing their frustrations over the care of an unnamed patient who they 
said was addicted to the prescription drug Demerol. 
</P>
<P>
 In her lawsuit, Linda Vergilis said her colleagues were referring to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Vergilis said in the suit that she has taken Demerol since 1984 because of 
physical ailments, including migraine headaches. But since 1992 when she began 
working at the Thousand Oaks clinic, the nurses there have considered her an 
addict and refused to honor her prescription, the suit stated. 
</P>
<P>
 The picketing and press coverage of the strike have caused damage to her 
reputation, according to the lawsuit. The suit names the other nurses and 
Kaiser as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vergilis was never mentioned by name in any of the newspaper stories, 
her attorney, Richard Hamlish of Westlake, said she was damaged nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the people know who she is. It's not a secret. If it was a secret, she 
would not be filing a lawsuit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit also cited a comment attributed to Kaiser's area director of 
public affairs, Pamela Spencer, who said the strike "decisively goes against 
medical ethics with regards to patient confidentiality." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser spokeswoman Linda Quon said officials there had not seen the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the nurses named as defendants were on duty Tuesday, said a woman who 
answered the phone at the Thousand Oaks clinic. She said several of the nurses 
had transferred to other clinics or were no longer employed by Kaiser. DWAYNE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; OFFICIAL PROPOSES CLEANUP BY HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Homeless people could be hired to clean up Ventura's downtown under a proposal 
roughly sketched out this week by a City Council member. 
</P>
<P>
 The project could began as early as January and would employ 25 people, 
screened for ability and assigned to small crews, Councilwoman Rosa Lee 
Measures told her colleagues Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing special badges or vests, the crews would sweep, steam-clean sidewalks, 
wash windows and trim bushes and trees, according to Measures. Each worker 
would earn $6 an hour and work eight hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The program would be planned and supervised by Bob McElroy, who has won 
nationwide attention for his success in putting the homeless to work in San 
Diego, Measures said.  
</P>
<P>
 Downtown merchants have complained for months that downtown transients look 
bad, smell bad and disturb their customers. Many of the city's homeless dwell 
in the Ventura River bottom, which also troubles environmentalists because they 
say it disturbs the river bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Measures, who has been on a drive to rid downtown of panhandlers and vagrants, 
invited McElroy to town last week to discuss his work in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon hearing of Measures' proposal Monday, some council members immediately 
wanted to know the cost and what portion of it the city would pick up. Measures 
said she hopes to fund the initial cleanup effort through private donations, 
but she will keep the council informed of any future expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, Measures' plan calls for starting a day center and finding 
shelter for the workers. However, she said she does not know what it would cost 
to provide such services or whether the city or business community will be 
expected to pay for them. CONSTANCE SOMMER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; LOAN WOULD TARGET USE OF NAVY AIRFIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura is willing to contribute $20,000 toward an effort to bring commercial 
flights to the airfield at Point Mugu Navy base, the City Council has agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will allow Ventura to join a joint powers authority created to 
manage the joint military and civilian use of the airfield.The contribution, 
officials say, is a loan from the city's reserves, which will be paid back with 
interest within five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Other government bodies asked to join the authority include Thousand Oaks, 
Oxnard, Camarillo, Port Hueneme, the County of Ventura and the Oxnard Harbor 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura will not lend the money unless at least five of the seven entities 
also join the authority, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Consultants' reports, prepared to determine how profitable civilian use of the 
airfield could be, vary widely. One study released in September said the 
airfield would handle 2.5 million commercial passengers annually by the year 
2010. Another report that came out in November, however, estimated that only 
500,000 to 1.5 million commercial passengers would use the airfield each year.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; DRIFTER PLEADS GUILTY IN SEXUAL ASSAULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 32-year-old drifter accused of a series of sexual assaults in Ventura and 
Oak Park has pleaded guilty in a case in which a judge ruled that DNA evidence 
could be used against him at trial, a prosecutor said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Fredman, who entered the guilty pleas to three counts of sexual assault 
Monday, faces up to 18 years in prison, said Deputy Dist. Atty.Matthew J. 
Hardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Had he not entered the pleas, Fredman could have received up to 32 years if 
convicted of the 16 charges he had faced in connection with the 1991 assaults 
and home break-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting Superior Court Judge Bruce A. Clark immediately convicted Fredman and 
set a sentencing hearing for Feb. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy said the judge ordered Fredman to undergo a psychiatric examination 
before sentencing. Fredman has a history of substance abuse and the judge 
wanted to determine if it played a role in the defendant's crimes, Hardy said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Fredman was arrested in 1992 on suspicion of attempting to break into 
his girlfriend's home, police collected saliva and blood samples from him and 
matched them to DNA material found at the scenes of the unsolved sexual 
assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, five women and girls were assaulted, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors originally charged Fredman with 27 criminal counts, but later 
reduced the number of charges to 16. They accepted guilty pleas on only three 
counts, Hardy said, because the 13 other charges probably would not have 
resulted in any additional prison time. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredman's lawyer, Deputy Public Defender Gary Windom, could not be reached for 
comment. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; 2 FLEE FIRE; BOY WAS PLAYING WITH MATCHES

<P>
 A 3-year-old boy playing with matches sparked a fire Tuesday morning that 
quickly destroyed much of his family's stucco home near Oxnard Shores, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, Steven Jenkins, and his grandmother, Olga Ortega, escaped from the 
blaze unharmed as neighbors and passersby used garden hoses on the flaming 
duplex in the 800 block of Dunes Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time the first firefighters arrived minutes later, the fire had 
engulfed much of the upper floor and flames could be seen leaping through 
ventilation openings in the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters stopped the flames from spreading to the other half of the duplex 
by training hoses on the common attic and walls, Battalion Chief Terry McAnally 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators estimated the fire caused $100,000 in damage to the two-story 
structure and property inside. 
</P>
<P>
 McAnally said Steven told an investigator he had been striking matches in a 
closet when the flames ignited clothing, paper and other nearby objects. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were lucky to get out of there," McAnally said. "That's why you have to 
keep an eye on 2- and 3-year-olds all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven's mother, Jenny Ortega, 23, arrived at the home as firefighters were 
beginning to mop up after the blaze. She said she had rented the duplex with 
her boyfriend just a few months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He started making more money and so we decided to move up to the beach," she 
said tearfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Ortega's neighbor in the other half of the duplex, Jim Johnson, 53, was home 
when the fire started, but didn't notice the flames until two electricians 
driving by stopped to knock on his door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked out and there was smoke everywhere," Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Although flames did not spread to his portion of the duplex, Johnson said 
thick black smoke had spread to his half of the building and firefighters had 
cut a hole through his roof to allow the heat to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a very smoky Christmas," he said.JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 The Ventura County Library Services Agency has received more than $10,000 in 
donations that it will use to expand the operating hours of county libraries in 
Camarillo and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The Library Services Agency on Tuesday accepted $3,000 from the Camarillo 
Newcomers Club and other community fund-raising groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will allow the Camarillo Library to open two additional hours each 
Wednesday between Jan. 4 and Aug. 30, said Dixie Adeniran, the county's library 
director. During this time, the library will open from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The Library Services Agency also accepted $7,667 raised through public 
fund-raising events in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will go toward adding two hours of service each Saturday at the E.P. 
Foster Library; two hours each Wednesday at the H.P. Wright Library, and one 
more hour each Monday at the Avenue Library between January and June, Adeniran 
said. All three libraries are in Ventura. CARLOS V. LOZANO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; 200 SEABEES LEAVING FOR GUANTANAMO 
</P>

<P>
 Two hundred Navy Seabees are scheduled to leave today for Guantanamo Bay Navy 
Base on a mission to build reinforced tents and other buildings to improve the 
lives of 23,000 Cuban refugees being detained on the base on the southeast 
coast of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seabees, based at the Naval Construction Battalion Center at Port Hueneme, 
are scheduled to leave for Cuba at 9:30 p.m. from the nearby airstrip at the 
Point Mugu Navy base. 
</P>
<P>
 They will join another 200 Seabees who left Port Hueneme earlier this month. 
All 400 of the Seabees belong to the 630-person Naval Mobile Construction 
Battalion 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the remaining members of the battalion will be spending the next seven 
months in Puerto Rico or will be scattered elsewhere around the globe as part 
of their regular seven-month tour of duty overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 At Guantanamo Bay, the Seabees will build 2,200 reinforced tents and 18 other 
steel-framed buildings, Navy officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seabees, trained in various construction trades, will also improve 
existing roads to the camps and provide water, electricity and sewage 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees held at Guantanamo Bay are part of the 32,000 Cuban rafters 
picked up at sea and held at detention camps until it is determined if they 
will be allowed to enter the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Clinton Administration reversed its policy against 
granting asylum to Cubans who fled on makeshift rafts last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the government plans to allow as many as 10,000 Cubans detained at camps 
at Guantanamo Bay and in Panama to settle in the United States. KENNETH R.

PLANNERS OK DAM; 140 OAKS WOULD BE LOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 It appeared to be a project that nobody wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 But after six hours of wrangling, Thousand Oaks planning commissioners early 
Tuesday approved a Lang Ranch developer's plan for an 11-acre earthen dam that 
requires ripping up 140 mature oak trees.  
</P>
<P>
 The flood control project, opposed by a dozen residents who live near the dam 
site, had planning commissioners searching for any reason to deny it during the 
meeting that began Monday night. But at 1:30 a.m., after a grueling review, 
they announced that they had no choice but to approve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone here wants to see a project of this magnitude go in," 
said Commissioner Forrest Frields. "But when you talk about the potential for 
flooding and people's lives being lost, we have to look at this with great 
seriousness. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a situation where we're doing something discretionary," he said 
before the 4-1 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Linda Parks, unsettled by the prospect of tearing up what many 
residents consider the premier wild oak grove in the city, voted against the 
project. She said she believes other options still exist. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plan receives final approval from the City Council, the flood and 
debris basin could be under construction at Westlake Boulevard and Avenida de 
Los Arboles near North Ranch by early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners said they were forced to approve the project despite its 
potential for environmental harm, because a federal court ruled in 1986 that a 
dam must accompany construction of the 2,257-dwelling, 2,500-acre Lang Ranch 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 The dam is meant to protect residents downstream from flooding during a storm 
expected to occur once every 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the project's effects on the environment are expected to be severe, 
city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-acre site for the dam and its concrete channels is now home not only to 
a grove of large oak trees, but is part of a prized wildlife corridor that 
connects the Simi Hills to the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Animals ranging from bobcats and coyotes to owls and golden eagles have been 
spotted there. In an exhaustive environmental review, city officials said there 
was no denying the property's natural value. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have felt very strongly that this is an extremely important wildlife 
habitat," said Greg Smith, the city planner who prepared the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about the loss of a very productive habitat, and the loss of 
some very large, very old trees that contribute to that habitat," Smith said. 
"We looked at all kinds of alternatives, and at this point I'm convinced that 
there is nothing feasible left that we haven't tried." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, residents listed their concerns, including a lack of notice that the 
project would be built to their loss of views of the rustic canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see this area every morning, and I see it every night," said John Riddle, 
an engineer from Thousand Oaks. "This is the prettiest arroyo in the city, and 
you're tearing it out to put in a chunk of cement." 
</P>
<P>
 Riddle complained that the project should have been placed on Lang Ranch 
property, not land earlier devoted as public space. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to take away public land to solve the flood problems that they are 
creating," Riddle said. "I think it's terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Lang Ranch representatives said they never expected to build such a large 
facility, but that government red tape forces them to. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have tried, as a responsible developer to the environment, to find out how 
to avoid building this facility," said Lang Ranch spokesman Ron Gallagher.

BUSINESSMAN PROPOSES OPENING CARD CLUB IN MOORPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Calabasas businessman wants to open a large card club in downtown Moorpark 
that he says could generate more than $2 million in revenue for city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city leaders on Tuesday, however, said a card club would attract "the 
wrong element." If eventually approved, the club would be by far the largest 
card club in Ventura County. The City Council is scheduled to review the 
proposal in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett Crawford, a retired real estate investor from Calabasas who made the 
proposal in a Nov. 30 letter to city officials, said he and his partner are 
"squeaky-clean" and the club would be too. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford said he and partner Donald MacKay, a real estate developer from San 
Diego, have no experience in building gaming casinos or card clubs and no 
connections to other card clubs in Southern California -- both of which he sees 
as advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are what we are," he said. "All our cards are on the table, so to speak. 
There's no one hiding behind us. We're going to dot every 'i' and cross every 
't.' We will hold ourselves to the highest standard. We won't allow a bad 
element to enter into this, that could only hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 The club would host only bridge and panguingue or pan -- a fast-paced version 
of gin rummy where dealers use eight decks with the eights, nines, and 10s 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Crawford's proposal, the club would have about 30 tables, which he 
estimates could bring in as much as $20 million a year from the fees charged 
for each hand played. Patrons would gamble against each other and not the 
house. The club's earnings would be solely from those fees, and the city would 
take a cut from the proceeds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would gladly pay the city almost whatever they wanted," he said. "We are 
starting with 10% of the gross receipts as an opener for discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of a 50-table card club that failed to get approval in Oxnard a year 
ago projected that their business would generate from $500,000 to $2 million 
for that city. Crawford said his revenue projections are not firm and that he 
would consider reducing the size of the operation if the city requested. 
</P>
<P>
 The backers of the Oxnard proposal were dogged by an investigation of 
political corruption and money laundering by the district attorney's office. 
Ventura County District Atty. Michael D. Bradbury also helped give the death 
knell to the proposal when he went before the council and condemned card clubs 
as magnets for crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark City Councilman Scott Montgomery is taking a similar tack. 
</P>
<P>
 "This just isn't the type of business we're looking for in Moorpark," 
Montgomery said. "And I personally don't believe that it brings the economic 
benefit that other businesses create." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Paul Lawrason has not ruled out supporting the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of advantages and disadvantages to the proposal," he said. 
"Before I make up my mind I would like to get some of my constituents' opinions 
on this." 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, the card club would not be the first in the city. For 26 years, a 
small low-ball poker club operated across the street from City Hall. Because 
the club opened long before the city was incorporated, it was exempt from a 
city ordinance passed in 1983 that prohibited gambling. That exemption was only 
in effect as long as the club's original owner -- Robert Bonta -- lived. 
</P>
<P>
 The club was closed in 1984 when Bonta died. Family members tried to reopen 
the club in 1985, but were denied permission by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonta's club had just two tables, room for eight people and was open only 
three days a week. Crawford wants his club to be open 14 hours a day, six days 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to go forward unless we know that we have a fighting chance," 
Crawford said. "This is a trial balloon. If they say no, that's fine. We'll try 
and go somewhere else."

SIMI VALLEY OFFICIALS' RAISES FOUND TO HAVE VIOLATED STATE LAW; GOVERNMENT: PAY 
AND BENEFIT INCREASES FOR THE CITY MANAGER AND THE CITY ATTORNEY WERE APPROVED 
BEHIND CLOSED DOORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Simi Valley City Council approved about $8,100 in pay and benefit 
increases for the city manager and city attorney on Monday, only to discover 
Tuesday that the raises are illegal because they were approved without public 
notice and behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Prompted by questions from The Times, City Atty. John Torrance acknowledged 
that the council acted improperly, on his advice, to grant pay raises to 
himself and City Manager Lin Koester. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a mistake," Torrance said. "I gave the council bad advice, and I 
accept full responsibility. The council acted solely on my advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Torrance notified council members late Tuesday that the pay hikes, which would 
have become effective after final approval next Monday, are void. He said the 
increases, to be legal, must be posted on a council agenda and decided during a 
public meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to the raises in a 1 1/2-hour closed session before its 
weekly meeting Monday night. Mayor Greg Stratton then publicly announced the 
raises, saying Koester would receive a 2.5% increase and Torrance would get 
3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, city Assistant Personnel Administrator Nona Young said the 
percentage increases applied only to the officials' base salaries. Such 
increases would amount to about $3,000 for Koester and nearly $3,800 for 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Young later acknowledged that some of the officials' non-salary benefits 
would also be hiked by the same percentages. 
</P>
<P>
 The raises would have boosted Koester's total compensation by about $3,600 to 
$187,200 and increased Torrance's about $4,500 to $148,500, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Koester and Torrance are already the highest-paid city manager and city 
attorney in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Tuesday, after The Times questioned the legality of the raises, Torrance 
said he had mistakenly advised the council that it could grant pay raises in a 
closed session. He said he was unaware of an updated version of the state open 
meeting law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed it," Torrance said. "It's as simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
 The law reads: "Closed sessions . . . shall not include discussion or action 
on proposed compensation except for a reduction of compensation that results in 
the imposition of discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 To correct the error, the council will reconsider the raises in an open 
session at its next meeting, Torrance said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members were circumspect after Torrance told them of his error Tuesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton said Torrance's advice was "an embarrassment to the city," but that 
it could be forgiven. 
</P>
<P>
 "They slipped in one more wrinkle and he just missed it," Stratton said. 
"Nobody likes to get bad advice. But John's batting average is pretty good, so 
I don't think we're going to hold it against him too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Sandi Webb said the error was not significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the grand scheme of things, I think this is a rather minor blooper," Webb 
said. "Thank God it's not a screw-up like (the investment problems) in Orange 
County."

ERRANT DOGS MAY BE SPARED IF OWNERS MEET CONDITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Rottweiler dogs that faced the death penalty for biting a man and 
terrifying other Newbury Park residents have been spared -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruling in an unusual dangerous-dog hearing, Los Angeles County animal 
regulation officials said Tuesday that, although the owners were negligent for 
failing to control their pets, the animals can be released from the pound and 
reunited with their masters. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and Control, 
however, set several conditions for the release of the dogs, named Heidi and 
Rommel. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs' owners, the Hale family, must buy $100,000 in liability insurance 
before regaining custody of the animals, which had escaped from the family's 
yard, scaring neighbors and tripping a jogger. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Hales cannot find insurance in 15 days, the dogs may be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the family must keep the dogs on a leash or in a secure enclosure 
and submit to unannounced inspections of their property on Adrian Street. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the dogs were still in the pound because the biggest hurdle -- the 
insurance requirement -- is proving troublesome, Rocky Hale said. Because of 
the Northridge earthquake, renter's insurance of the kind the Hales need is 
hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably called 20 insurance agencies, and had not one bit of luck," Hale 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale also complained about being required to pay about $500 in boarding fees 
for the dogs. He said because his dogs were not found to be dangerous, he 
should not be forced to pay for their time at the Agoura Animal Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a guy that's arrested and found not guilty and has to pay the jail 
costs," Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Mewshaw, a Woodland Hills lawyer who read a newspaper story about the 
dangerous-dog hearing, has offered to loan Hale the money for the boarding fees 
and to defend the dogs pro bono if the Hales are unable to find insurance and 
decide to appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "They touched my heartstrings," Mewshaw said of the dogs and their owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale said that, overall, he was pleased with the verdict, which came 12 days 
after an emotional hearing that lasted more than four hours and included 
testimony from his 6-year-old daughter and his two teen-age children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think my dogs were found not guilty as far as being dangerous," Hale said. 
"They've been vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale and his family were judged guilty of "ownership negligence," according to 
the three-page letter from the Los Angeles County Department of Animal Care and 
Control, which handles animal control for the Ventura County city of Thousand 
Oaks under a two-year old contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors who had complained about the dogs said they would wait to see if the 
dogs escape again. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we wanted from the beginning was for the Hales to control their animals. 
They haven't proved themselves responsible in the past," said Rebecca Au. 
</P>
<P>
 Au and another nearby resident, Virginia Suggs, said it would be a shame to 
kill the animals because of their owners' irresponsibility. But they said they 
had to consider the safety of their own families. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggs, who testified that her husband had been attacked but not harmed by the 
dogs, said she was not upset with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Suggs: "As long as they do their part in keeping the dogs in, that's 
fine."

FIRE CHIEF APOLOGIZES FOR PORTRAYAL OF VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of the most raucous and extraordinary city Fire Commission meetings in 
memory, Chief Donald O. Manning apologized Tuesday for inaccurately 
characterizing a controversial video of female recruits as a blooper-type film 
instead of as a hedge against potential sexual harassment claims or lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to apologize to the board if there is a feeling that I did not 
provide all the information," the chief said. "The information you received 
from me was to the best of my knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 Manning told the five-member oversight commission that, although he had been 
briefed by his top subordinate, he had not personally read the results of the 
investigation he had ordered into the affair and thus testified last week with 
limited knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, the videotape, which shows women trainees making repeated 
mistakes, has become a lightning rod for highly charged emotions over the 
department's treatment of women and minorities -- a controversy triggered by a 
scathing city audit last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the Personnel Department audit concluded that minorities 
and women have not only been frozen out of top management positions but in some 
cases have been harassed out of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 The bitterness stirred up by the matter repeatedly spilled into Tuesday's 
meeting, where more than 200 firefighters jeered the commission, accused the 
panel of engaging in a "witch hunt" against one of the nation's finest 
departments and praised their chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why you can't get all the facts before you start pontificating 
in front of the media," shouted Capt. Ken Buzzell, president of the 
3,000-member firefighters union as his colleagues -- decked out in dark blue 
uniforms -- gave him a standing ovation. "Murderers and rapists get more due 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighter after firefighter echoed that theme as the hearing's decorum 
steadily deteriorated -- until firefighter Don Jones walked to the podium and 
the audience fell quiet. Two years ago, Jones was honored with the Medal of 
Valor for pulling a female firefighter from a burning building during the 1992 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, who is black, said he had not planned to speak but was compelled to say 
something after hearing so many colleagues say that widespread harassment and 
discrimination are not problems on the 3,100-member force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rampant discrimination exists in the department," the 12-year veteran flatly 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Fire Commission meetings have been held with little interest, and 
commission members, who are appointed by the mayor, are virtually unknown to 
the public. But Tuesday's meeting was a sharp departure, signaling that the 
department has moved into an era of greater scrutiny. So many people were 
expected to attend the meeting -- including the media -- that the hearing was 
moved to larger quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 When Manning was called to testify shortly after the hearing began, he was 
sharply questioned by Commissioner Leslie Song Winner, who has positioned 
herself as perhaps the chief's toughest critic on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 She asked Manning to explain why he had testified before the commission last 
week that the investigation he ordered had concluded that the tape was meant to 
be humorous and was not intended to ridicule the department's women recruits. 
In fact, the report stated that the tape was intended to document mistakes of 
selected firefighters who training officials suspected might later claim 
mistreatment or harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning explained that he and his staff had hastily prepared their 
presentation on the video the morning of the Dec. 6 board hearing in response 
to an article in The Times that day, which detailed the tape's footage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really did not become an issue until that morning," the chief said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning said he scrambled to find someone connected to the video's production, 
and fire officials were able to contact Capt. Steve Owens, who was introduced 
by the chief during the earlier board meeting as the man solely responsible for 
producing and editing the video. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens then took full responsibility for the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 But, according to the chief's own investigation, Owens was ordered to document 
the poor performances of women trainees by his boss, Capt. Donald M. Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very difficult for me to understand why you wouldn't know about Capt. 
Carter," a disbelieving Winner told the chief. He answered that his top 
assistant, Deputy Chief Gerald Johnson, did not mention Carter's name during a 
briefing on the probe that morning or the main reason the tape was made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't recall Capt. Carter's name coming up at all," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Manning spoke, Johnson was called to testify but was not questioned 
about his briefing of the chief. Instead, the commissioners wanted to know why 
he had not said anything during the previous hearing he attended when Owens 
took sole credit for the tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he did not feel it was necessary to correct Owens' testimony 
because he wanted to pursue the matter privately. He said he did not believe 
the commission was the proper forum for such fact-finding endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see how that helped Capt. Owens," Winner interjected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not our practice to conduct investigations at a public hearing," Johnson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until that exchange, the hearing was relatively sedate, with occasional shouts 
of "Let him speak! Let him speak!" as Winner probed the chief and Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 But the simmering emotions exploded when union President Buzzell stood up in 
the audience and shouted at the commissioners, demanding that Carter and his 
training staff be allowed to defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "You seem so quick to drag their names through the mud," he snapped. "Would 
you please give us an opportunity to let them tell their story." 
</P>
<P>
 As the applause filled the auditorium at Parker Center, where the meeting was 
held, the man responsible for making the video was allowed to take the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can tell you today is the truth," said Carter, a 20-year department 
veteran, wearing his black dress uniform with his white cap at his side. "I 
have never been guilty of sexual harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 He then recounted how many of the female recruits -- and some males -- in the 
academy class were not even capable of performing 10 pushups, let alone 
handling the grueling task of battling blazes. During the course of the academy 
training, he said, he heard from his staff that some women were alleging 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was told that there was some grumbling going on from certain recruits that 
this was a sexual harassment issue," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This tape was meant to cover me and my staff," Carter said, adding later: "I 
slept pretty good knowing that the tape was in my garage. If I had to do it 
again, I would." 
</P>
<P>
 Several other training captains in the academy took turns corroborating 
Carter's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Conspicuously silent, however, was Owens, who sat rigid in his chair 
throughout the hearing. He was not called to testify, and he declined to be 
interviewed by reporters. "I can't talk to you right now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After testimony by most of the key players in the video affair, numerous 
speakers -- including several Latinos -- lauded the department's affirmative 
action policies, saying no one had ever blocked their paths to promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the politicians get their way, making promotions by race and gender, then 
worse than the stroke of any bigot's pen, I will be stripped of my dignity as a 
Latino," declared Lawrence Fiero, a 17-year veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Commissioner Larry Gonzalez scolded the audience. 
</P>

AMERICAN EAGLE PLANE CRASHES IN N.C.; 15 KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An American Eagle commuter plane with 20 people aboard crashed and split open 
Tuesday evening in a rugged, wooded area about four miles from Raleigh-Durham 
International Airport, killing 15 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen people died at the scene and two shortly after arrival at Duke 
University Medical Center, authorities said. The five survivors were 
hospitalized and two of them had extensive injuries, a hospital official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight 3379 was en route from Greensboro to Raleigh, a flight of about 70 
miles, when it crashed about 6:40 p.m. EST. Observers at the crash scene said 
it was foggy and sleeting. The airport reported a temperature of 37 degrees 
with steady drizzle. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport spokeswoman Teresa Damiano said the Jetstream Super 31 broke into two 
large pieces, with wreckage scattered over about 500 feet. A fire broke out in 
the cockpit area after the crash, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second crash of an American Eagle plane in less than two months, 
but it did not involve one of the ATR planes the airline recently grounded amid 
concerns over the planes' safety in icy conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The rugged terrain made rescue efforts difficult, Damiano said, and 
four-wheel-drive vehicles were required to reach the crash site. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane's flight data recorder and voice recorder were recovered, said 
American Eagle spokesman Al Becker. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said the plane 
apparently gave no sign of trouble before the crash and its crew had received 
clearance from the airport tower to land. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have complete confidence in this aircraft," Becker said. "At this point, 
no one has the slightest notion of what caused this." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation Safety Board dispatched a team to the scene, led 
by board member John K. Lauber. They were expected to begin their investigation 
early today. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation Secretary Federico Pena and FAA Administrator David R. Hinson 
also were to fly to the scene, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ill-fated plane first flew Tuesday from Jacksonville to Raleigh-Durham, 
then to Fayetteville, back to Raleigh-Durham and on to Greensboro, the airline 
said. It was returning again to Raleigh-Durham when it crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jetstream was delivered to Nashville-based Flagship Airlines, which 
operates American Eagle in the Southeast, in January, 1991. It had completed 
8,483 takeoff-and-landing cycles. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane had its last scheduled maintenance Saturday in Nashville, said Laura 
Tolar, another airline spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jetstream Super 31, a twin turboprop manufactured by British Aerospace, 
carries a maximum of 19 passengers and a cockpit crew of two. The plane 
received FAA certification in 1988. American Eagle said Tuesday night that it 
operates 54 Super 31s. The average age of the planes is three years, a 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the four carriers that operate under the American Eagle name, only Wings 
West, based in Los Angeles, and Flagship Airlines fly Jetstream Super 31s. 
Raleigh-Durham is one of Flagship's hubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Jetstream plane, a Jetstream 41, crashed on Jan. 7 near Columbus, 
Ohio, killing five people. 
</P>
<P>
 The NTSB ruled that pilot error, unfamiliarity with a new type of plane and 
inadequate training were the probable causes of that crash. 
</P>
<P>
 American Eagle flights have had at least four other fatal crashes in the past 
seven years, including a 1988 accident in which a plane went down outside the 
Raleigh-Durham airport after taking off in dense fog. All 12 people aboard were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday evening's crash was also the fourth serious airline accident in the 
United States in the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 31, an American Eagle commuter plane crashed while waiting to land at 
O'Hare, killing all 68 on board. On Sept. 8, a USAir jetliner crashed on 
approach to Pittsburgh International Airport, killing all 132 people on board. 
And on July 2, another USAir jet crashed near North Carolina's 
Charlotte-Douglas International Airport, killing 37 of 57 people on board. 
</P>
<P>
 American Eagle grounded all 41 ATR commuter airplanes at O'Hare on Saturday, a 
day after the government banned the turboprop aircraft from flying in icy 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice forming on the wings has been suspected in the Oct. 31 crash, which 
involved an American Eagle ATR-72. The cause of the crash is still being 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the ATR groundings and subsequent transfer of Saab aircraft to 
Chicago to replace them, American Eagle has announced the permanent shutdown by 
January of its Raleigh-Durham hub. 
</P>
<P>
 The airline said that anyone needing information about passengers in Tuesday's 
crash could contact American Eagle at (800) 433-7300.

RELATION BETWEEN CITRON, ADVISER DRAWS SCRUTINY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA and ERIC LICHTBLAU, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They were like "Siamese twins," associates would joke; the bookish Orange 
County treasurer and the brash Bel-Air financial adviser, an odd couple linked 
by a series of roller-coaster bond deals that produced high returns and even 
higher risks. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the ride is over, and the relationship between Robert L. Citron and 
Jeff Leifer -- seen as profitable by some, exclusionary by others -- is drawing 
closer scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents have subpoenaed records from Leifer's Santa Monica-based firm, 
Leifer Capital, and they are said to be focusing on his dealings with the 
county as part of their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Records and interviews show that Leifer, in his role of advising Orange County 
officials on how to structure their debt, has earned more than $1 million since 
1990 -- much of it through work that was never put out to bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say the financier is one of the best in his field, but his close 
contacts to Citron, three decades his senior, have spurred complaints from 
competitors about Leifer's relationship with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 When Leifer was forced to resign from his public finance job at First 
Interstate Bank in Los Angeles about six years ago, Citron placed an angry call 
to Leifer's bosses, threatening to withdraw county funds from the bank, sources 
said. Citron did not carry out his threat, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leifer and Citron were really as snug as a couple of bugs in a rug," said 
Timothy J. Schaefer, senior vice president with Evensen Dodge Inc., a financial 
advising firm in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's been going on for a long time. My sense is that Jeffrey used Citron 
to increase his business with other Orange County agencies. His relationship 
with Citron pre-qualified him for a lot of the business he did in the county," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief interview, Leifer said he had not done anything wrong and that his 
advice to the county had nothing to do with its current financial troubles. He 
has not been accused of wrongdoing or mismanagement in connection with Orange 
County's financial debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron also refused to discuss Leifer's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Leifer, 38, is a fast-talking entrepreneur equally at home crunching bond 
numbers or hobnobbing with Hollywood celebrities. He is also known for his 
astute politicking, serving as president of his class at UC San Diego, founding 
a young scientists group in Washington and helping in fund raising for 
environmental causes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Yale management school graduate, unaccustomed to the type of exposure 
usually reserved for major Wall Street players, is clearly uncomfortable with 
his new position in the spotlight and has asked a press agent to handle all 
inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials and Leifer say he never played a part in actual investment 
portfolio decisions; rather he helped decide how to structure the debt and 
solicit bids from Wall Street underwriters. 
</P>
<P>
 Leifer's relationship with Citron dates back to the early 1980s, when Leifer 
was a young public financier with the now-defunct Los Angeles firm of 
Ehrlich-Bober & Co. Executives there split up the list of potential clients 
among government officials to contact for public financing contracts, and 
Leifer drew Citron's name. It proved a profitable stroke of luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron began using Leifer as his financial adviser on bond projects in the 
early 1980s. The relationship continued even after the Los Angeles native left 
Ehrlich-Bober to go to First Interstate Bank and then to start his own 
financial services firm in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron reported receiving $200 in dinners from Leifer in 1990 and 1991, and in 
the midst of a tough reelection campaign earlier this year, received a $1,000 
contribution from him. Both donations were legal under state and federal laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Leifer is a fixture in municipal finance circles in California, serving on the 
state panel that advises agencies on debt sales. He counsels local governments 
on the types of bonds they need to cover various capital and operating costs 
and, in return, is paid fees that reach $100,000 or more, depending on the 
complexity and duration of the work, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leifer Capital has served as financial adviser for about 70 government bond 
issues around the state in the last four years, records show. Orange County has 
been the cornerstone of his operation, issuing nearly two dozen notes worth 
about $1.7 billion under Leifer's guidance, according to Securities Data Co., a 
New Jersey-based company that tracks the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
 He has managed all this with a staff of five professionals crammed into small, 
nondescript suite in Santa Monica where a closet doubles as one of the offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints have circulated for years that he was paid higher fees from Orange 
County than the standard rate in the industry. But it is difficult to determine 
whether the complaints are valid because of Leifer's informal relationship with 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 State law does not require that contracts with financial advisers be 
competitively bid; nor does it limit the fees members of the financial team can 
earn. But municipalities are increasingly bidding such contracts in the belief 
that they get a better deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Leifer's role in advising county agencies became an issue last year after a 
competitor complained to the Orange County Transportation Authority that Leifer 
was getting all the work. 
</P>
<P>
 The transportation agency revised its policies, pledging to put future 
contracts for financial consulting out to bid, but Citron offered a vigorous 
defense of Leifer's work in a memo in July, 1993, to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The county, Citron said, was getting lower borrowing rates than neighboring 
governments on more than half a billion dollars in outstanding notes, and he 
said Leifer deserved much of the credit because of his aggressive negotiations 
and "extreme knowledge" of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks before the county's bonds were issued, Citron said, Leifer 
traveled to New York and spoke repeatedly with investors to "hammer away" at a 
higher-than-acceptable interest rate, holding the bonds out of the market until 
the rate came down. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the 11th year that we have used the services of Mr. Leifer," Citron 
wrote. "Instead of going out each year to select a new financial team, because 
of our experience with Mr. Leifer, we have found that his expertise has 
resulted in the County receiving not only the lowest (interest) rate . . . but 
most often the lowest costs." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Leifer's references from Citron helped him solicit other business 
around the state. Leifer scored one of his most important victories in 1990 by 
winning the job of financial adviser to the Orange County Transportation 
Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation agency Director Stan Oftelie remembers that Leifer came to him 
with high marks from Citron. "I called Bob on him, and he said he'd done really 
good work for the county, talked about how strong he was in negotiating," 
Oftelie said. "Having (Citron) as a reference was really positive." 
</P>
<P>
 But after several years of work, there were "grumblings" that Leifer's fees 
were too high, said Gary Hausdorfer, chairman of the transportation agency 
until last year. Ultimately, the board pledged to seek more competition for its 
financial contracts and replaced Leifer this year as its adviser, when he was 
out-bid. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a feeling that it was time to re-look at the deal and make sure we 
weren't paying too much for services. It wasn't people screaming and yelling 
that Jeff was doing a lousy job and had to go. It was more a question of 
needing a change." 
</P>
<P>
 But government officials in other municipalities that have used Leifer praised 
his work this week, saying he combined expertise with accessibility. And 
perhaps most critically, his connections helped even smaller governments 
issuing notes worth only a few million dollars -- a pittance by Orange County 
standards -- to gain entry to the world of Wall Street high finance. 
</P>
<P>
 "He seemed to really know what he was doing," said John C. Brown, the interim 
county administrator for Yuba County, whom Leifer advised on several notes. "He 
seemed to have the right connections. He knew the people in the finance 
industry, he knew the people at Standard & Poor's and Moody's (ratings 
agencies), and he got us talking to the people we needed to talk to. . . . That 
was a big factor."

ORANGE COUNTY TO LIQUIDATE ITS PORTFOLIO IN FINANCIAL OVERHAUL; BANKRUPTCY: 
JUDGE APPROVES ACTION TO PREVENT FURTHER LOSSES. OVERSEER SAYS FISCAL MESS 'IS 
GOING TO BE A PROBLEM FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS,' BUT COUNTY 'CAN GET OUT OF IT.'

 Orange County plans to unload its entire portfolio of risky securities as part 
of a massive overhaul of the county's debt-laden investment pool, whose 
participants have lost $2.02 billion -- or 27% of their investment -- this 
year, the county's financial advisers announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a bet made on the interest rates, and the county lost the bet," 
said former state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, who is directing the county's 
efforts to unravel the financial mess. "What happened is going to be a problem 
for a number of years to come. Orange County can get out of it, (but) it will 
be painful." 
</P>
<P>
 Over strong objections from several city and school officials, U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court Judge John E. Ryan ruled Tuesday that the county can begin selling off 
its troubled bond holdings. The ruling remains in effect until Friday, when 
another hearing is set to reconsider the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's bankruptcy lawyer, Bruce Bennett, had argued that a liquidation 
had to begin for the county to avoid further losses should interest rates rise 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Salomon Bros., the county's financial advisers, each percentage 
point increase in interest rates will trim the portfolio's value by $300 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Tuesday in the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in 
U.S. history: 
</P>
<P>
 * Several members of the public, in their first opportunity to address the 
Orange County Board of Supervisors, blamed the board for the financial crisis. 
"The fingers should be pointing at all of you," said Linda Johnson of Dana 
Point. "You're incompetent, you've been negligent and I think you all should 
resign." 
</P>
<P>
 * City and school district officials with funds tied up in the frozen 
investment pool took steps to curb spending. The Irvine Unified School District 
imposed a hiring freeze and delayed construction projects. In Brea, officials 
postponed groundbreaking on a $7-million community center. And Huntington Beach 
indefinitely postponed construction of a restaurant at the end of the city's 
famed pier, a project in the planning stages for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 * County officials put off plans for an $82-million communication network that 
police consider a vital update of the county's antiquated system. It was the 
first big-ticket item to land on the county's casualty list. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maureen DiMarco, California's secretary of child development and education, 
assured the teachers, school officials and parents of Orange County that 
despite the county's budget crisis, schools will remain open, all employees 
will be paid and "business will continue as usual." 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Marshack, a bankruptcy attorney representing several school 
districts, said his clients should receive all of their money and not absorb 
any losses because schools are required by state law to deposit their money in 
the county treasury and had no say in its investment policy. County officials, 
however, have suggested that the losses be distributed equally among all 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gov. Pete Wilson said he had no sympathy for five school districts and 
agencies that took the extraordinary step of borrowing money to invest in the 
county pool. "That's like taking the milk money and playing bingo with it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lawmakers in Sacramento and Washington called for hearings into Orange 
County's crisis and ways to deter other local governments from making such 
high-stakes investments with the public's money. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Federal Transit Administration announced that $8.8 million should arrive 
by week's end -- a five-month advance on next year's transit funds for Orange 
County. The money will pay for bus and rail operations for the next 100 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street reacted cautiously to the potential liquidation of the county's 
remaining portfolio, which holds the savings of 187 government agencies and a 
number of individuals who were awarded damages in lawsuits. Most bond dealers 
said finding buyers for the more complicated securities won't be impossible, 
but that potential buyers will demand attractive returns to accept the 
securities. Details Emerge 
</P>
<P>
 A picture of the troubled portfolio emerged in greater detail Tuesday, as 
Hayes laid out the financial predicament and said the immediate goals are to 
improve Orange County's liquidity, remove the risk from the portfolio and 
replace long-term securities with more short-term investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors followed up with two specific actions. It formally 
hired Salomon Bros. to manage and help restructure the fund, now valued at $5.4 
billion. And the board agreed to free up previously "restricted" county funds 
-- emergency surplus money -- to help out the current cash crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will enable us to have more flexibility in moving county dollars to 
critical areas during this bankruptcy process," said County Administrative 
Officer Ernie Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 During a news conference, Hayes said "there was still considerable risk" in 
the county fund. He added that the county's liquidation would be conducted in 
"an orderly fashion." Stressed Hayes: "It's not a fire sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the turmoil, Hayes said the county retains "an underlying strength" of 
job growth, low unemployment rate and high household income. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to urge all of you: It is important we don't panic," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 In federal Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday, city managers and school district 
officials objected to the county's plan to sell any of its $5.4 billion in 
securities that remain. 
</P>
<P>
 One attorney who represents Brea and Buena Park said her clients had "been 
kept in the dark the entire time." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, the county's bankruptcy lawyer, urged Judge Ryan to approve the plan 
during the Santa Ana hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do nothing, the casino stays open and the dice will keep rolling," 
Bennett said. "This court needs to help us close the casino and put the dice 
away and start dealing with the substantial problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said he would not do anything to "undercut the county's ability to get 
control of the situation. It's important that what happens here reinforces a 
positive market perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was the first since the county filed for federal bankruptcy 
protection on Dec. 6. Status of Portfolio 
</P>
<P>
 An analysis of the county's investment portfolio by Salomon Bros. provided the 
most comprehensive look yet at how much the county's holdings have deteriorated 
since early this month, when county leaders announced the investment troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Structured notes -- exotic securities that are likely to be the hardest 
holdings to sell -- now comprise 60.1% of the pool, up from 47% as recently as 
a week ago. The probable explanation is that investment bankers sold a large 
share of the pool's better-grade securities as they redeemed their collateral 
last week on unpaid loans to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon officials said the average maturity of holdings in the pool is now 
about four years, sharply higher than the 2 1/2 years reported by former county 
Treasurer Robert L. Citron as recently as September. Portfolios tend to be much 
more sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates as their maturities lengthen; 
with rates going up, the value of longer-term securities tends to get pummeled. 
County officials said they hope to slash the average maturity to less than six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes and William D. Rifkin, a Salomon managing director, hinted in an 
interview that investment firms that dumped the county's holdings onto the 
market last week may not have gotten the best price for them. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the more conventional securities among the holdings were currently 
valued at 95-96% of their face values, but that the investment firms sold the 
county's collateral at an average of only 90%. Rifkin later declined to say 
specifically that the firms had undercut the market, but he did note: "Clearly 
they sold the securities quickly." Residents Angry 
</P>
<P>
 The emerging financial fallout has angered many citizens, some of whom 
addressed the board at Tuesday's meeting, the first public session to address 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You were negligent," Tustin attorney Stephen Johnson told the supervisors. 
"What won't work is the current board. Stop blaming others." 
</P>
<P>
 Teddi Alves, a local broker, directed her outrage at Ernie Schneider, the 
county's top administrator. "I'm not here to shoot fish in a barrel, but I 
think there should be layoffs and they should start with you, Mr. Schneider," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, county officials cut off all but essential spending related to 
health, safety and welfare because of the cash crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors still had no idea Tuesday whether they would be getting paid. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Wilson asked Treasurer-elect Matt Fong to lead a task force to 
review the investment practices of California cities, counties and other public 
agencies. Wilson, though, said it was too soon to call for a special session of 
the Legislature, as has been suggested by Assembly Democratic leader Willie 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a Senate Banking Committee 
member, called for a fact-finding session Thursday in Anaheim to discuss the 
financial turmoil. Hayes and state Controller Gray Davis are among the invited 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawsuits continued to be filed by bondholders and investors in the county 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit filed by Los Angeles County residents David and Rosalyn Bare alleged 
that Citron, Assistant Treasurer Matthew R. Raabe and two investment houses 
fraudulently led them to believe that the county's troubled bond pool was 
relatively risk-free. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bares purchased bonds issued by the county and other municipalities that 
participated in the investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Their lawsuit is the fourth federal class-action suit filed in connection with 
the Orange County bankruptcy case, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Tuesday, a fifth class-action lawsuit was filed in Orange County Superior 
Court on behalf of hundreds of youngsters and others who invested settlements 
from car accidents in the county investment pool on the advice of local judges. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors include Robin DeLeon, a 14-year-old from Huntington Beach, who 
received a settlement in April, 1993. The complaint alleges that her guardian, 
Susan McGivney, agreed to deposit the undisclosed amount in the county pool "on 
the recommendation of an unnamed Superior Court judge" who presided over the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLeon, McGivney and the attorneys could not be reached for comment.

<P>
 Here is a status report on the Orange County fund: 
</P>
<P>
 * Current Loss: About $2.02 billion in value from the $7.4 billion invested by 
the county, schools, special districts and others -- a decline of 27%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Future Ups and Downs: With every 1% increase in interest rates, the fund 
will lose another $300 million in value. With every 1% decline in rates, the 
fund will gain $300 million in value. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assets: About $5.4 billion, after subtracting remaining $2.5 billion pledged 
for borrowings from securities firms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quick Cash: About $230 million cash and investments that readily can be 
converted to cash. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maturity: Fund investments have an average maturity of four years, which the 
county and its advisers plan to reduce. 
</P>
<P>
 * Working it Out: New investment plan calls for fund to consist entirely of 
short-term Treasury and government agency securities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Portfolio Breakdown: Part consists of conventional investments, such as 
fixed-rate corporate and government agency debt. But most consist of so-called 
structured notes, primarily "inverse floaters" that lose value as interest 
rates go up and gain value as rates go down. 
</P>
<P>
 Structured notes: 60% 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional investments: 40%

NEWS ANALYSIS; CHALLENGE FOR FUND ADVISERS: AVOID FIRE SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO and MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buyers can be found for the complex bonds remaining in Orange County's doomed 
investment fund, but the challenge for the fund's advisers is to avoid a fire 
sale -- and in the meantime keep the securities' value from diminishing 
further. 
</P>
<P>
 Accomplishing all of that in the take-no-prisoners world of today's financial 
markets will be crucial to limiting the fund investors' loss to what is now 27 
cents on each dollar they put in, the fund's advisers conceded Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, reaction to the workout proposal unveiled by the county's 
adviser, the Salomon Bros. brokerage, was generally positive. But experts 
warned that any number of variables could upset the plan -- including another 
potential interest rate hike when the Federal Reserve Board meets next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon and fund overseer Thomas W. Hayes, the former California state 
treasurer, made clear Tuesday that they intend to rid the portfolio of the 
high-risk, long-term bonds that were central to the fund's ill-fated bet on 
falling interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they left open the question of exactly how quickly they will proceed, 
except for setting a six-month deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes pledged that "we are not going to do a fire sale" with the remaining 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
 But wringing the best possible prices from potential buyers will be tough, 
many analysts say, because the sophisticated investor audience for the complex 
securities is relatively limited. 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise to some experts, Salomon estimated that the fund's "structured 
note" derivatives -- hybrid bonds that make up 60% of the remaining portfolio 
-- have lost only 10.1% of their market value this year. The conventional bonds 
constituting the rest of the portfolio are down 4.4% in value, according to 
Salomon's estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Structured notes are designed to produce varying rates of return depending on 
the movements of interest rates or the prices of other securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Salomon said the fund's portfolio now is worth $5.4 billion, after 
subtracting loans still outstanding to a handful of lenders. That figure 
represents a 27% loss to the fund's investors, based on the $7.4 billion the 
county now says the investors put in. 
</P>
<P>
 The size of the investors' loss has been magnified by the fund's heavy use of 
borrowed money to balloon its wrong-way bet on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Tuesday, some derivatives experts who have studied the county fund's 
holdings expressed surprise at Salomon's estimate of the remaining bonds' 
market value. Some of the fund's structured notes have dropped more than 20% 
this year, these analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the structured notes in the fund are designed to pay lower interest 
rates as market interest rates rise, as has occurred over the past 12 months. 
Thus, their value declines sharply with each rate increase. 
</P>
<P>
 One Wall Street derivatives expert went so far as to call Salomon's price tag 
on the fund "ludicrous," though he could not give a reason why Salomon would 
overestimate the portfolio's value. If the brokerage has been overly 
optimistic, the municipalities in the fund may build up false hopes for 
limiting their ultimate losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon's market value estimate also is important because it indicates the 
price level at which Salomon expects to begin receiving bids for the bonds. At 
the same time, it gives potential buyers an idea of how much negotiating room 
they may have. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Wall Street traders said Salomon is warning them against submitting 
low-ball bids for the bonds. Still, many were skeptical that Salomon can avoid 
adding to the fund's huge losses as it liquidates the securities, especially if 
the liquidation is rapid. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're telling us they're going to sell in a 'controlled' fashion, but 
define that," said one mutual fund manager contacted by Salomon. "Their first 
goal is to get rid of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike conventional fixed-rate bonds, structured notes and other derivatives 
are attractive to a limited audience of investors because of the relative 
difficulty in putting a daily price tag on them and in understanding their 
risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you're going to see much bidding on these," said Zahid Ullah, 
principal at Gotham Derivatives Inc. in New York. And by definition, a smaller 
pool of bidders will mean that pricing negotiations will be tougher than if all 
the securities were conventional bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street brokerages themselves -- Salomon excluded -- will probably be the 
principal bidders for the derivatives, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the participation of certain big brokerages may be in doubt. A number of 
major firms are at risk of being sued by the county for calling in loans to the 
fund last week, precipitating the bankruptcy filing. The county has sued Nomura 
Securities and has pledged to file suit against the other major brokerages that 
redeemed its collateral. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether those same firms now would stand up as buyers for the rest of the 
fund's securities is not clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes and William D. Rifkin, the chief Salomon adviser on the fund, indicated 
that they expect some insurance companies and mutual funds to be buyers of the 
remaining bonds. But many of those investors are under no pressure to buy 
unless they can strike sweet deals, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be interested," said Art Steinmetz, manager of the Oppenheimer 
Strategic Income bond mutual fund in New York. "But we're interested only if we 
can get this stuff at distressed levels -- if it's cheap enough," meaning that 
the bonds' prices would have to be set low enough to offer the buyers extremely 
attractive returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Rifkin said another option for the fund is to attempt a restructuring of some 
of its bonds with the original issuers, mainly government agencies such as the 
Federal Home Loan Bank System, the Federal National Mortgage Assn. and the 
Student Loan Marketing Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction in returning to those issuers to essentially "unwind" the 
derivatives' structures is that it might be less costly for the fund than 
selling the securities to other investors, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agencies would be unlikely to offer the fund a bailout of any kind; 
they would only restructure the bonds if it meant no change in their own 
financing situation and costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokespersons for all three of the agencies said Tuesday that they either are 
having discussions with the fund's representatives or anticipate having them. 
</P>
<P>
 At a minimum, many analysts expect the fund to turn to at least one more set 
of derivative transactions before being liquidated -- some sort of interest 
rate swap that would hedge at least a portion of the portfolio against any 
further increases in market interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 A swap would effectively freeze much of the fund's losses where they currently 
stand, though such a transaction also would keep the fund from enjoying any 
benefit of a sudden decline in market interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Wall Street experts say that rather than sell the remaining bonds in a 
short time period, the smarter strategy would be to hold the securities and 
dispose of them over a longer period -- while hedging away the interest rate 
risk inherent in them via a swap. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing we'd tell them (the county) is, 'Don't sell,' " said Ullah. 
</P>
<P>
 But with many Orange County municipalities in need of cash and eager to 
extricate themselves from the debacle -- and also eager to excise the 
derivatives stigma from their shrunken portfolio -- Ullah and other analysts 
concede that a fast liquidation of the bonds might be the most politically 
expedient approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street sources also say a speedy dissolution would probably be preferred 
by Salomon because of the potential fees that could be generated for a 
relatively brief investment of time by the firm. More on Bankruptcy

 Strategies for Stabilizing/Liquidating Portfolio 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the alternatives available to stabilize and liquidate the investment 
fund: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Hedge and liquidate portfolio over time 
</P>
<P>
 * Lock in current value (no further losses or gains) 
</P>
<P>
 * Limit further losses while maintaining upside exposure 
</P>
<P>
 2) Sell portfolio immediately in an orderly fashion 
</P>
<P>
 * Sell portfolio as a single unit 
</P>
<P>
 * Divide portfolio by security type and sell in blocks 
</P>
<P>
 * Sell portfolio security by security 
</P>
<P>
 3) Restructure portfolio over time 
</P>
<P>
 How Different Strategies Compare 
</P>
<P>
 Lock in Current Value (no further losses or gains) 
</P>
<P>
 Pros: Eliminates interest rate exposure and allows sale of securities in less 
volatile environment 
</P>
<P>
 Cons: Doesn't generate needed cash; possibly imperfect protection against 
interest rate movements; cost of such protection; requires use of derivatives 
</P>
<P>
 Limit Further Losses 
</P>
<P>
 Pros: Eliminates risk of further losses while allowing for potential gains 
</P>
<P>
 Cons: Doesn't generate needed cash; possibly imperfect protection against 
interest rate movements; requires use of new derivatives 
</P>
<P>
 Sell Portfolio as a Single Unit 
</P>
<P>
 Pros: Fast execution; immediate elimination of market risk; less disruptive to 
market; allows immediate deployment of funds to appropriate investments 
</P>
<P>
 Cons: Limited number of bidders; valuing portfolio is complex 
</P>
<P>
 Sell Portfolio in Blocks or Security by Security 
</P>
<P>
 Pros: Larger potential number of bidders, takes advantage of their individual 
interests 
</P>
<P>
 Cons: Length of time needed to carry out; exposed to market risks until 
process is completed 
</P>
<P>
 Restructure Portfolio 
</P>
<P>
 Pros: Maintains existing market position in hopes market interest rates fall 
</P>
<P>
 Cons: Assets are inappropriate for most fund investors, considering their 
objectives 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended Strategy 
</P>
<P>
 Immediate Objective: Make cash available quickly and easily while safeguarding 
portfolio value. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary Step: Determine size of immediate cash needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Restructured Portfolio: Short-term Treasury and government agency investments. 
Ultimately, no borrowing, derivatives or structured notes (such as "inverse 
floaters," which pay less as interest rates rise and vice versa).

GOP PROPOSES SAN DIEGO FOR CONVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL and TONY PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republicans selected San Diego Tuesday as the proposed site of their national 
presidential nominating convention in 1996 -- 24 years after the city was 
ingloriously stripped of the 1972 party conclave at virtually the last moment 
under a cloud of political scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice of San Diego for the 1996 Republican National Convention is 
contingent on negotiation of a satisfactory financial package with the city. 
But state and national party leaders said Tuesday they are confident there will 
be no hitches and that the decision essentially had been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Final ratification is scheduled at a meeting of the Republican National 
Committee in Washington in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed dates of the meeting in the San Diego Convention Center are Aug. 
12-15, 1996. While the early political posturing has begun, the Republican 
presidential sweepstakes appears to be wide open at the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats will convene in Chicago later in August, presumably to nominate 
President Clinton for a second term. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest for the 1996 meeting earlier narrowed to three cities: San Diego, 
New Orleans and San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 The news was greeted with jubilation in California's southernmost city, the 
second most populous in the state and sixth in the nation, but one that often 
has suffered a civic inferiority complex and a lack of recognition for its 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Susan Golding, who has led a six-month effort by civic leaders to win 
the convention, said: "This will give us a chance to show the whole world that 
San Diego is the cosmopolitan, sophisticated city it is." 
</P>
<P>
 To get the convention, the San Diego host committee agreed to raise between 
$10 million and $16 million from private sources to pay for organizing costs. 
The city is guaranteeing the GOP 20,000 class-A hotel rooms, adequate police 
protection and a reconfiguration of the convention hall seating. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will draw an estimated 20,000 delegates, party officials, media 
representatives and guests who are expected to spend as much as $41 million. 
Even so, that will not yield the city a major financial bonanza compared to a 
normal August week in the height of the tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
 The real windfall to the city is in exposure in the national and world media. 
</P>
<P>
 "This helps put San Diego on the world stage and it's about time," said Dave 
Nuffer, a Chamber of Commerce leader who complains to this day that the 1972 
GOP convention "was cruelly whisked away" from San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 This will be the third GOP convention to be held in California. The first was 
in San Francisco in 1956 when Dwight D. Eisenhower was renominated. In 1964, 
the Republicans nominated Barry Goldwater for President over New York Gov. 
Nelson A. Rockefeller in a titanic ideological struggle, also in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 That meeting effectively ended the power of the so-called Rockefeller wing of 
moderates in the Republican Party and spawned the Ronald Reagan era in American 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic conventions were held in San Francisco in 1920 and 1984 and in Los 
Angeles in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican National Convention was set for San Diego in 1972, to 
triumphantly nominate Richard Nixon for a second term. Officially, the meeting 
was moved to Miami Beach a bare three months before it was scheduled to be held 
because of concerns over the adequacy of hotel rooms, the convention hall and 
possible labor problems. 
</P>
<P>
 What really scared off the GOP, however, political experts and insiders 
agreed, was the fuss raised when columnist Jack Anderson reported on a leaked 
memo attributed to ITT lobbyist Dita Beard. In the memo, Beard was alleged to 
have claimed that the Justice Department dropped an antitrust suit against the 
firm after it contributed $400,000 to the San Diego convention effort. 
</P>
<P>
 One of ITT's Sheraton hotels was to have served as a San Diego convention 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1972, San Diego has grown to 1.2 million people and has played host to 
baseball's World Series, football's Super Bowl, yachting's America's Cup and 
the opening this month of the Mighty Morphin Power Ranger concert tour. 
</P>
<P>
 But nothing has salved the ignominy of losing the 1972 convention until now. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great moment for 'America's Finest City,' " said California Gov. 
Pete Wilson, who was San Diego mayor in 1972 and is among those figuring in 
speculation about potential GOP presidential candidates in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, local leaders have believed that San Diego was in the lead to get 
the 1996 convention, but none have been willing to say so publicly, lest the 
comments jinx matters. Four years ago, the city thought it had the inside track 
for the GOP convention, only to see it go to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1996 convention would be held in the city's gleaming Convention Center 
opened beside San Diego Bay in 1989 after construction costing $161 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The one sticking point for San Diego had been the center's modest size 
compared to the Alamodome (48,000) in San Antonio and the Louisiana Superdome 
(40,000) in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 The main ballroom of the center will be redesigned to seat 19,400 -- including 
1,500 in new skyboxes -- and to accommodate the needs of network television. As 
part of its bid package, San Diego employed a "virtual reality" video showing 
how the ballroom would look. 
</P>
<P>
 "High tech helped convince the Republican National Committee to come here," 
Mayor Golding said. To make sure that the Convention Center's size is never 
again a problem, the City Council has approved expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 There were reports that the controversy over Proposition 187, the successful 
November ballot initiative that cuts off state aid to illegal immigrants, 
caused some concern among moderate Republicans about a San Diego selection. But 
Michael Grebe, a Wisconsin member of the Republican National Committee and 
chairman of the site selection committee, said this was not a major factor in 
the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Grebe also discounted the possibility that going to Wilson's home city might 
enhance his chances of winning the GOP presidential nomination. He said he has 
never seen the convention city have that sort of impact. Besides, Wilson has 
said he has no plans to become a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor welcomed the news, however, as an opportunity to demonstrate the 
success of the "California Comeback" after several years of recession, state 
fiscal crisis, fire, earthquake, riots and other disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Republicans understand how important California is to the country and 
recognize that California continues to lead the nation in making fundamental 
change," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Grebe said that holding the convention in California is recognition of 
the state's importance to GOP chances of winning back the White House. Most 
political experts claim that Clinton would have no chance of winning reelection 
without California's 54 electoral votes, one-fifth of the 270 needed to win the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 While the 1996 GOP meeting is a big draw, it will not be the biggest 
convention San Diego has lured. Next year, a national convention of Baptists is 
expected to draw 40,000 and the international convention of Alcoholics 
Anonymous 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Republicans can give San Diego something that the Baptists and others 
cannot, something that San Diego craves: international media coverage to tout 
its weather, desirability as a tourist destination and business-friendly 
political climate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be very few people anywhere that won't know what San Diego has to 
offer when this is over," Golding said. 
</P>
<P>
 Golding said that site selection committee members were impressed during their 
visit to discover such support for bringing the convention to San Diego among 
waiters, busboys and desk clerks, a kind of civic boosterism that might be hard 
to find in more blase big cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamber of Commerce estimates that the convention will pump tens of 
millions of dollars into local businesses, although those businesses would 
probably have made as much money even if the Republicans had gone to San 
Antonio or New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 August is the prime tourist season in San Diego, with hotels reaching peak 
occupancy and tourist sites brimming. To make room for the Republicans, 
conventions will have to be booted from the convention center, and prospective 
guests canceled from their hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Golding, a Republican and close ally of Wilson, was a City Council member, a 
sub-cabinet member for Gov. George Deukmejian, and a county supervisor before 
being elected mayor in 1992. She dodged questions about whether the convention 
will help her political career. 
</P>
<P>
 But asked if she would be opposed to addressing the convention delegates on 
national television, she smiled broadly and said, "Certainly not."

FACEOFF BETWEEN U.S. SHIP, CHINESE SUB IS REVEALED; MILITARY: OCTOBER INCIDENT 
IN YELLOW SEA HIGHLIGHTS GROWING CHANCE OF NAVAL CONFLICT. BEIJING SOUNDS 
WARNING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN and ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The American aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk and a Chinese nuclear submarine 
squared off in international waters off China's coast this fall in a maritime 
encounter that demonstrated the growing potential for naval conflict between 
the United States and China, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the incident, which occurred in the Yellow Sea on Oct. 27-29, 
China served notice through a U.S. military official in Beijing that the next 
time such a situation arises, China's orders will be to shoot to kill, Pentagon 
officials confirmed this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although in the end no shots were fired in the high-seas confrontation, U.S. 
officials acknowledge that it was serious. The captain of the Kitty Hawk 
dispatched anti-submarine-warfare aircraft to drop sonic devices designed to 
track the nuclear sub, and Chinese jet fighters scrambled and flew within sight 
of the American planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, after the Chinese submarine withdrew to its base at the port of 
Qingdao, the U.S. aircraft carrier was pulled out of the area. The Kitty Hawk, 
whose home port is San Diego, had been used earlier to project American power 
in the Persian Gulf and off the coast of Somalia before it was transferred in 
July, at the height of the Korean crisis, to an American naval base in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The encounter underscored the growing maritime tensions between the U.S. 
Pacific Fleet and China, which is rapidly developing a blue-water navy. U.S. 
officials say they found the nuclear submarine in open waters where they had 
rarely spotted Chinese vessels before. There had been one other instance, in 
early September, in which U.S. Navy ships encountered a Chinese submarine, but 
that episode ended much more quietly. 
</P>
<P>
 The previously unreported incident also highlights some of the gunboat 
diplomacy involving the United States, China and North Korea that surrounded 
the U.S.-North Korean nuclear agreement reached Oct. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the Kitty Hawk was dispatched to waters off North Korea in what 
a U.S. military official acknowledged was a show of force intended to influence 
nuclear negotiations in Geneva -- in roughly the same way that the dispatch of 
American troops had induced Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras and his military regime to 
give up power in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Haiti example is a good example of how . . . some very strong 
military forces can influence diplomacy," Adm. Ronald Zlatoper, commander of 
the U.S. Pacific Fleet, told the newspaper Stars & Stripes at the time. He also 
said the deployment of the aircraft carrier near North Korea was "significant 
because, in the past, we haven't had a carrier battle group presence in this 
region." 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy's carrier battle group included not only the Kitty Hawk but also 
three cruisers, one frigate, one submarine, two logistics ships and an 
estimated 10,000 American naval personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 To the apparent consternation of Clinton Administration officials, the Yellow 
Sea incident took place less than two weeks after Secretary of Defense William 
J. Perry traveled to Beijing to try to improve military cooperation between the 
United States and China. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials have been watching as China has rapidly increased its naval 
strength, with the aid of some purchases from what was once the Soviet Union's 
navy. U.S. officials said this week that the Chinese navy recently ordered four 
conventional submarines from Russia and that one of those left St. Petersburg 
recently for refitting in another port. 
</P>
<P>
 The nuclear submarine encountered by the Kitty Hawk is one of five operated by 
China's navy. It is 330 feet long, weighs 5,000 tons and carries torpedoes, 
U.S. officials say. U.S. intelligence officials say the nuclear submarines 
don't often operate in the open ocean but that their operations have picked up 
lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Harlan W. Jencks, a UC Berkeley expert on the Chinese People's Liberation 
Army, wrote in a recent article that leaders in Beijing now view the American 
military presence in the Pacific as being "at least implicitly" in opposition 
to China. "Recent U.S. Navy exercises with Southeast Asian navies casting China 
as the potential troublemaker have reinforced this perception," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Yellow Sea incident, American anti-submarine aircraft detected the 
Chinese nuclear submarine off the Shandong peninsula, about 200 miles from the 
Kitty Hawk, Pentagon officials said. The Chinese vessel was found through 
electronic monitoring devices. At times during the three-day encounter, it 
operated at periscope depth, about 35 to 40 feet below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, the Chinese submarine eluded the carrier group, and American 
planes began dropping devices known as sonobuoys in an attempt to relocate it. 
After they found the ship, the Kitty Hawk and the U.S. planes continued to 
track it. In response, the Chinese air force at one point sent its jet fighters 
toward the aircraft dispatched by the Kitty Hawk. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese submarine then moved back to Qingdao, the main naval base on 
China's eastern coastline. In 1986, at a time when relations between Washington 
and Beijing were warmer, U.S. Navy warships visited Qingdao for their first 
port call on the Chinese mainland since the end of China's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.S. officials, China's warning that it will use force next time 
was made to an American military attache during a dinner in Beijing. Chinese 
officials apparently felt that the warplanes accompanying the Kitty Hawk may 
have come close enough to the mainland to violate Chinese airspace. It is not 
clear whether U.S. and Chinese officials have had further discussions of the 
incident since the Chinese warning. 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.S. officials believe that China's strong reaction reflected some 
embarrassment that the U.S. carrier battle group operated in the vicinity of 
the Chinese coast. On Tuesday, a spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in 
Washington said accounts of the incident involving the Kitty Hawk and the 
Chinese submarine were just "rumors. . . . Nothing happened." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials insist that the Kitty Hawk and its planes did not violate 
Chinese airspace, a fact they say was confirmed by satellite tracking equipment 
aboard the aircraft. And Pentagon officials insist that the Kitty Hawk's 
captain did "the appropriate thing" by tracking the Chinese sub, because "there 
always are concerns" about other powers' nuclear submarines. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (Chinese officials) have never defined what they consider to be their 
territorial limit," one Pentagon official said Tuesday. As a result, he said, 
from the U.S. Navy's point of view, the limit is the traditional 12 nautical 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pentagon sources, Adm. Richard Macke, commander in chief of all 
U.S. forces in the Pacific, informally admonished Zlatoper for appearing to 
suggest in the published interview that the deployment of the Kitty Hawk near 
North Korea was timed to influence the diplomatic talks between the Clinton 
Administration and Pyongyang. Zlatoper said Stars & Stripes linked too closely 
words he had spoken in separate parts of the interview. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department officials reportedly were unhappy with Zlatoper's comments, 
which gave North Korean negotiators a reason to attack the United States at the 
Geneva talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon afterward, the aircraft carrier pulled into the South Korean port of 
Pusan, and Rear Adm. Dennis C. Blair, the commander of the Kitty Hawk battle 
group, said the deployment of the carrier group was "not specifically tied to 
the rhythm of the negotiations in Geneva." The Kitty Hawk was then moved away 
from Korean waters to east of Japan. A Show of Force 
</P>
<P>
 The events leading to the tense showdown between a U.S. aircraft carrier and a 
Chinese nuclear submarine off the eastern coast of China: 
</P>
<P>
 * July 16: Kitty Hawk arrives in Japan from Persian Gulf. United States, Japan 
announce plans for joint naval exercises in East China Sea, first in that area 
since 1988, at time of Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sept. 22: Aircraft carrier battle group, including Kitty Hawk, three 
cruisers, one frigate, two logistics ships, one submarine and an estimated 
10,000 naval personnel, is dispatched to waters off Korean coast. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 3: Kitty Hawk reported to be in South Korean port in Pusan; commander 
says its visit is routine and not meant for military showdown. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oct. 27-29: In Yellow Sea, Kitty Hawk encounters Chinese nuclear submarine. 
U.S. anti-submarine-warfare planes drop sound buoys to keep track of the sub; 
China scrambles jet fighters toward Kitty Hawk. Chinese submarine proceeds to 
base at Qingdao.

 UC Irvine doesn't plan to mail registration and financial aid materials to its 
17,000 students next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry; it's not the latest fallout from Orange County's fiscal crisis. 
The school simply is dumping the post office in favor of electronic 
distribution by computer. On-time -- indeed, instantaneous -- delivery is 
guaranteed, and the university expects to save $225,000 a year in postage, as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's decision is but one sign of the unprecedented technological and 
competitive challenges shaking the foundations of America's postal system. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged by deteriorating service or seizing upon faster, more convenient 
forms of communication, Americans who can afford to are dumping the U.S. Postal 
Service for all but the most pedestrian tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 The post office's share of express mail -- a business it invented -- dropped 
below 9% this year. Electronic communications such as e-mail and fax 
transmissions grew by as much as 15% -- or five times the growth rate of 
regular mail. Business-to-business mailings have plummeted, down 10 billion 
pieces in the last five years. Person-to-person mail, meanwhile, accounts for 
less than 4% of the postal stream, a figure that is steadily falling. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even as it loses grasp of some of the most profitable lines of 
communication, the post office finds itself buried under an ever-increasing 
volume of mail. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, its army of 782,000 mail handlers, clerks and letter carriers and 
supervisors -- the largest civilian work force in the nation -- is grappling 
with the closing days of its busiest Christmas season ever. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's been that kind of year: In the 12 months that ended Sept. 30, the 
post office handled a record 177 billion pieces of mail. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a year, too, in which thousands of pounds of undelivered mail were 
discovered in trailer trucks and under roadside culverts in Chicago, a year in 
which service in Washington, D.C., was so bad that 10,000 of Vice President Al 
Gore's holiday cards were delivered up to 10 weeks' late. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Postal Service, restoring public confidence in its ability to deliver 
the mail on time while it tries to reinvent itself for the paperless society is 
a daunting task -- one that former Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank once 
compared to "rebuilding and remodeling an airplane while we are flying it." 
</P>
<P>
 No one believes the plane is about to drop out of the sky. Indeed, current 
Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon Jr. insists that doubts about the agency's 
future are overblown. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they invented the telegraph, people said, 'That's it, the mail is going 
out of business,' " he said in an interview. "When the telephone came along, 
they said, 'People will stop writing letters.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is no denying that the U.S. Postal Service is chronically, 
critically ailing: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ordinary Americans are angrier than ever about the deterioration in service, 
with a record number of formal complaints topping 513,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In metropolitan areas with antiquated facilities such as Chicago, New York, 
Washington and Baltimore, more than a quarter of all letters fail the agency's 
own standard of overnight local delivery for first-class mail. Carnegie Hall in 
Manhattan refuses to mail out tickets for events less than eight days in 
advance, even if the buyer lives a few blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates will go up Jan. 1, with the price of a first-class letter climbing to 32 
cents from 29 cents. That is expected to give the Postal Service a badly needed 
cash infusion of nearly $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is a stopgap measure -- the system is likely to plead for another rate 
hike in 1997 -- and it comes with no assurance that customers will get better 
service along with the higher costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * An automation campaign once regarded as the key to the Postal Service's 
ability to handle increased mail flow is at least two years behind schedule. 
Critics in part blame Runyon, who suspended vital elements of the program upon 
taking office two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The lag means slower processing -- at much higher cost -- as workers continue 
to sort 10% of the mail by hand, much the way things were done when Benjamin 
Franklin established a post office for the American Colonies 240 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * In a baleful omen for an organization that spends 83% of its budget on 
labor, employee morale is disastrously low. In a September report, Congress' 
General Accounting Office said dictatorial managers, adversarial union 
attitudes and a lack of programs to reward good workers and weed out bad ones 
all fostered a "dysfunctional organizational culture." 
</P>
<P>
 One out of 12 employees has a pending grievance that had to be referred to 
regional supervisors, meaning it could not be resolved informally or locally. 
Pending grievances reached 51,827 in 1993, an increase of 47% from four years 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working six days a week, nine and 10 hours a day under a lot of pressure is 
finally taking its toll," one exhausted worker complained. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Postal Service fails consistently to meet challenges from private 
competitors. Companies such as Federal Express and United Parcel Service use 
lower-paid workers, pricing flexibility and better service to take business 
away. After 20 years of struggling against such competition, the Postal Service 
still has trouble tracking down a letter or package that goes astray in its 
vast network. Next-day Express Mail is the only guaranteed service it offers. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Lou Taverna, a photo processor in Coral Springs, Fla., was so 
frustrated by the time it took his Priority Mail packages to reach their 
destinations that he filed a complaint with the Federal Communications 
Commission charging postal authorities with false advertising for promising 
two-day delivery for $2. The Postal Service changed its ads 1993, dropping the 
promise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite ambitious claims of increased efficiencies, the postal payroll is 
growing rapidly. A generous buyout program -- designed to provide $1 billion in 
annual savings -- prompted 48,000 of the Postal Service's then 721,000 
employees to leave in 1992 and 1993. But the departing workers included many 
experienced clerks, letter carriers and mail handlers. Runyon says the program 
will produce hefty long-term savings, but critics point to costly overtime and 
recruitment of new workers to fill many jobs since the buyout. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: The agency is bigger than when Runyon took over. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, when Congress created the Postal Service in 1971 and charged it 
with running as a business instead of a government bureaucracy, it left the new 
agency saddled with many of the constraints that had hobbled the old Post 
Office Department. 
</P>
<P>
 One was the cherished tradition of universal mail service at a uniform price. 
A one-ounce letter costs the same whether it is going across the street or to 
Guam. That means the stamp on a local letter to Grandma subsidizes delivery to 
remote areas of Alaska, where supermarkets receive their inventory by mail. 
Heavy Fixed Costs 
</P>
<P>
 "So long as you have to deliver six days a week and for the same price no 
matter where people live, you will have very heavy fixed costs almost 
impossible to cut dramatically," says Thomas Ellington, a former assistant 
postmaster general. He recalls being pilloried in the 1970s for daring to 
propose that delivery be cut back to alternate days. "You would have thought I 
declared World War II," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, when the post office wants to raise rates or offer a new product, it 
cannot jump headlong into the marketplace. First, it must get approval from the 
Postal Rate Commission, a regulatory body also established in 1971, which has 
up to 10 months to render a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of the advantages the Postal Service enjoys over private businesses -- 
including a tax exemption and the right to borrow money from the Treasury at 
preferential rates -- the commission always has refused to let it undercut the 
prices charged by private competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, the 535 elected officials in Congress -- each of whose 
districts has a postal payroll and constituents demanding their mail on time -- 
can exert political pressure on the system in ways a private business could 
barely imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 Steering the Postal Service through these shoals is Runyon, a 70-year-old 
Texas native and veteran executive of Ford Motor Co., Nissan Motors Inc., and 
the Tennessee Valley Authority who was appointed postmaster general by the 
Postal Board of Governors in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Postmasters general have always been lightning rods for criticism when the 
system is under stress. But the silver-haired Runyon's imperious demeanor, his 
preoccupation with cutting costs and holding down rates and the unparalleled 
economic and technological challenges faced by the postal system have combined 
to make his stewardship the focus of special scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're giving too much credence to the financial side of things and letting 
service go down the tubes," complained Robert Setrakian, a San Francisco 
businessman who is completing 10 years on the board of governors. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Runyon's moves to appease important postal customers do not always meet 
unalloyed appreciation. 
</P>
<P>
 By having delayed the rate increase for one year and limiting his request to 
10.3% across the board, Runyon sought to ensure the support of major customers 
-- notably third-class advertising mailers -- who otherwise could have 
stretched out the rate-approval process for months. But the Postal Rate 
Commission judged his plan to be too generous to the big mailers; its 
recommendation -- a 14% rate hike for newspapers, magazines and third-class 
mail -- won the board of governors' approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Runyon's rate increase deferral cost the agency as much as $6 billion, 
contributing heavily to its current negative net worth -- that is, piled up 
losses and debts exceeding its assets -- of $9 billion. Much of the shortfall 
has to be covered by borrowing, which will increase costs down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 And by waiting so long and requesting so little, Runyon has heightened the 
chance of another rate increase soon, according to Tim May, an attorney for big 
mailers. The result is "a huge cloud hanging over the post office, both the 
service and the financial condition." 
</P>
<P>
 How thick are the clouds? 
</P>
<P>
 The Postal Service suffered a loss of $914 million during the fiscal year that 
ended Sept. 15, compared with $371 million in the previous year. For postal 
planners, the bright spot was that the expected loss had been even bigger -- 
$1.3 billion. Service on Decline 
</P>
<P>
 By most measures, mail service has steadily deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal standards for first-class mail generally call for overnight delivery 
within a metropolitan area; that is, letters dropped in a mailbox before the 
last pickup of the day should be delivered the following day. Two-day service 
is promised within a 400- to 600-mile region, with three-day delivery the 
standard anywhere in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 For items mailed within the Los Angeles basin, the overnight zone includes all 
of Los Angeles and Orange counties, and the city of San Diego. The two-day zone 
covers the rest of California and such Western cities as Denver, Phoenix, Las 
Vegas and Seattle. The rest of the continental United States should receive 
letters from Los Angeles by the third day. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the latest Postal Service survey, 80% of Los Angeles' overnight 
mail is delivered on time -- as good as it gets in the nation's five biggest 
cities, but still below the expectations of both customers and the Postal 
Service itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, authorities have loosened the standards to make their performance 
look better. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 and 1991, for example, the agency relaxed its national service 
standards by shifting some overnight and two-day mail in many localities into 
the next slower delivery category. The change -- which moved 5% of overnight 
mail to two-day delivery and 7.5% of two-day mail to three-day -- was akin to 
an airline trying to improve on-time performance record by stretching out the 
scheduled length of chronically late flights. 
</P>
<P>
 By the original standards, performance sharply deteriorated -- to 76% on-time 
delivery of overnight items and 70% on-time delivery of two-day mail, according 
to a study this year by the New York State Consumer Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't train an athlete to pole-vault by lowering the pole," said Richard 
Bossert, the New York consumer analyst who conducted the study. "As recently as 
1976, they were talking about having one-day delivery throughout the country. 
But when you have a management that says, 'our statistics don't look good, so 
let's reduce the standards,' that attitude will permeate the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Postal officials said at the time that they adjusted the standards to better 
approximate reasonable expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Customer discontent, meanwhile, is rising as service levels sink. 
</P>
<P>
 A record 513,000 written and telephone complaints reached officials this year, 
up nearly 100,000 from a year ago and far above the 299,000 five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters flowing into Postal Service headquarters at L'Enfant Plaza in 
Washington are poignant, helpless and angry. One citizen asked, in vain, for 
$677; his auto insurance was canceled when his premium check arrived late, 
forcing him to buy a more costly policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Carpenter-Kester, a Washington lawyer on the board of a charitable 
trust, was shocked to learn that three donations the trust mailed to 
Washington-area homeless shelters in the metropolitan area disappeared. "Three 
checks simply never arrived at those institutions," she complained at a 
congressional hearing, "and we didn't know it until that long, hard, cold 
miserable winter for the homeless was over." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter-Kester's personal mail was a litany of missed letters, bills that 
never arrived, "20 examples of invitations, professional and personal, that I 
didn't even receive until after the events were over -- sometimes weeks later." 
</P>
<P>
 Things got worse when she moved from one house to another 2 1/2 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eventually I found out that there were construction workers in the house I 
had moved from, that they were hoarding the mail there, that hundreds of pieces 
of my mail had gone through the mail slot, although I had done everything I was 
supposed to to indicate the change of address," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Runyon acknowledges that overnight delivery, in particular, remains a major 
source of dissatisfaction. "We've got to get overnight service in the big 
cities up," he said. "I really think we ought to have at least a 90% target." 
But beyond resuming the automation program Runyon suspended, the Postal Service 
has no program in place to hit that goal. 95% Goal Sought 
</P>
<P>
 The automation program -- initiated in large part by Frank, Runyon's immediate 
predecessor -- aimed at having virtually all mail electronically sorted by next 
year. The slogan: "95% in '95." 
</P>
<P>
 The program's focus was the bar code -- strips of short, vertical lines that 
first became familiar in the grocery store and are visible on many envelopes. 
For postal purposes, the marks are a digital rendering of the nine-digit Zip 
Code and part of the street address, all readable by sorting machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank's idea was to give big mailers a discount for pre-printing their 
mailings with bar codes. He hoped that by 1995, about 40% of the mail would be 
pre-coded; another 40% would be encoded by post office equipment that would 
read a printed address, spray the bar code on the envelope and sort the mail. 
The rest -- much of it hand-addressed or otherwise unreadable by machine -- 
would have to be manually encoded. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need all of the mail stream automated or you can't get efficiencies out 
of it," Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Runyon froze automation spending when he took over, temporarily 
scattering the headquarters team responsible for training workers on the new 
machines. He says the postal governors wanted to take a second look. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was being interviewed," Runyon said, "I was told by the board: 'We 
have a $1.7-billion (automation) project before us. We're not ready to approve 
it, because we're not sure we're getting what we thought we were getting with 
automation.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the delays, today less than 60% of the mail carries bar codes; the 
95% automated goal has been put off until 1997 at the earliest. And the 
slowdown comes at great cost: The Postal Service itself says it spends $42 to 
sort 1,000 letters by hand, compared with $19 to handle them mechanically and 
just $3 for a machine scanning addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics say the delay sent exactly the wrong message. "They didn't need a 
breather, but more of a push," said Harry T. Whitehouse, president of Envelope 
Manager Software of Menlo Park, a firm that markets technology to both the 
Postal Service and big mailers. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, it remains unclear that automation is capable of making the 
Postal Service more efficient overall. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason is how hard it is to lay off postal workers whose jobs have been 
taken by machines. Under civil service rules, it can take as long as five years 
to fire a worker even for cause; economic layoffs are considered "reductions in 
force" and demand a complicated administrative process. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, major mailers told the rate commission earlier this year, one result 
of advanced technology has been the creation of a large cadre of "automation 
refugees" -- workers given make-work jobs after their original responsibilities 
were taken over by machines. 
</P>
<P>
 As proof, the mailers noted that "non-productive time" -- the portion of the 
workday comprised of break time, clocking in and out and moving empty equipment 
such as trays and carts -- soared to 28.4% of worker hours in 1993, from 18.3% 
in 1983 and 7.5% in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some places, they'd have 150 people doing manual sorting," said Hallstein 
Stralberg, a postal consultant to magazine publisher Time-Warner, which spends 
$400 million a year on postage. "They'd put in a machine to do that work, but 
they'd still have the 150 people." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, postal officials argue that the growth in non-productive time 
reflects not the failure of automation but its success. Fewer people are 
engaged in sorting the mail by hand, they say, but a larger share of hours are 
spent tending the machines -- a category of work so novel to the postal world 
that it is misleadingly labeled "non-productive." They say the bulk of 
automation's benefits are invisible, because they come in expenses not 
incurred. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we didn't have automation," said William J. Henderson, the service's 
senior vice president, "then today's volume would have cost us a cumulative $6 
billion more (to handle) since 1981." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Runyon is promising to offer a revolutionary scheme for classifying 
mail, reassessing the discounts big mailers get for doing the Postal Service's 
work -- sorting, boxing and otherwise preparing advertising-related mail for 
delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 But that plan won't alleviate the crushing pressures on the postal work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Some employees report being overloaded during their regular hours and then 
harassed when they put in for overtime. Others say they have run afoul of a 
concerted management campaign to cut down on sick leave, which the unions 
define as legitimate and management treats as absenteeism needing to be 
quashed. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the fight against overtime has been hampered by the aftermath of 
Runyon's buyout. Though the hope was to cut layers of bureaucracy, just 18,000 
managers left -- along with 30,000 veteran clerks and carriers. The typical 
departing worker had 25 years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had a lot of good people leave, and overtime went sky-high," observes 
ex-postmaster general Frank. "There was an overwhelming emphasis on cost 
without looking at service." 
</P>
<P>
 Runyon responds that the increase in volume contradicted all of the received 
wisdom of the time, which held that electronic mail was going to begin cutting 
even more deeply into the mail stream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't consider it a failure to improve your business by 10 billion pieces 
and have to hire some people to deliver the mail," he said. "The people that 
are new are taking care of new business." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, without service improvements, the agency will be hard-pressed to retain 
the big customers it needs to keep its huge work force busy -- customers whose 
business is constantly being solicited by a host of private firms offering 
alternate delivery or attracted by the allure of electronic alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to get things to the customers on time," said Chris Rubello of Current 
Inc., which mails 64 million catalogues each year, offering wrapping paper and 
other household items. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubello complains that over the last two years, delivery of his catalogues has 
been getting erratic -- not only in the big cities, which are chronic problem 
spots, but even in suburban and rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can't do it through the Postal Service," he said, "I will just have to 
find another way."

 To "bind the nation together through the personal, educational, literary and 
business correspondence of the people." That is the stated objective of the 
U.S. Postal Service. It is a massive -- some say impossible -- task, engaging 
780,000 workers in the unparalleled logistical challenge of delivering over 169 
billion pieces of mail annually. Here are the facts of postal life:

 A key measure of USPS performance is the percentage of first-class mail 
delivered on time within a city's next-day delivery area. The post office's 
pledge is to deliver 100% of mail within that zone overnight, but service 
generally falls short of the mark. Data are for May-September, 1994.

 May Pierstorff, 4, was mailed by her parents in Grangeville, Idaho to her 
grandparents in Lewiston, 100 miles away, in 1914. May weighed 48 1/2 pounds, 
less than the limit for parcel post, which was cheaper than a railroad fare. 
She travelled in the baggage car, with 53 cents in stamps on a tag on her coat. 
It is now illegal to mail people.

 A merchant shipped an entire bank, in small packages, from Salt Lake City to 
Vernal, Utah, before a road was built between the two communities. Some 80,000

BIGOTS' GROWING USE OF COMPUTER NETWORKS ASSAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alarmed by the growing presence of hate groups in cyberspace, the Simon 
Wiesenthal Center Tuesday sent a letter to the Prodigy on-line computer service 
protesting the "continued use of Prodigy by bigots to promote their agendas of 
hate." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based center said it has tracked increasing activity over the 
last few months by more than 50 hate groups using on-line services and the 
popular Internet global computer network. "More and more of these groups are 
embracing and utilizing the information superhighway," said Rabbi Abraham 
Cooper, associate dean of the center. "The slurs are the same but the venue is 
different." 
</P>
<P>
 The center called on commercial on-line services to keep hate groups out and 
proposed that the government play a similar policing role on the amorphous 
Internet. Of particular concern, Cooper said, is that young people could be 
exposed to white supremacy in an environment unmediated by teachers, parents or 
librarians. Much of the activity takes place on open electronic forums 
accessible to anyone with an Internet account or a subscription to a commercial 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 million computer users are connected to the Internet, and another 5 
million use commercial on-line services, including more than 2 million on 
Prodigy. 
</P>
<P>
 But civil libertarians -- and white supremacists themselves -- say that 
cyberspace, like any other medium of expression, must remain open to free 
speech. And in an uncharted territory where the rules of engagement are still 
unformed, the center's offensive is sure to sharpen the ongoing debate over 
electronic censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a genuinely difficult problem," says Marc Rotenberg, director of the 
Electronic Privacy Information Center, an on-line civil liberties organization. 
"And there are no paradigms to turn to." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a problem that is quickly becoming relevant to a lot more people. All 
sorts of enterprises, from businesses to charity organizations, have been 
rushing to get hooked up to computer networks, which offer fast, convenient 
communication at increasingly lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But for white supremacist groups like the National Alliance and the American 
Renaissance, cyberspace offers benefits that are proportionately far greater. 
</P>
<P>
 Marginalized by traditional media and short on funds, hate groups have been 
learning to use low-cost on-line communications to gain recruits and spread 
propaganda across state and even national boundaries, giving them access to a 
far wider audience than they have historically been able to reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Valerie Fields, for example, a West Los Angeles resident and political junkie, 
signs on to her Prodigy account a few times a week to read the discussion of 
local politics. Last month, she clicked her way into the "News" forum to find 
an anti-Latino diatribe that closed with a plug for a $20 subscription to the 
newsletter of Louisville, Ky.-based American Renaissance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Around the election the messages about (Prop.) 187 got pretty nasty," Fields 
said. "But then I saw this one that seemed to be from an organized white 
supremacist group, and that really freaked me out." 
</P>
<P>
 The message Fields saw, and several others, including one that referred to 
"The Diary of Anne Frank" as a "Jewish hoax" prompted the Wiesenthal Center to 
ask Prodigy to strengthen its guidelines to delete such messages from its 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having a discussion with them," Prodigy spokesman Brian Ek said Tuesday 
afternoon. "Our feeling is we already have a good system in place. But we have 
more than 1.7 million notes on the board at any given time, and we can't read 
them all." 
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy was the focus of controversy involving anti-Semitic comments in 1991, 
and worked with the Anti-Defamation League at the time to craft a policy that 
forbids "blatant expressions of hatred" on its boards. All messages are also 
run through a computer that scans for obscenities before they are posted. But 
Cooper says the service should look more carefully at messages that target 
groups rather than individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy is not the only on-line service to be utilized by hate groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Strom, who produces a weekly radio show for the National Alliance, and 
has been active on-line, said he was recently blocked from the "Political" and 
"Issues" forums on Compuserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently somebody complained that our articles were bashing ethnic 
minorities," Strom says. "So the system operator decided we didn't deserve 
freedom of speech." 
</P>
<P>
 Strom says the articles he posted on the forums were among those which users 
transferred most frequently to their home computers. One titled "The Wisdom of 
Henry Ford," which reviewed the book "The International Jew," was downloaded 
120 times one week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Compuserve leaves the decision of what to screen out to the individual 
"sysops" who are hired to moderate the service's discussion forums. Says 
Georgia Griffith, the Politics sysop: "We don't block users for what they 
believe or say, but how they say it. The First Amendment allows people to 
publish what they choose, but we are not obliged to publish it for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The legal issue of who is ultimately responsible for what does get "published" 
on-line is a thorny one that has yet to be entirely resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal judge ruled in 1991 that Compuserve was like a bookstore owner who 
could not be held accountable for the contents of books on his shelves -- a 
precedent the on-line services support. 
</P>
<P>
 But activists say there are ethical issues at stake, which public opinion can 
help to enforce -- at least in the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 The Internet, a web of several hundred computer networks not owned by any one 
enterprise, is a more difficult proposition. Cooper wrote a letter to Federal 
Communications Chairman Reed E. Hundt last summer suggesting that it "may be 
time for the FCC to place a cop on the Superhighway of Information." 
</P>
<P>
 But such an effort would involve significant technical difficulties, and would 
also likely encounter vehement opposition from civil liberties groups who want 
to preserve the Internet as a democratic forum that provides open. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its anarchic structure, the Internet has generally been viewed as a 
"common carrier" much like the telephone company, which cannot be held liable 
for what passes over its lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be a very dangerous path to go down," says EPIC's Rotenberg. It 
would lead to an extraordinary amount of censorship and control that would be 
very inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Discussion groups geared toward white supremacist propaganda on the Internet 
have labels such as "skinheads," "revisionism" and "vigilantes." The Institute 
for Historical Review recently set up a site on the World Wide Web portion of 
the Internet, where some of its literature can be obtained for free. A document 
called "Frequently Asked Questions about National Socialism" is available at 
several sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The computer commands used on the Internet also allow users to access 
information anonymously, which far-right activists say helps many to overcome 
the inhibitions they might have about signing up. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Alliance rents space on a computer at Netcom On-line 
Communication Services, one of the largest Internet access providers in 
California, where texts of its radio programs are available. It has also posted 
flyers on the Internet promoting its radio show, urging readers to send 
"minority parasites packing to fend for themselves" and condemning community 
development funding as support for black "breeding colonies." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a huge growth in use of the Internet by our people," says Alliance 
Chairman William Pierce. "The major media in this country are very biased 
against our political point of view. They present us with ridicule or in a very 
distorted way. The information superhighway is much more free of censorship. 
It's possible for a dedicated individual to get his message out to thousands 
and thousands of people."

FIGURES BEHIND PROP. 187 LOOK AT ITS CREATION; INITIATIVE: WORDING OF THE 
ANTI-ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT MEASURE IS UNDER HEIGHTENED LEGAL SCRUTINY. ITS DRAFTING 
WAS A COMMITTEE PROJECT, ITS CHIEF SPONSOR SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Throughout the fall election campaign and in state and federal courtrooms 
since, Proposition 187 has been repeatedly attacked as poorly written. "It 
looks as if this was enacted or drafted by one person drafting one section and 
some other person drafting another section," a U.S. district judge declared 
last month before blocking most portions of the sweeping ballot measure from 
taking effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, says the initiative's chief sponsor, the anti-illegal immigrant measure 
was drafted by committee. Moreover, proponents say they are proud it was 
prepared that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a committee of 10 and I worked with each and every member to make sure 
every word was written and approved by them," said Ron Prince, who chaired the 
pro-187 "Save Our State" campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 With the fate of Proposition 187 resting squarely in the courts, the wording 
of the get-tough initiative is under heightened legal scrutiny. If judges 
conclude that its language and intent fly in the face of state or federal 
statutes or the U.S. Constitution, it will not matter that it was approved by a 
59% to 41% margin. Just like the 1964 state initiative that banned 
anti-discrimination housing laws but was later declared unconstitutional, the 
key provisions of Proposition 187 would simply never take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The next major court date for the measure is scheduled today in Los Angeles 
before U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer, who will decide whether to 
issue a preliminary injunction halting the measure's implementation until the 
legal questions are resolved in prolonged court hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, a state court judge in San Francisco and U.S. District Judge W. 
Matthew Byrne Jr. in Los Angeles have issued temporary restraining orders 
raising constitutional questions about the initiative, which would bar illegal 
immigrants from public educational, non-emergency health care and social 
welfare services. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how was the measure stitched together and what was the thinking of its 
authors? In a series of post-election interviews, they said: 
</P>
<P>
 * The drafting of the measure was a group effort undertaken by a committee 
that included an unemployed accountant, a political consultant and a civilian 
police employee, as well as a state legislator and the nation's former top 
immigration officer. Many of the initiative's key elements were eventually 
reviewed on a piecemeal basis by the state legislative counsel's office, but 
the measure as a whole was never reviewed by state lawyers and few changes of 
import were suggested or made. 
</P>
<P>
 * Knowing that an educational ban would stir inevitable legal challenges 
because of a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling ensuring free public schooling for 
undocumented youngsters in Texas, some members of the "Save Our State" 
committee had deep reservations about whether to include a ban. However, after 
lengthy debate the committee agreed to do so in order to maintain the support 
of Orange County grass-roots activists who would be circulating the petitions 
to earn the measure a place on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although Harold Ezell, the most publicly recognizable leader of the pro-187 
movement, was long billed as the initiative's co-author, the former western 
regional director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service actually 
contributed no more than a handful of the words that appeared on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some leading sponsors, in hindsight, have second thoughts about the wording 
of the initiative, which calls for each educator, health administrator and law 
enforcement officer to report people he or she "reasonably suspects" of being 
illegal immigrants to state and federal authorities. Ezell, in particular, 
wishes the word suspects had never been included, because of its inflammatory 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no need to run red flags up like that," Ezell said. "It fanned the 
flames of the opposition. . . . To me, the word should have been better 
defined." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the proposition won by an overwhelming margin, several sponsors say 
the exact wording should now make little difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're picking it to death," said co-author Alan C. Nelson, a 
Sacramento-based attorney and director of the INS during the Reagan 
Administration. "The initiative sets forth the general principles and we'd have 
the state follow up with regulations and implementing procedures." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, many pro-187 voters appear angry that the measure has been blocked 
from taking effect by eight lawsuits filed by civil rights groups and 
government entities, including the Los Angeles Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 However, legal experts say the wording must play a key role in the ultimate 
fate of the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court has to decide whether this law as written is constitutional, not 
whether some imaginary law that could be better drafted is or is not 
constitutional," said USC constitutional law professor Erwin Chemerinsky. 
"Whether the law meets due process, whether it denies equal protection, the 
court has to consider: Is this statute constitutional?" 
</P>
<P>
 In issuing a temporary restraining order, Judge Byrne declared that the 
sections banning health and social services appear to conflict with federal 
laws. The initiative also does not provide for hearings before or after 
suspected illegal immigrants are denied government services. That, said Byrne, 
raises "serious questions" whether the initiative violates the constitutional 
right to due process. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 was spawned last fall in discussions among Orange County 
political consultant Robert Kiley; his wife, Yorba Linda Mayor Barbara Kiley; 
and Prince, an accountant who has been without work for three years, according 
to his recently filed bankruptcy papers. 
</P>
<P>
 To test the waters, Prince, who had previously launched an unsuccessful 
petition drive calling for lawyers in California to be re-examined every four 
years, stood outside a Vons supermarket in Tustin, seeking signatures for a 
vaguely defined anti-illegal immigration initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Barbara Kiley called Ezell for expert assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the (Kileys) came to me, I thought they were talking about illegal 
immigration in Yorba Linda," Ezell recalled. "So they came in and we talked for 
a couple of hours about illegal immigration and its impact and they knew very 
little about it at the time. It was a business consideration for them at the 
time. That's their business -- campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two hours later, this guy by the name of Prince comes in -- he was the guy 
who originally talked to them about it." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, Prince had big things on his mind: specifically, a national 
constitutional convention concerning immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prince's original idea," said Ezell, "was some cockamamie constitutional 
amendment that was so far out it had nothing to do with the issues we had in 
Proposition 187." 
</P>
<P>
 At a subsequent Oct. 5 meeting at the members-only Center Club in Costa Mesa, 
the committee expanded its ranks to 10, including Nelson, Assemblyman Richard 
L. Mountjoy (R-Arcadia) and Barbara Coe, an Anaheim Police Department civilian 
employee who headed the grass-roots California Coalition for Immigration 
Reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy quickly convinced the group that a state ballot measure denying 
public services to illegal immigrants was the best option. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting for much of the day, the group divided into subcommittees to explore 
what public services to ban. The most contentious issue that day and at the 
committee's subsequent sessions in Ezell's Newport Beach office concerned the 
public education ban and the litigation that would surely result. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the most controversial part," recalled Coe, who said her coalition 
considered the ban a must. "(Some committee members) said, 'Oh boy,' and we 
said we knew it would be an 'Oh boy.' But the result was everyone finally 
agreed if we were going to do it, do it all the way or not bother." 
</P>
<P>
 Coe also insisted that the initiative require parents or guardians of 
schoolchildren to provide proof of their own legal residency. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the whole logical overview," Coe said. "What we are trying to do is 
resolve the overall illegal alien problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the Oct. 5 meeting, Nelson worked up an initial draft, according to 
Prince and Nelson, who refused to make a copy public because of the pending 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nelson's draft, Prince said, several different terms were used to describe 
people to be reported to immigration authorities. Among them: those "determined 
or believed to be in violation of federal immigration laws," those "known or 
believed to be" in violation of the laws and anyone "arrested for a crime who 
is suspected of being present in the United States in violation of U.S. 
immigration law." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the wording of several sections was modified -- at the suggestion 
of either the state legislative counsel's office or Nelson, according to 
various committee members -- to require each health, educational and social 
welfare entity to report those it "determines or reasonably suspects" of being 
illegal immigrants to the state attorney general and the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure fails to define in detail why a person would be reasonably 
suspected. Prince and Nelson -- as well as Gov. Pete Wilson, a leading 
Proposition 187 advocate -- say suspects would be people who fail to provide 
documentation of legal residency status when applying for public benefits or 
after having been arrested for another offense. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nelson acknowledges that in hindsight, "people misunderstood it." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we knew we'd get all this flak," he said, "it would have been very easy to 
say the definition of suspect is failure to provide documents and take away any 
doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell, for his part, calls the terminology "probably the biggest goof in the 
wording. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw it, I said, 'Holy Toledo, what is this?' " he said. "It won't be 
in any other propositions that (I) have anything to do with." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince said that at Mountjoy's request, he drafted the only parts of the 
measure not blocked by Judge Byrne -- sections providing new sanctions for the 
manufacture or use of fraudulent citizenship documents and a severability 
clause stating that if one portion of the initiative is ruled invalid, other 
portions could still take effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The wording for the severability clause came from other ballot measures, 
according to Prince. "I wrote it myself," he said, "largely plagiarizing other 
initiatives."  
</P>
<P>
 Prince said he chose the wording for the false-document section -- which was 
later unsuccessfully introduced as state legislation by Mountjoy -- to avoid 
affecting young Americans using fake identification for such purposes as 
purchasing alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want American kids in trouble," he explained. "But if an illegal 
alien is trying to hide his citizenship, that then is now going to be a major 
felony in California and it should be." 
</P>
<P>
 However, law enforcement officials say the initiative's wording leaves it 
doubtful whether many illegal immigrants or document manufacturers will receive 
stiffer penalties than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block says that because the initiative does 
not address the issue of possession of false documents, a suspect would have to 
actually use a fake identity card in order to face arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince, who has no law degree or law enforcement experience, says Block and 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, both of whom opposed Proposition 187, are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of their electoral success, some committee members now seem at 
odds on how portions of the initiative were drafted. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince says Nelson was responsible for the education, health and law 
enforcement sections. Prince then did some editing of these sections, he says, 
and distributed copies of rough drafts to committee members for comments and 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince says that he also faxed copies to Mountjoy's Sacramento office for 
review by the legislative counsel's office, but that what few changes were 
suggested were mainly for grammatical purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy counters that he was responsible for the initiative since he had 
previously introduced illegal immigration bills, unsuccessfully, in the 
Assembly on topics covered by Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just stuff I was doing, when I ran into these people," he said. "It 
was also a group effort, basically along the lines of: 'Can you live with this? 
Can you campaign on this? Can you stand up and justify this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy says that he showed most portions of the measure to the legislative 
counsel at one point or another and that among the suggestions made were to 
include the phrase "reasonably suspects." 
</P>
<P>
 Without that wording, Mountjoy said, education, health and social service 
administrators who turned in names might be sued if suspects turned out to be 
legal residents. "I think that's a good clause," said Mountjoy. "You clear 
yourself of liability." 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy did credit Nelson with suggesting one major concept -- providing 
illegal immigrant students a 90-day grace period before being tossed out of 
school. That provides time for the INS to conduct deportation hearings, 
Mountjoy reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell was listed as a co-author because he was better known than other 
committee members and was serving as a spokesman, sponsors say. But his role in 
writing the measure was limited to six words, according to Prince. "In Section 
9, I left out the reference to the INS. He pointed it out and I made the 
correction." 
</P>
<P>
 Ezell, who hosted the committee's sessions, sees things differently. "The 
designation that Nelson and I had was co-author," he said. "If that means you, 
in long hand, write it out, then that's not what I think co-author is. 
Co-author is pulling the parts and pieces together." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, Proposition 187 is different from many initiatives because it 
is written in such easy-to-read English. In the state ballot pamphlet, the 
measure took up just more than one page. In contrast, Proposition 186, the 
unsuccessful health care reform measure, filled 16 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these petitions look like you could build a house out of them," said 
Robert Kiley. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, the "Save Our State" committee's approach may prove in the long 
run to have serious, even fatal, consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Different sections of the initiative contain different definitions of who 
would be barred from receiving public services. Moreover, the initiative does 
not use the same terminology as the federal government for declaring who is 
eligible for services. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne cited both points before issuing his restraining order. 
</P>
<P>
 "In two sections, they list (as legal residents) . . . a citizen of the United 
States, an alien lawfully admitted as a permanent resident, an alien admitted 
lawfully for a temporary period of time," said Byrne. "(But) they leave out of 
that certain people that the federal government would assume are entitled to 
benefits or really are, quote, legally in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the initiative, Byrne added, "They use totally different 
language."

HORCHER LASHES OUT AT BRULTE; ASSEMBLY: DIAMOND BAR INDEPENDENT SAYS HE MAY 
VOTE FOR A REPUBLICAN SPEAKER TO BREAK DEADLOCK, BUT NOT GOP LEADER OR ANY FROM 
HIS CADRE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Independent Assemblyman Paul Horcher, who holds the balance of power in the 
Legislature's lower house, says he might still vote for a Republican to break 
the partisan deadlock that has paralyzed the Assembly in a leadership struggle 
now in its second week. 
</P>
<P>
 But Horcher, a Diamond Bar attorney who bolted from the GOP to vote for 
Democrat Willie Brown on Dec. 5, says he will never side with Republican Leader 
Jim Brulte or any member of Brulte's leadership cadre, whom Horcher termed too 
"immature and irresponsible" to be given the power to run the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm open," Horcher said in an interview. "Anybody can deal with me who uses 
reason and logic and rational thought. I'm not open to being bullied or 
intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to respond, Brulte dismissed the notion of another Republican replacing 
him as the GOP candidate in the speakership fight when the Assembly reconvenes 
Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have made it abundantly clear to the Republican Caucus that if at any time 
they are unhappy with the job I've done as leader, I am more than willing to 
step down," Brulte said. "I doubt whether the Assembly Republican Caucus will 
allow a Willie Brown supporter to determine the Republican candidate for 
Speaker." 
</P>
<P>
 But there has been some talk, particularly among first-term Republicans, of 
finding a way to bring Horcher back into the GOP fold. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, newly elected Republican -- Tom Woods of Shasta -- said he was 
trying to reach Horcher to open talks about an alternative to Brulte that 
Horcher would find acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm willing to facilitate a dialogue between Mr. Horcher and the (Republican) 
caucus," he said. "I am willing to go to them and bring them a proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what his goal would be, Woods replied: "Electing a Republican Speaker -- 
immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after talking to Brulte, Woods said he had changed his mind and would 
only try to persuade Horcher to support Brulte. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no one else who all 41 people could agree on except Jim," Woods 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher, 43, said he feels "great" and is holding up well under the pressure 
-- including death threats -- he has been getting since he voted for Brown. He 
said calls to his office now are running about 3-2 in his favor, and he 
expressed confidence that he will defeat a Republican-backed effort to recall 
him early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher said his vote in the speakership battle -- still deadlocked in a 40-40 
tie -- should not be seen as a vote of confidence in Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a message to the Republican leadership that I've seen . . . how you 
operate on minimum power (and) I have no interest in seeing you operate under 
maximum power," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher said Brulte never had much chance of gaining his support because the 
Republican leader treated him shabbily after Horcher defied the leadership and 
accepted a key committee position offered by Brown in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Horcher said, there was a time when he considered voting for Brulte 
for Speaker. But Brulte never directly asked him for his vote, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept asking me what I wanted," Horcher said. "I told him I want respect. 
Apparently that was something they were unable to give me." 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher said Brulte also showed little interest in the threats Horcher was 
getting after radio talk shows named him as the Republican most likely to vote 
for Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew about the death threats and didn't inquire," Horcher said. "He didn't 
care whether I lived or died." 
</P>
<P>
 Brulte said he did ask Horcher for his vote, and he noted that Horcher had 
voted twice to elect him Republican leader and showered him with praise a year 
ago when Brulte was the featured speaker at a political fund-raiser for 
Horcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assemblyman Brulte's leadership this past year has produced the most 
successful legislative session in recent memory," Horcher said in a news 
release dated Dec. 2, 1993. "He was responsible for developing an effective 
Republican agenda that resulted in an overhaul of the workers' compensation 
system, a balanced budget by the constitutional deadline and a manufacturer's 
tax credit." 
</P>
<P>
 But Horcher has a different view now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Brulte and his leadership are too immature and irresponsible to be given 
that much power," he said. "People who have shown little or no responsibility 
in the past should not be rewarded with power." 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher said his problems with his fellow Republicans began in the summer of 
1991, when he voted to oust former Republican Leader Ross Johnson of La Habra 
and replace him with Bill Jones of Fresno, a moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 "They demand that you go along to get along," he said. "They just want power." 
</P>
<P>
 The rift worsened, he said, when Brown named him vice chairman of the powerful 
Ways and Means Committee, which votes on the state budget and all bills that 
spend money. Republicans had wanted a more conservative member -- Dean Andal of 
Stockton -- to get the job. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, Horcher said, Republicans blocked money that had been earmarked to 
relieve traffic problems in his district, limited his staff's access to the 
party's computer database and generally made it difficult for him to enact 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was endless harassment," he said. "Every bill was a struggle to get off 
the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher said much of the problem stemmed from the leadership's desire to see 
Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy of Arcadia elected to the state Senate rather than 
Horcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't want my district to have anything," he said. "They did not want 
any rival to Mr. Mountjoy to have a decent position." 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy defeated Horcher for the Senate seat and now is in the position of 
having been simultaneously elected to both the Assembly and Senate. He had 
intended to leave the Assembly after helping to elect Brulte Speaker but now 
says he will stay and renounce the Senate seat if need be to keep Brown from 
winning a record eighth term as Assembly leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher said he hopes that some sort of "co-speakership" is arranged when the 
Assembly returns in January. He said his decision to prevent Brulte's rise will 
lead to greater bipartisanship because neither party can seize power without 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 With 41 votes needed to pass any bill and 54 votes necessary to enact the 
budget, Horcher said, cooperation is essential. 
</P>
<P>
 "No Republican is going to get a bill out without Democrat votes, and no 
Democrat is going to get a bill out without Republican votes," he said. "And 
the governor is not going to get a budget out without a lot of votes on both 
sides."

HUFFINGTON OUTSPENT FEINSTEIN 2 1/2-TO-1; TOTAL FOR RACE IS RECORD; POLITICS: 
THE CONGRESSMAN USED $27.5 MILLION OF HIS OWN MONEY, REPORTS SHOW. HIS CAMPAIGN 
SPENT THE EQUIVALENT OF $7.62 PER VOTE.

<P>
 Republican Mike Huffington outspent Democrat Dianne Feinstein by a 2 1/2-to-1 
margin and their combined spending topped $41.4 million, a record for a Senate 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spent $29,070,533, including a record $27,543,680 of his own money 
on the race, the campaign expenditure reports obtained Tuesday reveal. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein spent $12,490,061, including $2,525,989 of her own funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein defeated Huffington 3,976,885 votes to 3,811,232, a margin of 46.8% 
to 44.9%, in the latest unofficial tally. The remaining 8.3% was divided among 
four minor party candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 That amounted to $7.62 per vote for Huffington to $3.14 per vote for 
Feinstein. 
</P>
<P>
 An even greater contrast is how much of their personal funds the two 
multimillionaire candidates spent per vote: Huffington spent $7.22 per vote, 
while Feinstein spent 63 cents per vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's personal spending per vote is more than double the $3.22 per vote 
that billionaire Ross Perot spent on his presidential campaign in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Huffington's report, received Tuesday by the secretary of state, 
he contributed $15,543,680 to his campaign and loaned it an additional $12 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein made outright contributions of only $3,989 to her campaign, and she 
loaned it $2,522,000, including a reported $982,000 from a mortgage on her San 
Francisco home. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous total spending record for a Senate race was $25 million by 
Republican Jesse Helms and Democrat Harvey Gantt in North Carolina in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's personal fortune, from the sale of his family's oil and gas 
business, has been estimated at $70 million. Feinstein and her investment 
banker husband, Richard Blum, are worth an estimated $40 million to $50 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has still not conceded the election, which is scheduled to be 
officially certified by the end of this week. He says "there's an immense 
amount of evidence of voter fraud."

 The Angry Citizen walked into a meeting of the Orange County supervisors and 
took a seat. This was the board's first public session since the county 
declared itself bankrupt, and so the gallery Tuesday was packed. The Angry 
Citizen found himself surrounded by bankruptcy attorneys, brokers, bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for the session to begin, these learned insiders chatted easily among 
themselves of $50 million frozen here, $100 million frozen there. "We'll be 
OK," one said, "if we can hold on until the spring property tax payments come 
in." Most wore fine suits; a few did business on cell phones from their chairs. 
Busy, informed people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angry Citizen was not of them. He came dressed in a brown herringbone 
sports jacket and no-wrinkle slacks. He wore horn-rimmed glasses and sensible 
shoes. A scratch across his cheek marked where he had cut himself shaving. He 
had written down what he wanted to say on a small sheet of office scratch 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting began. Right away, the supervisors invoked the Brown Act and 
retired to a private chamber. The Angry Citizen waited. The supervisors emerged 
about 30 minutes later to announce that, with investment fund losses now in 
excess of two B-boy billion dollars, a New York investment firm would be hired 
to navigate the county back from the swamp. With no money to spend, there was 
not much additional business to conduct. And so the session progressed quickly 
to that sporting moment in democracy known as Public Comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First to the microphone was a woman who'd driven up from Dana Point on a work 
break. "You are incompetent," she raged at the board members. "You should 
resign." They gave nothing back, not a word, not a frown. "Hope you enjoyed 
your trip up this morning," Thomas Riley, the jowly, silver-haired board 
chairman, crowed sarcastically as the woman stormed away. 
</P>
<P>
 She was followed by some clown in a St. Patrick's Day derby and an orange 
skirt. He called himself Will B. King, carried a toilet plunger and made 
rambling complaints about county finances. He would say a few words, retire to 
his seat, and then come back and start anew. Every time the supervisors saw him 
coming, they would blanch. "You are not serious, " Riley sniffed importantly. 
"We have serious business." 
</P>
<P>
 This brought a chuckle from the banker-lawyer brigade, but Riley did not seem 
to grasp that the joke was on himself -- a "supervisor" who had just helped 
supervise a tumble into bankruptcy by the nation's richest county. A serious 
piece of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Now to the podium came the Angry Citizen. He gave his name: Stephen D. 
Johnson. He gave his address: Tustin. He was, he would say, "just a small-town 
attorney. Born in Orange. 1946. Republican." In other words, he belonged to 
that large tribe of conservative populists who have long dominated the voting 
end of Orange County politics. 
</P>
<P>
 That a million or more Stephen Johnsons were out there -- in La Habra and 
Tustin and Fullerton and Orange, all still sorting through the fiscal calamity, 
what it might mean to their lives, who to blame and so on -- should have 
prompted the supervisors to pay close attention to what the Angry Citizen had 
to say. Should have. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke well, in plain, simple language and clear voice, with his chin out. 
Picture Jimmy Stewart's Mr. Smith; that's our hero. The Angry Citizen wanted to 
know why so many decisions were being made behind closed doors. "That is 
taxpayer money," he said of the dwindling investment fund. "That is public 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted to know how it happened, how the supervisors had failed to keep 
watch over the treasurer. He noted their attempts to spread the blame. He 
compared them to leaders of some fallen coup, trading in military uniforms to 
hide out among the commoners. He wanted to know why the supervisors have "not 
even said you're sorry." He wanted to know why they did not resign, or at least 
take a pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "You lost 27% of our money," the Angry Citizen said, ignoring the red light 
that indicated his 180-second allotment of citizen participation had expired. 
"Each and every one of you can take a 27% pay cut, right here and now." 
</P>
<P>
 This was too much for Riley. He pounded his gavel. "Is there a sheriff in 
here? Sheriff, sheriff, sheriff. Get this man out of here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you going to remove me?" the Angry Citizen demanded, indignant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, we are going to remove you." 
</P>
<P>
 And so they did. The Angry Citizen was run from the room by an officer of the 
law. His apparent offense: poking around in the business of the elected. It 
might be described as incredible, except that in Orange County this is a word 
-- like the investment fund itself -- fast losing its value.

ITALIAN PREMIER GIVES TESTIMONY; EUROPE: BERLUSCONI SPENDS MORE THAN SEVEN 
HOURS WITH MAGISTRATES. PROBE TARGETS ALLEGED PAYOFFS TO TAX INSPECTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Asserting his innocence and vowing to remain in office, Italian Prime Minister 
Silvio Berlusconi gave marathon testimony Tuesday to magistrates in Milan 
investigating alleged payoffs to tax inspectors by his Fininvest business 
empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi turned up at the Milan courthouse around noon on a misty winter's 
day and did not leave until more than seven hours later. The foggy darkness 
that masked his departure was emblematic of the day in which a sitting Italian 
prime minister was queried in a criminal case for the first time: Berlusconi, 
whisked away in a limousine with its curtains drawn, said nothing. Neither did 
the magistrates, from their heavily protected fourth-floor chambers in the 
downtown courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi's alleged involvement in Fininvest bribery cases occurred before he 
entered politics and while he headed a media and commercial conglomerate with 
receipts of about $7 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The cases, involving alleged payoffs to tax inspectors totaling about $200,000 
in 1990 and 1991, are small potatoes among thousands involving big business, 
public officials and politicians in an unprecedented three-year investigation 
that has triggered a political revolution in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 But they could prove the straw that breaks the back of the young Berlusconi 
government. Amid partisan salvos between the magistrates and Berlusconi 
supporters, Umberto Bossi, a loose-cannon populist who is one of the key 
pillars of Berlusconi's right-wing government, talks openly of a new government 
within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of Berlusconi's coalition are also showing signs of restiveness 
with a prime minister who is under siege from all sides: His party lost local 
elections, organized labor wars against his economic austerity program that 
threatens to prune pensions, students are occupying high schools around the 
country and even his Cabinet ministers are lukewarm in their defense of the 
billionaire tycoon. 
</P>
<P>
 At the courthouse, where questioning was interrupted only for a midafternoon 
coffee and brioche break, Berlusconi was interrogated by three magistrates, 
headed by Chief Prosecutor Francesco Saverio Borrelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts believe that the 58-year-old tycoon protested his innocence to the 
judges -- as he has to the Italian people in recent weeks. In an open letter 
Tuesday morning to the business newspaper Il Sole-24 Ore, Berlusconi said he 
was meeting the judges "with my head held high." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never corrupted anybody, ever, in any circumstances," he wrote, 
reiterating that he had no thoughts of resigning a post he assumed in May after 
a stunning electoral victory in his political debut. "I have no intention of 
giving up," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi and the rest of Italy learned that he had been formally named in 
the Fininvest investigation, which also involves his brother Paolo, on Nov. 22 
as the prime minister chaired an international anti-crime conference in Naples. 
Word had been leaked to a newspaper from the judges' office in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's long day of testimony came in the context of an accelerating 
struggle between the magistrates and government ministers who accuse the judges 
of becoming more political than judicial in their "Clean Hands" inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 About two weeks ago, an appeals court ruled that Clean Hands investigations 
involving Fininvest should be moved from Milan to the smaller city of Brescia 
to ensure a more objective inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 Then -- a thunderbolt -- Judge Antonio Di Pietro, the spearhead of the Clean 
Hands investigation, resigned last week after leading the inquiry for nearly 
three years. In the process he had become a national hero, the most respected 
public figure in Italy, according to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 In Milan, crowds rallied outside the courthouse last week to lament Di 
Pietro's departure. Tuesday, about 100 anti-Berlusconi protesters at the 
courthouse, a monument of Fascist architecture, were outnumbered by police as 
Berlusconi's motorcade swung through steel mesh gates now symbolic of a scandal 
that has implicated more than 3,000 Italians, including business leaders, 
politicians -- and more than one prime minister.

PEACEKEEPER WOUNDED IN BOSNIA DIES; BALKANS: BANGLADESHI WAS ONE OF FIVE 
INJURED IN SERBIAN ATTACK. U.N. OFFICIALS DENOUNCE IT AS MOST SERIOUS STRIKE 
AGAINST THEIR MISSION SINCE WAR BEGAN.

 A Bangladeshi peacekeeper, his hand severed and his eyes blinded by a missile 
attack on his armored vehicle in northwest Bosnia, slipped into a coma and died 
Tuesday at a mobile military hospital here. 
</P>
<P>
 His death, and the wounding of four fellow Bangladeshis in the attack Monday, 
were denounced by U.N. officials as the result of the most serious strike 
against the U.N. Protection Force since the start of the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attack . . . is one of the most flagrant, deliberate and calculated 
assaults on UNPROFOR to have taken place in the history of this peacekeeping 
operation," said U.N. spokesman Michael C. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 But aside from angry talk at UNPROFOR headquarters here and the lodging of 
official protests with the Bosnian Serbs and their allies, the U.N. mission was 
at a loss to respond for fear of provoking new attacks against the 23,500 
peacekeepers in Bosnia. The Bangladeshi soldier was the 133rd peacekeeper to 
die in the former Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the United Nations' version of saber rattling -- calling on the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization to deploy warplanes overhead -- was deemed too 
risky a response because of the growing number of antiaircraft missile systems 
controlled by the Bosnian Serbs. The United Nations estimates that the systems 
cover 40% of Bosnia, including the airport in the capital, Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 A request for NATO air presence was made by the Bangladeshi commander in Bihac 
in northwest Bosnia, but it was not formally passed on to NATO, U.N. spokesman 
Paul Risley said. Bad weather, the inability to target the weapons used in the 
assault and the presence of antiaircraft missile systems contributed to the 
decision, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The risk to the pilots is too great," Risley added. 
</P>
<P>
 But a NATO official in Brussels disagreed, saying NATO could have deployed 
aircraft in the area if the United Nations had asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this kind of behavior goes on, it is going to weaken the U.N.," the NATO 
official said of UNPROFOR's inaction. "The reputation of the U.N. and U.N. 
peacekeepers will suffer." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Defense Secretary William J. Perry, in Brussels for a NATO meeting, also 
placed the responsibility on the U.N. command in Bosnia for not responding to 
the attack on the Bangladeshis. "NATO is ready to react in response to the 
U.N.," Perry said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the United Nations chose to stand idly by, the embattled Bangladeshi 
battalion threatened to become a tragic metaphor for the unraveling U.N. 
presence in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Already without adequate supplies and weapons, the 1,200 peacekeepers were 
pinned down Tuesday in a bomb shelter near the northwest Bosnian town of Velika 
Kladusa as Croatian Serbs and Serbian-backed Muslim rebels advanced on the 
area. U.N. officials said the Serbs from the breakaway Krajina region of 
Croatia appear intent on overrunning the Muslim farm town, which lies within 
the U.N.-declared "safe area" around Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks as if there is a conscious attempt to try and take Velika Kladusa," 
Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting to the south in Bihac also intensified Tuesday, with a mortar shell 
striking a house in the town center. U.N. officials said the shell was fired by 
Bosnian or Krajina Serbs and killed a 3-year-old child. 
</P>
<P>
 With the war closing in, the Bangladeshi battalion is virtually defenseless. 
Deployed in early October when France withdrew its troops from Bihac, the 
Bangladeshis were sent to the then-quiet region with a rifle for every fourth 
soldier and wearing summer uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are trapped in the region with a two-week supply of food and a paltry 
weapons depot that U.N. officials say is insufficient to repel attacks such as 
the antitank missile assault Monday. Williams conceded on Tuesday that the 
decision to send the battalion to replace the French was "ill advised." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are in an extremely grave situation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bangladeshi problems have been compounded by Bangladesh's lack of clout in 
a U.N. mission dominated by Europeans. With no Bangladeshi general in the 
UNPROFOR command, the 1,200 peacekeepers have no strong advocate in Zagreb. By 
contrast, when Bosnian Serbs attacked a French armored vehicle in September, 
the United Nations requested -- and NATO supplied -- an air strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bangladeshis also have fallen victim to bad timing and waning 
international resolve. 
</P>
<P>
 "In September, the international community was still playing hardball: They 
thought the Serbs would blink," one Western diplomat said. "Now we have regular 
harassment of peacekeepers, some are even taken hostage, and we are back to 
worrying and hand-wringing."

SCIENCE; YELLOWSTONE GEYSERS SPEW FOSSIL CLUES TO PRIMEVAL LIFE; INTRICATE 
MINERAL TUFTS AND TERRACES MAY HELP DECODE RELICS OF MICROSCOPIC LIFE ON MARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Kneeling at the edge of a splashing hot spring, Jack Farmer gingerly taps his 
chisel against a thin mineral tuft rising from the pool's brim. After snapping 
off a pea-sized chunk of stone, he holds it up for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 Red and green bands stripe the tiny piece of rock as if it were a miniature 
slice of layer cake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are bacteria, living cells," says the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration research scientist. "As they get coated with minerals, they are 
encased and fossilized right before our eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Where tourists see intricate mineral tufts and terraces adorning Yellowstone 
National Park's hot springs and geysers, Farmer sees crusty catalogues of past 
life. In the pale yellow and gray formations, he seeks clues that may lead him 
to similar, telltale relics of microscopic life on Mars. 
</P>
<P>
 Steaming thermal basins like Yellowstone's may be rare today but were 
commonplace during Earth's early days. So common, in fact, many scientists 
suspect hot springs were the original incubators of life, which for most of its 
history on Earth took the form of simple one-celled microbes. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of microbes still flourish in Yellowstone's simmering waters, some as 
feathery filaments waving in the current, others as thick mats that look like 
green, growing JELL-O. 
</P>
<P>
 The primitive organisms closely resemble the earliest life on Earth. And they 
may not be so different from the first life that would have appeared on other 
planets. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like Earth, the modern Martian landscape is far different from what it 
once was. Although it's now barren, river channels and lake beds visible from 
spacecraft attest that water was abundant 3.5 billion years ago, about the same 
time life developed on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Altered by the same kind of volcanic forces that heat Yellowstone, Mars is 
home to the largest volcano in the solar system, a peak three times higher than 
Mt. Everest. Fueled by such fiery heat and water, hot springs probably once 
gurgled on Mars -- offering life another foothold in the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
 Since bacterial life appeared early in Earth's 4-billion-year history, Farmer 
figures it might have developed on Mars too. If it did, the tiny creatures may 
have left fossil footprints in hot spring mineral deposits, just as microbes in 
Yellowstone do today. 
</P>
<P>
 It is those tracks that Farmer would like to find. 
</P>
<P>
 Any primeval life on Mars might have vanished as the planet's atmosphere 
dissipated over later eons, taking liquid water with it. Or, Farmer says, 
Martian microbes may have since become subterranean dwellers -- moving 
underground, closer to the heat source of the planet's center. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a convergence of biology, chemistry and geology, hot springs entomb 
their tiny inhabitants in calcite, silica and iron that builds up -- like 
residue on a bathroom faucet -- where water bubbles to the surface. So any 
organisms in Martian springs should have left a Stone Age diary behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to know what information gets incorporated into the rock and then how 
you get that information out," says Farmer, poking at crunchy shoots of 
bacteria that have just begun to accumulate a mineral crust. Once laminated 
with rock, they may last billions of years. 
</P>
<P>
 To pinpoint similar remains of Martian hot springs, Farmer and his colleagues 
are first taking what lessons they can from Earth. By comparing high-altitude 
photographs of regions like Yellowstone to what they find on the ground, they 
hope to single out distinctive topographic impressions of ancient hot spring 
terraces. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we can recognize these environments on Earth, we should be able to 
recognize them on Mars too," adds Farmer, who is based at NASA's Ames Research 
Center in Northern California, where he works at the Search for 
Extraterrestrial Intelligence Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Two spacecraft are scheduled to lift off for Mars in 1996, succeeding the 
failed Mars Observer mission. One will survey Martian terrain from above, while 
the other -- the Mars Pathfinder -- will land. With Farmer's input, NASA 
expects to direct the lander to a broad river plain that may hold fragments of 
eroded hot spring terraces. 
</P>
<P>
 The space agency then plans to launch another Mars orbiter and lander roughly 
every two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to ask that question, 'Can life exist somewhere else?' " 
Farmer says, depositing his small chunk of rock into a vial about the size of 
his little finger. "Mars not only had a favorable environment for life, but it 
also had an environment that could have preserved evidence of life." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Yellowstone, Farmer and his colleagues have examined 
California's Mono Lake, where they will return next summer to probe the lake 
floor; salt ponds in Baja California, and dry lakes throughout the West.

POPULATION; U.S. STUDIES EMPLOYING FEWER CENSUS TAKERS, MORE ESTIMATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Since 1787, when the Constitution called for a count of everybody every 10 
years, census takers have hit the streets in search of America itself -- 
specifically, those citizens who didn't return census forms. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the government's Panel on Census Requirements gets its way, many of 
these temporary census takers will have to look elsewhere for work during the 
next head count, slated for 2000. The panel says the Census Bureau can get a 
more accurate reading by using statistical estimates than by sending census 
takers out in search of the uncounted. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can deceive yourself into thinking you've done a better job when you 
really haven't," said James Trussell, professor of economics and public affairs 
at Princeton University and a member of the commission. "We've got to change 
the way we look at conducting a census." 
</P>
<P>
 In the current process, surveys are mailed out, then census takers on the 
streets try to count those who did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that despite repeat visits, many people aren't recorded. 
Counting people in urban areas is not as easy as knocking on doors in suburban 
single-family neighborhoods. Cities are packed with people living on the margin 
-- the homeless, addicts and squatters. 
</P>
<P>
 As the panel would have it, the new census would first mail out the survey to 
all Americans and make a "good-faith attempt" to locate those people using 
on-foot census takers. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the Census Bureau would choose a handful of target zones around 
the country and saturate them with census takers. The idea would be to get a 
nearly perfect count in those areas, and then use those findings to construct a 
statistical model for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen E. Fienberg, professor of statistics and social science at Carnegie 
Mellon University, said the panel's method fuses old mathematical techniques 
with the latest statistical advances to account for those regularly missed by 
the head count. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also calls for the Census Bureau to create more reader-friendly 
surveys and to expand efforts to publicize the mandatory nature of the census. 
Additionally, the report acknowledged that the issue of identifying one's race 
on the census may need to be more closely examined, now that more people of 
mixed races are born. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Farnsworth Riche, the director of the Census Bureau, said that the 
statistical method would cut costs and improve accuracy. A test census is 
planned for 1995 to experiment with methods prescribed by the panel, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Accuracy isn't the only advantage, commission members say. The report says 
that if statistical estimation had been used in the 1990 census, the government 
could have saved up to $400 million on the total bill of $2.6 billion. The 
savings would be even higher in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistical estimation would answer a longstanding call for more accurate data 
in cities heavily populated by minorities . In 1990, the census came under fire 
for undercounting blacks, Latinos and other minorities. The census counted 
248.7 million Americans, but statistical estimates calculate that 3 million 
people were missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing course to use estimates would have political implications: The census 
determines the boundary lines of congressional, state and local districts. It 
also determines the number of congressional districts in each state. 
</P>
<P>
 The new procedure would likely turn up many more minorities in cities, which 
have been known to usually vote Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Henderson, director of the Washington chapter of the National Assn. for 
the Advancement of Colored People, said the undercount is a serious issue for 
the 2000 census. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the NAACP, the greatest concern is the accuracy of the census," Henderson 
said. "The undercount of African Americans in 1990 was deplorable. All steps 
must be taken to keep it from happening again." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles L. Schultze, chairman of the panel, will appear today with other 
panelists before a House subcommittee to discuss the proposal. Any changes in 
the census' method of operation must be approved by the Office of Management 
and Budget, the Census Bureau and two congressional panels.

NEWS ANALYSIS; TIMING OF YELTSIN NOSE JOB BAFFLES RUSSIA; LEADERSHIP: AIDES SEE 
NOTHING 'SENSATIONAL' IN HIS UNDERGOING SURGERY AFTER ORDERING DRIVE ON 
CHECHNYA. CRITICS ACCUSE PRESIDENT OF HIDING.

 What a time for a nose job. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would the president of a major power decide to enter the hospital for 
optional surgery to repair a deviated septum in his nose -- surgery that aides 
said would require a recovery period of up to eight days -- immediately after 
approving a controversial invasion of a rebellious province? 
</P>
<P>
 Yet that is exactly what Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin has done, 
prompting his fellow citizens once again to ponder the erratic performance of 
their leader, the state of his health and the degree of control he wields over 
his powerful Kremlin aides. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the fiery 63-year-old Siberian, whose popularity is at an all-time 
low, authorized the Russian government to "use all means at the state's 
disposal" to subdue the breakaway Muslim republic of Chechnya. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he entered the hospital for what aides described as a two-hour procedure 
on his nose. At dawn Sunday, Russian troops and tanks began rolling toward the 
Chechen capital of Grozny, a military intervention that many fear could spill 
much Russian blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir Ilyushin, one of Yeltsin's closest aides, said the president, who has 
a history of back problems, heart trouble and unexplained absences during 
crises, had recently had trouble breathing through his nose, particularly at 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything sensational about this, although these are complicated 
times," Ilyushin said. "You only have one health." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Kremlin aides said Yeltsin was in complete control and would be 
back in his office in a few days. They said the president would soon be able to 
receive foreign diplomats but would not be able to speak to journalists for a 
time because his speech is not clear enough. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, as reports reached Moscow that nine Russian soldiers had been 
killed fighting in Chechnya, Yeltsin gave a brief interview from his hospital 
bed. "No big war will start. The conflict so far is not even spreading out of 
Chechnya," he assured the newspaper Argumenti i Fakti. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctors say the operation was successful," Yeltsin added. "I feel not 
bad." 
</P>
<P>
 "Boris Yeltsin is a coward," said entrepreneur Konstantin N. Borovoi, head of 
the Economic Freedom Party, at an anti-war demonstration in Moscow. "The fact 
that he decided to undergo a nose operation shows that he really no longer 
controls the situation in the country. He has let matters get out of hand and 
decided to 'take a break' in a quiet clinic." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Russians suggested a different explanation for the sudden hospitalization 
of a head of state who recently stood up the prime minister of Ireland and then 
blamed his bodyguards for not allowing aides to wake him up in time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he took too much of his favorite medicine," suggested Caucasus scholar 
Sergei A. Arutiunov, referring to Yeltsin's rumored vodka habit. 
</P>
<P>
 Others viewed his reported illness with deeper concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very worried about what happened to him," said Alexei G. Arbatov, who 
heads a Moscow think tank. "I have very many suspicions that it's not the 
nose." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin has been hospitalized for heart trouble twice, in 1987 and in 1990. He 
dropped out of sight for short periods during the political upheavals of 1991 
and 1993, and has admitted to bouts of depression. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the truth about the presidential proboscis, Yeltsin is once again in 
a deep political crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Three and a half years into his six-year term, Yeltsin's popularity rating has 
dropped to a new low. 
</P>
<P>
 A poll of Muscovites by the firm Mnenie last month found that only 40% want 
him to continue as president and 33% would like him to resign. In May, the same 
poll found 53% supported Yeltsin and 24% wanted him to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 His political foes -- who now include democrats as well as nationalists and 
Communists -- are calling for presidential and parliamentary elections next 
year. If Yeltsin is forced to acquiesce, the outlook is not promising. 
</P>
<P>
 In a by-election in the city of Bryansk last weekend, Communists and 
nationalists won seven local legislative seats, and independent candidates took 
the other two. The democrats failed to field a candidate. If Yeltsin was 
following the election news from his hospital bed, the only consolation was 
that the candidate actively supported by ultranationalist Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky was beaten soundly. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, some of the stalwart liberals who were Yeltsin's last allies have 
turned against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergei N. Yushenkov, chairman of the Parliament's Defense Committee, on Monday 
said Yeltsin's policy on Chechnya was aimed at justifying a crackdown in Russia 
and at "introducing dictatorship." He said Yeltsin no longer consults with his 
former democratic allies and has no respect for their advice, while his 
entourage has lost all ties with reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on a holiday celebrating the Russian constitution, the prominent 
democrat called on his colleagues to use the year-old document to impeach 
Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Economist Yegor T. Gaidar, head of the Democratic Choice of Russia party, 
quickly disavowed Yushenkov's remarks. But Gaidar has broken with Yeltsin over 
Chechnya, as have human rights leader Sergei A. Kovalyev and other leading 
lights of Russia's democratic transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaidar, a former acting prime minister and the first architect of Yeltsin's 
free-market economic reform, told the "Itogi" television program, "I tried to 
reach Boris Nikolayevich but I did not succeed, for the first time in many 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 Yushenkov's telephone was cut off altogether -- a tactic Yeltsin has used 
against friends-turned-critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Yeltsin sacrificed Gaidar to appease the right-wing critics who 
opposed "shock therapy" reforms as too painful and who then turned to a more 
potent brand of nationalism. Reforms have continued, though with more fits and 
flaws than many had hoped. Inflation running at 14% per month in November has 
yet to be tamed. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics sought to portray the Russian president as an isolated captive of his 
power-hungry men. 
</P>
<P>
 Borovoi charged that Kremlin "riffraff" are running the crackdown on Chechnya 
under the direction of Gen. Alexander V. Korzhakov, the head of Yeltsin's 
bodyguard service, who is now considered one of the most powerful men in the 
Kremlin. Yeltsin once described himself and Korzhakov as "inseparable." 
</P>
<P>
 But Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev, who supports the Chechnya 
intervention, warned that if democratic forces are linked in the public mind to 
"disintegration, anarchy and muddle," Zhirinovsky and the Communists will be 
seen as the alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say Yeltsin has already adopted many of Zhirinovsky's policies. 
Democrats charge that Yeltsin has developed a case of the same political 
disease that proved fatal to former Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev: 
compromising real reform to appease political conservatives, and in the process 
alienating the liberals and reformers who were his only true allies.

 A summit of the 52-member Organization of the Islamic Conference opened with 
appeals for Muslims to change their image, work against extremists and rescue 
the Bosnian Muslims. At the opening session in King Hassan II's Moorish palace 
in Casablanca, two influential heads of state -- Hassan and Egyptian President 
Hosni Mubarak -- lamented the damage to Islam's reputation done by intolerant 
militants. The summit is expected to make a strong statement on Bosnia, 
probably with a hint that Muslim states might defy a U.N. ban on arms to the 
mainly Muslim Bosnian government.

 The body of the president of the Oslo stock exchange was found floating off 
Norway's southeast coast, hours after he was fired on suspicion of financial 
impropriety.Erik Jarve's body was spotted in the sea near Bamble, 60 miles 
southwest of Oslo, where he owned a summer cabin, police spokesman Geir 
Sonstebo said. Jarve, 50, had been president of the stock exchange since 1977 
and was known for his campaign against corruption in financial circles. He was 
dismissed Monday after the stock exchange's board of directors accused him of 
using his position for improper personal gain.

4 DIE, 2,500 FLEE AS EXPLOSION REDUCES FERTILIZER PLANT TO CRATER 
</P>

 An explosion demolished a farm chemical plant Tuesday, killing at least four 
workers and leaving only a crater where the seven-story building had stood. 
Eighteen people were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The early morning blast at the Terra Industries plant, Iowa's biggest producer 
of nitrogen-based fertilizers, released a cloud of ammonia gas, forcing the 
evacuation of 2,500 people from towns up to 20 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The ammonia leak was brought under control by late afternoon, and all but 100 
residents were allowed to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the explosion was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a building there. It's gone," said Dick Braun, a firefighter in 
nearby Salix. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast at the plant along the Missouri River, on the Nebraska-Iowa line, 
was felt 30 miles away. It twisted steel beams and tossed one 500 yards into a 
cornfield, Braun said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said most of the buildings in the refinery-like complex 10 
miles south of Sioux City were damaged, and the main, seven-story building was 
reduced to a crater. The scene was closed off to all but emergency workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is worse than any tornado I've seen, as far as destruction," said Salix 
Fire Chief Garold Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrapnel thrown out by the explosion punctured one or both of the plant's two 
15,000-ton refrigerated ammonia storage tanks, said Burton Joyce, Terra's 
president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The company estimated that one of the tanks held 5,700 tons of ammonia but 
said it did not know how much had escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Flying debris also punctured a nearby nitric acid tank, spilling up to 100 
tons of the corrosive liquid.

MAIL SERVICE IN L.A. IS PUT TO THE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL A. HILTZIK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How good is the mail service in Los Angeles? 
</P>
<P>
 To find out, The Times undertook an informal test of its own. The question: 
How long would it take letters to find their way within the basin, to other 
parts of California and the West, and to Washington, D.C.? The test also 
included a sample mailing from the Washington area to points in the Los Angeles 
basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Postal Service standards call for most first-class mail deposited in the Los 
Angeles basin to be delivered the following day within the basin, including the 
San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys, Orange County and the city of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles mail is to be delivered on the second day to all other points in 
California and to major population areas of the West, including Seattle, 
Denver, Las Vegas and Phoenix. The rest of the continental United States should 
get items mailed from Los Angeles on the third day. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, reporters posted 650 pieces of mail from randomly selected mailboxes 
in West Los Angeles, downtown Los Angeles, Long Beach and Washington. The 
letters were in white, legal-size envelopes, machine-printed for legibility and 
stamped. Each contained a blank sheet of paper. 
</P>
<P>
 The postings were divided in two to minimize the chance that a onetime glitch 
in postal operations -- say, a freeway disaster or mass breakdown of postal 
vehicles -- would overly influence the results. Half were mailed Oct. 31, the 
rest Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The test showed that within Los Angeles, the system worked well -- better, in 
fact, than its performance in the Postal Service's own official surveys, 
conducted throughout the year by the auditing firm of Price, Waterhouse & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 In the May-September period, Price Waterhouse found that the Los Angeles 
postal district met its overnight standard only 80% of the time. But of the 200 
Times test pieces sent within Los Angeles, 187 were delivered the next day, for 
an on-time performance of 94%. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Postal Service's performance markedly deteriorated as distances 
widened. 
</P>
<P>
 On-time delivery of second-day mail posted from Los Angeles dropped to 89%, 
with delivery to Seattle a particularly woeful 64%; just 32 out of 50 letters 
made it on time. 
</P>
<P>
 Delivery of letters sent from Los Angeles to the Washington area -- widely 
regarded as having nearly the worst mail service in the country -- showed the 
greatest problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 65% of the pieces sent to Washington from Los Angeles (98 out of 
150) made it within three days. On the other hand, 97 out of 100 pieces sent to 
Los Angeles from Washington arrived on schedule.

GEPHARDT UNVEILS HIS ENTRY IN WASHINGTON TAX CUT DERBY; CONGRESS: HIS 'WORKING 
PEOPLE'S AGENDA' CHALLENGES BOTH THE GOP AND CLINTON. PLAN HAS NO SPECIFICS ON 
WHERE TO REDUCE SPENDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just two days before President Clinton is to unveil his legislative priorities 
for 1995, incoming House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) offered 
his own proposals for a middle-income tax cut -- challenging both the GOP 
majority and the leader of his own party. 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt's "working people's agenda," the most explicit Democratic response 
yet to recent Republican proposals, includes a "substantial" tax cut aimed at 
workers earning up to $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Missouri congressman offered no specifics about the proposal, and 
acknowledged that he had not yet figured out what spending cuts to make to pay 
for his tax reduction plan. "We will look up and down every section of the 
budget to come up with the funds to do this," he said. Gephardt also proposed 
using government incentives to encourage companies to give workers a greater 
share of profits resulting from rising productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 He mentioned Clinton's name just once in his 30-minute address to the Center 
for National Policy, a Democratic think tank. He promised to cooperate with the 
President, but added: "Our agenda will come from America's houses, not the 
White House." 
</P>
<P>
 The remarks echoed those of the new Democratic leader in the Senate, Tom 
Daschle of South Dakota, who also has promised to work with White House 
officials, but declared: "We will not be led by them." 
</P>
<P>
 The attempt to distance Democratic congressional leadership from Clinton 
reflects the broad change that the Republican election victory wrought on 
Capitol Hill -- particularly in the House, where Democrats had been in the 
majority for 40 years. It also illustrates the profound concerns Democratic 
congressional leaders have about linking their party's political fortunes to 
the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt contrasted his tax cut proposal, which would apply to families with 
or without children, to the GOP's plan to provide a $500-per-child tax credit 
for people with incomes of up to $200,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the American people will have a choice between two tax cuts," he said. 
"The Republican tax cut, which gives a tax rebate for every child of the rich; 
or the Democratic tax cut, which says that all working people deserve a break 
-- not based on the size of the families, but based on the size of their 
incomes." 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt's corporate profit-sharing plan was similarly intended to buttress 
the party's appeal to working people. He noted that industrial productivity 
increased 18% in the last 12 years, while real wages dropped by more than 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to recognize that a company's shareholders are not the only 
stake-holders," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not explain, however, what incentives he would offer to get companies 
to let their employees share in their profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Gephardt sought to undercut the GOP's much-heralded plan to adopt 
a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced federal budget. He said he will 
introduce an "honest budget bill" requiring Republicans to explain exactly what 
steps they would take to balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't delay their vote on the amendment," he said. "But neither will we 
allow them to balance the budget on the backs of working people and senior 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the extent to which he consulted with the White House before the 
speech, Gephardt said: "We've been talking about the budget and about taxes for 
the past couple of weeks. They haven't figured out what they want to do, and we 
haven't figured out exactly what we want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, Clinton met throughout the day Tuesday with aides, who 
presented him with a variety of options for a middle-class tax cut -- as well 
as ways to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the tax cut likely would amount to about $50 billion over five 
years and be limited to families with incomes of less than $100,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said Clinton was looking to pay for it through "dramatic cuts" in 
spending on domestic programs and substantial restructuring of numerous 
government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The President reportedly remained undecided Tuesday night over which 
recommendations to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Administration officials had considered outright elimination of one 
or more Cabinet departments, that option looked increasingly remote. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not really the issue," one knowledgeable aide said. "We are not simply 
looking at what we can eliminate. It's been a far more serious look at what 
departments and agencies do." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials cautioned that Clinton's speech Thursday from the Oval 
Office would be more thematic than specific. 
</P>
<P>
 The address was described as an attempt by Clinton to "reconnect" with middle 
America by returning to the themes that won him the presidency -- work, family 
and personal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "The notion that somehow the President needs to change is not right," said 
political adviser Paul Begala. "The President is doing all the right things. He 
just has to link up with the voters again. That's what the speech is about." 
</P>
<P>
 In his address, Gephardt also delved into thematic areas normally reserved for 
presidents, offering his own definition of the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "This election may have been a harsh rebuke of our party, but it was far from 
an embrace of theirs," Gephardt contended. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the ballot boxes, we may have lost the majority. But in the hearts and 
mind of working America, the values we stand for -- the policies we fight for 
-- are still in the majority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, Republicans sought to counter the Democratic tax cut 
initiative by accusing them of being copycats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're glad that the Administration and the Democrats are finally getting the 
message -- there is a need out there," said Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.). 
</P>
<P>
 Cochran noted that "candidate Clinton committed himself to a middle-class tax 
cut and one never really materialized." 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt also announced a new Democratic leadership structure, describing it 
as "the largest, the most diverse and the most inclusive in the history" of the 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most thankless jobs -- chairman of the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee -- went to Martin Frost of Texas, who is known both for his 
keen political instincts and a strong will. 
</P>
<P>
 The four chief deputies to Minority Whip David E. Bonior of Michigan will be 
Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, Chet Edwards of Texas, John Lewis of Georgia and 
Bill Richardson of New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 They will also join Gephardt as members of a newly formed Democratic Policy 
Committee, which in turn will have three "special teams" of vice chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In charge of research will be David R. Obey of Wisconsin and Eva Clayton of 
North Carolina; in charge of policy will be George Miller of Martinez, Calif., 
and John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina; and in charge of communications will 
be Richard J. Durbin of Illinois and Kweisi Mfume of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt also announced the creation of a Leadership Advisory Group, whose 
members include Charles W. Stenholm of Texas, John P. Murtha of Pennsylvania, 
Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, Louise M. Slaughter of New York, Louis Stokes 
of Ohio, John D. Dingell of Michigan, W.G. (Bill) Hefner of North Carolina and 
Ed Pastor of Arizona. The next chair of the Congressional Black Caucus also 
will be a member.

 Federal agencies unveiled a new Emergency Alert System designed to warn the 
public of everything from wars to hurricanes by beaming information to their 
television sets, radios, pagers and compact disc players. The new system can 
activate consumer electronic devices even when they are turned off. It is the 
successor of the old Emergency Broadcast System, whose repetitive tests on 
broadcast channels have long been tuned out by most people as boring.

CRASH DEALS NEW BLOW TO COMMUTER AIRLINE INDUSTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tuesday evening's crash of an American Eagle propjet on a short flight from 
Greensboro to Raleigh, N.C., is the latest in a series of setbacks for the 
newly beleaguered commuter airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The last two months have not been good ones for a segment of the 
transportation industry that until recently has enjoyed spectacular growth with 
deregulation. Last year, commuter planes carried some 50 million customers. 
</P>
<P>
 But just Friday the Federal Aviation Administration effectively grounded a 
good part of the fleets, ruling that the more than 150 French-made ATR 
airliners operated by nine U.S. regional carriers could not fly in icy weather. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA said new tests after the Oct. 31 crash of an American Eagle ATR-72 in 
Indiana, killing all 68 aboard, had shown that ice buildups on the ATR wings 
could cause the aircraft to suddenly roll out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Just three weeks earlier the FAA had balked at the National Transportation 
Safety Board's recommendation for such a ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month an airline passenger group said smaller commuter planes pose a risk 
to travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Commuter aircraft with under 31 seats are the real hazard," said David 
Stempler, executive director of the 110,000-member International Airline 
Passengers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on statistics showing that regional airliners with less than 31 seats 
had 29 fatal accidents over 15 years compared with only one fatal accident for 
a regional plane with more than 31 seats, Stempler's organization said 
travelers should avoid the smaller planes. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry accused the group of "needlessly frightening the public" and FAA 
Administrator David R. Hinson responded that commuter airlines "have achieved 
and sustained a high level of safety." 
</P>
<P>
 But last week the FAA said it hoped to put their crews under the same training 
requirements of those flying the larger planes by the end of 1995. The proposed 
changes also would tighten safety inspections of the smaller aircraft.

 Incoming Senate banking chairman Alfonse M. D'Amato (R-N.Y.) said he will 
defer Whitewater hearings indefinitely to stay out of the way of independent 
counsel Kenneth W. Starr.After an hourlong meeting with Starr and outgoing 
committee chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.), D'Amato told reporters he 
could not say when Senate hearings might begin, but that they will not start in 
late January or early February as he has suggested in recent weeks. He 
predicted that when they do resume, they probably will stretch into the 1996 
election year.

 There is no constitutional right to assisted suicide, and Michigan's ban on 
the practice is constitutional, the state Supreme Court ruled.The ruling in 
Lansing came on four combined cases, three of them involving criminal charges 
against Dr. Jack Kevorkian, who has been present at 21 deaths since 1990. The 
fourth was a civil challenge on behalf of two cancer patients and some medical 
professionals. The court said assisted suicide has been a crime under common 
law and someone could be prosecuted for that even without the Legislature 
enacting its temporary ban in 1993.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; DAILY DEVELOPMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 LIQUIDATING INVESTMENTS: A federal bankruptcy judge approved Orange County's 
plan to liquidate its devastated investment pool, now worth $5.4 billion. 
Thomas W. Hayes, the county's financial adviser, said the process could take up 
to 180 days.Officials said they are trying to beat several upcoming 
announcements that could boost interest rates, cutting into the pool's value. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE POTENTIAL BUYERS: Salomon Bros., which is assisting the county in 
restructuring the fund, may find a shortage of potential buyers because of 
pending lawsuits. But experts say the securities are salable at some price. 
Losses so far total $2.02 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * PUBLIC REACTION: In their first opportunity to address the Board of 
Supervisors, several members of the public blamed the board for the crisis. 
"You were negligent," a Tustin resident told the board. "What won't work is the 
current board. Stop blaming others." 
</P>
<P>
 * FALLOUT IN WASHINGTON: Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) said an element of the 
Republicans' "contract with America" would make it harder for investors in the 
fund to recover losses through the courts. She called on Republicans to drop 
the securities law section of the contract. Its author was Rep. Christopher Cox 
(R-Huntington Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 * PROJECT POSTPONED: PUrchase of an $82-million communications network, which 
police say is vital to updating the county's antiquated system, was postponed 
by county officials. It was the first big-ticket item to land on the county's 
casualty list. 
</P>
<P>
 * SCHOOLS: Schools will remain open, all employees will be paid and business 
will continue as usual, said Maureen DiMarco, California's secretary of child 
development and education.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; CHOWCHILLA DRAWN INTO FISCAL QUAGMIRE; GOVERNMENT: 
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TOWN HAS $2.5 MILLION TIED UP IN INVESTMENT FUND. 'THE 
EFFECT HERE COULD BE MONUMENTAL,' THE MAYOR SAYS.

 This town of almond orchards and rodeo riders in the wide-open spaces of the 
San Joaquin Valley would seem a far cry from the world of high finance. 
</P>
<P>
 But good word has a way of traveling and when local school officials heard 
what Orange County was getting for its money -- nearly triple the rate of 
return here -- they decided to take the plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, their $2.5-million investment is one of the far-flung victims of the 
collapse in Orange County. As townsfolk wait nervously for the latest word on 
the crisis, they fear that the high school district -- with an annual operating 
budget of $4.5 million -- will be devastated if the money is lost. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know $2.5 million doesn't sound like much when you're talking billions," 
said Kathy Horn, Chowchilla's mayor and a fifth-grade teacher. "But the effect 
here could be monumental. It's scary. Very scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Up and down the Central Valley, far from the epicenter of the biggest 
municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, towns and cities are trying to 
gauge the damage from their dance with the ill-fated fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of school districts in the San Joaquin Valley invested either directly 
with Orange County or indirectly through a statewide pool called the Schools 
Excess Liability Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The Madera County Office of Education has seen its $3-million direct 
investment frozen. "The most frustrating part right now is not knowing the 
future," said Sally Frazier, Madera County's superintendent of education. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like waiting for the other shoe to drop, said Ronald Moore, 
superintendent of the Chowchilla Union High School district. "We heard we're 
going to get 80 cents on the dollar. Or 50 cents," he said. "We can't afford to 
lose any of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, a star running back for the Chowchilla High Redskins in 1957, has the 
look of a beleaguered man. It was his decision three years ago, backed by the 
school board, to invest in the Orange County bond fund. 
</P>
<P>
 It made great sense, he said. Each year, the school district must cover a few 
months of lag time between the collection and distribution of property taxes. 
So the school district borrowed $1.1 million from the bank at 3.5% interest and 
parked it in the Orange County fund earning 8% interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference amounted to $35,000 to $40,000 a year in our pocket," Moore 
said. "That's the equivalent of a teacher's salary." 
</P>
<P>
 The yearly $1.1-million note is due next June; the school district needs the 
money invested in Orange County to meet the debt. If the money is not freed up 
soon, the school district may have to cover the debt through operating funds. 
</P>
<P>
 This could mean big cuts to staff and athletic programs, Moore said. The 
district also has $1.4 million in school construction funds frozen in the wake 
of Orange County's bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm doing a heck of a lot of soul searching on this," Moore said. "I've been 
the superintendent here for 19 years. I grew up here. I attended school here. 
Everyone knows me. . . . Which is good most of the time." 
</P>
<P>
 With its 6,200 residents and one traffic light, Chowchilla delights in its 
isolation from the outside world. Fresno, the nearest big city, is 45 miles 
south. Townsfolk like to joke that they got a McDonald's the same time the 
Soviet Union got one. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for the sensational kidnaping of a school bus full of local children in 
1976, residents say, no one would have heard of Chowchilla. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions Club just finished putting up a 30-foot Christmas tree in the middle 
of the main street for the 20th straight year. Each spring, an old-fashioned 
cattle drive bounds through town, followed by four days of calf and team roping 
and barrel racing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have drive-by shootings. We don't have graffiti," Horn said. "This 
is middle America. If you want a safe place to raise your children and good 
schools, this is it. That's why this Orange County thing is so hard to 
swallow." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Green, the high school principal, went golfing last weekend at the local 
country club and had to defend Supt. Moore against those who argued that 
Chowchilla had no business entrusting its money to faraway places. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them Ron Moore has been pulling rabbits out of the hat for more than 
10 years. He's the reason this school district has been able to avoid the 
cutbacks other schools have felt. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't blame him. No one could have foreseen this." 
</P>
<P>
 At Glen Ray's diner on the main street, waitress Betty Meadows said everyone 
is talking but no one knows a thing. "People are upset but what can you do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Odessa Ray, mother of the proprietor, said she feared the worst. "It sounds 
like a done deal to me. It's like everything else. The taxpayer is going to end 
up footing the bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, Ed Ray, the driver of that ill-fated school bus in 1976, was not 
in a mood to talk. He said he was still smarting over Hollywood's portrayal of 
the bus kidnaping in a recent made-for-TV movie starring Karl Malden as Ray. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made us look like a bunch of hicks," he grumbled. "A bunch of country 
bumpkins." 
</P>
<P>
 A farmer in a dirt- and sweat-stained Germain seed cap said the town wanted 
its privacy back. "What I know about this Orange County thing isn't enough to 
complain," he said. "I just know that it doesn't help our anonymity any."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; NOTES ISSUED BY MONTEBELLO REDUCED TO LOWEST 
RATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's slashed investment ratings on $31 million in notes issued by 
Montebello to speculative-grade status Tuesday because much of the city's cash 
is tied up in Orange County's now-frozen investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 S&P cut its rating on Montebello's $25 million of taxable notes -- which come 
due Dec. 30 -- to its lowest possible grade for such securities, SP-3. That 
signals the firm's belief that it is speculative whether Montebello can repay 
the principal and interest due on the notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The notes previously had carried S&P's highest grade for notes, SP-1-Plus, 
which indicates "a very strong capacity" to pay off the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 S&P made the same ratings change on Montebello's $6 million of so-called tax 
and revenue anticipation notes, or TRANs, even though those notes do not mature 
until Sept. 29, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary impact of the ratings change is that it will drive up Montebello's 
future borrowing costs. Investors will want a higher yield relative to the 
additional risk now attached to the city's securities. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Richard Torres discounted the downgrade's effect. "As far 
as we're concerned, ratings are recoverable," he said. "I don't consider it 
permanent damage." 
</P>
<P>
 S&P said the downgrade stems from uncertainty over whether the city of 60,000, 
which had invested $47 million, or 60% of its investment portfolio -- can get 
enough of its cash out of the Orange County fund in time to repay its notes. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, the City Council voted 11-0 with almost no debate to appoint a 
blue-ribbon panel of outside experts to review the city's investment strategies 
and guidelines in the wake of the Orange County debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sense that we have got a problem, but we should always be alert," 
said Council President John Ferraro. "It's important to reassure the public 
that our investment practices are fiscally responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrative Officer Keith Comrie said the city might find it prudent 
to delay a plan to sell bonds in January to finance the purchase of refuse 
equipment "if the market isn't comfortable" with new issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might have to wait on that," he said.

JUSTICES OK COUNTY POLICE BRUTALITY PANELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court, ruling in a San Diego case, held Monday that 
charter counties can create tough citizen review boards to investigate police 
brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous ruling affects all 12 charter counties in the state, including 
Los Angeles, by giving them the option of creating review boards with subpoena 
power to probe allegations of excessive force or other misconduct by law 
enforcement personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in San Diego County passed a charter amendment in 1990 to create such a 
board after a string of controversial shootings by police and sheriff's 
deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the president of the San Diego Sheriff's Assn. filed suit, contending that 
counties cannot legally give citizen boards the power to compel witnesses to 
testify or produce documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Pending a Supreme Court ruling, the county's citizen review board has not 
subpoenaed deputies to appear, and most have declined to do so voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big step," said Eileen Luna, executive officer of the county's 
review board. "This is just really exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Community activists in Los Angeles also were thrilled by the ruling. Robin 
Toma, staff counsel of the ACLU Foundation of Southern California, said 
activists have been pressing for years for the creation of such a review board 
to probe complaints against members of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "This directly refutes the argument that they don't have the power to meddle 
in the Sheriff's Department," Toma said. 
</P>
<P>
 California has 12 charter counties, including San Diego, San Bernardino, 
Alameda, Sacramento and Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 David Niddrie, an attorney for San Diego's review board, said the county was 
the first in the country to create such a panel with subpoena power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to get at the truth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luna said the board has recommended about 40 policy changes to the San Diego 
County Sheriff's Department and probation office and found misconduct in about 
35% of the cases citizens have brought. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board's recommendations are only advisory, and Luna said she could not 
disclose whether any deputies were disciplined as a result of the panel's 
recommendations. Members of the San Diego board are appointed by the county's 
chief administrative officer and confirmed by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Dibb, who filed the suit as president of the Deputy Sheriff's Assn., 
declined to comment on the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy's association had argued that the board's subpoena power could 
impede law enforcement investigations.

FINAL CHARGE IS DROPPED IN MORONGO TRIBAL CASINO CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LIEBERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Weeks after a Los Angeles judge threw out 23 of the 24 counts against the 
managers of the Morongo tribal casino, federal prosecutors have agreed to 
dismissal of the final charge -- while they appeal the earlier ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the action left prosecutors with the option of reviving the case, the 
dropping of the last count -- charging the casino's non-Indian managers with 
possessing illegal slot machines in the casino west of Palm Springs -- was 
applauded by defense attorneys as an exoneration of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard P. Crane Jr., who represented the casino's management firm, E. C. 
Investments, derided the prosecution as "a heavy-handed effort by the United 
States that unfairly exposed our clients to loss of their freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution had billed the indictment as the start of a crackdown on 
electronic slot machines used in California's tribal gambling halls. But it 
suffered a setback in October, when U.S. District Judge Richard A. Gadbois Jr. 
dismissed the 23 counts against the managers of the Morongo casino that were 
based on the powerful federal Organized Crime Control Act. 
</P>
<P>
 In a complex opinion, Gadbois ruled out use of that act because it targets 
groups that engage in gambling that is illegal under state law. Although the 
California Penal Code "bans slot machines without exception," the judge said, 
the public policy of California is to permit many forms of gambling -- thus 
undercutting the state's right to impose criminal sanctions against tribal 
gambling operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In asking for dismissal of the remaining slot machine count, Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Jonathan Shapiro said the government preferred to complete its appeal of 
Gadbois' October decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The original indictment did not target the Riverside County tribe, but charged 
the outside casino managers with offenses ranging from money laundering to 
interstate travel in aid of racketeering. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer facing the charges are E. C. Investments; its president, Ira 
Englander, and three others.

'BELL CURVE' SCIENTIFICALLY FLAWED, PANEL SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Bell Curve," a book that claims intelligence is a genetically linked 
characteristic of race, is scientifically flawed, a panel of scholars and 
testing experts said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In a symposium at Howard University in Washington, D.C., scholars said the 
book fails to present a scientifically balanced view and then uses faulty 
conclusions to justify suggested changes in the way society deals with the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "The book uses data selectively and then ignores any data that contradicts its 
point of view," said Nancy Cole, president of Educational Testing Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Charles Murray and the late Richard Herrnstein, "The Bell Curve" 
was published in October and created instant controversy. The book analyzes IQ 
scores and socioeconomic status and concludes that economic success is directly 
linked to measurable intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 It also concludes that intelligence is largely controlled by inheritance, that 
blacks score about 15 points below whites on IQ tests, and that this difference 
controls destiny and is unchangeable through life. Accordingly, the book 
suggests that efforts through social programs to improve lives are doomed 
because the poor are too dumb to climb out of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these points are wrong, according to Stephen Jay Gould, professor of 
zoology at Harvard University. 
</P>
<P>
 He said even the statistical analysis in the book used a technique that failed 
to take into account individual differences within a group and, thus, could 
contort the conclusions. Gould said the book also was wrong in assuming that 
intelligence could be accurately represented by tests, that people can be 
accurately rated by such tests, and that measured IQ is unchanged through life 
or through circumstances of culture, training or experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a one-dimensional study based on a single data set," said Gould. 
"They have bamboozled everybody."

NO SINGLE CAUSE FOUND FOR 'GULF WAR SYNDROME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Defense Department said Tuesday that it has been unable to find any 
medical evidence pointing to a single cause for the widely reported "Gulf War 
syndrome," but it vowed to intensify its research and to set up special centers 
to treat the illness. 
</P>
<P>
 In a preliminary report, officials said examinations of 1,019 Persian Gulf War 
veterans who have complained of unusual symptoms show that 85% of the cases 
involve already recognizable illnesses, from arthritis to sleep disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no magic bullet," Stephen Joseph, assistant secretary of defense for 
health affairs, told reporters at a briefing Tuesday. "We don't find . . . any 
indication of a single . . . causality that would cover that broad spectrum." 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials emphasized Tuesday that they are not trying to suggest that 
there is no such illness as Gulf War syndrome, or that the veterans who have 
complained of such symptoms may be only imagining them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joseph and Robert Roswell, executive director of the Gulf Veterans' 
Coordinating Board, said that in 85% of the cases studied, the symptoms were 
found to have stemmed from one or more common illnesses that are treatable -- 
and are to be expected in such a war. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials said the military will establish two special treatment 
centers for those whose cases so far have defied diagnosis, and said the White 
House will propose spending an extra $15 million to $20 million next year to 
continue the research. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcements are likely to disappoint some veterans, who contend they 
suffer from a new disease and complain that the Pentagon has been unresponsive. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Gulf War veterans say they believe that the syndrome -- which they 
describe as mysterious and untreatable -- is being passed on to their spouses 
and children. The Pentagon has denied that the veterans were exposed to 
life-threatening chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 Physicians said the 1,019 cases reflected in Tuesday's report represent a 
significant sample of veterans who have sought treatment for Gulf War syndrome. 
Of the 697,000 who served in Operation Desert Storm, 11,000 have complained of 
illness. Some 8,000 are being processed. 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie Ayers, a Fayetteville, N.C., military spouse who heads Gulf War 
Babies, an organization of parents whose children have been afflicted, said the 
studies so far have been flawed because they have only involved volunteers and 
have not reviewed a broad enough sample. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they said (in Tuesday's report) doesn't make that much difference," 
Ayers said in a telephone interview. Defense officials "need to get their act 
together and organize what they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 The common illnesses Pentagon officials said were responsible for most of the 
symptoms included circulatory and digestive problems, infections, specific 
injuries and blood disorders. About one-fourth of those evaluated reported 
psychological problems, including depression, headaches, post-traumatic stress 
disorder and anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the remaining 15% still are a mystery, but said it is unlikely 
that they would point to any one cause, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph also dismissed speculation by some veterans' groups that the syndrome 
may stem from exposure by soldiers to a toxic chemical agent or combination of 
chemicals, such as insect repellent and pyridostigmine bromide, which was taken 
by some soldiers as a vaccine. 
</P>
<P>
 The treatment centers the Pentagon is establishing will be based at Walter 
Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., and at the U.S. Air Force Medical 
Center and Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio, Tex.

O.C. AGENCIES IN FUND POOL HALT PROJECTS

<P>
 Cities and school districts throughout Orange County slammed the brakes 
Tuesday on expenditures and projects, many of them in the works for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Off the planning boards for now is a $17.5-million extension of Newport Coast 
Drive that would have provided a toll-free bypass connecting Irvine to Newport 
Beach. In Foothill Ranch, school trustees delayed the ballyhooed opening next 
month of a new elementary school. Brea city officials postponed the 
groundbreaking for a $7-million community center, scheduled for later this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was not all. 
</P>
<P>
 The reverberations from the widening financial crisis continued to shake many 
of the 187 cities, school systems and special districts that have relied on 
Orange County to invest their savings. Officials said Tuesday that they were 
acting to protect their remaining assets, deferring all but the most necessary 
expenditures until the situation is clearer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still in the shock mode, in the grieving mode," Fullerton City Manager 
James L. Armstrong said after hearing the news Tuesday that the county 
investment pool had lost 27% of its value since January. "Obviously, I'm angry. 
You entrusted your money to somebody who you thought was managing it 
appropriately and they weren't." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Niven, Irvine's manager of finance and fiscal services, said he was 
particularly irked Tuesday to learn that the county treasury continued to 
borrow money and tie investments to interest rates this spring. He and other 
local officials learned Tuesday that the money they had entrusted to Orange 
County's investment pool may have dropped even more in value than previously 
feared. 
</P>
<P>
 "You invest some money and the next day, it's gone. Ouch!" Niven said. "To 
deposit money in the county four months ago and incur a 27% loss is 
staggering." 
</P>
<P>
 One week after the county declared bankruptcy and froze all funds in the 
ill-fated pool, officials of the agencies that had participated were struggling 
to come to terms with news that seemed to grow worse with each passing day. 
</P>
<P>
 Several said their latest actions -- including hiring freezes and postponing 
numerous capital improvement projects -- could be reversed or modified should 
the situation prove to be less serious than feared. But few of those 
interviewed Tuesday appeared to hold out much hope. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra City Manager Lee Risner, who announced that the city was instituting 
a hiring freeze and deferring three flood-control projects, was openly hostile 
toward county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we see that the county is serious about paying out money, we'll have to 
hold a lot of things," Risner said, including park development, storm drain 
repairs and street projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Public offices throughout the county were tallying the losses Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most common actions were postponement of planned construction 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In Irvine, officials said they have been told by the county and its toll-road 
agency that there is no money right now for a $17.5-million extension of 
Newport Coast Drive that would have provided a toll-free bypass to a section of 
the San Joaquin Hills toll road. Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), 
confirmed that the county financial crisis would probably scuttle it. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, officials announced that they had postponed indefinitely 
the construction, set to begin Jan. 2, of a new Ruby's restaurant at the end of 
the pier. The project had been planned for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd be foolish to blindly spend our money on . . . capital outlays without 
finding out where we're going and where we are down the road," said Richard 
Barnard, Huntington Beach deputy city administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea officials postponed breaking ground on a $7-million community center, 
scheduled for a construction start this week. Assistant City Manager Tim 
O'Donnell called the move a precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Anaheim has put $86.5 million in capital improvement projects on 
hold, most involving the planned widening of the Santa Ana Freeway, city 
officials said at a council meeting Tuesday. Other planned but now postponed 
expenditures included sewer improvements along the freeway corridor and three 
separate high-occupancy-vehicle-lane projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, which has $167 million invested in the county pool, also has begun a 
detailed cash-flow analysis and has hired a portfolio and investment adviser 
and a law firm specializing in bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City School District officials said Tuesday they are holding off on 
building a new Head Start facility at one elementary school and putting off 
repairing the drainage system at another. District Supt. Meliton Lopez remained 
optimistic that his district would recover all of its money in the fund, 
despite the sharp drop in the fund's value, but the district has ceased all 
non-essential spending, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not replacing textbooks that are lost, we have canceled all seminars, 
workshops, anything teachers were planning to attend that would require a 
substitute," Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cities and school districts, hiring was the No. 1 issue on managers' 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange Unified School District put negotiations with the teachers union on 
indefinite hold, Supt. Robert L. French said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Alamitos, the city suspended contract negotiations with the Los 
Alamitos Police Officers Assn. until early next year, City Manager Robert C. 
Dunek said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Irvine Unified School District, selection of a new superintendent will 
be slowed by the bankruptcy, officials said; the district does not yet know 
whether it will have the money to hire a search firm. And plans for a new high 
school and elementary school will also be placed on hold, along with 
negotiations between teachers and administrators for a new three-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every element of this district will be ultimately impacted," district Clerk 
Tom Burnham said, reacting to Tuesday's news of the county's investment loss. 
"The haircut of 27% is substantial. It's certainly going to create a lot of 
pain." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton School District was suffering even more basic problems. Supt. 
Duncan Johnson told the school board Tuesday night that a vendor refused to 
fill a $5,000 purchase order for audio visual equipment such as televisions and 
videotape recorders for use in classrooms. After being turned down, the 
district was able to persuade another vendor to fill the order, Johnson said. 
He did not identify either vendor. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, another unidentified vendor refused the district's request for 
8,000 gallons of gas to fuel school buses -- instead giving the district only 
1,000 gallons. District officials said Tuesday that they threatened to stop 
doing business with the vendor, who then filled the rest of the order. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach City Council voted to put off the purchase of a new 
firetruck, even though the city could have delayed paying for the unit for at 
least a year and saved $36,000 by making a commitment this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little queasy about making this kind of a commitment this early on in 
this kind of an environment," Mayor John W. Hedges said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two school districts are holding off on projects that already have cost them 
considerable sums. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saddleback Valley Unified School District has put off the opening of its 
new elementary school in Foothill Ranch. The school was expected to open next 
month. The county pool contained $22 million the district had set aside for 
construction projects and needed to tap into in order to complete the school. 
Officials said the district also has asked its vendors to hold all shipments of 
supplies until further notice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Capistrano Unified School District, spokeswoman Jacqueline Price said 
the county's financial crisis cut short a final scheduled $2.5-million payment 
from the pool for an elementary school site in Aliso Viejo at Sanborn and Wood 
Canyon Road. District officials had hoped to open a school there in September, 
1996, but that schedule is now in limbo. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Capistrano Supt. James A. Fleming sounded a note of certainty 
Tuesday that even if the county does not free funds in the pool relatively 
soon, the state will act to protect the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that the state will not permit schools to go under or suffer," 
Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others also tried to remain optimistic, hoping that the latest dose of bad 
news from the county might somehow spell little in the way of problems for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Niguel City Manager Tim Casey, for example, said the 27% loss was 
actually less than many had expected. And no current projects are endangered in 
his city, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are only deferring the commencement of some capital improvement projects," 
Casey said. Those include a $1.5-million street resurfacing project and another 
$3.3 million in improvements to street medians and local parks. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials in Cypress too said they saw few impacts for their city. City 
Manager Darrell Essex, in his job for 32 years, said he saw no immediate 
changes or hardships for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's fairly normal," he said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But frustrated members of the public were not always seeing things the same 
way. Many were telling off city or school district officials who had chosen to 
invest taxpayer money in the ill-fated pool. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting of the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District on Tuesday 
night, Yorba Linda resident Thomas Turk called for the resignation of the top 
administrators who had borrowed an extra $50 million to invest in the county 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Addressing school board members, Turk said, "Each of you brings special 
talents to the board. None of you are elected for your financial expertise so 
it's understandable that you rely on the expertise of the management team. That 
the management team remains in a position of trust is not understandable."

 Orange County plans to unload its entire portfolio of risky securities as part 
of a massive overhaul of the county's debt-laden investment pool, whose 
participants have lost $2.02 billion -- or 27% of their investment -- this 
year, the county's financial advisers announced Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a bet made on the interest rates, and the county lost the bet," 
said former state Treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, who is directing the county's 
efforts to unravel the financial mess. "What happened is going to be a problem 
for a number of years to come. Orange County can get out of it, (but) it will 
be painful." 
</P>
<P>
 Over strong objections from several city and school officials, U.S. Bankruptcy 
Court Judge John E. Ryan ruled Tuesday that the county can begin selling off 
its troubled bond holdings. The ruling remains in effect until Friday, when 
another hearing is set to reconsider the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's bankruptcy lawyer, Bruce Bennett, had argued that a liquidation 
had to begin for the county to avoid further losses should interest rates rise 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Salomon Bros., the county's financial advisers, each percentage 
point increase in interest rates will trim the portfolio's value by $300 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Tuesday in the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in 
U.S. history: 
</P>
<P>
 * Several members of the public, in their first opportunity to address the 
Orange County Board of Supervisors, blamed the board for the financial crisis. 
"The fingers should be pointing at all of you," said Linda Johnson of Dana 
Point. "You're incompetent, you've been negligent and I think you all should 
resign." 
</P>
<P>
 * City and school district officials with funds tied up in the frozen 
investment pool took steps to curb spending. The Irvine Unified School District 
imposed a hiring freeze and delayed construction projects. In Brea, officials 
postponed groundbreaking on a $7-million community center. And Huntington Beach 
indefinitely postponed construction of a restaurant at the end of the city's 
famed pier, a project in the planning stages for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 * County officials put off plans for an $82-million communication network that 
police consider a vital update of the county's antiquated system. It was the 
first big-ticket item to land on the county's casualty list. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maureen DiMarco, California's secretary of child development and education, 
assured the teachers, school officials and parents of Orange County that 
despite the county's budget crisis, schools will remain open, all employees 
will be paid and "business will continue as usual." 
</P>
<P>
 * Richard Marshack, a bankruptcy attorney representing several school 
districts, said his clients should receive all of their money and not absorb 
any losses because schools are required by state law to deposit their money in 
the county treasury and had no say in its investment policy. County officials, 
however, have suggested that the losses be distributed equally among all 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gov. Pete Wilson said he had no sympathy for five school districts and 
agencies that took the extraordinary step of borrowing money to invest in the 
county pool. "That's like taking the milk money and playing bingo with it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lawmakers in Sacramento and Washington called for hearings into Orange 
County's crisis and ways to deter other local governments from making such 
high-stakes investments with the public's money. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Federal Transit Administration announced that $8.8 million should arrive 
by week's end -- a five-month advance on next year's transit funds for Orange 
County. The money will pay for bus and rail operations for the next 100 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street reacted cautiously to the potential liquidation of the county's 
remaining portfolio, which holds the savings of 187 government agencies and a 
number of individuals who were awarded damages in lawsuits. Most bond dealers 
said finding buyers for the more complicated securities won't be impossible, 
but that potential buyers will demand attractive returns to accept the 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
 A picture of the troubled portfolio emerged in greater detail Tuesday, as 
Hayes laid out the financial predicament and said the immediate goals are to 
improve Orange County's liquidity, remove the risk from the portfolio and 
replace long-term securities with more short-term investments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors followed up with two specific actions. It formally 
hired Salomon Bros. to manage and help restructure the fund, now valued at $5.4 
billion. And the board agreed to free up previously "restricted" county funds 
-- emergency surplus money -- to help out the current cash crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will enable us to have more flexibility in moving county dollars to 
critical areas during this bankruptcy process," said County Administrative 
Officer Ernie Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 During a news conference, Hayes said "there was still considerable risk" in 
the county fund. He added that the county's liquidation would be conducted in 
"an orderly fashion." Stressed Hayes: "It's not a fire sale." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the turmoil, Hayes said the county retains "an underlying strength" of 
job growth, low unemployment rate and high household income. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to urge all of you: It is important we don't panic," Hayes said. 
"There's a diversified economy, and . . . basically, you have good people in 
this county." 
</P>
<P>
 In federal Bankruptcy Court on Tuesday, city managers and school district 
officials objected to the county's plan to sell any of its $5.4 billion in 
securities that remain. 
</P>
<P>
 One attorney who represents Brea and Buena Park said her clients had "been 
kept in the dark the entire time." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's remarkably cavalier of the county to waltz into court and say that the 
wishes of the smaller investors must all be pushed aside," said attorney 
Nanette Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett, the county's bankruptcy lawyer, urged Judge Ryan to approve the plan 
during the Santa Ana hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do nothing, the casino stays open and the dice will keep rolling," 
Bennett said. "This court needs to help us close the casino and put the dice 
away and start dealing with the substantial problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said he would not do anything to "undercut the county's ability to get 
control of the situation. It's important that what happens here reinforces a 
positive market perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was the first since the county filed for federal bankruptcy 
protection on Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 An analysis of the county's investment portfolio by Salomon Bros. provided the 
most comprehensive look yet at how much the county's holdings have deteriorated 
since early this month, when county leaders announced the investment troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Structured notes -- exotic securities that are likely to be the hardest 
holdings to sell -- now comprise 60.1% of the pool, up from 47% as recently as 
a week ago. The probable explanation is that investment bankers sold a large 
share of the pool's better-grade securities as they redeemed their collateral 
last week on unpaid loans to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon officials said the average maturity of holdings in the pool is now 
about four years, sharply higher than the 2 1/2 years reported by former county 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron as recently as September. Portfolios 
tend to be much more sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates as their 
maturities lengthen; with rates going up, the value of longer-term securities 
tends to get pummeled. County officials said they hope to slash the average 
maturity to less than six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes and William D. Rifkin, a Salomon managing director, hinted in an 
interview that investment firms that dumped the county's holdings onto the 
market last week may not have gotten the best price for them. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the more conventional securities among the holdings were currently 
valued at 95-96% of their face values, but that the investment firms sold the 
county's collateral at an average of only 90%. Rifkin later declined to say 
specifically that the firms had undercut the market, but he did note: "Clearly 
they sold the securities quickly." Residents Angry 
</P>
<P>
 The emerging financial fallout has angered many citizens, some of whom 
addressed the board at Tuesday's meeting, the first public session to address 
the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You were negligent," Tustin attorney Stephen Johnson told the supervisors. 
"What won't work is the current board. Stop blaming others." 
</P>
<P>
 Teddi Alves, a local broker, directed her outrage at Ernie Schneider, the 
county's top administrator. "I'm not here to shoot fish in a barrel, but I 
think there should be layoffs and they should start with you, Mr. Schneider," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors split up the tasks of trying to repair the county and assess 
the damage. Supervisor William G. Steiner met with directors of nonprofit 
organizations who do business with the county and have outstanding county bills 
that need to be paid. Steiner said he would support appointing accountant John 
M.W. Moorlach, Citron's opponent in the June election, to become treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Roger R. Stanton offered a proposal to identify potential budget 
cuts and restructure county government operations. Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez 
called a news conference to announce advances in state money for the Orange 
County Transportation Authority. But he kept reporters waiting for 2 1/2 hours 
and eventually canceled the briefing because his office was unable to confirm 
the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor-elect Marion Bergeson, now a state senator, issued a statement 
calling for the county to adopt a charter ordinance, which would allow the 
county to privatize certain services and departmental roles, such as the 
treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, county officials cut off all but essential spending related to 
health, safety and welfare because of the cash crunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors still had no idea Tuesday whether they would be getting paid. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the vendor who supplies toilet paper to the county jails had 
balked at delivering until he received money up front. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of confusion," said Sheriff Brad Gates, who said the 
toilet paper was later delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Gov. Wilson asked Treasurer-elect Matt Fong to lead a task 
force to review the investment practices of California cities, counties and 
other public agencies. Wilson, though, said it was too soon to call for a 
special session of the Legislature, as has been suggested by Assembly 
Democratic leader Willie Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), a Senate Banking Committee 
member, called for a fact-finding session Thursday in Anaheim to discuss the 
financial turmoil. Hayes and state Controller Gray Davis are among the invited 
speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) said the Orange County crisis could 
have been averted if former treasurer Citron had been required to disclose more 
about the county's investment portfolio. As a new member of the House Commerce 
Committee, Cox called for congressional hearings in January on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 He has proposed reforming federal securities laws to require full disclosure 
of investment activity. But Boxer contended Tuesday that proposals drafted by 
Cox for the Republican "contract with America" would make it harder for 
investors in the Orange County fund to sue successfully if they believed they 
were victims of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawsuits continued to be filed by bondholders and investors in the county 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit filed by Los Angeles County residents David and Rosalyn Bare alleged 
that Citron, Assistant Treasurer Matthew R. Raabe and two investment houses 
fraudulently led them to believe that the county's troubled bond pool was 
relatively risk-free. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bares purchased bonds issued by the county and other municipalities that 
participated in the investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Their lawsuit is the fourth federal class-action suit filed in connection with 
the Orange County bankruptcy case, court officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys involved in the class action suits said they expect them to be 
consolidated by U.S. District Judge Linda McLaughlin in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Tuesday, a fifth class-action lawsuit was filed in Orange County Superior 
Court on behalf of hundreds of youngsters and others who invested settlements 
from car accidents in the county investment pool on the advice of local judges. 
</P>
<P>
 The investors include Robin DeLeon, a 14-year-old from Huntington Beach, who 
received a settlement in April, 1993. The complaint alleges that her guardian, 
Susan McGivney, agreed to deposit the undisclosed amount in the county pool "on 
the recommendation of an unnamed Superior Court judge" who presided over the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLeon, McGivney and the attorneys could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's business community saw the first signs of trouble resulting 
from the county's bankruptcy Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Apartment Communities Inc. said it has shelved plans to refinance 
$327.3 million worth of its tax-exempt bonds, despite the fact they are in no 
way linked to the county investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Under normal circumstances, such refinancing activity is routine. But "you 
can't do a refinancing when the (bond) issuer is in bankruptcy," said Richard 
Moran, chief financial officer of Irvine Apartment Communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders last week expressed confidence that the bankruptcy was a 
political issue rather than a business one. But on the heels of the real estate 
company's refinancing difficulties, doubts began to surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Apartments watched its stock fall 38 cents a share to close at $15.75 
in extremely heavy trading Tuesday. And Moran confirmed that he has been 
fielding inquiries from Wall Street investors about the effect the county's 
bankruptcy could have on the competitiveness of companies based here.

</P>
<P>
 * Current Loss: About $2.02 billion in value from the $7.4 billion invested by 
the county, schools, special districts and others. That represents a decline of 
27%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Future Ups and Downs: With every 1% increase in interest rates, the fund

</P>
<P>
 * Quick Cash: There is about $230 million cash and investments that readily 
can be converted to cash.

JUDGE SUPPORTS BURBANK AIRPORT EXPANSION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge has given Burbank Airport a major victory in its 
11-year fight with the city of Los Angeles over plans to build a larger airport 
terminal, moving the project closer to the construction phase. 
</P>
<P>
 In a ruling made public Tuesday, Judge Robert H. O'Brien sided with the 
Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority in the third of four lawsuits 
brought against the authority by Los Angeles, representing residents opposed to 
airport noise. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge, saying he had no choice, ruled that airport officials had complied 
with state law in the manner in which they carried out an environmental impact 
report for the project, a key controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's decision was released by airport officials, who said they were 
elated by the court victory and vowed to begin the next stage of planning on 
the multimillion-dollar project -- quadrupling the size of the terminal -- as 
soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now maybe we can begin talking about areas of agreement with our neighbors 
rather than disagreement," said Brian Bowman, president of the authority, the 
airport's nine-member governing board. "I'm happy to have it behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the city of Los Angeles had sued airport officials last year to 
halt the project on behalf of residents of the southeastern San Fernando 
Valley, who have long complained about noise created by planes taking off from 
the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, Deputy City Atty. Keith Pritsker said he was unsure whether the city 
will appeal O'Brien's decision, a question he will put before the Los Angeles 
City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's unfortunate we had this ruling against us," he said. "We're 
hopeful one way or another we still will be able to achieve some relief for the 
people around the airport." 
</P>
<P>
 The Airport Authority, made up of nine commissioners representing the city 
governments of Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena, wants to quadruple the size of 
the present 163,000-square-foot terminal to accommodate the 10 million 
passengers expected to use it annually by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles has sued the Airport Authority four times since 1977, 
disputing in each case the adequacy of the airport's environmental impact 
reports. The first suit challenged the authority's purchase of the airport from 
Lockheed Corp. In 1983, the airport began planning for a new terminal, 
prompting more lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration has ordered airport officials to replace 
the current terminal, built in 1930, because it is too close to a runway to 
meet modern safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit that O'Brien ruled on, lawyers for the city of Los Angeles alleged 
that airport officials failed to recognize the significant increase in aircraft 
noise that would be caused by quadrupling the size of the terminal building and 
nearly doubling the number of aircraft gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowner groups in Studio City, North Hollywood, Valley Village and Sherman 
Oaks -- located under the airport's usual takeoff flight path -- later joined 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, O'Brien raised the homeowners' hopes when he ruled in their favor 
and ordered airport officials to redo the environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying the issue again, airport officials returned with the same 
findings they had the first time: The number of passengers using the airport 
will continue to grow with or without a new terminal. Any increase in air 
traffic will be caused by passenger demand and airline business decisions, 
regardless of the size of the terminal, the study maintains. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, they concluded, the new terminal itself will not significantly increase 
aircraft noise. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Dec. 9 ruling that was made public Tuesday, O'Brien did not take issue 
with those findings, focusing instead on whether airport officials complied 
with his orders to at least look into the potential for noise pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scope of the judicial review of this process does not include a 
re-analysis or re-decision by the court," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court does not, indeed cannot, second-guess the decision, reverse the 
decision, or modify it, etc., so long as the record shows by substantial 
evidence that (the Airport Authority) had all the necessary information before 
it prior to making its decision," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the city of Los Angeles filed their fourth lawsuit against 
airport officials this month, contending that even the updated environmental 
report contained new, improperly analyzed information. 
</P>
<P>
 However, airport officials expressed confidence Tuesday that the unresolved 
case would eventually be dismissed by O'Brien because he has already ruled that 
the report is sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the homeowner groups nor the city of Los Angeles are opposed to a new 
terminal. But they say they do not want to see the project proceed until the 
airport's commissioners acknowledge and attempt to mitigate noise pollution 
impacts on nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The airport essentially presented the same case as they did the first time. 
It doesn't make any sense," said Tom Paterson, a board member of the Citizens 
for Fair Airport Noise Homeowners Coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman of the Airport Authority disagreed, saying: "Really, the issue the 
court dealt with is, did we do our investigation and make our decision 
correctly? The judge said clearly we did. 
</P>
<P>
 "He also said there is no right or wrong answer. Neither the judge nor anyone 
else has the right or authority to question our conclusion. The only thing that 
can be questioned is our process." 
</P>
<P>
 Although airport officials intend to proceed immediately with their plans, the 
project is clouded by uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials hope to build the new terminal just north of the present 
one, on 120 acres of land once used by Lockheed to build military aircraft. But 
it is not clear how much longer Lockheed will take to clean up contaminated 
soil on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport also must negotiate a contract with a project management company 
and determine how to finance the $185-million terminal. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) NEXT STEP 
</P>
<P>
 The Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority meets Monday morning to 
discuss Superior Court Judge Robert H. O'Brien's favorable ruling. Soon after, 
airport officials expect to negotiate a contract with a project management 
company, BGP Airport Associates. Within the next two months, they expect to 
prepare a financial plan detailing how they hope to fund construction of the 
new terminal. Meanwhile, attorneys for the city of Los Angeles will go before 
the City Council as early as next week to ask whether the council wants to 
appeal the judge's ruling.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; COUNTY WINS BROAD AUTHORITY TO SELL POOL 
SECURITIES; COURTS: BANKRUPTCY JUDGE'S INTERIM RULING IS MADE OVER PROTESTS 
FROM AGENCIES WITH FUNDS INVESTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Over the objections of many of the cities, school districts and water 
districts that have money in the Orange County's bankrupt investment pool, U.S. 
Bankruptcy Court Judge John E. Ryan gave the county broad leeway Tuesday to 
sell any of its remaining $5.4 billion worth of securities in favor of more 
stable investments. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ryan's ruling will only remain in force until Friday afternoon, when he 
scheduled a second hearing to reconsider the matter. The "interim ruling" will 
give the 187 governmental agencies that invested in the pool more of a chance 
to review the county's request for unfettered control over the troubled fund, a 
request that the county submitted just hours before the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Several public agencies that invested millions of dollars in the fund filed a 
motion opposing the county's urgent plea, which the county said was needed to 
minimize its mounting losses. Both sides asked Ryan for a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 During the contentious, two-hour court hearing -- the first since the county 
filed for bankruptcy Dec. 6 -- attorneys representing investors asked the judge 
to postpone any ruling for at least several days. They complained that most of 
the county's 187 investors had been given less than 24 hours' notice of the 
county's sudden push for authority to sell all or part of the investment pool's 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The courtroom was filled beyond capacity, and the bankruptcy attorneys were so 
numerous that they had to wear number tags for easy identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Nanette Sanders, representing the cities of Brea and Buena Park, said 
her clients had had almost no opportunity to study the proposal, or come up 
with alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been kept in the dark the entire time," Sanders said. "It's 
remarkably cavalier of the county to waltz into court and say that the wishes 
of the smaller investors must all be pushed aside," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She and other attorneys representing public agencies complained that they had 
been excluded from a meeting earlier Tuesday between the fund's top 11 
investors and county officials in which the investors had been informed of the 
county's intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Rus, a lawyer representing Newport Beach, Fountain Valley and the Yorba 
Linda Water District among others, said he opposed allowing the sale of the 
fund's holdings until his clients could assess the true worth of the fund. He 
said he wanted additional time to review the findings of Salomon Bros., the New 
York investment banking firm hired by the county to analyze the fund's 
investments and come up with a strategy to stem the hemorrhage of losses. "My 
clients tell me that given a brief opportunity to analyze (the portfolio) 
themselves, they would like to make their own decisions," Rus said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County bankruptcy lawyer Bruce Bennett argued that the county needs 
the ability to sell securities and make more appropriate, stable investments 
immediately. The county must have the ability to sell certain investments if 
signs foretell more interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, Bennett 
said. Every percentage point increase in the interest rate, he said, would 
result in another $300-million loss to the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we do nothing, the casino stays open and the dice will keep rolling," 
Bennett said. "This court needs to help us close the casino and put the dice 
away and start dealing with the substantial problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan noted that the market's confidence in the county's ability to deal with 
the financial crisis is critical to the county's success in stabilizing its 
fund. He said he is loathe to do anything that would "undercut the county's 
ability to get control of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important that what happens here reinforces a positive market 
perspective," Ryan said. Under Ryan's ruling, the county now will be able to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Sell all or substantially all of the securities in its fund over the next 
180 days to one or more bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 * Restructure its securities with agencies such as the Federal National 
Mortgage Assn. and the Student Loan Marketing Assn. and other federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sell all or substantially all of the securities in the county's fund by 
class and/or type of securities over the next 180 days. 
</P>
<P>
 * Take actions such as purchasing financial instruments to lock in the current 
value of the county's fund and prevent further loss of value to the fund by any 
increase in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The authority to sell off securities was particularly pressing, Bennett said, 
because of the upcoming holiday season during which Wall Street transactions 
grind almost to a halt. Bennett said the county needs to be able to seize any 
good opportunities for restructuring its portfolio this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Access to the fund was also needed to protect the county's investments from 
upcoming market announcements about various economic indicators that could 
affect its value, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the events and announcements that county officials feared could have an 
adverse impact are: today's auctions of two-year and five-year U.S. Treasury 
notes; a Dec. 20 auction by the U.S. Treasury of two-year government notes and 
the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee that sets interest rates, and 
the Dec. 21 U.S. Treasury auction of five-year Treasury notes, court documents 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Bennett nor former state treasurer Thomas W. Hayes, the county's 
financial adviser, could predict what county securities might be sold most 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 "If tomorrow we found a good deal, we would execute it. But we won't move so 
quickly that we'll make a mistake," Hayes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said that one of the county's main priorities for payment of debts 
will be school districts, though he stressed that keeping schools running will 
be one of many priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing, Salomon Bros. Managing Director William D. Rifkin, who is 
leading his firm's efforts for Orange County, said his firm could potentially 
earn as much as $15 million in agent fees in a sell-off of Orange County's 
investments. County bonds, he said, will probably sell at an 8% discount on 
average.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; COUNTY SEARCHES FOR WAYS TO TRIM ITS CASH OUTLAYS; 
OPERATIONS: AGENCY HEADS ARE TOLD TO DETERMINE WHICH GOODS AND SERVICES ARE 
ESSENTIAL. OFFICIALS SEEK TO REASSURE VENDORS, WHO WORRY THAT THEY WON'T BE 
PAID.

 As county department heads scrambled Tuesday to determine what goods and 
services provided by outside vendors are essential and what can be cut, the 
vendors worried about whether they would get paid at all. 
</P>
<P>
 As the day wore on, county officials mollified vendors who demanded cash up 
front and fretted about whether their state and federal grants might be 
jeopardized because of possible cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned with a wide range of things, from security guards to toilet 
paper," said County Librarian John M. Adams. "We are attempting to evaluate all 
of those on a very short-term basis: What is most crucial to keep opening our 
doors?" 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors directed all agencies late Monday to 
prioritize the vendor contracts vital to the "health, welfare or safety" of 
county residents and to submit lists "immediately" to the county administrative 
office outlining their barest needs to keep the county running. 
</P>
<P>
 While it was still unclear Tuesday just what services would go, Adams 
speculated that no new library books would be ordered, and Health Care Agency 
Director Tom Uram said he was agonizing over whether to include private 
security guards that escort county workers to their cars on his list of 
essentials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do all the county physicals," Uram said. "Do we continue that type of 
thing? We have some private guards that help us at 17th Street. Do we continue 
that service or not? Is employee safety a concern right now? Yes. Is it more 
important than what we're going through? I don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Uram said he hoped to submit his lists to the county administrative office by 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 All other contracts will be canceled, and vendors who rendered nonessential 
services before the county's bankruptcy filing will not be paid for the time 
being, according to county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Uram said about 80% of his budget is state and federally funded, but he is 
concerned that he could jeopardize some of that funding if he can't match some 
of it with the required county dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 General Services Agency Director Bert Scott had "several dozen" employees 
working Tuesday to prioritize contracts and services provided by thousands of 
vendors. The agency not only contracts for its own goods and services, it 
handles $100 million in annual purchasing for the entire county, Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can tell you is, we're working on it," Scott said. "It's a big task, 
it's a very important task." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Brad Gates said his officials were meeting with some of the 600 
vendors who provide services to the Sheriff's Department. "There may be a 
chance down the road that they may not get all or part of their money," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the county auditor-controller's office began writing checks to food 
vendors "so we can keep prisoners and children fed," and discussed the 
possibility of replenishing petty cash reserves of departments more regularly, 
said Gary H. Leach, manager of claims and disbursing. 
</P>
<P>
 Several county agency heads said vendors had sent them letters stating they 
will not provide any services unless they are paid cash on delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 The vendor who supplies toilet paper to the county jails had balked at 
delivering until he received money up front, Gates said, and there has been "a 
lot of confusion" among other vendors too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got it all resolved," Gates said. "We've been on the phone with all our 
vendors and we picked up some checks today. It's all taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy attorney, said it was still too early 
to tell which vendors will be paid and how much. There just is not enough money 
to go around right now, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt very much that the end result will be that vendors are paid nothing," 
he said. "What is likely is that there is going to have to be a plan developed 
to distribute this loss to the constituencies of this county, and it's just too 
early to tell exactly where it will fall and in what proportions." 
</P>
<P>
 Anxiety has also descended on many private social service agencies that 
receive funds from the county. 
</P>
<P>
 It was somewhat reassuring to them that the county plans to honor obligations 
to essential health, welfare and safety service providers, but what "essential" 
means, they said, is open to interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 Margot Carlson, executive director of CSP Community Service Programs, said the 
county owes her agency more than $409,000 -- money that she needs to keep 
operating. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are caught in that bankruptcy aura. Nonprofits don't have deep pockets," 
said Carlson, whose agency contracts with the county to provide such services 
as diversion programs, gang intervention and assistance to victims of domestic 
abuse. "We desperately need answers. We cannot continue to fund programs, 
because we'll run out of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Several nonprofit agencies that depend heavily on state and federal money that 
funnels through the county said they have been told those funds are frozen as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said such "pass-through" funds would not be affected. But 
Rifka Hirsch, executive director of the Cambodian Family Inc. in Santa Ana, 
said she has been notified by county officials that the federal funds for her 
agency's refugee assistance programs, administered by the county, were frozen 
as of Dec. 6. And there is no assurance of funding for services provided after 
that date, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the organization does not receive some assurance by the end of the week, 
she said, it will have to cut services to hundreds of refugees. The agency 
provides English instruction and vocational assistance under contracts worth 
about $45,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said they have opted to stop doing business with the county altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Ruelas, owner of SSC, a 37-person engineering consulting firm in Orange, 
said he will stop doing business with the county, which has provided 10% to 15% 
of his firm's revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to be taking any chances," he said. "First they were saying it 
was $1.5 billion, now it's $2 (billion). I don't know whether they know 
themselves."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; BOXER SAYS GOP 'CONTRACT' TO IMPEDE LITIGATION BY 
INVESTORS; LEGISLATION: SENATOR FEARS STRATEGY OF EASING SECURITIES LAW WILL 
MAKE IT HARDER TO SUE SUCCESSFULLY TO RECOVER FUND LOSSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sen. Barbara Boxer called on Republican House leaders Tuesday to drop the 
securities law section of their "contract with America," asserting that the 
plan would make it more difficult for investors in the Orange County fund to 
sue successfully if they believe they were victims of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 By proposing major easing of securities law, the "contract" would "do great 
injustice to the investing public," Boxer said in letters to Rep. Newt Gingrich 
(R-Ga.), the next House Speaker, and Sen Robert Dole (R-Kan.), who will become 
Senate Majority Leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The suggested change in the law would require an investor to prove that the 
defendant had "actual knowledge" of a fraud, creating barriers "far more 
difficult than any in current law," wrote Boxer (D-Calif.), who is holding a 
fact-finding hearing on the failure of the Orange County fund in Anaheim on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), who wrote the securities section in 
the Republican plan, insisted that it would separate legitimate suits from 
frivolous complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican plan "is good for Orange County because it is targeted at 
frivolous lawsuits designed to extort settlements from taxpayers," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer and Cox disagree strongly on the Republican plan, as they do on many 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Chris Cox wrote this, then it is the height of political irony that he 
wrote this section that could win up injuring his constituents," Boxer said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox responded by saying, "either Barbara Boxer hasn't read it or she doesn't 
understand securities law." 
</P>
<P>
 Both legislators pledged an active role in dealing with the aftermath of the 
Orange County bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer said Thursday's hearing in Anaheim will include testimony from finance 
experts, public officials, and investors who suffered financially because of 
Orange County's filing. The hearing is set for 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. in the council 
chambers at Anaheim City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer is a member of the Senate Banking Committee, and its chairman, Sen. 
Alphonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.), has agreed at her request to hold hearings on the 
Orange County situation Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, will push for 
legislation requiring municipalities to provide the same disclosure to 
potential investors as corporations provide when they issue shares. Orange 
County disclosed far less than a business would, Cox said.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; VOICES

 Orange County residents have reacted strongly to the county's financial 
crisis. Here is a sampling of comments from readers who called TimesLine, the 
Times' phone-in line, with their thoughts. To leave a comment on TimesLine for 
possible publication, call 808-8463 from a touch-tone phone and press category 
*8300. In your message, please leave your first and last name, address and a 
phone number where you can be reached during the day or night. You can also us 
your comments -- with your name, city and phone number -- at (714) 966-5663.

 In high school economics, we learned the relationship of risk and reward, and 
it seems somewhat hypocritical for all the cities now to be criticizing Robert 
Citron when they went to him for that extra interest that he could earn....They 
had to know -- and if they didn't, they shouldn't have been managing municipal 
funds -- that they were incurring a greater risk by that higher interest rate.

 I want to know why we're always blaming the welfare moms and illegal 
immigrants for all of the state's and country's problems when in fact it's the 
bankers and real estate developers and lawyers and insurance agents that cause 
all the financial problems. Look at the savings and loan crisis, now Orange 
County's bankruptcy. This wasn't caused by these poor people, it was caused by 
the rich investors.

 I find it impossible to believe that one man can have so much authority over 
such a large fund as this....And to find out that my own town of San Clemente 
has $35 million in the investment pool, which seems inappropriate, makes me 
even more concerned. I think to give this man so much authority is absurd.

 It is incomprehensible to me that the top financial people, including (Robert 
L.) Citron, did not know what would happen to the fund if interest rates kept 
climbing. This is such a fundamental, simple issue for many investors.

O.C. IN BANKRUPTCY; 2 MORE CLASS-ACTION LAWSUITS BRING TOTAL TO 5; COURTS: 
FILINGS STEMMING FROM CRISIS WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO SAME JUDGE. ATTORNEYS 
ANTICIPATE SHE WILL COMBINE THEM. 
</P>

<P>
 Two more class-action lawsuits stemming from Orange County's bankruptcy were 
filed Tuesday, bringing the total to five so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County residents David and Rosalyn Bare claimed in federal court 
that former county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron, Assistant 
Treasurer Matthew Raabe and two investment houses fraudulently led them to 
believe the county's troubled bond pool was relatively risk-free. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bares' lawsuit is the fourth class action filed in federal court, said 
U.S. District Court Deputy Clerk Carolyn Voss. The lawsuits, including one in 
Los Angeles federal court, are being transferred to U.S. District Judge Linda 
McLaughlin in Santa Ana, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Voss said the class actions in the bankruptcy are being referred to McLaughlin 
because she drew the first such lawsuit last Thursday, when a San Diego 
attorney won the race to the courthouse with an 8:45 a.m. filing. 
</P>
<P>
 Several attorneys in the class actions said they expect McLaughlin to 
eventually consolidate the federal lawsuits into one. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, a fifth class action was filed in Orange County Superior Court 
on behalf of hundreds of minors and others who invested settlements received 
from car accidents in the county investment pool on the advice of judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Robin DeLeon, 14, sued on behalf of "all persons whose funds 
were deposited with the Orange County treasurer" upon recommendations by 
Superior Court judges who heard their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants are Citron, Raabe, Orange County Auditor-Controller Steve E. 
Lewis, Merrill Lynch, and Merrill Lynch executive Michael Stamenson, who 
advised Citron on investing the county portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit does not mention how much DeLeon, a Huntington Beach resident, 
received from her April, 1993, settlement, but alleges that her guardian, Susan 
McGivney, agreed to deposit the funds in the county pool "on the recommendation 
of a Superior Court judge" who presided over the case. The judge is not 
identified in the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLeon, McGivney and the attorneys could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Bares' suit, Citron, Raabe and two investment houses -- First Boston 
and Merrill Lynch -- were named as defendants. The couple, who could not be 
reached for comment, do not mention how much they invested in the portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 Circulars for recent county bond offerings were described as having a "low 
level of risk," according to the suit. Even when the county discussed risky 
reverse-repurchase agreements the circulars "continued to minimize this risk," 
according to the filing. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, a Florida retiree, Lee Theise, filed a class action concerning 
the $10,000 in bonds she purchased on Sept. 1, 1994, when the county offered 
almost $210 million in taxable pension obligation bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Theise's suit, Citron and Raabe mismanaged the fund and "made 
false and misleading statements" about the portfolio's soundness. First Boston 
and Merrill Lynch, who are also named as defendants, failed to "disclose the 
risks . . . arising from the reckless and unsuitable investment strategy" 
pursued by Citron and Raabe, the suit alleged. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch and First Boston profited from the county's failed investment 
strategy through "commissions and other fees obtained by creating and selling 
unsuitable derivatives and other securities" to the Orange County investment 
pool, Theise's lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, both firms knowingly loaned the pool more than $12 billion to 
purchase risky securities without much jeopardy to themselves because "the 
extension of credit was effectively secured" by the investment fund's 
collateral, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Theise's $10,000 investment in the pool is small compared to the sums 
other investors had in the fund, she is being represented by four different law 
firms with offices in Los Angeles, New York and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Other class actions filed last week include a suit by Leetate Smith, a wealthy 
Rancho Santa Fe resident who purchased $15,000 worth of Orange County bonds, 
and a suit filed by Janice Morgenstern. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming weeks, dozens of additional class actions probably will be filed 
by investors who purchased different Orange County bonds, said an Orange County 
attorney who is familiar with the county's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the Chapter 9 were dismissed tomorrow, these suits are going to go on 
because of the economic damage already done to the value of the bonds," said 
the attorney, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's bankruptcy filing protects the county from being named as a 
defendant in the suits filed in U.S. District Court, said the attorney, adding, 
"it's only a matter of time before bondholders begin filing claims in 
Bankruptcy Court." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, Raabe, First Boston and Merrill Lynch could not be reached for 
comment.
