RABIN, PERES AND ARAFAT SHARE NOBEL; HONOR: PEACE PRIZE AWARDED FOR HISTORIC 
AGREEMENT BETWEEN ISRAEL AND PALESTINIANS. BUT SOLDIER'S ABDUCTION CREATES 
STRAIN BETWEEN PARTIES. 
</P>

<P>
 The 1994 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat for 
the vision and courage of their efforts to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli 
conflict after generations of war and bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 The long legacy of Middle East violence, however, obscured the new hope that 
the Norwegian Nobel Committee had wanted to celebrate; the fragility of 
peacemaking here and the uncertainty of success were all too clear Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A 19-year-old Israeli soldier abducted by Islamic militants was killed in a 
fierce gun battle north of Jerusalem along with three of his captors and an 
Israeli officer leading a rescue team. Relations between Israel and the PLO had 
been thrown into a serious new crisis by the abduction. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also angry protests -- even from within the Nobel committee, one of 
whose five members resigned -- over awarding the prestigious peace prize to 
Arafat, whose Palestine Liberation Organization had used terrorism for years in 
its struggle against Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 And some Palestinian leaders complained that the award was not only premature 
but a Western attempt to win popular acceptance for agreements that remain 
controversial on the occupied West Bank and that are rejected by most 
Palestinian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Norwegian Nobel Committee was clear in its intention of strengthening 
the search for peace in the Middle East. It expressed hope that "the award will 
serve as encouragement to all Israelis and Palestinians who are endeavoring to 
establish lasting peace in the region." 
</P>
<P>
 "For several decades, the conflict between Israel and its neighbor states and 
between Israelis and Palestinians have been among the most irreconcilable and 
menacing in international politics," the committee said in announcing the award 
in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
 "By concluding the Oslo Accords (on Palestinian self-rule) and subsequently 
following them up, Arafat, Peres and Rabin have made substantial contributions 
to a historic process through which peace and cooperation can replace war and 
hate." 
</P>
<P>
 The award recognized Arafat's political courage in accepting Israel's 
existence and legitimacy. And it noted Rabin's recognition, in return, of the 
Palestinians' aspirations for self-determination and the right to govern 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This prize is for the whole nation, for the citizens of the state of Israel, 
for the bereaved families and the disabled, for the hundreds of thousands who 
have fought in Israel's wars," Rabin said in a statement. "The work is not yet 
finished -- and the prize is a prize for the future more than it is a reward 
for the efforts for peace that have been made up until now." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat described the award as a tribute to Palestinians' long struggle for 
recognition as a nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This prize is not for me," he said in the Egyptian port city of Alexandria. 
"It is for my people who have suffered much, for our martyrs, for our 
prisoners, for our children, so that we can have lasting peace." 
</P>
<P>
 The inclusion of Peres, a surprise to some Nobel watchers, was a tribute both 
to his enduring vision of a Middle East at peace and the brilliance of his 
diplomacy in achieving the breakthrough agreement last year in months of secret 
negotiations with the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made the choice this way because we found it too difficult to distinguish 
between the efforts of Rabin and Peres," committee Chairman Francis Sejersted 
explained. "On the (Palestinian) side, Arafat's contribution was clearly the 
most important." 
</P>
<P>
 The three men will receive gold medals at a ceremony in Oslo on Dec. 10, the 
anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, the Swedish industrialist who 
established the prizes, and they will share an award of $950,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the prize was awarded jointly to South Africa's Nelson Mandela, now 
the nation's president, and his predecessor, Frederik W. de Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second time that the Nobel committee had honored participants in 
the search for a Middle East peace: In 1978, it had awarded the prize to 
Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat for 
their initiatives to make peace between their two nations.  
</P>
<P>
 The jubilation that might have been felt Friday both in Israel and the 
Palestinian territories was overshadowed by the death of kidnaped Israeli army 
Cpl. Nachshon Waxman, three of his Islamic militant captors and an Israeli 
officer during a botched rescue missue. 
</P>
<P>
 Peres, in a statement expressing gratitude for the peace prize, delivered 
before the incident, said the militants had "not only kidnaped a young man . . 
. (they were) trying to kidnap the peace process and destroy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat, speaking after a meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and 
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in Alexandria, said he was using all 
the means that he had as chairman of the new Palestinian Authority -- ordering 
massive police searches of the Gaza Strip, roundups of Islamic militants and 
personal pleas to their leaders -- to try to secure Waxman's release. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are participants in preserving the peace from any acts of sabotage meant 
to damage this peace of the brave," he said. "We hope the other side will 
understand that we should not give any extremist forces the chance to damage 
the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's decision to award the prize to Arafat was the most 
controversial in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaare Kristiansen, a conservative former government minister in Norway, a 
staunch supporter of Israel and a member of the Nobel committee for three 
years, resigned in protest immediately after the announcement. He said the 
veteran guerrilla leader's "past is too tainted with violence, terrorism and 
bloodshed, and his future is too unpredictable to make him a Nobel Peace Prize 
winner." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1973, the committee awarded the prize jointly to Secretary of State Henry 
A. Kissinger and Le Duc Tho, a member of the Vietnamese Communist Party 
Politburo, for their efforts to end the Vietnam War. Two committee members 
later resigned in protest, and Tho declined to accept the prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the Israeli Foreign Ministry in Jerusalem, right-wing demonstrators 
chanted "Arafat is Hitler" and "Rabin and Peres are men of blood," and some 
carried Israeli flags painted with black lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Netanyahu, leader of the opposition Likud Party, called the award to 
Arafat "shameful." 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that the prize is given to the person who invented international 
terrorism, the archmurderer who says he decided to stop killing for a while but 
whose men killed seven Israelis this year -- this turns the prize into a 
farce," Netanyahu said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peres dismissed such criticism as simply blind to political realities. 
"Peace is made with one's enemies," he declared. "What's the alternative? We 
all know that peace is made with yesterday's enemies so that there won't be a 
war tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Palestinians, there was criticism of a different kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is entirely premature, both for Arafat and for the Israelis," said 
Haidar Abdel-Shafi, the respected Gaza physician who led the Palestinian 
delegation to the Mideast peace talks. "No one is certain that true peace will 
be realized in the region. All Israel's actions -- expansion of the 
settlements, the checkpoints and closures, the arrests -- show there is no 
peace."  
</P>
<P>
 Hanan Ashrawi, chairwoman of the Palestinian Human Rights Commission, called 
the award "a tarnished trophy." 
</P>
<P>
 "The mission of peace has not been accomplished, and the peace process itself 
is in serious difficulties," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahmoud Zahhar, a leader of Hamas in the Gaza Strip and a prominent critic of 
the accord, denounced Arafat as a "servant of Western imperialism." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is well known that this prize is only given to those who serve the 
policies of the West," Zahhar said to the cheers of worshipers at a 
Hamas-affiliated mosque in Gaza City. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Christopher urged both sides to recognize the award as the 
commemoration of the "great achievement of Arafat and Rabin in the peace accord 
signed just over a year ago in Washington and to keep the difficulties of 
reaching a full peace in perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to step back from the tragic events of the last few days," 
Christopher said, referring to the Waxman abduction, "and remember the 
tremendous progress that was initiated by Prime Minister Rabin and Chairman 
Arafat." 
</P>

Cahn in Jerusalem and Summer Assad on the Israeli-occupied West Bank also

N. KOREA, U.S. NEAR NUCLEAR ARMS PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is preparing to conclude a far-reaching new 
agreement with North Korea that will permanently freeze that country's nuclear 
weapons program but also will postpone for several years the requirement that 
it submit to special inspections of its nuclear waste dumps, U.S. officials 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, the United States and North Korea will set up liaison offices 
in each other's capitals within six months, the first step toward establishing 
diplomatic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration will drop its earlier insistence that radioactive 
nuclear fuel rods now sitting outside the North Korean nuclear plant at 
Yongbyon be transported out of the country, agreeing instead that they can be 
stored inside North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The accord is expected to be signed within the next two or three days in 
Geneva, where Special Ambassador Robert L. Gallucci has been negotiating with 
representatives of North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials cautioned Friday that there still could be some last-minute 
hitch to delay the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Administration officials have begun briefing Congress and the South Korean 
government on details, and Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord said 
Friday that the United States and North Korea "may be on the verge of a rather 
significant breakthrough." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed deal will enable the Clinton Administration to claim victory for 
persuading North Korea to stop its nuclear program. It may also provide 
ammunition for Republicans and conservatives to attack the Administration for 
making concessions to Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The reported terms of the deal also drew sharp criticism in Seoul. Critics 
declared that the United States had sold out South Korea's interests. They said 
delaying the inspections could allow North Korea to continue dodging questions 
about its nuclear capacity.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many concessions and nothing gained for the South Korean side," 
said one government adviser and expert on North Korea. "There are two winners, 
the United States and North Korea, and one loser -- South Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hangyoreh, a leftist newspaper in Seoul, said: "It's a big breakthrough. 
It's a disappointment to hard-liners, but we have to learn to live with North 
Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 The special inspections requested by the International Atomic Energy Agency 
are aimed at finding out how much nuclear fuel North Korea has already 
produced. By the CIA's estimate, North Korea possesses enough weapons-grade 
plutonium to make one or two nuclear bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 In sharp questioning over the reported deal before the National Assembly on 
Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hong Koo told legislators that the government 
was not satisfied with the terms but had to accept them to prevent the outbreak 
of another war on the Korean peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts here said the U.S. interest in keeping North Korea in the nuclear 
non-proliferation treaty -- even at the price of tolerating Pyongyang's 
possession of one or two bombs -- was fundamentally different from South 
Korea's interest. Unlike the United States, South Korea is directly threatened 
by even one bomb and so has tried to argue furiously for the inspections of 
Pyongyang's nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But Seoul failed -- a smashing diplomatic triumph for Pyongyang, one expert 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Selig Harrison, a specialist on North Korea at the Carnegie Endowment for 
International Peace in Washington, said the proposed deal "is a true compromise 
. . . reflecting diplomacy at its best." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison has argued for several years that North Korea would be willing to 
bargain away its nuclear capability in exchange for political and economic 
benefits from the West. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, U.S. and North Korean negotiators in Geneva reached a first, vague 
and preliminary agreement that set out the goals both countries wanted to 
achieve. The United States said it would agree to exchange liaison offices with 
North Korea at some point and would arrange for North Korea to get new civilian 
light-water nuclear technology for energy production, if Pyongyang would freeze 
its nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 But that earlier agreement left the most important questions unanswered -- 
such as when the diplomatic liaison offices would be set up, what country would 
supply the light-water technology and what would happen to the 8,000 fuel rods 
now cooling in a pool outside the Yongbyon reactor. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, there was no agreement in August on the crucial issue of when 
international inspectors could examine nuclear waste dumps near Yongbyon. North 
Korean negotiators later said they had no intention of ever permitting special 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is finally signed, the proposed new agreement will go much further and 
be much more detailed than the previous one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a new concession, Pyongyang will agree to let South Korea take the lead 
role in providing North Korea with new light-water civilian nuclear technology, 
which is worth about $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and its allies have said they are willing to supply this 
light-water technology to Pyongyang, because it cannot be used to make fuel for 
nuclear weapons as easily as North Korea's current gas-graphite nuclear 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korea has been seeking the right to supply this light-water technology 
to North Korea, both because the contracts are economically important and 
because Seoul hopes that, some day, a reunified Korea will have all its nuclear 
plants using the same technology. Until now, however, North Korea had demanded 
that the equipment to come from Russia or Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most significant compromise in the new accord, North Korea would 
explicitly agree for the first time to submit to the special inspections of two 
sites where it is believed to have dumped nuclear wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a concession of its own, the Clinton Administration would agree that 
the inspections need not take place for three to five years, until after 
significant amounts of the new light-water technology and equipment arrive in 
North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, North Korea would also agree not to reprocess the 8,000 fuel 
rods and would promise not to refuel or start up its current nuclear reactor at 
Yongbyon. In exchange, the United States would agree to let the fuel rods 
remain inside North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia reportedly had said that it was willing to accept storage of the rods 
on its soil in exchange for money, but North Korea did not want the rods 
shipped out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, North Korea ends a 100-day mourning period for the late President 
Kim Il Sung today with a ceremony that could reveal whether his son, Kim Jong 
Il, is being formally named the nation's leader. The younger Kim has not been 
named head of the Korean government or its ruling Communist Party, and there 
has been speculation in the West that he is suffering from some undisclosed 
illness.

WILSON, BROWN MEET AT LAST IN BITTER DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL and AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown traded sharply worded attacks with Gov. Pete Wilson 
during a televised debate Friday that reached an emotional peak when Brown, 
rejecting Wilson's contention that she is weak on crime, revealed that her own 
daughter had been raped. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset of the hourlong forum -- the only debate of the gubernatorial 
campaign -- Brown went aggressively on the offensive against Wilson, telling 
viewers across the state that California "cannot afford four more years of 
tax-and-spend Republicanism." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, appearing at times tentative and halting, told state Treasurer Brown: 
"Kathleen, you lack the courage to be governor" because she had not offered 
detailed budget cuts when the state was going through a fiscal crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy and illegal immigration dominated most of the discussion. Brown, 
generally composed and deliberate, hammered at Wilson repeatedly about his 
handling of the budget and the economy, over and over touting her 62-page plan 
to return California to prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson returned to his tough stand against illegal immigration in response to 
almost every question asked by the panel of three political reporters, always 
mentioning his support for Proposition 187, the anti-illegal immigration ballot 
measure, and the cost of the state providing services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 On the tax issue, Wilson contended that Democrat Brown's economic plan 
contains massive tax increases. Brown disputed the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dramatic highlight of the Sacramento encounter came when an emotional 
Brown turned to Wilson and said she resented his persistent allegation that she 
would be soft on violent criminals. She said he could not imagine what it was 
like to be a mother having to comfort a daughter who had been raped. Later she 
said her daughter had been the victim of a date rape several years ago but that 
no charges had been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional moment came about halfway through the telecast as Brown sought 
to blunt Wilson's attack on her personal opposition to the death penalty and 
answer questions about how tough she would be on crime.  
</P>
<P>
 Brown said: "You know, Pete, you've misrepresented my positions on crime 
throughout this campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I have to tell you what I resent most of all is you questioning, 
questioning, my commitment to be tough on crime. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "And you cannot imagine what it's like to be a mother waiting at home late at 
night for your kids to come home, waiting for your daughter to come home in the 
evening and having her come home and comfort her because she's been raped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or your son called to come home from school while I'm working to say, 'Come 
home, because I've been robbed.' . . . You can't understand that. So don't 
question my commitment to be tough on crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson gave no quarter. "Well I have to question it Kathleen, because despite 
that moving performance," he began, going on to attack the death penalty record 
of her father and brother, both of whom were governors of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers at first were not certain whether Brown was relating personal 
experience or hypothetical incidents, because she had never discussed the rape 
or mugging before. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the debate, Brown disclosed that she was describing the date rape of 
one of her daughters. She said no police report was filed and no arrests were 
made. She said her son Zeb was mugged in the late 1980s in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why she made the disclosures now, Brown said she was "sick and tired of 
this governor . . . using cheap political tricks" to suggest she would be weak 
on crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said after the debate that he felt sympathy for the Brown family in 
suffering what must have been "a terrible experience." 
</P>
<P>
 But he did not back down on his campaign theme that he is the only candidate 
the voters can trust on the crime issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson added: "It makes it more mystifying to me what I will charitably term 
her tardiness" in working to toughen laws against violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was pleased with her performance in the debate and challenged Wilson to 
more meetings between now and the Nov. 8 election. Wilson, who is the 
front-runner in opinion polls, said no. 
</P>
<P>
 The 61-year-old Wilson said he was pleased with the debate and said Brown was 
"out of touch" on the economics issue and in her booklet, which he referred to 
as a "pamphlet." 
</P>
<P>
 "She tried to sell the plan," he said. "I don't think it will work." 
</P>
<P>
 In the selling, the 49-year-old Brown had some of the best lines of the hour. 
</P>
<P>
 She accused Wilson of lying when he said during the 1990 campaign that he was 
the only candidate who could balance the budget without a tax increase. Making 
a play on former President George Bush's broken promise, she said: "Don't read 
his lips. Read my plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown turned around an old Republican epithet about "tax and spend" Democrats 
in Congress when she labeled Wilson a "tax and spend" Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson agreed to a $7-billion tax increase in 1991 in order to get the state 
through an unexpectedly severe fiscal crisis. State spending was cut by a like 
amount. Brown has said in the past that there was no alternative to raising 
taxes that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown had the advantage of drawing the first question, determined by a coin 
toss. Although the format called for no opening or closing statements, Brown 
used her question -- about why she had fallen so far in the polls -- as an 
opportunity to deliver a broad opening statement about her plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said: "My campaign has just begun," apparently referring to the release 
of the economic plan with fanfare a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no attempt by the moderator to force either candidate back to the 
subject of the questions being asked and both candidates often strayed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wilson was asked if he would serve a full four years, he said simply, 
"Yes," and then used the rest of his time to talk about the costs of illegal 
immigration to California. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point Wilson was asked what he would do if he was a school principal 
and Proposition 187 became law. Would he go through classes and pull out 
children who were ineligible for public education because of their illegal 
status? 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson declined a direct answer, saying that that provision of the measure 
will have to be tested in the U.S. Supreme Court first. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who opposes the ballot initiative, said several times that Proposition 
187 "will make a bad situation worse." 
</P>
<P>
 One independent analyst who watched the encounter thought Brown had the best 
performance, but questioned whether it was enough to close Wilson's lead in the 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Brody, emeritus professor of political science at Stanford, said: "If 
people have questions about Kathleen Brown's grasp (of issues), which is often 
the rap on her campaign -- that she's an empty suit -- it seems to me she did 
better than people would have expected."

AST LAYOFFS, PLANT CLOSURE HIT O.C. HARD; EMPLOYMENT: SHUTDOWN OF FOUNTAIN 
VALLEY'S BIGGEST EMPLOYER WILL COST ANOTHER 440 JOBS BY FEB. 1. DOZENS MORE 
WILL BE CUT IN IRVINE AS COMPANY REPORTS LARGER-THAN-EXPECTED LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 AST Research Inc., struggling to keep pace in the cutthroat personal computer 
business, said Friday that it will close its Fountain Valley manufacturing 
plant, lay off its 440 employees and move operations there to an AST plant in 
Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's sixth-largest computer maker, which employs 6,900, said it is 
moving to reduce its work force by 10% worldwide. It also reported that it 
expects a quarterly loss of up to $40 million -- far worse than industry 
analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a gut-wrenching thing to have to do," said James T. Schraith, AST's 
president. "But for the sake of the remaining employees and the people who have 
a stake in the company, we simply had to make the necessary changes to become a 
stronger company." 
</P>
<P>
 The ax fell swiftly Friday morning in this latest round of layoffs to hit 
Orange County's high-tech work force. Employees were summoned to a 6 a.m. 
meeting, and 100 workers were dismissed with up to two months of severance pay. 
The entire plant is to close by Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees had suspected for some time that layoffs were pending, and word of 
the early morning session had fueled speculation. "I slept OK last night, but 
it was tough waiting for the 6 a.m. meeting," said stockroom worker Jose 
Corvarruvias, 33. "They started the meeting by saying 'Good morning,' but we 
told them it sounded like a bad morning." 
</P>
<P>
 AST attributed its problems to an unusual combination of product delays, parts 
shortages and atypically low profit margins. But all companies in the PC 
industry -- which is now in many ways a marketing-driven business that relies 
on commodity parts and suffers chronically thin margins -- are wrestling with 
similar issues. 
</P>
<P>
 AST said that about 250 additional employees worldwide, including 50 to 75 at 
its Irvine headquarters, also will lose their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant closing will erase Fountain Valley's biggest employer from the city 
rolls and will leave about 290,000 square feet of manufacturing space vacant. 
The city receives $100,000 a year in property taxes from the AST plant, which 
consists of two buildings owned by Sakioka Farms in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley Mayor John Collins bemoaned the latest hit to the local 
economy. "You feel bad for the employees, some of whom are Fountain Valley 
residents, but the economy has been very harsh to everybody, including to this 
city," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The news was a blow to the team of business and political leaders who have 
been trying to recruit businesses and keep jobs in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't know about it, and obviously this is not good," said Wayne Wedin, 
chairman of the Orange County Economic Development Consortium, a 
business-retention group. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, Hughes Aircraft Co. said it will relocate most of its Fullerton 
operations, laying off 1,000 workers and taking 6,100 more jobs out of the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 "AST's announcement is part of a continuing loss of high-tech manufacturing 
jobs here," said Anil Puri, chair of the economic department at Cal State 
Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoff at AST is its second in a year. The company terminated 1,050 
employees, including 650 in Orange County, in the aftermath of its July, 1993, 
purchase of Tandy Corp.'s computer manufacturing operations. It has since 
shifted some of its Fountain Valley operations to the former Tandy plant in 
Fort Worth. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of percentages, AST's latest job cuts are "not a lot," Puri said. 
"But AST is an important company, a local, home-grown company, and when they 
make a decision like that, we need to pay attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The closing of the Fountain Valley plant is mainly the result of AST's 
problems over the past few months in the superheated competition to sell 
low-cost machines loaded with features. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is reeling from the computer industry price wars but, more 
critically, from internal problems, including delays in new-product development 
and difficulties absorbing the $175-million Tandy purchase, said Kimball Brown, 
a high-technology industry analyst with Dataquest Inc. in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "And while they are doing that, the industry continues to be ferocious," Brown 
said. Competitors such as Compaq Computer Corp. and International Business 
Machines Corp. are reporting profits and increased sales. "It is difficult to 
maneuver in that kind of climate," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schraith pointed out that the company has no plans to move its headquarters, 
which has a staff of 800. "We feel this is the right place," he said. "We're 
close to a lot of technology, close to the operating system companies. Also, a 
large amount of business comes out of the Pacific Rim. So we'll stay here with 
our engineering, marketing, sales and other headquarters operations." 
</P>
<P>
 The company said at the end of August that it would report a loss for its 
first fiscal quarter, which ended Sept. 30. But Friday's announcement of red 
ink totaling $39 million to $40 million was triple the amount expected by 
analysts, who last month had projected a loss of 35 cents to 75 cents a share. 
The update puts the loss at $1.20 to $1.25 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales for the quarter also will be much lower than anticipated. AST said 
revenue will likely be $495 million. Analysts had expected revenue of at least 
$515 million, which would have matched last year's first-quarter revenue. Final 
financial results will be released Oct. 27, AST said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock, too, has been battered this year, mainly in response to 
concerns that the company is overstocked with older products and is unable to 
get new models out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 AST's share price fell $1.50 Friday to close at $10.75 a share in heavy 
trading of 5.7 million shares on the Nasdaq market system. The stock has 
plummeted from $33 a share early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's announcement marked the second time in two months that the company 
surprised analysts with bad news. At a meeting in early August, AST executives 
painted a rosy picture of the company for Wall Street. Less than 30 days later, 
the company said that the profit it had projected would instead be a loss and 
that it was taking steps to rectify the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 From that point, Schraith said, senior executives were researching the 
company's options and settled about 10 days ago on the action that the board of 
directors eventually approved. The move to Taiwan, where AST has a plant that 
also makes notebook computers, was logical not only because of the lower labor 
costs but also because of the proximity to Pacific Rim countries that supply 
that model with parts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The closing of the factory was expected," said Stephen Dube, an analyst at 
Wasserstein Perella Securities in New York. "The surprise was the manpower cuts 
outside of Fountain Valley. We won't find out at least until the March quarter 
if AST is back in the game."

Making Jobs Disappear 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing jobs in Orange County have been disappearing steadily since the 
late 1980s, particularly in the electronic-equipment industry, where 35% of the 
jobs have been eliminated since 1988. In thousands: 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing jobs (1994*): 205.5 
</P>
<P>
 Electronic-equipment jobs (1994*): 24.5 
</P>
<P>
 * 1994 figures are for January through May; all others are annual averages.

CHILDHOOD SAVAGERY REVISITS CHICAGO'S TOUGH SOUTH SIDE; CRIME: BOY, 5, IS 
DROPPED TO HIS DEATH BY YOUTHS DEMANDING HE STEAL CANDY FOR THEM. BROTHER'S 
RESCUE FAILS. 
</P>

<P>
 In the brutal pecking order that passes for childhood in the Ida B. Wells 
housing projects on Chicago's near South Side, Eric Morris already had three 
strikes against him the night he died. He was five years old, he was too weak 
to fight back and he wanted to do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday night, Eric Morris fell to his death, dropped from the window of a 
14th-floor project apartment by two older children angered because the boy 
would not steal candy for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago police said that the two older youths, just 10 and 11, dangled their 
tiny captive out of the window, fighting off a rescue attempt by the boy's 
older brother. Police and neighbors said Derrick Morris, 8, grabbed his 
brother's arm but lost control as another youth attacked him. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Eric Morris fell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just cruel," said Joanne Mitchell, 28, an 11th-floor tenant of the Wells 
project. "What goes on in a child's mind to do that to a baby? What kind of 
kids are we raising?" 
</P>
<P>
 Children kill and are killed in almost every American city. But Chicago seems 
to have carved its own grim niche this summer. Over the past month, South Side 
neighborhoods have repeatedly become scenes of childhood savagery that dwarf 
even the fictionalized terrors of "The Lord of the Flies." 
</P>
<P>
 First, there was Robert Sandifer, an 11-year-old murder suspect known as 
"Yummy" to his friends. He was shot in the head, allegedly executed by two 
fellow adolescent gang members because they feared he might surrender to 
police. Days later, Chicago police arrested yet another unnamed 11-year-old and 
charged him with the bludgeoning murder a year ago of an elderly neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Chicago police detained two youths whose names they would not 
reveal, charging them with first-degree murder in Eric Morris' death. Police 
said that both of the suspects have confessed their roles in the boy's death. 
But because of their young ages, they face only a maximum of 5 years' probation 
or commitment to a state juvenile facility until they are 21. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instances such as these are not easy," said Chicago Police Detective 
Commander Charles Smith. "It's very sad when a five-year-old is killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that the Morris boys and the other youths went into the high-rise 
project building shortly before 8 p.m. Thursday. Although the Morrises lived in 
a low-rise nearby, they were not stopped by Chicago Housing Authority police 
assigned to monitor the entrances, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors also criticized the housing authority for not moving fast enough to 
board up abandoned apartments. Housing Authority spokesman Steve Canty said 
that more than 6,300 of the agency's 48,700 units are vacant, but insisted that 
abandoned units are boarded up quickly "if they can't be made usable quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 The Morris boys were led to an abandoned 14th-floor unit that police described 
as a "clubhouse" where neighbors say youths used to smoke marijuana and crack. 
</P>
<P>
 The older youths tried to persuade the Morris boys "to steal candy," Smith 
said. When the boys refused, Eric was "dangled out the window and then pulled 
in" by Derrick. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Eric was grabbed and "dangled again." As Derrick tried again to pull 
his brother to safety, another youth "bit and scratched" Derrick. In the 
confusion, both Derrick and the older youth let Eric go. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was horrible," said Monique Jackson, 14, who watched from outside the 
building as she was returning from a nearby market. "He came down waving and 
screaming." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the suspects had been arrested at least six times, according to law 
enforcement authorities, on charges ranging from unlawful use of a weapon to 
aggravated battery with a fist. The other youth has one referral to juvenile 
court on a theft charge, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the maroon-brick low-rise units where the Morrises live, there was 
astonishment at the way he died, but no surprise about the youths charged with 
his murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "That boy used to steal candy from my younger brother," said Shawn Jackson, 
11. "And last summer, he hit me in the eye with a slingshot." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no one inside the Morris residence. Toni Morris, the child's mother, 
had been hospitalized in shock at her son's death, neighbors said. And Derrick 
Morris was being treated for bites, scratches and bruises he suffered as he 
tried in vain to pull his brother to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 As dusk fell, a horde of children gathered around Joanne Mitchell as she stood 
near the Morris home. Some hit each other with sticks. Others clutched the 
hands of older siblings, wondering what the talk was all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Derrick was doing everything a brother should do," Joanne Mitchell said. 
"That boy's a hero. But what's this going to do to him, seeing his brother die 
like that? This ain't the kind of thing that's supposed to happen to little 
boys. I don't care where you live."

JUDGE REFUSES TO PROBE FALSE NEWS LEAK IN SIMPSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito, wrestling with media coverage of the O.J. 
Simpson case and its potential impact on the jury, denied a defense request 
Friday for permission to conduct a far-reaching investigation of how a false 
report made its way onto television. 
</P>
<P>
 That report -- a KNBC Channel 4 story saying DNA tests of blood on socks found 
in Simpson's bedroom genetically matched Nicole Brown Simpson's -- has emerged 
as a major point of contention in the case because prosecutors and defense 
attorneys have both said it was incorrect. After first standing by the story, 
KNBC later acknowledged that it had erred. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito ruled that the story has been so widely denounced that it no longer poses 
any danger to Simpson's ability to receive a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see that it is prejudicial to the defendant at this time, and the 
court declines to proceed further in this matter," Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the judge has cited the KNBC report in his discussions with potential 
jurors in order to emphasize that they should not believe everything they read 
or hear about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling headed off the latest aggressive attack by defense attorneys, who 
had hoped to use the hearing to ferret out the "source and purpose" of leaks 
that they said had compromised Simpson's rights. Simpson has pleaded not guilty 
to the June 12 murders of Nicole Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the hearing, Simpson's lawyers had hoped to show that the KNBC report 
was more than inaccurate. They have suggested that police gave the information 
to KNBC knowing that it was false but expecting to manipulate future tests on 
the socks in order to falsely implicate Simpson. Although they have produced no 
evidence that such tampering has taken place, the defense attorneys have made 
the accusation in court documents and arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Shapiro, one of Simpson's lead attorneys, said that police were 
perpetuating a "self-fulfilling prophecy" and that he wanted to take testimony 
from three employees of the LAPD Scientific Investigation Division, four 
employees of KNBC or NBC, LAPD Cmdr. David J. Gascon and a deputy district 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not want to accuse anybody. We do not want to destroy anybody," Shapiro 
said. "We want the opportunity to conduct an inquiry." 
</P>
<P>
 But Shapiro's request was vigorously contested by media lawyers and an 
attorney appearing on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union. Ann 
Egerton, representing KNBC, said the station's reporter and president would 
invoke the state's shield law that protects journalists from revealing their 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Egerton accused Shapiro of hypocrisy, citing news reports that 
appeared to be generated by defense sources. An article in the New Yorker 
magazine leveled an attack on Detective Mark Fuhrman and quoted unnamed defense 
attorneys calling him a racist and a "bad cop" who might have planted evidence 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas E. Mirell, an ACLU lawyer, also objected to proposed questioning of 
the KNBC staffers, including reporter Tracie Savage, who was in the courtroom. 
He said the proposed questioning was collateral to the main issues of the trial 
and would not reveal anything of substance. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Shapiro agreed to release Gascon from his subpoena after the 
commander, who is the LAPD's chief spokesman, said he would sign a declaration 
denying that he was the source of the KNBC report and stating that he did not 
know who leaked that information to the station. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing those arguments, Ito ruled against the defense, at least for now 
removing the KNBC report and its fallout from the list of far-ranging issues 
that have cropped up in the Simpson case. Media issues will soon return to the 
top of the court agenda, however: Ito has scheduled a Nov. 7 hearing to decide 
whether to bar cameras from his courtroom for the duration of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 With the case receiving enormous national attention, attorneys for both sides 
have complained that the task of finding an impartial jury is difficult, and 
Friday's jury selection session continued to move ploddingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Only five prospective jurors were questioned during a morning session in which 
Shapiro for the first time actively took part in the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 One person was removed from the panel Friday. The potential juror, a 
68-year-old South-Central Los Angeles man, had repeatedly ignored a bailiff's 
admonitions to stop reading a booklet titled "Instant Pain Relief" as he sat in 
the courtroom audience. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ito asked why he insisted on reading, the man replied: "I was way ahead 
and knew what the answer was going to be. I don't take it serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro tackled the task of questioning jurors with vigor, his sharp, 
sometimes abrasive style in contrast to co-counsel Johnnie L. Cochran Jr.'s 
softer touch. When Shapiro pressed a 65-year-old woman from West Los Angeles on 
how she would feel if she had been unjustly accused of murder and had a jury 
with someone like herself on it, the woman became clearly flustered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't put myself in his shoes," she responded. "I don't know what exactly 
you're trying to get out of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Under continued questioning from Shapiro, the woman also acknowledged that she 
had heard 911 tapes from a 1989 incident in which Nicole Simpson called police 
for help as a man she identified as her ex-husband tried to break down a door. 
The prospective juror said she had mistakenly believed that O.J. Simpson had 
physically attacked his ex-wife in that incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the oral questioning Friday focused on those tapes. All five jurors 
questioned said they could put aside what they thought about the tapes and 
judge Simpson fairly. 
</P>
<P>
 But the overwhelming majority of prospective jurors have said they heard the 
tapes, and the breadth of their dissemination has caused great concern. More 
than 90% of the prospective jurors said in their responses to written questions 
that they had some information about the tapes, Ito said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've indicated that they are aware of it, that it stuck in their minds," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro said the decision by the city attorney's office to release those tapes 
was grossly negligent and asked for additional peremptory challenges -- those 
that each side can use to remove prospective jurors without stating a cause -- 
as a way of compensating Simpson for the harm he had suffered as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 But representatives of the district attorney's office and city attorney's 
office each objected on varying grounds -- noting that 911 tapes typically are 
public records and that the request in the Simpson matter was handled in 
exactly the same way as other requests for such information. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark also said the tapes may still be admitted as 
evidence, in which case their public broadcast would not significantly affect 
Simpson's ability to receive a fair trial. In fact, she argued that some jurors 
might be less affected by the tape than they otherwise would have been because 
the shock of hearing it for the first time in court would no longer be there. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ito said he shared the concerns about the tapes' release, he deferred 
a ruling on the defense request for additional peremptory challenges. Ito said 
he would see whether each side exhausts the 20 peremptory challenges that they 
have been granted for the jury selection. If they do, he said he would return 
to the issue of the tapes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of Friday's session, defense attorneys were in the process of 
renewing their challenge to evidence seized from Simpson's Ford Bronco after 
the killings. Prosecutors have prevailed in previous defense efforts to 
challenge items taken from the car, but the latest effort revolves around a tow 
yard employee who testified Friday he took two vouchers or receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers argue that his improper entry into the car broke the chain 
of evidence required. They are asking that later tests performed on the vehicle 
be disallowed. Those tests revealed signs of blood that had previously gone 
undetected. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, prosecutors vainly attempted to fight back against a more serious 
challenge to their evidence. Ito indicated earlier this week that he is 
considering imposing a deadline on scientific tests performed on blood samples 
because prosecutors had delayed sending those samples to labs. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Clark asked Ito to consider a letter from the prosecution explaining 
the status of DNA tests before making that ruling. But an obviously irritated 
Ito said prosecutors had missed their chance to make that argument despite his 
efforts to alert them that they were in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 He refused Clark's request and said he hoped to have a ruling Monday on the 
deadline. If he were to set an Oct. 21 deadline sought by defense attorneys, 
prosecutors could be forced to go to trial without key pieces of scientific 
evidence. A later deadline would do less harm to the case, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection resumes Monday morning, when questioning will continue with the 
first panel of prospective jurors. So far, just nine of the 84 panelists who 
showed up for the first day of jury selection have been questioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has expressed impatience with the progress, but so far has been reluctant 
to interfere with the attorneys as they pose questions to the members of the 
panel.

SOLDIER DIES IN RESCUE EFFORT, CLOUDING ISRAELIS' JOY AT NOBEL; MIDEAST: THE 
KIDNAPED 19-YEAR-OLD IS KILLED BY HIS ISLAMIC MILITANT CAPTORS AS ISRAELI ARMY 
UNIT STORMS A WEST BANK HOUSE. SECOND SOLDIER, 3 PALESTINIANS ALSO DIE IN THE 
RAID.

<P>
 The Israeli soldier whose kidnaping by Islamic militants threatened to derail 
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process was killed Friday night in a firefight 
when Israeli soldiers stormed the West Bank house where he was held. 
</P>
<P>
 The disastrous climax to a hostage drama that has absorbed Israelis since 
Tuesday night overshadowed the nation's joy at the announcement Friday morning 
in Norway that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon 
Peres received this year's Nobel Peace Prize, along with Palestine Liberation 
Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hastily called late-night news conference Friday, a grim-faced Rabin told 
the nation that the soldier, 19-year-old Nachshon Waxman, was killed "in cold 
blood" by his captors during the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I, as minister of defense and prime minister, take full responsibility," 
Rabin said. "It is our obligation not to surrender to terrorism but to act 
against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat aide Marwan Kanafani said the PLO chairman was saddened by the loss of 
life. Kanafani said the PLO had been vindicated in its assertion that Waxman 
was not being held in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Israeli, an officer identified at the scene as Capt. Nir Poraz, was 
killed during the attack. Nine other Israelis were wounded and three 
Palestinians were killed, Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Ehud Barak said. Two 
Palestinians were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Barak said that Waxman, whose hands and feet were tied, was shot in the neck 
and chest by his captors shortly after the assault on the house in the village 
of Bir Nabala began. Bir Nabala lies just outside Jerusalem's northern 
municipal boundary, only two miles from the home of Waxman's parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The elite unit mounted the attack only 90 minutes before the 9 p.m. (11 a.m. 
PDT) deadline set by the militant group Hamas for killing Waxman if Israel 
refused to release Palestinian prisoners in its custody. The commandos were 
slowed by having to use explosives to force their way into the house, Barak 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside, they had to use explosives again to destroy the door to the room 
where Waxman was held, Barak said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could hear the terrorists in the room with Waxman shouting, 'The soldier 
is already dead,' " Barak said. "They shouted at the terrorists to surrender, 
but they said they preferred to die." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a stunning turn of events at the end of a day during which most 
Israelis anxiously awaited the Hamas deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the week, Israelis have listened to the tearful pleas of Waxman's 
mother, Esther, broadcast on Israel Army Radio and Israel Television, for the 
release of her son, who holds dual American-Israeli citizenship. The soldier's 
plight triggered a massive outpouring of support for the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of Israelis responded to a request from the family Thursday 
night and flocked to the Western Wall in Jerusalem's Old City -- a site holy to 
Jews as the only remnant of the Temple of Solomon, the destruction of which 
marked the start of the Diaspora -- to pray for Waxman's safe return. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds gathered outside the family home in a northern Jerusalem suburb 
Friday night as the deadline approached and then passed. 
</P>
<P>
 So caught up in the drama was most of the nation that Rabin violated religious 
prohibitions against working on the Sabbath in order to hold the press 
conference, broadcast live on Israel Television, and explain how Waxman died. 
</P>
<P>
 The somber turn of events was particularly confusing, because just three hours 
before the army acknowledged that Waxman died in the failed rescue attempt, a 
Hamas leader announced that the organization had negotiated with Israel a 
24-hour extension of its deadline for killing Waxman. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahmoud Zahar told Israel Television at 8 p.m. that "the deadline has been 
extended." 
</P>
<P>
 Zahar said that the militants holding Waxman, for whom he said he was acting 
as a mediator, had agreed to extend their deadline after Israel agreed to free 
Sheik Ahmed Yassin, Hamas' founder and spiritual leader, and 32 Palestinian 
women it is holding among about 4,000 Palestinian prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin confirmed that he had received the support of both his Cabinet and 
opposition parties for negotiating with Hamas. He used an Israeli Arab member 
of the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, as a go-between. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was hope, but Rabin killed the hope and the soldier," said the 
go-between, Talab Sanaa, after Waxman's death was announced. "There were 
chances to bring out the soldier alive." 
</P>
<P>
 The Izzidin al-Qassam military unit of Hamas, which claimed responsibility for 
abducting Waxman on Sunday, had said on Tuesday night that it would kill him 
Friday night unless Israel released Yassin and 200 other prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Zahar said an appeal broadcast by Israel Television on Thursday night from the 
jailed Yassin -- the second he had made -- to Waxman's captors, asking that 
they not harm the soldier, persuaded the kidnapers to modify their demands and 
extend the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin said Friday night that Hamas waited too long to make it clear to him 
that it was willing to extend the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "The policy of this government is conducted along two lines," Rabin said. "One 
is the efforts to achieve peace, and the other is an unrelenting war against 
terrorism." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin said that Israeli security forces learned only Friday morning that 
Waxman was being held in Bir Nabala, a village of about 7,000 people. Until 
Friday, Israel had insisted that he was being held in the Gaza Strip, in 
territory controlled by the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Izzidin al-Qassam unit first issued its demands in a videotape aired 
on Israel Television on Tuesday night, a furious Rabin on Wednesday ordered 
Gaza closed, banning about 30,000 workers from their daily commute into Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 He also suspended peace negotiations with the Palestinians that were under way 
in Cairo, and he told Arafat that Israel's future relations with the 
Palestinian Authority were at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Arafat ordered the biggest roundup of suspects since Israel 
handed him control over the daily lives of Palestinians in Gaza and the West 
Bank town of Jericho last May. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamas activists warned that Arafat was risking civil war by arresting as many 
as 200 supporters of the movement, which was founded in Gaza and enjoys 
widespread support there. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher backed Rabin's tough stance with the 
Palestinian Authority, lecturing Arafat in Alexandria, Egypt, on Friday morning 
that he must "do everything conceivable" to find Waxman. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian officials kept saying they had no proof Waxman was in Gaza, but 
Barak and other Israeli officials scornfully dismissed such demurrals 
throughout the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin offered no apologies to Arafat on Friday night, nor did he say when 
talks with the Palestinians will resume or when Gaza will be reopened. Israel 
is the primary source of employment for residents of Gaza, an impoverished and 
overcrowded strip of coastal land with little industry of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who carried out the kidnaping were given orders from Gaza," Rabin 
said at the press conference. "Their commander and the person giving them 
orders is in Gaza. Therefore I say: Recognizing the fact that it is true that 
Waxman was not held in Gaza, still these actions are being planned and directed 
from Gaza." 
</P>
<P>
 It is up to the Palestinian Authority, Rabin said, to "prevent turning the 
Gaza Strip into a base from which terrorist attacks are planned and initiated." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton issued a statement calling Friday's events a 
"dark moment." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the face of such cowardly and evil action, I know that it is hard to go 
forward," the President said. "But we owe it to all those who have paid such a 
heavy price to persist and finally prevail in our pursuit of peace." Peace 
Deferred 
</P>
<P>
 In a news conference after the raid, Israeli Prime Minster Yitzhak Rabin said, 
"I wish I could give up the Nobel Prize to get the two soldiers back." West 
Bank Raid 
</P>
<P>
 Cpl. Nachshon Waxman was killed in the village of Bir Nabala in the West Bank. 
The kidnaping has threatened to wreck the fragile Israel-PLO peace accord and 
trigger new violence in the region.

 Clint Reilly knows what needs to be done for his candidate, Democratic state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown, to win the race for governor. He says so right there 
in black and white, in the 11-page "campaign analysis" he printed up shortly 
after taking control of Brown's campaign last spring: 
</P>
<P>
 Win big in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Improve on Democrat Dianne Feinstein's 1990 gubernatorial victory in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Lose San Diego, San Bernardino, Riverside, Orange and Ventura counties, which 
Feinstein also lost, but "reduce the margin of defeat." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the furious battle for governor, campaign advisers for 
incumbent Republican Pete Wilson have made equally blunt calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 While it might seem odd to publicly predict defeats, the campaigns' analyses 
reflect the reality of California politics: Most regions vote so similarly 
election to election that pretty fair odds on the general outcome can be laid 
months in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than trying to win every county this November, the campaigns are moving 
on three fronts: seeking to secure counties that their parties traditionally 
win; tussling over a few areas that actually change hands, and engaging in a 
voter-by-voter struggle to lessen the margin of defeat in areas they know they 
will lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "What Clint will attempt to do is raise issues and attack us to whittle down 
the margins and we will attempt to do the same thing," said Joe Shumate, a 
Wilson campaign adviser who has studied the state's demography. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Wilson's campaign manager, George Gorton: "Everything is in the 
percentages." 
</P>
<P>
 Geography alone does not determine a candidate's destiny. Campaign managers 
know, for example, that they can strike different chords among men and women, 
liberals and conservatives, environmentalists and business people, even when 
they live in the same neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 That individual complexity is magnified by the state's sheer size. Unlike, 
say, New Hampshire, the length of which can be driven in a few hours, 
California is a massive compilation of more than a dozen media markets, its 
counties ranging from liberal San Francisco to conservative Orange, all further 
complicated by the presence of swing voters who change loyalties year to year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, geographic voting patterns have a certain consistency that allows 
strategists to determine almost everything about a race -- the message a 
candidate sends, the placement of television advertising (which is 
all-important in this media-dependent state) and a candidate's campaign events 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no accident, for instance, that the first ads touting Brown's vow to 
enforce the death penalty did not run in San Francisco, the most liberal county 
in the state. Instead, ads detailing her support for public education -- a far 
less polarizing issue -- were substituted. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also no accident that 45% of Brown's time since the June primary has 
been spent in the Los Angeles media market, which includes Los Angeles, Orange, 
Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties. Voters in the market cast 44% 
of all votes in November, 1992, according to a survey by the Los Angeles Times 
Poll. Mighty Los Angeles County accounted for 25% of votes cast in 1992, making 
it a required asset for any winning candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1990, Wilson won (the governorship) by 266,000 votes," said Brown 
spokesman John Whitehurst. "He won the L.A. media market by more than 300,000 
votes. One could argue that in the determination of this election, the Los 
Angeles media market will be very significant." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's gubernatorial team is engaged in an unprecedented effort to run 
regionalized campaigns, emphasizing quite different issues, in several key 
areas of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're actually trying to run five to six campaigns at one time," said Reilly. 
</P>
<P>
 It is with good reason that Democrats are attempting to come up with a new way 
to run statewide campaigns. Except for 1992, the party's successes in recent 
years have been meager. From 1980 until 1992, the only Democrat to win a 
top-of-the-ticket statewide race was U.S. Senate veteran Alan Cranston, who 
retired in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite consistent Democrat leads in statewide voter registration, only two 
counties have voted Democratic in all of the three most recent governor's 
races: San Francisco and Alameda. 
</P>
<P>
 Even ignoring one of the three, the disastrous 1986 race in which George 
Deukmejian won every county but those two in defeating Los Angeles Mayor Tom 
Bradley, the predictable Democratic turf is narrow indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides San Francisco and Alameda, only six of the state's 58 counties have 
consistently voted Democratic at the top of a statewide ticket for governor or 
senator: the Northern California suburban counties of Marin, Mendocino, San 
Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz and Yolo. Sonoma has voted Democratic since 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Los Angeles County, which is tailor-made for Democrats, broke with its 
traditional leanings to vote for Republicans Deukmejian in 1986 and Wilson in 
the 1988 Senate race. All told, Democrats have had their best successes along 
the narrow coastline and Republicans have controlled everything else for more 
than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a pretty sight," grimaced Reilly about the Democratic map. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, the 1992 results shocked even Democrats. Not only did Bill 
Clinton and Al Gore become the first Democratic presidential team to win 
California in 28 years, but Democrats captured both Senate seats with victories 
by Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 Geographically, Democrats surged inland, after having seized only small slices 
of the coast for nearly a generation. Clinton and Feinstein in particular 
grabbed territory that had been dominated by Republicans for years. 
</P>
<P>
 While still limited to the western side of the state, where Democrats have 
been more popular over the years, Boxer won 19 counties. Feinstein controlled 
36 counties -- 20 more than she had won two years before in the governor's 
race, including all of north-central California from San Francisco to the 
Nevada border. And Clinton won 37 counties, including the usual Republican 
stalwarts of Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The question of 1994: Was 1992 a fluke? 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats are nervous about predicting that such advances are permanent, but 
the state party's campaign adviser, Bob Mulholland, argues that California is 
at least becoming friendlier to Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prior to the end of the Cold War, the Republicans had a lock on this state," 
he said. "All because we were seen as weak on communism and Republicans as 
strong. . . . The hold the Republicans had, like Russia on Eastern Europe, is 
ending." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mulholland acknowledges that Republicans were at a severe disadvantage in 
1992: President George Bush conceded California months before the election, 
leaving the state without a competitive candidacy at the top of the ticket and 
without a complementary get-out-the-vote effort. Independent Ross Perot 
siphoned off more Republican votes, to Clinton's advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the Senate races, the well-known Feinstein was up against 
little-known Republican John Seymour, who had been appointed to the Senate less 
than two years earlier. Boxer won the second seat with a far narrower victory 
over Republican Bruce Herschensohn. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Feinstein succeeded at least in part because they campaigned as 
moderates, appealing to members of their own party but also to independents and 
liberal Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 So-called swing voters, such as those attracted to Clinton and Feinstein, tend 
to inhabit the middle regions of the political spectrum. That is why successful 
politicians in politically split states such as California most often tread 
moderate ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy can pay off even in the most polarized counties. In San 
Francisco, a significant percentage of voters cross party lines election to 
election. A Republican who wins 40% of the vote there has pulled off the 
equivalent of a landslide victory, even if it technically spells defeat, 
because it represents the maximum number of Republican votes plus swing voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "No Republican is going to get more than 40% in the Bay Area unless the 
Democrat is a complete boob, and no Republican gets less than 32% unless he's a 
complete boob," said Wilson manager Gorton. "So you're looking at an 8% swing." 
</P>
<P>
 For Democrats, getting just a third of the vote in Orange County is, 
similarly, a cause for exultation, because it signals the maximum possible 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the efforts of Democrat Brown to establish a moderate profile to 
appeal to those voters, many demographers say recent polling suggests that 
voters are returning to pre-1992, GOP-leaning patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent demographer Bruce Cain, associate director of UC Berkeley's 
Institute of Governmental Studies, said that while some electoral changes are 
afoot, there has as yet been no wholesale adjustment in voter attitudes that 
could maintain Democratic primacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be very hard to recreate the Clinton victory without a third 
party in there," Cain said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's campaign is not taking the 1992 results for granted. Its strategy is 
built not on those successes but on the Democratic near-miss in the 1990 
governor's race. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign manager Reilly is convinced that the state is on the cusp of partisan 
change. He contends that the Clinton, Feinstein and Boxer victories in 1992 
were nourished by voters worried about the domestic economy and ready to blame 
Republicans for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The same set of circumstances will recur this year as Californians blame 
incumbent Wilson for the state's economic difficulties, Reilly argues. (The 
latest Los Angeles Times Poll indicated that theory is a tough sell right now, 
since Californians trust Wilson more than Brown with handling the rocky 
economy.) 
</P>
<P>
 In brief, Reilly believes that to win, Brown will have to carry the Bay Area, 
Sacramento and its suburbs and Los Angeles County. He believes she can lose 
everywhere else, but she must hold down the size of the defeat. His goals in 
some counties may seem marginal -- winning 35% in Orange, for example, compared 
to Feinstein's 31% showing in 1990 and 42% in San Diego compared to Feinstein's 
36% -- but they add up to hundreds of thousands of votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly sees Wilson as vulnerable in the most important emerging areas of the 
state, the Inland Empire and, to the north, greater Sacramento and the suburbs 
at the northern edge of the Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Both areas have traditionally voted Republican. But demographers believe 
voters there are particularly blase about party loyalty and receptive to 
promises to improve their lot in life from either conservative Democrats or 
moderate Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 What the areas have in common are increasing numbers of commuters who live in 
new developments far from their jobs, and who do not necessarily share the 
traditional political views of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "As they sit on the freeway commuting two to three hours a day and living in 
something less than the middle-class opulence that they had as kids, there is a 
disconnect that either party can tap," said UC Berkeley's Cain. 
</P>
<P>
 In its regional emphasis, Brown's campaign differs sharply from past efforts 
by either Democrats or Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, a campaign will run one -- or at most two -- ads statewide at a time. 
At one point recently, Brown was running five commercials in different media 
markets. She was hitting the state budget deficit and government mismanagement 
in Sacramento, Wilson's parole policies in Fresno and the Sierras, education in 
the Bay Area, and jobs in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Her campaign spokesman Whitehurst said Brown plans to run ads in at least five 
media markets that focus on narrow regional issues. So far, Los Angeles and San 
Diego voters have seen separate ads that blame Wilson for those areas' economic 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are purposely mixing it up and not being consistent," Whitehurst said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson campaign's approach is far different, somewhat akin to testing 
spaghetti against a wall: They throw what they have and see how well it sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reilly looks at it precinct by precinct," said Wilson spokesman Dan Schnur. 
"We look at it a lot more holistically. An issue might move (voters) 
differently in San Diego than in San Francisco. But the 40% of the vote you 
could get in San Francisco needs to hear it as much as the 60% in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign manager Gorton airily dismisses Reilly's charts and graphs of 
geographic voter preferences, despite the Wilson team's own recent decision to 
run slightly different ads in San Diego and Los Angeles counties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clint does that because he's never won a statewide race before," said Gorton, 
ignoring Reilly's two statewide victories as campaign manager for former state 
schools superintendent Bill Honig. "That's a great approach if you're running a 
state Legislature race."  
</P>
<P>
 Gorton does, however, have a track record to back up his holistic approach, 
since he has helped lead Wilson to one gubernatorial and two Senate victories. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that Wilson's potential supporters in the more liberal Bay Area 
"respond to similar themes" as do his partisans in conservative Orange County, 
although the pool of susceptible voters is smaller, percentage-wise, in the 
north than in the south. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suburban southern counties of Orange, San Bernardino, Ventura and 
Riverside, he said, Wilson could roll up 60% of the vote -- a margin that, if 
realized, would essentially deny Brown the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than the Bay Area, Gorton refuses to concede much territory to Brown. He 
even suggests that Wilson has a shot at winning Los Angeles County, as he did 
in his 1988 U.S. Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can win L.A. County, and we would like to," he said. "We can certainly run 
up the score in the surrounding . . . counties." 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on mammoth Los Angeles and other geographically important 
counties can have its downside because, by extension, it takes for granted the 
state's less populated areas. Political demographer Shumate cautions that the 
old saying still holds: Every vote counts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990 race for state attorney general, he recalled, Republican Dan 
Lungren beat Democrat Arlo Smith by fewer than 30,000 votes out of almost 7.3 
million cast. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can tell me the candidate will win the election by a million votes, I 
can tell you a whole slew of places that don't matter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a close election, every vote in every place counts." The Political 
Geography of California 
</P>
<P>
 California's political geography is not a comfortable sight for Democrats. 
More counties have gone Republican in recent years than Democratic. To chart a 
political map of the state, Times Poll Director John Brennan analyzed six races 
for U.S. Senate and governor from 1986 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Democractic Stronghold: Democrats can count on winning these North Coast 
counties, but only a walloping margin, at least 18 percentage overall, is 
indicative of enough strength for statewide victory. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP Strongholds: Republicans can count on winning these counties, but they 
need to rack up substantial margins to contribute to statewide victory. 
Republicans need to win in Orange County by at least 30 percentage points. In 
more moderately Republican areas, such as Ventura, San Bernardino, Riverside 
and San Diego counties, Republicans need at least 19-point margins, in years 
that they won statewide offices. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP-Leaning Swing Counties: The counties can be won by either party, but lean 
toward Republicans -- Democrats average between 40% and 50% of the vote in the 
swing counties of central California and the Sierras. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento County: If there is a bellwether county in California, it may well 
be Sacramento, which has sided with the winner in every election for governor 
and U.S. Senate since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County: Los Angeles County, with a quarter of the state's voters, 
tends to be Democratic but is crucial for both parties. Republicans who win Los 
Angeles win the state; Democrats generally have to win by a margin of at least 
11 points for statewide victory.

THE TIMES POLL; ANTI-ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION PROP. 187 KEEPS 2-TO-1 EDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With California voters increasingly convinced that illegal immigration is one 
of the major problems facing the state, Proposition 187, the emotionally 
divisive anti-illegal immigration initiative, continues to hold a strong lead 
in the Los Angeles Times Poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a month before the election, the get-tough measure is favored by a 
margin of 59% to 33% among likely voters -- a 26-point margin. Among all 
registered voters, the split is 61% to 32%. 
</P>
<P>
 The margin was 33 points among likely voters in mid-September, when the Times 
Poll reported a 62% to 29% lead. Registered voters were split by a similar 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
 With the campaign heating up, interest in Proposition 187 is now as high as it 
is for the governor's race between Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown and 
Republican incumbent Pete Wilson, whose opposition to illegal immigration is a 
hallmark of his reelection bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, nearly twice as many registered voters said Proposition 187 would 
motivate them to cast ballots as would the U.S. Senate race between Democratic 
incumbent Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Republican Rep. Mike Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the efforts of a wide-scale coalition of mainstream education, health 
and law enforcement organizations to defeat the measure, Proposition 187 
continues to win majority support among Democrats as well as Republicans, and 
voters of both sexes and all age groups and income levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some of the staunchest opposition to the measure has come from 
Cardinal Roger M. Mahony and organized labor leaders, poll results suggest that 
they have had limited influence. The initiative is favored 56% to 37% among 
Catholic voters and 55% to 34% among union members. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll found that arguments against the measure seemed to have little 
impact on voter attitudes. Support for Proposition 187 remained steady after 
three pro and three con arguments were read to poll respondents. If anything, 
pro-187 arguments appeared to sway voters more than such anti-187 arguments as 
the possibility of a public health hazard because illegal immigrants would be 
denied immunizations against communicable diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people have made up their minds," said Assistant Times Poll Director 
Susan Pinkus. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinkus cautioned that about one-third of voters remain unfamiliar with the 
details of Proposition 187 -- which would terminate most government services to 
illegal immigrants and require local health, education and law enforcement 
officials to turn in the names of suspected illegal immigrants to federal 
authorities. Among likely voters who were familiar with Proposition 187, the 
margin of support is 45% to 25%.

<P>
 A second high-profile, send-a-message measure, the "three strikes" crime 
initiative, also continues to draw strong support in the Times Poll. 
Proposition 184, which calls for prison terms of 25 years to life for 
third-time felony offenders, is favored by a 58%-32% margin among likely 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 But Proposition 186, which calls for a state-run health system, has failed to 
find a constituency. More than 50% of likely voters are unfamiliar with the 
single-payer health initiative when just read the ballot label. When they were 
read a synopsis, the split against it was 64% to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest race among the major November initiatives involves Proposition 
188, the tobacco industry-backed measure to establish statewide regulations on 
smoking restrictions. Half of likely voters said they were familiar with the 
measure and those voters split 3 to 2 against Proposition 188. 
</P>
<P>
 After being read an explanation summarized from the ballot pamphlet mailed to 
all California voters, likely voters favored it by a 49% to 43% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The summary read to poll respondents, like the title and summary in the 
state's ballot pamphlet, does not make clear that one of the prime backers of 
the initiative is tobacco giant Philip Morris. Political analysts believe that 
voters would be more likely to reject the measure, which would repeal local 
no-smoking laws, if they knew of its backing from the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll, conducted by telephone Oct. 8 through Tuesday, questioned 
1,232 registered voters, 821 of whom are considered to be likely to vote Nov. 
8. The poll's margin of sampling error for registered voters is 3 percentage 
points in either direction. For likely voters it is 4 points in either 
direction. Margins of error for smaller subgroups of voters may be larger. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll's results make clear that illegal immigration, which has begun 
receiving widespread attention in news stories, editorials and in TV ads 
touting Wilson's reelection bid, is a hot topic among Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Among all registered voters, more people cited illegal immigration than either 
education or the economy as the state's most pressing issue. Only crime and 
unemployment ranked higher. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Times Poll last month, crime also was cited as the state's most important 
problem. But unemployment, the economy, education and immigration were all 
clustered together far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, only 6% of voters in The Times Poll said Proposition 187 would 
particularly motivate them to cast ballots -- compared to 19% for the 
governor's race. In the new poll, the ballot measure and the governor's race 
each were cited by 19% of registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 19% motivated to vote by Proposition 187, 58% favor the initiative 
and 40% oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
 Support for Proposition 187 is particularly strong among Republican voters -- 
75% to 19% -- andwhite voters -- 64% to 28%. But the measure also continues to 
lead among Democrats -- 52% to 40% -- and independents -- 57% to 34%. 
</P>
<P>
 The only two major blocs of registered voters not favoring Proposition 187 are 
liberal Democrats, opposed by a 51%-44% margin, and Latinos, who opposed it by 
a small margin (48% to 46%). Last month, registered Latinos favored the measure 
by a 52%-42% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent interviews, leading opponents of Proposition 187 have said they are 
convinced they can still turn public opinion around if they can raise enough 
money to mount a significant statewide advertising campaign. Earlier this week, 
an anti-Proposition 187 coalition that includes the state PTA, school boards 
association and teachers association, began running its first radio spot 
attacking the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 However, The Times Poll, seeking to gauge the influence of various pro and con 
arguments, found no significant shift in support after six arguments were read 
to poll respondents. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the arguments were read, likely voters favored the measure 59% to 33%. 
After the arguments were read, the margin was 60% to 32%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The arguments made no impact," Pinkus said. "They reinforced people voting 
for Proposition 187." 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest argument in favor of the measure was one stating it would save 
the state millions of dollars a year by stopping illegal immigrants from 
getting health, education and child welfare benefits. Nearly 60% of likely 
voters said that argument would make them more likely to vote for Proposition 
187. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, an argument that the initiative might cost California billions of 
dollars in federal aid since some of its provisions violate federal law 
resulted in only 26% of likely voters saying they were less likely to vote for 
the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro-187 arguments that illegal immigration is hurting California and that the 
initiative would require law enforcement agencies to check the immigrant status 
of those arrested for crimes each led more than 50% of poll respondents to say 
they were more likely to vote for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Anti-187 arguments that the measure could cause a public health hazard and an 
increase in juvenile crime if hundreds of thousands of children are ejected 
from public schools led far fewer voters -- roughly one-third in each case -- 
to say they were less likely to cast ballots for the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize we're talking about kids and I have grandkids and great-grandkids 
myself," said poll respondent Albert Brower, 80, of Sacramento. "But I'm 
against a wide-open door to the welfare business in our state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pretty much have got my mind made up," said Brower, a Baptist minister and 
a registered Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 A Catholic Toluca Lake resident said he favors Proposition 187 regardless of 
the position of Mahony and many personal friends. "Anyone in this country 
illegally should get nothing," said the 43-year-old travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some poll respondents who favor Proposition 187 said they are 
open-minded. 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids losing almost all of their school programs because the state of 
California has no money is a big swayer for me," said Marilyn Bailey, 39, a 
printer from Visalia. "But one thing I hadn't heard about before was the lack 
of immunizations for illegals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may change my mind," said Bailey, a Democrat. "My goodness, I don't want 
new babies to go without shots." THE TIMES POLL

 How They Would Vote 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-illegal immigration initiative, Proposition 187, continues to hold a

 Source: Los Angeles Times Poll of California voters How the Poll Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,641 adults statewide, by telephone, Oct. 8-11. 
Included in the sample are 1,232 registered voters and 821 likely voters. 
Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the state. 
Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed and unlisted numbers 
could be contacted. The sample was weighted slightly to conform more closely 
with census figures for sex, race, age and education. Interviewing was 
conducted in English and Spanish. The margin of sampling error for the total 
sample and the sample of all registered voters is plus or minus 3 percentage 
points; for likely voters it is 4 points. For certain subgroups the error 
margin may be somewhat higher. Poll results can also be affected by other 
factors such as question wording and the order in which questions are 
presented.

MILITARY; EX-ANC TROOPS STAGE MUTINY TO PROTEST NEW S. AFRICA ARMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 President Nelson Mandela, commander in chief of the new army of South Africa, 
clearly was angry. "Discipline in the armed forces cannot break down," he 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
 The object of his ire? The men and women who fought in his name in the ragtag 
guerrilla forces that helped bring down apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 7,000 members of the now-disbanded army of the African National 
Congress went absent without leave Oct. 5 from military assembly areas where 
they are being assimilated into the new National Defense Force. Only about half 
have returned so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The discontent is not new. In recent weeks, angry former guerrillas have 
marched on Mandela's office and provincial legislatures, booed officers and 
stoned their cars. They have been tear-gassed in a mess hall riot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest development -- which appears something between a labor action 
and open mutiny -- has undermined the newfound legitimacy of the strongest army 
in sub-Saharan Africa as it adjusts to the end of white rule. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for the revolt are simple. Disgruntled former guerrillas complain 
that they are not given equal housing, pay, ranking or respect with the mostly 
white soldiers and officers who helped prop up apartheid and who fought a 
brutal campaign of "total onslaught" against black liberation forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-apartheid forces never won any military battles. Indeed, poorly 
trained and based in exile, their tactics never went beyond isolated terrorist 
attacks and sabotage. Their significance was largely symbolic in the bitter 
struggle against a far stronger foe. 
</P>
<P>
 But apartheid fell, and those creating the new government last year promised 
all combatants an equal role in a new armed forces under central command. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans were announced to integrate 21,000 members of the ANC's Umkhonto we 
Sizwe (Spear of the Nation) and 6,000 members of the Pan Africanist Congress' 
army with the 90,000-member old South African Defense Force over the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 How to merge deeply disparate, suspicious military forces and cultures is the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a normal recruiting process," said Bill Sass, a retired brigadier 
now with the independent Institute for Defense Policy. "One problem is the 
guerrilla army doesn't have ranks the way a normal army does. They had team 
leaders, commanders and political commissars. How do you translate that to 
lance corporals and sergeants?" 
</P>
<P>
 The former cadres complain that the merging process is too slow, their 
military training abroad is scorned and they are given lower ranks and salaries 
because of insufficient education. They charge they are simply being "absorbed" 
by the old South African army, rather than joining to form a new defense force. 
Some complain that their assignments are too far from home. 
</P>
<P>
 Some are also angry about a reported pledge by ANC leaders last year to pay 
them about $3,000 each for their service outside the country. The ANC now says 
it does not have the money, and the military has declined to pick up the tab. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who claim that we are impatient and ill-disciplined do not appreciate 
the psychological trauma of this integration process and the inhuman welfare 
that we are subjected to," the rebel group said in a letter to ANC leaders in 
seven provinces last week.  
</P>
<P>
 The dissatisfied soldiers have refused to obey orders from Defense Minister 
Joe Modise, former chief of Umkhonto we Sizwe, or other military leaders. They 
insist on personal intervention by Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 The president first promised to respond after several hundred former cadres 
marched for six hours to his Pretoria office Sept. 9 to demand a meeting. His 
statements this week, after urgent meetings with top military brass, marked a 
harsher approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Col. Connie van Rensburg, a spokesman at the Wahlmansthal base where most of 
the new troops had been assembling, said the situation has created morale 
problems for soldiers in the old South African army. "We just call this plain 
mutiny," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But government officials and others remain wary of cracking down too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our society cannot afford the lawlessness that may arise from disgruntled 
soldiers roaming our streets," warned an editorial in the Sowetan, the 
country's largest black paper. "Mandela must fix the problem once and for all."

POLITICS; MAJOR SEEKS SALVE TO BIND UP TORIES' WOUNDS; BRITISH PRIME MINISTER 
CALLS FOR PATIENCE AT PARTY'S ANNUAL CONFERENCE. BUT FRACTIOUS ELEMENTS 
HIGHLIGHT RIFTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister John Major, at the Tories' annual, weeklong conference, has 
painstakingly sought to bind up the wounds of his Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
 To a party accused of drift, incompetence and even sleaze -- and under 
pressure from its right wing -- Major called for "patience and realism . . . in 
a world of bewildering change." 
</P>
<P>
 "The party must stand for continuity and stability," he said in a low-key, 
reassuring speech at the seaside resort of Bournemouth. 
</P>
<P>
 With pledges to improve health, education and the economy, Major on Friday 
attempted to stake out the center ground where Tories have fought and won the 
last four national elections. 
</P>
<P>
 His party needs his ministrations: It has been bleeding badly after 15 years 
in office -- and many of its wounds have been self-inflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 During this week of speeches, for instance, many Tories seemed to go out of 
their way to raise embarrassing issues, particularly the long-running argument 
over how close Britain's ties should be to the European Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, Michael Portillo, a Cabinet minister and the party's 
leading right-winger, warned of the dangers of getting too close to Europe. 
Portillo, 41, was rewarded with the conference's most enthusiastic response, a 
reception once reserved for that conservative icon, former Prime Minister 
Margaret Thatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Portillo's performance overshadowed those of party moderates such as Trade 
Secretary Michael Heseltine, a former conference darling, and Foreign Secretary 
Douglas Hurd. They both insisted that Britain should be "at the heart of 
Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tory sessions came on the heels of a glitzy Labor Party conference last 
week -- at which Tony Blair, the most appealing Labor leader in 20 years, 
sought successfully to weld together the center and left wings of his party. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor's apparently successful conference week left them far ahead of 
Conservatives in public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
 This left the stage set for a week of Tory reconciliation and healing. 
Instead, the fractious elements of the party rose up. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference received a shock on the first day with the appearance of 
Thatcher, who looked pale and drawn. She ignored media questions about the 
ethics of her son Mark Thatcher, accused by Labor members of Parliament of 
having made more than $18 million in commissions on an arms deal between 
Britain and Saudi Arabia. Thatcher was not scheduled to speak and left after 
her brief appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the week, Norman Lamont, the former chancellor of the exchequer, made 
a bitterly anti-European speech, which seemed to tap deep sentiments in the 
party's right wing. Then Portillo and other ultraconservatives called for a 
sharp differentiation between Tory and Labor policies -- the establishment of 
"clear blue water" between the parties. 
</P>
<P>
 But this seemed to draw the party to the right, rather than the center, where 
the most votes are. And that prompted Kenneth Clarke, a centrist and chancellor 
of the exchequer, to assert that Portillo and his allies were using, in their 
"blue water" reference, "an almost meaningless cliche." 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea that the party starts marching off to the right wing because Tony 
Blair is muscling in on it," Clarke said, "is slightly laughable." 
</P>
<P>
 Geoffrey Howe, a former foreign secretary and now a member of the House of 
Lords, also objected, declaring that "establishing as much 'clear blue water' 
as possible between ourselves and Labor is the Pavlovian response of a party on 
a suicide mission." He warned that the Tories face a decade out of power and in 
opposition if they "lurch to the right." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the ideological slugfest, the Tory conference was marred by newspaper 
photographs of drunken party-goers at the Young Conservatives' Ball -- a 
session at which speakers more than once assailed the antics of the 
drinking-class "yob culture." 
</P>
<P>
 But Major wound up the overall conference, co-opting the center, declaring of 
the right's demand for radical, conservative reforms: "Change for the sake of 
change should never appeal to any Conservative." He asserted that Labor, under 
Blair, was merely adopting Tory policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his speech, Conservatives hardly presented a picture of unity in 
confronting the serious challenge of revived Labor. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were solaces for Major, however, one would be that his authority over 
the party was no longer questioned, as it was last year. Further, the 
cease-fire in Northern Ireland is seen by many as directly attributable to his 
long, hard efforts to find a solution to the 25 years of violence in the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
 Major can also take heart that he does not have to call an election until 
spring, 1997 -- giving the economy a chance to recover and allowing renewed 
hopes for the now-flagging Conservatives.

PROBE OF CISNEROS PAYMENTS TO FORMER MISTRESS STARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Janet Reno on Friday opened a "preliminary inquiry" into whether 
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry G. Cisneros misled the FBI about 
the amounts and timing of payments he made to a former mistress, who now is 
suing him for breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Cono R. Namorato, Cisneros' attorney, announced the step, which gives the 
government 90 days to investigate and decide whether to seek appointment of an 
independent counsel to pursue a full investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Namorato attempted to minimize the significance of Reno's action by noting 
that, under the law, the government is required to move to a preliminary 
inquiry if it found during its initial 30-day examination that accusations 
against a high-ranking official specifically alleged a violation of federal law 
and come from a credible source. 
</P>
<P>
 "We remain confident that, after the department completes its preliminary 
investigation, it will conclude that the appointment of an independent counsel 
is unnecessary," said Namorato, a former Justice Department tax prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros, in Oakland on Friday for a community development symposium, said in 
a statement issued by Namorato: "While I had hoped that this matter would end 
during the first stage of the inquiry, given the limited scope of that stage I 
understand why it has moved into the next phase. I have made mistakes in my 
personal life but I have always adhered to the law." 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI is examining whether Cisneros misled its agents during questioning 
before his Senate confirmation when asked how much he had paid the former 
mistress, Linda Medlar, and how long the payments continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue now is not whether assistance was provided to Ms. Medlar, the 
propriety of such assistance, or the secretary's disclosures about those 
matters," Namorato said. "The focus of the investigation appears to be the 
details of the timing and amounts of the assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 The three-month span of the inquiry, which can be extended two months, 
virtually assures that it will not be resolved before congressional elections 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House Friday gave full support to Cisneros in his decision to remain 
on the job. Cisneros, who is scheduled to be questioned Monday in Dallas by 
Medlar's attorney in the civil suit she has brought, said that he has not 
allowed "this matter to distract me from my duties at HUD, and, in the coming 
days, my lawyers will deal with this matter while I continue to focus on the 
housing problems of our nation's communities." 
</P>
<P>
 White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta said that the decision to move to 
the preliminary inquiry represents "no conclusion. So obviously, we'll await 
the results of this 90-day investigation by the Justice Department. Until then, 
obviously we continue to have great confidence in him and the way he has 
performed his job." 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros becomes the second Clinton Administration Cabinet officer to face 
possible scrutiny by an outside prosecutor. On Oct. 3, Mike Espy announced that 
he would step down as secretary of agriculture in the midst of an independent 
counsel's examination of whether he broke the law by accepting gifts and 
services from companies regulated by his department. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cisneros inquiry is based on 40 hours of tapes that Medlar secretly made 
of conversations she had with him in which he allegedly expressed concern over 
FBI agents' efforts to determine how much he had paid her. 
</P>
<P>
 A non-governmental source familiar with the case said there is a potential 
conflict over whether Cisneros told the FBI that he paid Medlar about $60,000 
in all or whether he was paying that much annually. In a Sept. 12 interview on 
the tabloid television show "Inside Edition," Medlar charged that Cisneros had 
"lied" to the FBI about the payments. 
</P>
<P>
 On the basis of the preliminary inquiry, Reno must decide "whether reasonable 
grounds exist to warrant further investigation" by an independent counsel 
appointed by a special court. 
</P>
<P>
 In her suit against Cisneros, filed in July in Lubbock, Tex., Medlar contends 
that he failed to fulfill a verbal contract to pay her $4,000 a month until her 
teen-age daughter graduates from college in 1999. Alleging that the payments 
began in 1990 and were cut off last January, Medlar is seeking $256,000, plus 
lawyers' fees and an unspecified amount of punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Secretary Cisneros was forthright at every stage of the vetting and 
background process about this difficult personal matter," Namorato said in his 
statement.

BRITISH PAIR GIVEN 28 MONTHS FOR BUYING BABY IN ROMANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A British couple were in shock after they were sentenced Friday to two years 
and four months in jail by a Bucharest court for buying a baby and trying to 
smuggle her out of Romania in a box. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not too good. They are in a state of shock," defense lawyer Ioana 
Floca said after consulting her clients, Bernadette and Adrian Mooney. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple are the first foreigners prosecuted under tough new Romanian 
adoption laws aimed at stopping a wave of baby trafficking since the 1989 
collapse of communism shed light on gruesome orphanages packed with thousands 
of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Floca has lodged an appeal but has yet to get the written judgment explaining 
the harsher-than-expected sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Mooneys could have gotten five years, they hoped for a suspended 
sentence. They remain free on bail pending the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are out and they will stay out," Floca said. "They are waiting for the 
appeal because they are very confident that the appeal judges will see that 
they are not so guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mooneys were arrested at the Hungarian border July 6 with a 5-month-old 
Gypsy baby, Monica, hidden in their car. 
</P>
<P>
 They are in Bucharest with their 3-year-old daughter Grace, legally adopted 
from Romania in 1991. Ruled too old to adopt -- she is 40, he 42 -- the Mooneys 
took another route, paying a middleman $6,000 to find them a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica's teen-age parents say they got $500 for the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Romanian men convicted of arranging the sale were sentenced to two years 
and eight months in jail. Monica's unmarried 17-year-old parents did not appear 
and were ordered to serve a year in jail when they turn 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica is in a Bucharest orphanage with 400 other children. They are among the 
80,000 Romanian children in so-called cradles across the country. A handful are 
genuine orphans. Most have been abandoned or deposited indefinitely by parents 
who may come back and get them when their family or money worries end.

ITALIANS TURN OUT AGAINST BERLUSCONI'S POLICIES; EUROPE: MILLIONS OF WORKERS 
STRIKE TO PROTEST CUTS IN SOCIAL BENEFITS. RALLIES ARE SOME OF THE LARGEST 
SINCE THE 1970S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a heady spring of renewal, political rookie Silvio Berlusconi came to power 
promising Italy a million jobs and no new taxes. Now, in a restless and noisy 
autumn six months later, Berlusconi is the butt of economic disarray and social 
discontent among some of the same Italians who cheered him to office. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, millions of workers struck in massive protest against their 
billionaire prime minister's quest to balance the books of a country accustomed 
to living beyond its means. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi himself was far from the madding crowds Friday -- in Moscow on a 
trade mission -- but it seemed as if everybody else was in the streets of 
Italy. Huge rallies in sunlit piazzas up and down the peninsula were some of 
the largest since the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Called by the country's three largest unions, the strike protested 
Berlusconi's first budget, an adventure in austerity aimed at lopping a third 
off a swollen government deficit of about $100 billion. Planned pension pruning 
is what outrages Italians most. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor leaders claimed more than 3 million marchers in the dozen largest 
cities. Police saw about two-thirds that number in protests that were sometimes 
angry but everywhere peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrators marched in bright sunshine behind drums, trumpets, whistles, 
flags, banners and catcalls in more than 30 cities, jamming landmarks such as 
Piazza Santa Croce in Florence, Piazza del Duomo in Milan and Piazza San 
Giovanni in Laterano in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike was nationwide and nominally for four hours, but many workers 
stayed away all day. Rail and air service was chaotic, with disruptions and 
cancellations even after their sector strikes ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Private shops and businesses were open, but schools, banks, government offices 
and many factories closed. Buses stopped in nearly every city, and there were 
walkouts by hospital workers, immigration and customs officials and traffic 
police. "Berlusconi Out" was a favorite placard in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest march, more than 200,000 strong, was in Milan, Italy's industrial 
heart and Berlusconi's hometown. Among the strikers there were workers from 
companies in his Fininvest empire, which had revenue of about $7 billion last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government says it hasn't touched people's rights, and it's true -- it's 
simply canceled them," said union leader Pietro Larizza in Milan. He termed the 
protest "a gigantic vote of no confidence in the budget." 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow for talks with President Boris N. Yeltsin, Berlusconi did not seem 
impressed by the protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't change the numbers, not with one strike, or with 10 strikes. The 
numbers are there. I found them; I didn't produce them," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 At the head of a right-wing, free-market coalition, Berlusconi is seeking 
parliamentary approval for a budget that would cut about $33 billion from 
Italy's chronic deficit, reducing it to below 8.5% of GNP in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the cuts would come from social programs that were sacred cows of 
previous governments led by political parties that have since collapsed in 
corruption scandals. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlusconi seeks reductions in spending on schools, defense, scientific 
research and health care, but the lion's share of the cuts are aimed at one of 
Europe's most generous -- and corrupt -- pension systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a third of Italians draw pensions. Women can retire at 56 and men at 
61, but in some cases pensions are available at as much as 80% of final salary 
after as little as 15 years' work. 
</P>
<P>
 In southern Italy particularly, tens of thousands of able-bodied citizens with 
political friends live off disability pensions. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is seeking to freeze early retirements and cut benefits as part 
of an austerity needed to reduce a government debt equal to 123% of last year's 
GNP. Economists applaud the austerity as a necessary tonic after years of 
overspending.

RUSSIAN BANK CHIEF TENDERS RESIGNATION; ECONOMICS: VIKTOR S. GERASHCHENKO IS 
BLAMED FOR RUBLE'S ROLLER-COASTER RIDE. HARD-LINERS IN PARLIAMENT MAY NOT LET 
HIM QUIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian Central Bank Chairman Viktor S. Gerashchenko, once branded "the 
world's worst central banker," offered his resignation Friday after a week of 
pandemonium in the Russian currency market. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavyset, jovial 57-year-old banker made the offer after a meeting with 
President Boris N. Yeltsin, who had asked Parliament to fire Gerashchenko 
earlier this week when the Russian ruble plunged nearly 25% in a single day. 
Less than 24 hours before the encounter, Gerashchenko had told the Parliament 
that he would not quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope the news (of the resignation) sticks, because this man has been a 
remarkable survivor despite three years of miserable, miserable economic 
policy," said Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, a former economic adviser to 
Russia and author of the "worst central banker" label. 
</P>
<P>
 "His actions for four years, not just as head of the Russian Central Bank but 
earlier as head of the (Soviet) State Bank, did more to undermine public 
confidence in the currency than anything else," Sachs said in a telephone 
interview Friday. "His untrustworthiness had become apparent to everyone 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerashchenko may not be gone yet, however. Only the Parliament can dismiss the 
Central Bank governor and appoint a replacement, and hard-line lawmakers said 
they will not accept the resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the last person left in power whom the majority of the Duma can fully 
trust," nationalist lawmaker Sergei N. Baburin said. "The rest in the 
government have already stolen so much, and so openly." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian reformers are pushing former liberal Finance Minister Boris G. 
Fyodorov as Gerashchenko's replacement. Fyodorov said Friday that he would like 
the job, but nobody has offered it to him yet. 
</P>
<P>
 Some doubted that the anti-reform Parliament would approve Fyodorov, an 
uncompromising advocate of tight monetary policy and Western-style capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 "To this day, reform in Russia is outward rather than real," Fyodorov told 
business people in London earlier this week, the Itar-Tass news agency 
reported. "I want genuine reform." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruble strengthened slightly Friday against the dollar, which closed down 
six rubles at 2,988. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in three days the Central Bank has spent more than $250 million of 
its dwindling hard-currency reserves to prop up the ruble. Demand for dollars 
remains strong from Russians who have learned not to trust their savings to the 
ruble. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, economists said the very expansionist monetary policies of the 
Central Bank this summer that led to the weakening of the ruble, as well as the 
panic itself, are nearly certain to push inflation much higher this fall, 
perhaps back up to 11% or 14% per month from a low of 4% in August. 
</P>
<P>
 That would undo most of Yeltsin's achievements in bringing lower inflation and 
relative economic stability to his long-suffering citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian and Western economists said Russia needs to stop printing money to 
bail out dying industries and inefficient farmers and to peg the ruble to a 
basket of Western currencies. Gerashchenko presided over two previous ruble 
stabilization efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 currency reform wiped out most Russians' savings. Then, in the summer 
of 1993, the Central Bank suddenly announced that all ruble notes issued before 
1993 would be recalled -- but each citizen was permitted to exchange about $28 
worth of bills. Grandmothers stood in line for days trying to unload their 
meager savings before Yeltsin canceled the decree.

HAITI READIES FOR ARISTIDE'S RETURN; CARIBBEAN: SECURITY IS A MAIN CONCERN AS 
U.S. TROOPS EXPECT UP TO 800,000 TO GATHER FOR THE PRESIDENT'S HOMECOMING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It has taken more than three years of bluster and inducements, harsh sanctions 
and, finally, 20,000 American troops, and now Jean-Bertrand Aristide is coming 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 In an act almost unparalleled in a hemisphere where ousted leaders either are 
killed or waste away in exile, the man his followers call "TiTid" (Little 
Aristide) and "Savior" is scheduled to walk off a U.S.-provided jetliner today 
and resume the Haitian presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 The restoration of the 40-year-old suspended Catholic priest comes three years 
and 15 days after he was driven from office by a military and civilian elite 
that believed his overwhelming election and his populist policies threatened 
their privileges, power and wealth. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Friday, nearly everything was ready. A podium had been built in front 
of the entrance to the Presidential Palace for his first public appearance, 
pigs had been ordered off the streets by City Hall, and Haitian army Maj. Marc 
Valme had been fired from the airport police force after vowing to shoot 
Aristide when he landed. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since Juan Peron returned to Argentina from exile in 1973 has there been 
such an event in the region, although U.S. and Haitian security experts expect 
to prevent anything like the murderous gun battle between rival Peron followers 
that spoiled his welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Security is the main concern today. Access to streets around the Presidential 
Palace, as well as the airport road, will be cordoned off by thousands of 
heavily armed U.S soldiers for the 11 a.m. (8 a.m. PDT) arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 Other troops will keep the tens of thousands of Haitians expected to gather 
downtown from storming the gates of the Presidential Palace, where Aristide 
will deliver his homecoming speech about two hours after touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 And a large American and Haitian bodyguard will shield the president. 
</P>
<P>
 According to plans, Aristide will be seen in public only during the afternoon 
hour set aside for his speech and welcoming ceremonies. He will lunch privately 
in the palace with U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher and more than 200 
other diplomats, American Congress members, foreign supporters and dignitaries 
scheduled to arrive in his three-plane convoy from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. tanks and armored vehicles, as well as motorized and foot patrols, were 
in evidence throughout downtown Port-au-Prince on Friday with the expectation, 
American officials said, "that our presence will deter any enemies of 
democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Those enemies presumably could include even some Aristide followers. Tanks, 
armored vehicles and more soldiers will be posted on key streets leading to 
elite neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is make sure mobs don't form and break loose," said a Capt. Sullivan 
of the 10th Mountain Division, who said he was involved in the security 
planning. He would not give his first name. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the great concerns expressed about Aristide in the seven months before 
the military revolted was the perception by the wealthy that he was urging his 
followers to engage in dechoukaj , a Creole word literally meaning "uprooting" 
but used in Haiti to describe total devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't expect troubles like that," said Stanley Schrager, U.S. Embassy 
spokesman. "Aristide doesn't want violence, and his organizers will see that 
demonstrations are peaceful. But there will be precautions. That is why the 
troops are here -- to guarantee a safe and secure environment for Aristide's 
return." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Aristide organizers here were aware of the potential danger from a mass 
of people that could be easily turned into a deadly mob, or be infiltrated by 
supporters of the military who have sworn never to allow the president to 
resume office. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of two of the city's largest slums, Carrefour and Cite Soleil, say 
they have been asked to organize their own neighborhood fetes and stay away 
from the palace area, where U.S. officials estimate that 300,000 to 800,000 are 
expected to gather. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's reception today doubtless will be tumultuous, perhaps even chaotic, 
as followers greet the man whose meaning to the Haitian masses goes far beyond 
his position as the nation's only democratically elected president. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a country where a tiny elite has always dominated the majority, and the 
mass of people never had even the hope of a better life, Aristide represented a 
real new order," a Haitian businesswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is black in a country run by light-skinned people. He is poor where rulers 
are rich, and his first language is Creole, while the elite speaks French. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he tells the people they have the same rights to food, good housing and 
a just life, they believe him," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a belief that has sent thousands of people into the streets during the 
past week to clean up the rotting piles of garbage and slime that have made 
Port-au-Prince a fetid center of stink and disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not getting paid," said Alice Bazile, a vendor sweeping out a gutter on 
John Brown Road between Port-au-Prince and the wealthy suburb of Petionville. 
"I do this because I want my TiTid to be proud of us. I want the blancs 
(foreigners) to know that we are clean." 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond the popular hysteria, the self-satisfaction of the U.S. officials 
who engineered the ouster of Haiti's army rulers and the hopes of peace and 
prosperity for a nation historically deprived of both, the welcome for the 
restored leader is tinged with uncertainty, even fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "He faces problems of unimaginable magnitude" before his term runs out in less 
than 15 months, said Lionel Delatour, a former Haitian diplomat who has 
organized several business groups to promote Aristide's return even in the face 
of doubts about his policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The country is in bad shape economically, it has no political structure, and 
there is no leadership. Several of us have doubts, but he has to return, and we 
have to build democratic institutions. He can't waste any time or try to act as 
if he doesn't need to compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide agrees in theory on the need for reconciliation with his opponents, 
for justice and a sense of common purpose -- and has spoken on these themes 
frequently if not always persuasively. 
</P>
<P>
 But his tactics and slow pace in developing a program, or even naming a 
permanent prime minister and Cabinet, have many U.S. officials and Haitians 
worried, particularly his failure to outline an economic or social program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, he doesn't even have a schedule for working after he gets back," said 
an aide to an acting Cabinet minister. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has enough real enemies," said a U.S. official, listing a splintered and 
virtually dysfunctional Parliament, a business community that is at best 
doubtful about the future, a truly hostile social elite and some vengeful 
remnants of the Haitian military. 
</P>
<P>
 "So he doesn't need to weaken his supporters by vacillating or appearing to be 
hiding his real purposes," the official said. "I think he has changed, that he 
knows he has to compromise and cooperate, but he can't just come back and think 
that is enough."

WHITE HOUSE DEFENDS CEDRAS DEAL; HAITI: CLINTON AIDE SAYS RENTAL OF HOUSES 
WON'T COST TAXPAYERS AND WAS NECESSARY TO REMOVE THE MILITARY LEADER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration dismissed criticism of its "golden parachute" for 
members of Haiti's military regime Friday as "a minor blip" and said it had 
leased three houses from Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras for $60,000 a year because it 
was the only way to get the Haitian strongman out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Berger, Clinton's deputy national security adviser, said the 
Administration is moving to unfreeze $79 million in Haitian assets that were 
blocked during the political crisis over the nation. But he added that less 
than $1 million of that amount belongs to people linked to the Haitian 
military. 
</P>
<P>
 He said none of the frozen money belongs to Cedras, although exactly $1,000 
belongs to Cedras' wife, Yannick. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the frozen $79 million belongs to Haitian business interests that are 
not directly connected to the military, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the three houses -- Cedras' residence, his beach house and his 
mother-in-law's house -- Berger said the United States government will sublet 
them, so they should not cost the taxpayer anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) denounced the Administration for "house-sitting for 
Cedras." And Randall Robinson, head of the lobbying group TransAfrica, 
complained that it is unseemly for the United States to be making payments of 
any kind to Haiti's deposed generals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Berger responded: "In the context of facilitating the departure of Gen. 
Cedras . . . so that President Aristide could return to an environment which 
was more unified and had less elements of friction, the notion of our paying 
fair-market rental for three houses for a year -- which I'm sure we'll sublease 
-- it seems to me is a minor blip." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, at the same White House news conference, William H. Gray III, 
President Clinton's special adviser on Haiti, said the houses are being leased 
because "the United States' government will be needing additional space" in 
Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they were standing at the same podium, Berger and Gray were unable to 
reconcile the apparent inconsistency in their statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Clinton attended a formal farewell ceremony for Haitian 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide on the South Lawn of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "For three years, you have kept faith against all odds that one day a 
government of the people would be restored to your native land," Clinton said, 
addressing Aristide. "Tomorrow will be that day. You have survived decades of 
violence, terror, poverty with dignity, pride and hope. Now, you and your 
people will have the opportunity to make democracy work for yourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide offered "sincere and everlasting thanks" to Clinton, Congress, his 
supporters in the United States and U.S. troops providing order in Haiti. 
"Tomorrow, when we return home to Haiti, this will be our message to the 
nation: No to violence, no to vengeance, yes to reconciliation," he said.

AN EMOTIONAL JUNCTURE IN HAITI'S CHAOTIC HISTORY; CARIBBEAN: WITH SOME CALLING 
FOR RECONCILIATION AND OTHERS CRYING FOR JUSTICE, THE FUTURE REMAINS UNCERTAIN.

 The brother of slain Justice Minister Guy Malary trembled as he stood in the 
pulpit of Sacre Coeur Church on Friday, his hands raised before a solemn 
audience that included some of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide's most 
high-profile supporters.  
</P>
<P>
 "Is it justice," he cried, "when they kill our people and then they are 
allowed to leave the country?  
</P>
<P>
 "Is that justice?" he asked, referring to the lucrative, U.S.-sponsored 
departure of Haiti's military dictators. Some in the audience sobbed and burst 
into shouts for justice and the president they hope will bring it -- Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorial Mass for Malary, who was assassinated by pro-military henchmen a 
year ago, was in equal parts homage to a dead man and celebration of Aristide's 
anticipated return today.  
</P>
<P>
 "Reconciliation has started!" proclaimed the Rev. Gerard Jean-Juste, presiding 
over the service in French but switching to English and Creole for key 
passages. "Look around you and you shall see. Open your eyes and you shall 
see." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience included pro-Aristide legislators who only recently emerged from 
hiding and members of a caretaker Aristide-sanctioned Cabinet making its first 
joint public appearance in a year. The diplomatic corps, including U.S. 
Ambassador William L. Swing, and a handful of attorneys, doctors and a bank 
president also attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Significantly, the papal nuncio -- a bitter enemy of Aristide since he was 
suspended as a priest in 1988 -- and at least one anti-Aristide bishop also 
joined in the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Emotions surrounding the return of Aristide are reaching fever pitch in this 
polarized nation -- among the Haitian masses for whom the returning president 
represents salvation, and among the elite and business class who fear that he 
will not control the popular violence that threatens to explode at any minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is like we were tied with rope, and Aristide will come to untie us," said 
Berenise Pierre, a 23-year-old church worker who helped sing "We Shall 
Overcome" at the conclusion of the Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the tearful plea of Malary's brother, Luckner, indicated, the issues of 
justice and reconciliation sometimes work at cross purposes. U.S. officials and 
some Haitians argue that social peace could be maintained, and the wounds of 
society healed, only with the removal from Haiti of former strongman Lt. Gen. 
Raoul Cedras and his associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Haitians, however, want to see the leaders of Haiti's brutal 
dictatorship punished for the murders, rapes and tortures they allowed in the 
three years since the coup that overthrew Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand the emotions of those who suffered," Jean-Juste told reporters 
after the service. "But now we hope everybody is more conscious and decided to 
reject violence. . . . We have no other choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the downtown church, Malary's relatives laid floral arrangements of 
white carnations and blue candles along the sidewalk where the justice 
minister, his bodyguard and his driver were gunned down. The gunmen chased the 
three from Malary's office until running their car onto the sidewalk and 
opening fire. The brick wall still bears the gash where Malary's car crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 The assassination of Malary was a turning point in the Haitian crisis. It came 
two days after a pro-military mob turned away the U.S. military cargo ship 
Harlan County, which was attempting to dock, and formed part of the world's 
growing awareness at the time that Cedras had no intention of obeying an 
agreement that provided for Aristide's return. 
</P>
<P>
 The Governor's Island accord, which Cedras and Aristide signed in July, 1993, 
called for Cedras to step down by Oct. 15 of that year and for Aristide to 
resume Haiti's presidency. Neither would happen until this week. 
</P>
<P>
 For Aristide's many supporters, there was an air of elation Friday. Vendors 
hawked T-shirts with his picture, passengers waved Aristide flags from their 
public buses, and residents of Port-au-Prince's most miserable slums painted 
murals in his honor. Many planned an all-night vigil Friday as a form of ad-hoc 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday, thousands of Haitians were roaming the streets of Port-au-Prince, 
chanting pro-Aristide slogans and playing musical instruments to celebrate his 
impending return. 
</P>
<P>
 For his detractors, there was dread. They have seen looting and beatings by 
mobs in recent days, and they fear a return of the social upheaval that 
followed the demise of the Duvalier dynasty in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are concerned about . . . anarchy," attorney Sybille Theard Mevs, a 
member of one of Haiti's wealthiest families, said in an interview. "People are 
concerned because there is no state of law, no rules. Who will guarantee the 
security of anyone?" 
</P>
<P>
 Swing, the American ambassador, said the U.S. military would continue to 
provide security. 
</P>
<P>
 "But," he said in the foyer of Sacre Coeur Church, "it's not a perfect world 
yet. There are a lot of divisions and a lot of guns out there. There is a large 
potential for violence. We have not had success in creating for Haiti a culture 
of nonviolence. That's the ultimate objective."

WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION OKS LARGE-SCALE TRIAL OF AIDS VACCINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The World Health Organization on Friday gave the go-ahead to large-scale 
trials of a vaccine to try to prevent infection with the virus that causes 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 A meeting of experts said small-scale trials on people in the United States 
and Europe had shown that the vaccine was safe and had some impact on improving 
the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. health agency said, however, that too little was known about the 
vaccine to predict its effectiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the information available so far, it is uncertain whether these vaccines 
will protect against infection in humans," a WHO statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 WHO said that the complex trials are unlikely to start before 1996, and that 
it would take years for any results to show. 
</P>
<P>
 No sites have yet been chosen for the trials, which will involve several 
thousand people who do not carry the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes 
AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 According to WHO figures, 17 million people have been infected with the virus 
since it first spread in the early 1980s. About 4 million have gone on to 
develop full-blown AIDS.

BRITON IS FIRST WOMAN TO WALK AROUND WORLD; RECORDS: FFYONA CAMPBELL BEGAN HER 
EPIC JOURNEY WHEN SHE WAS 16 AND ENDED AT AGE 27. SHE IS FOURTH PERSON TO 
COMPLETE A GLOBAL TRIP ON FOOT.

<P>
 A British woman, who left home at the age of 16 on an epic global trek, 
entered the record books Friday as the first woman to go around the world on 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Ffyona Campbell, 27, strode into this small village on the northern tip of 
Scotland just before 8 a.m. and 11 years after she left to cross Europe, 
Australia, the United States and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, barefoot and in tears, was greeted by her parents, Colin and Angie, 
and sister Shuna, crowds of supporters, local residents, reporters and camera 
crews in helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a piece of history," said Campbell, the fourth person to complete a 
round-the-world walk. She took her shoes off just before entering the village. 
</P>
<P>
 During the grueling two-year Africa leg, she was stoned by hostile villagers, 
had to be rescued from political unrest in Zaire by French Foreign Legion 
troops and suffered an attempted rape in Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 She said her supporters had kept her going: "Some of them I met along the way, 
giving me generosity and kindness and taking care of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell's walk of 19,586 miles across four continents began in September, 
1983, when she walked from the northern tip of Scotland to Land's End in 49 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Campbell walked the 3,500 miles from New York to Los Angeles in 151 
days. She crossed the 3,200 miles between Sydney and Perth in 95 days in 1988, 
which beat the existing men's record. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell embarked on her Cape Town-to-Tangiers walk in April, 1991. The 10,055 
miles were completed in several stages in 363 days. She walked from Algeciras, 
Spain, to Calais, France, in 112 days this summer and began her final hike 
through Britain on Sept. 4.

NOBEL PRIZE-WINNING AUTHOR STABBED IN CAIRO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man with a knife stabbed Nobel Prize-winning novelist Naguib Mahfouz in the 
neck outside the writer's Cairo home Friday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 An Interior Ministry statement said Mahfouz, 83, was in "safe condition" at a 
hospital, where he underwent surgery. Police sources labeled the attack a 
terrorist incident -- a term commonly used for attacks by Islamic militants. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahfouz won the 1988 Nobel Prize for literature and has been criticized by 
Muslim radicals for his writings. The statement from the Interior Ministry, 
which is in charge of Egypt's police, gave no hint of a motive. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacker emerged from a white Mercedes-Benz and stabbed Mahfouz several 
times in the neck as he was leaving his home in the neighborhood of Agouza 
shortly before 6 p.m., the police sources said. They spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The man then fled in the car, which bore license plates from Suez in northern 
Egypt, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The novelist, who is diabetic and almost blind, believed that the man wanted 
to shake his hand. Mahfouz's driver called police after the attack, the 
ministry statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahfouz was leaving his home to attend a weekly coffeehouse gathering with 
other Egyptian literary figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahfouz's allegorical "Children of Gebelawi," a 1959 political novel depicting 
religious figures such as Jesus Christ and the Prophet Mohammed, landed him in 
trouble with Egypt's religious Establishment. It remains banned in Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 Radical Egyptian Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman, implicated in the New York Trade 
Center bombing, said Mahfouz, a Muslim, deserved to die for "Children of 
Gebelawi." Some critics had long condemned Mahfouz for supporting Egypt's peace 
with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 At his age, Mahfouz said in a recent interview, a death threat is not really 
that frightening. "I might receive a threat on Sunday and die on Monday of 
natural causes," he said.

REACTION OF L.A.-AREA JEWS AND ARABS MIXED 
</P>

<P>
 Jews and Arabs in the Los Angeles area offered mixed reactions Friday to the 
news that Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon 
Peres and PLO leader Yasser Arafat will share the 1994 Nobel Peace Prize. 
</P>
<P>
 Many said the award came too early in the light of continuing Mideast 
violence. But others hailed it as a show of support for the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewish leaders, including Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, 
found the choice of Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization hard to 
swallow. 
</P>
<P>
 They said this was especially true on a day when Israeli troops suffered 
casualties while storming a home where Islamic militants had held a kidnaped 
19-year-old Israeli soldier. The hostage was killed, as were three kidnapers 
and an Israeli commando. 
</P>
<P>
 Hier called the prize "tragic and flawed." "There is something inherently 
wrong when such a distinguished award becomes a means for repentant terrorists 
to gain instant respectability," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabbi Laura Geller of Temple Emanuel in Beverly Hills hailed Peres' 
vision, Rabin's negotiating skills and Arafat's gumption in rising above the 
PLO's violent record. 
</P>
<P>
 "All three of them took risks in moving toward peace," she said. "They all 
risked a great deal, and they are all facing serious threats from extremists, 
as we've seen just today. So my hope is that this prize supports the forces in 
the Middle East that want there to be peace. We all recognize that this is 
still a very long road." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Islamic Center of Southern California, spokesman Maher Hathout said the 
time was not right for awarding such a prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is premature because peace is not there yet," he said. And one of the 
worshipers, Amr Ali, said, "All three of them don't deserve it. Israel is 
living in peace but the Palestinians are definitely not living in peace." 
</P>
<P>
 While some Jewish spokesmen protested the choice of Arafat, saying he was a 
former terrorist, Hathout recalled that another Israeli prime minister was 
similarly honored despite his violent record as commander of a underground 
group that existed before Israel's statehood. "Those that are objecting because 
of Arafat should remember that Menachem Begin got the peace prize too," he 
said.

 Joel Rembaum, president of the Southern California Board of Rabbis, observed

started a process that up to now was not as meaningful as it might have been.

<P>
 "Perhaps the hope is the prize will give an impetus to completing that 
process."

RABIN'S COURAGE LED ISRAEL TOWARD PEACE -- AND TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This was the day of the Nobel Peace Prize, a day that Prime Minister Yitzhak 
Rabin had been looking forward to for months, a day in which his courageous 
decision to make peace with the Palestinians would, he knew, be recognized by 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 But before it ended, Friday had become a day of tragedy -- a day like so many 
others that Rabin had seen in his 53 years as a soldier and political leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the abduction of a 19-year-old army corporal by Islamic militants, 
a threat to kill the youth unless the radicals' demands were met and 
negotiations that were dragging on, Rabin gave the order Friday evening to an 
elite commando unit to storm the house where the soldier was held. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything rested, it seemed, on Rabin's decision -- to proceed with the 
negotiations but run the risk that the soldier would be killed as the deadline 
passed, or to mount a rescue operation, accepting the risk that the youth, 
barely out of high school, would be murdered when the first shot was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin chose the military option -- a gamble, but a gamble that Israel's 
commandos had won so often and so brilliantly in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wherever there is the possibility of military action, especially when we are 
dealing with areas under our control," Rabin explained later, "a clear 
preference is given to it and not to negotiations and the release of 
terrorists. . . . Therefore I made the decision to take military action to free 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 But the raid failed. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldier, Nachshon Waxman, was killed, apparently by his captors, as was 
the Israeli captain leading the charge into the house. Three of the Palestinian 
radicals were also killed. Nine more Israeli commandos were wounded. "I bear 
responsibility for the results," Rabin later told a shocked nation in a 
late-night news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Over and over, Rabin justified his order as part of Israel's policy of 
combatting terrorism even as it sought peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin's lifetime has been full of such decisions, and his closest associates 
say he never flinches from them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The courage he showed in recognizing the PLO is the same courage that he had 
in ordering that rescue attempt," a senior government official said. "He does 
it by brain, and he does it by gut. . . . The responsibility is frightening." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day Friday, negotiations with Hamas and military preparations 
proceeded simultaneously.  
</P>
<P>
 As nightfall came, Rabin was forced to choose his path. Time was running out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I faced the question: What if I don't act tonight?" he recounted. "Would I be 
able to say that I did, that we did, all that we could? No. I therefore 
authorized the action, I gave the order." 
</P>
<P>
 Anguished and saddened on what was to have been his day of glory, Rabin said: 
"I would have been very happy to give up the Nobel Prize to bring these two 
soldiers back."

ROSTENKOWSKI DOESN'T HAVE IMMUNITY, U.S. JUDGE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Constitution does not protect Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) from 
prosecution on charges of political corruption, a federal judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski's appeal of that ruling could delay any trial for several months, 
and more than a year if the matter goes to the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson turned aside defense arguments that 
the government's case was an unprecedented intrusion on Congress' 
constitutional authority to police its own rules. Also rejected was the claim 
that Rostenkowski was improperly being prosecuted for official legislative acts 
protected by the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge acknowledged that members of Congress have limited constitutional 
protection against prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "But precedent seems to be lacking for the proposition that immunity attaches 
to a congressman's decision to hire employees whose duties consist of 
photographing his daughters' weddings, mowing the grass at his summer house or 
other personal duties," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard Pearl, one of Rostenkowski's attorneys, said: "We intend to appeal." 
The U.S. attorney's office had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had contended that the constitutional provisions and internal 
rules of Congress "simply have nothing to say about common thievery." 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski was indicted on 17 felony counts May 31. He is charged with 
converting $636,600 in federal funds and $56,267 in campaign funds to his 
personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 The government says he used official funds to pay employees who did mostly 
personal work for him; converted stationery, postal and home office allowances 
to his personal use; and obstructed justice. Rostenkowski, now seeking 
reelection, has pleaded not guilty and denied wrongdoing.

SALMONELLA POISONING IN 35 STATES BLAMED ON ICE CREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ice cream made in Minnesota is now blamed for thousands of suspected cases of 
salmonella poisoning in at least 35 states, and investigators are trying to 
figure out the source of the bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwan's Sales Enterprises, based in Marshall, Minn., recalled its ice cream 
after the first reports of food poisoning last week. Investigators have found 
salmonella bacteria in samples of Schwan's ice cream from people who got ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Larry Slutsker, an epidemiologist with the federal Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention, said Friday that reports have come from at least 35 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC has 400 confirmed cases of salmonella from Schwan's ice cream, and 
3,000 to 5,000 suspected cases, agency spokesman Kent Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC said the confirmed cases came from 15 states: Colorado, Delaware, 
Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, Nebraska, New York, 
Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Washington and Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC is not releasing the list of the 20 other states where cases have been 
reported but not yet confirmed. "We don't want to cause alarm in these areas," 
said another CDC spokesman, Bob Howard. 
</P>

 In Minnesota alone, about 2,500 people called a state hot line to report 
getting sick after eating the ice cream. As of Friday, 72 cases had been 
confirmed as salmonella. 
</P>
<P>
 The ice cream could have been contaminated in any number of ways, 
investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at everything from the ingredients to the mixes to the 
transportation system to the plant. We're trying to determine in which of those 
areas the salmonella might be growing and how it got there," said Jackie 
Renner, a spokeswoman for the state Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwan's suppliers turn the raw ingredients, such as milk, sugar and cream, 
into a pasteurized ice cream mix that Schwan's uses to make the ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmonella causes nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhea, fever and headaches. 
Symptoms are most severe in infants, the elderly and people with weak immune 
systems.

 American working women earn only about three-fourths as much as men, and they 
are frustrated by poor pay and benefits and problems balancing work and family, 
a new Labor Department survey said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Labor Secretary 
Robert B. Reich released results of the "Working Women Count" survey, in which 
thousands of women expressed opinions about juggling job and family 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientific telephone survey of 1,200 women also took into account the 
comments of 250,000 women who answered questionnaires distributed through their 
jobs, churches, clubs and other organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the scientific survey and the comments gleaned from questionnaires found 
frustration with pay and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Women earned an average of $7.15 an hour in 1993, about 79.8% of male workers' 
average wage, the survey showed. Women's weekly earnings were only 76.8% of 
men's and annual earnings in 1992 -- the most recent year this statistic was 
available -- were $21,440, or 70.6% of what the average man earned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working women tell us . . . they are not getting the pay and benefits 
commensurate with the work they do, the level of responsibility they hold or 
the societal contribution they make," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-nine percent of respondents in the scientific survey and 55% of 
questionnaire respondents said they are not paid what they are worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Stress was the most-mentioned problem, cited by 60% of the respondents. Nearly 
three-quarters of women in their 40s who hold professional and management jobs 
listed it as their top problem, as did more than two-thirds of single working 
mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most women said it was getting tougher to balance work and family, and said 
that "problems with child care are deep and pervasive, affecting families 
across the economic spectrum," the report said.

GIRLS' SPREE SPOILS GRANDMOTHER'S NEST EGG AND PLANS FOR WORLD TRIP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After spending most of her life working two jobs to save $26,500, 63-year-old 
Beatrice Jones had it all planned: "I wanted to go on a nice trip around the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' two teen-age granddaughters got to the money first, however, 
authorities said.The girls allegedly stole the cash from a bedroom safe and 
took a lavish trip of their own -- to Disney World. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a 13-year-old friend, they blew all but $8,100 in Orlando, Fla., on 
an expensive hotel, restaurants and a three-day shopping spree, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One sister, 15, and the friend are charged with grand larceny. The other 
sister, 14, is charged with grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls remained in a juvenile detention center in Orlando on Friday as 
authorities discussed how to bring them back to Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls' odyssey started last Saturday. According to police, the sisters, 
who lived with their father and grandmother, decided to run away after their 
father, Deron Jones, hit the elder one with a belt. They broke into the safe 
and stole the money, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After getting their friend, the girls went to the airport and bought tickets 
to Orlando. Once there, they checked into the Embassy Suites Hotel near Disney 
World and paid cash in advance for a two-week stay. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls were discovered Monday night when one of them got scared, called a 
friend and told her where they were. The friend in turn called their father, 
who contacted Florida authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Beatrice Jones said she has not spoken with the girls since her son told her 
what they did. "I really don't want to talk with them," she said.

IS IT '94 OR '84? CANDIDATES RELYING ON RETRO RHETORIC; POLITICS: REPUBLICANS 
REVIVE REAGANOMICS WITH A NEW 'CONTRACT.' DEMOCRATS DERIDE TRICKLE-DOWN, PART 
TWO. OFF-YEAR CAMPAIGN SOUNDS AWFULLY FAMILIAR. 
</P>

<P>
 Voters trying to decipher the economic themes of Republican and Democratic 
candidates in this year's elections must feel a little bit like Yogi Berra did 
when he said it was deja vu all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, hoping to recapture the glory days of Reaganism, are reverting to 
the hoary themes of 1980, issuing a 10-point "contract with America" that 
commits them to huge tax cuts and a constitutional amendment that would require 
the President and Congress to balance the federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, meanwhile, are reaching back to 1982, the year that saw some of 
their most successful attacks on President Ronald Reagan's programs. Largely 
afraid to identify with President Clinton's economic record, Democratic 
candidates are instead countering the GOP "contract" by raising the specter of 
Reagan's controversial trickle-down economic theory and warning that a 
balanced-budget amendment would produce sharp cuts in Medicare and Social 
Security. 
</P>
<P>
 This back-to-the-future campaign underscores the dearth of new ideas about 
U.S. economic policy that now plagues both parties and threatens to increase 
voter alienation and frustration with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, it suggests that, even if Democrats are able to retain control of 
Congress, Clinton may find little support in his own party for his economic 
agenda, especially for what White House aides describe as his long-term 
strategy to restore American competitiveness -- new spending aimed at expanding 
federal job training and education programs, welfare reform and other so-called 
investment projects. 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with the new Congress, Clinton likely will be forced to fashion an 
economic agenda for 1995 that responds more directly to short-term Republican 
challenges. Even as the White House and Democratic candidates have derided 
Republicans for issuing what they charge are outlandish promises of expensive 
tax cuts as part of their "contract," senior Administration officials conceded 
that they will begin a serious study of a middle-class tax cut proposal of 
their own soon after next month's elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the dominant economic theme of the campaign right now seems to be driven 
by a sudden and rather puzzling desire by both sides to rehash the stale 
arguments of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 This tendency comes at a time when the economic problems of the nation are 
more complex than ever and seem to demand far greater creativity and innovation 
from Washington than is being offered by either major party, many experts 
believe. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, for example, has sought to begin a debate during this fall's campaign 
over what many leading economists and political analysts think is the most 
puzzling and ominous economic trend facing the nation: the steady decline in 
income at a time when the overall economy is in the midst of a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration policy-makers are convinced that a continuing decline in wages 
for families in 1993, coupled with a heightened sense of job insecurity in the 
face of widespread corporate layoffs, explains why most Americans have so 
little confidence in the ongoing recovery -- and in Clinton's economic 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen a continuation of a 15-year trend in declining American incomes 
and standards of living. We've put in place policies to begin to address that, 
but you can't reverse that overnight," acknowledged Laura D'Andrea Tyson, who 
heads the White House Council of Economic Advisers. And President Clinton 
argued this week that, if he does propose a middle-class tax cut, it will be to 
offset "the problem of stagnant wages." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet few Democrats or Republicans are showing any interest in engaging in 
complex debates this fall on such issues. Instead, congressional candidates 
seem satisfied to replay old arguments over so-called Reaganomics and thus are 
reverting to slightly altered versions of the same sound bites they were using 
a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Republican contract is deja voodoo economics," quipped Labor Secretary 
Robert B. Reich. "People are beginning to see that this is just Republican 
cotton candy," added Rep. Vic Fazio (D-West Sacramento), chairman of the 
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, if this is a referendum on Ronald Reagan versus Bill Clinton, we'll take 
it," countered Tim LeFever, Fazio's Republican challenger, one of more than 300 
Republican House candidates who have signed on to the party's contract. 
</P>
<P>
 From a purely political standpoint, the Republicans may have miscalculated by 
announcing a party-wide contract that ties them so directly to an updated 
version of Reagan's economic ideas. In an off-year election, the party out of 
power traditionally tries to keep the focus on the record of the governing 
party without offering substantive policy prescriptions of its own. But this 
year, the Republicans have given Democrats the chance to run against 1980s 
Republican policy -- and avoid having to defend the Clinton record. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contract reminds everyone of why they voted the way they did in 1982," an 
off-year election in which Republicans suffered huge losses, observed David 
Wilhelm, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a balanced budget amendment, which would require steep and 
painful cuts in a wide range of federal programs, the Republican accord, signed 
by more than 300 House candidates, also calls for enormously expensive tax 
breaks, including a 50% cut in the capital gains tax; a $500-per-child tax 
credit for families with annual incomes up to $200,000; tax relief for Social 
Security beneficiaries; elimination of the so-called marriage penalty, which 
means that married couples usually pay more than two single taxpayers; and a 
dramatic expansion of individual retirement accounts, which postpone payment of 
some taxes until retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 While less-controversial elements of the contract deal with social issues, 
such as crime and welfare reform, and national security issues, such as the 
role of U.S. forces in multinational operations, its economic provisions and 
the dubious budgetary math behind them have offered the most attractive targets 
for Democrats. Senate Republicans, wary of the political implications of the 
House GOP pact, issued a series of similar proposals but not in contract form. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the potential for a massive budgetary crisis from the Republican plan 
prompted one senior congressional budget official to call it the Republican 
"contract on America." 
</P>
<P>
 And Democrats across the country are savaging Republicans by warning that the 
balanced budget amendment would require cuts in Social Security and Medicare 
benefits -- which also provided the dominant anti-Reagan theme in 1982. House 
Minority Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia charged that Clinton and the Democrats 
are openly lying about the contract, since Republicans have promised not to 
touch Social Security. Yet Republicans still find themselves on the defensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Republicans threw us a life jacket when they announced their 
'contract with America,' because clearly that package just doesn't add up," 
observed Rep. Timothy J. Penny (D-Minn.), a leading fiscal conservative who is 
retiring this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the contract was unveiled in late September, Democrats were at a loss 
about how to deal with economic issues. "They (Democratic candidates) now have 
something to get people's attention on economic policy," argued Robert E. 
Rubin, chairman of the National Economic Council at the White House.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, few Democrats have been willing to follow the risky strategy of Rep. 
Bob Carr, (D-Mich.) and openly defend their past support for Clinton's economic 
policies. In his campaign for Michigan's open Senate seat, Carr is airing 
television commercials defending his vote for the Clinton economic plan of 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that the budget reconciliation act (the 1993 Clinton plan) was 
a big piece of legislation with many elements, including deficit reduction and 
new investments, and we should not let Republicans get away with the big lie 
that this was just a tax bill," Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican leaders, meanwhile, remain undeterred by the new willingness of 
Democrats to go on the offensive on economic policy and are convinced that 
their contract has helped frame the debate and has forced longtime Democratic 
incumbents to respond to Republican challengers. In fact, the contract is being 
most widely used by Republican challengers, while Republican incumbents are 
largely downplaying its importance in their races, according to Ed Gillispie, a 
spokesman for the House Republican Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a situation where everything in our contract scores very 
positively with normal voters," said Gingrich in defense of the Republican 
strategy. "And remember, there is no Clinton contract. They (the Democrats) are 
only out there running a cynical smear campaign on our contract. We are trying 
to take the high road and show what we will do. And we're saying if we don't do 
it, throw us out. But I don't understand their strategy at all."

8 MEN CHARGED IN DYNAMITING OF RIVER RAPID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 White-water rafters confronting Quartzite Falls on the Salt River could 
swallow their fear and take the plunge, or get out and carry their boats around 
it. Eight men, prosecutors say, took a third route: They dynamited it. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the wildest rapid on the river has been reduced to a mild thrill 
ride and a federal grand jury on Thursday charged a river guide and seven other 
men with conspiracy and destruction of federal property by means of an 
explosive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of viewed this as an act of eco-terrorism. It's irreparable damage," 
said U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Joyce Hassel. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors won't comment on the motive, but one river runner speculated it 
may have been frustration over the lines that sometimes form at the portage 
point, where rafters take their boats out of the water and start hiking. Or 
worse: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like these guys were too lazy or too incompetent to run this rapid or go 
around it," said Gail Peters, who is Arizona director for the environmental 
group American Rivers and has rafted the Salt. 
</P>
<P>
 Conviction on the conspiracy charge carries a sentence of up to five years in 
prison and a $250,000 fine. Destruction of property is punishable by 20 years 
and a $250,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The rapid spanned the bottom of the Salt River Canyon in the Tonto National 
Forest about 100 miles northeast of Phoenix. It was what rafters call a Class 6 
rapid, the most challenging. It looks deceptively mild in photos but has 
claimed at least two lives -- rafters who got stuck in the rapid and drowned 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrill came from the hydraulic effect created by the water's six-foot 
drop, explained Peter Weinel, a Forest Service rafting expert. The shape of the 
bottom turned the flow of the river back on itself in a way that could get a 
boat stuck in one spot. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't look much different now, but the dynamite destroyed the six-foot 
drop, leaving only a tame four-foot drop above. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictment, river guide William Stoner, 34, of Phoenix 
returned with accomplices five times from August through October, 1993, to the 
remote spot to place and detonate charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Indicted with Stoner were Richard M. Scott, 39; Stephen M. Cortright, 39; 
William C. Kelley, 28; James E. Lewus, 40; Christopher M. Meehl, 34; Mark E. 
Meehl, 42; and Michael W. Meehl, 38. Kelley is from Glendale, Ariz.; the others 
are from Phoenix. They were freed without bail.

SOCIAL SECURITY RECIPIENTS TO GET 2.8% RAISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 America's 45 million recipients of Social Security and Supplemental Security 
Income will get a 2.8% increase in benefits next year to keep up with 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Social Security Administration announced Friday that the average benefit 
for retired people would rise to $698 from $679, effective Jan. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Maximum SSI payments -- which go to poor people who are aged, blind or 
disabled -- will climb to $458 from $446 for individuals, and to $687 from $669 
for couples, effective Dec. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual cost-of-living adjustments, which began in 1975, are designed to 
keep inflation from eroding the value of benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "This latest increase ensures that Social Security will continue to provide 
inflation-adjusted economic security to millions of senior citizens who depend 
on it in their retirement years," said Social Security Commissioner Shirley 
Sears Chater. 
</P>
<P>
 But because it reflects the overall increase in the inflation rate, the 1995 
increase will be the third smallest in 20 years. For the last four years, 
prices have been rising at the lowest rates in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the benefits adjustments of 1.3% in 1987 and 2.6% last year are smaller 
than the 1995 increase. Benefits had shot up 14.3% in 1980 and 11.2% in 1981 
when inflation was flaring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department reported Friday that the 0.2% increase in its September 
consumer price index meant prices were rising at a 2.8% annual rate for the 12 
months ended Sept. 30. The Social Security and SSI adjustments are calculated 
each fall from the CPI increase during the previous four quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Assn. of Retired Persons acknowledged that the adjustment permits 
many beneficiaries to keep up with inflation and remain financially secure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, this COLA (cost-of-living adjustment) will not be as much help 
for younger Americans with disabilities nor for many older Americans because 
this increase will not cover rising health care costs," said Horace B. Deets, 
the association's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health care costs for these populations routinely outstrip the COLA, with the 
price of many retail prescription drugs twice the COLA and overall health care 
costs more than triple the COLA." 
</P>
<P>
 Deets also said the increase will be offset for many lower-income Medicare 
beneficiaries by a 12.2% increase in 1995 Medicare Part B premiums. The 
Medicare premium is taken directly out of a recipient's monthly benefit check. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45 million Americans now receive benefits, including 42 million on 
Social Security rolls and 6 million on SSI. Some people are eligible for both, 
which accounts for the smaller overall total.

STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION TAKES NO POSITION ON PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The State Board of Education declined Friday to take a stand on Proposition 
187, the ballot initiative that would prohibit illegal immigrant children from 
attending California's public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The board heard testimony from witnesses on both sides of the issue but took 
no vote on two proposed resolutions, one to oppose the ballot measure because 
it "punishes innocent children for their parents' violations of immigration 
laws," and another to push for "full federal reimbursement" of state costs of 
educating illegal immigrant children. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, who supports the initiative and who either appointed or 
reappointed all nine members of the board, says the state cannot afford the 
estimated $1.5 billion it costs to educate the more than 300,000 illegal 
immigrant children attending kindergarten through 12th grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents say the initiative is too extreme and would turn the schools into 
immigration offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that virtually all major groups associated with the public schools 
oppose Proposition 187, Sherry Loofbourrow, president of the California School 
Boards Assn., said: "I believe they (the board of education) abdicated their 
leadership."

TOWN GETS $106,000 FOR NONEXISTENT POLICE DEPT.

<P>
 This town of 340 people has received a $106,000 federal grant to fight 
crime.Now all it needs is a police department. 
</P>
<P>
 Town officials said they were surprised to learn they were among the first 392 
municipalities to share $200 million designated by the federal crime bill for 
hiring police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we need is a part-time officer, three nights a week on weekends," said 
David Lindsey, one of the town's two councilors. "We don't have no trouble the 
rest of the time. A retired policeman who will work cheap is all we need." The 
town laid off its only officer in April because there was no money to pay him.

 James Hill, whose directorial scenery ranged from the rich African veld of 
"Born Free" to posh British estates where "The Avengers" often worked their 
wily ways, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Press reported this week that Hill -- who won an Academy Award 
for his 1960 short film "Giuseppina" -- was 75 when he died in London on Oct. 
7. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither The Times of London nor the wire service reported a cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the commercial success of "Born Free," an overwhelmingly popular 
picture of 1966, could have given Hill the choice of projects earlier denied 
him, he continued into his later years directing the small, quaint films he 
found appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Giuseppina," one of his first pictures, was an example. 
</P>
<P>
 Produced in Britain and sponsored by British Petroleum, it was almost a 
formless documentary of one afternoon in the life of the daughter of a service 
station proprietor. Hill's unobtrusive camera tracked her wry observations of 
her father's customers. 
</P>
<P>
 After a brief stint as an actor with the Bradford Civic Playhouse near his 
birthplace in Airedale, England, Hill began directing after joining Britain's 
General Post Office Film Unit. Funded by the government, it produced a series 
of documentaries still considered among the best of the genre. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the Royal Air Force as a filmmaker shortly after World War II broke 
out in 1939 and found himself on bombing raids over Germany and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill -- sometimes confused with U.S. producer James Hill who was once married 
to Rita Hayworth -- was taken prisoner after being shot down over Germany and 
was later decorated for bravery. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the success of "Giuseppina," Hill in 1961 directed a film adaptation 
of Arnold Wesker's stage play "The Kitchen," and in 1962 made two film versions 
of plays by John Mortimer: "The Dock Brief" (known in the United States as 
"Trial and Error"), which starred Peter Sellers as an unsuccessful attorney, 
and "Lunch Hour" with Shirley Anne Field. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1965, he moved into the mystery-horror field with "A Study in Terror" and 
then to pop music with "Every Day's a Holiday." 
</P>
<P>
 "A Study in Terror" was an imaginative account of how Sherlock Holmes 
identified Jack the Ripper and featured some of Britain's best-known actors: 
Anthony Quayle, John Neville, Donald Houston and Judi Dench. "Every Day's a 
Holiday" had Freddie and the Dreamers as a prime musical attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the films was well received. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1960s, Hill also worked in television, writing and directing many 
episodes of two popular and long-running thriller series -- "The Saint" and 
"The Avengers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Born Free," based on Joy Adamson's autobiographical account of a family of 
lions and filmed in Kenya, starred the husband-and-wife team Virginia McKenna 
and Bill Travers as game wardens. But the real stars were Elsa, the lioness, 
and her cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The documentary-drama, with its intimate examination of the family life of 
lions, was a huge hit with audiences of all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill followed that with other animal films -- "An Elephant Called Slowly" in 
1970, again with McKenna and Travers; "Black Beauty" in 1971 based on Victorian 
writer Anna Sewell's children's classic about a horse; "The Lion at World's 
End," which Hill co-directed with Travers in 1971, and "The Belstone Fox" in 
1973.

GORDON A. MARKER; PIONEER IN BURNING USED TIRES TO GENERATE ELECTRICAL ENERGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gordon A. Marker, a pioneer in converting used tires to electrical energy, has 
died in the crash of his single-engine plane in Lake Erie. He was 62. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred Sept. 27, Marker's Los Angeles daughter-in-law, Bonnie 
Lena, said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Marker, an expert in organizing hydroelectric projects, joined an investment 
banker and others to create Oxford Energy in 1985. The company built the 
nation's first tire-burning power plant in Westley, Calif., near Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Marker and his company earned the U.S. Government Award for Energy 
Innovation.  
</P>
<P>
 Marker formed TransEnergy Inc. in the late 1980s to promote alternative energy 
sources on an international basis, and in 1990 built England's first 
tire-burning power operation. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Portland, Ore., Marker earned bachelor's and master's degrees from 
the University of Oregon and a doctorate in economics from the University of 
Pennsylvania. He began his career teaching economics at the Wharton School of 
Rutgers University and at the University of Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Marker is survived by his wife, Mary; a daughter, Rachel, and four adopted 
sons, Tom, Todd and Jeremy of Boston, and David of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is scheduled for Nov. 18 in Newton, Mass., and another will 
be planned for the West Coast. The family has asked that any memorial 
contributions be sent to the American Keeshond Society, Dog Rescue Group, 4626 
N. 30th Drive, Phoenix, Ariz. 85017.

STAN BOHRMAN; AWARD-WINNING NEWSMAN ON RADIO AND TELEVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stan Bohrman, a radio and TV newsman in Los Angeles, San Francisco and other 
major markets who won Emmys for his newscasts and accolades for his 
presentation of guests opposing the Vietnam War, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 His son, David, a producer of specials coverage for NBC-TV, said his father 
was 63 when he died Thursday of cancer at Tarzana Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in Los Angeles, Bohrman worked for the Voice of America in New York and 
KNX radio in Los Angeles, and appeared as an anchorman in the film "The China 
Syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s he had hosted a daytime talk show, "Tempo II," on KHJ-TV. It was 
there that he and his co-hosts, Regis Philbin and Maria Cole, widow of Nat 
(King) Cole, featured celebrity guests, among them anti-war spokesmen in an era 
when dissent was not popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in his career, Bohrman returned to radio broadcasting and producing. He 
retired in 1990, after working at KFWB in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 His awards included local Emmys in Los Angeles and San Francisco and a duPont 
award for investigative reporting in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his son, he is survived by his wife, Del, a TV writer, two daughters 
and two grandchildren.

A LOOK BEHIND CLAIMS IN DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson and state Treasurer Kathleen Brown made a number of claims 
during their 60-minute debate Friday night. Here are some of them, along with 
analysis by Times staff writer Daniel M. Weintraub: 
</P>
<P>
 Brown: "My plan calls for cutting $5 billion from wasteful government 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: Although Brown has advocated cutting that much money, neither she 
nor her written plan spells out how she would do it. The two examples she gave 
Friday totaled $13 million. A detailed version of her budget proposal shows she 
is counting on only $2 billion from cutting waste by the fifth year after her 
plan is implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: "We have cut $18 billion. . . . We have reduced the state general fund 
budget by fully one-third." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: Wilson has not cut $18 billion, nor has he reduced the general fund 
by one-third. The general fund was $40.3 billion when he took office. In the 
coming year, Wilson plans to spend $40.9 billion, according to his own 
Department of Finance. It is true that the state budget today is $18 billion 
less than state officials predicted five years ago. But most of that difference 
is a result of the recession, not state budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown: "He has given a tax cut to the richest 2% of Californians." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: Actually, Wilson raised taxes on the wealthy. Brown was referring to 
an income tax surcharge Wilson and lawmakers enacted in 1991 to help close a 
$14-billion budget gap. The higher tax rates apply to people earning more than 
$100,000 annually and are due to expire at the end of 1995. Brown wants to keep 
the higher rates on the books. Wilson wants to let them expire. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown: "He said (in 1990) only he could balance the state budget without 
raising taxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: Wilson never pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes. He 
pledged to not raise income tax rates, a pledge he later broke when he raised 
taxes on the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: "We have spent more for education, $4 billion more." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: It is true that total funding for education has climbed from $25 
billion when Wilson took office to $29 billion this year. But most of that new 
money came from other than state sources. During that period, federal funds for 
schools grew 35% and local property taxes climbed 63%, while state funding for 
education grew by just 1.8%. Despite the increases, the schools have lost 
ground to inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown: "When he was in the Senate, he voted for the (immigration) mandates 
that we're now paying for." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: Wilson did vote for the federal law that requires the state to 
provide health care to illegal immigrants. He said he did so because it was 
part of an omnibus budget act that was supposed to reduce the federal deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown: "He wrote what's called the Wilson Amendment that opened up the 
floodgates, letting 1.1 million illegal immigrants into this country." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: Wilson as a U.S. senator proposed allowing employers to hire guest 
workers temporarily from other countries to pick perishable crops. His 
amendment was altered by Democrats in the House, and their changes made it 
easier for the immigrant workers to remain in this country. Wilson says he 
voted for the final version because it was part of the comprehensive 
immigration reform act. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: "We have cut welfare 15% in the last four years." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: Wilson and lawmakers have reduced cash welfare grants in three of 
the past four years, from $694 monthly to $593 for a family of three, a cut of 
14.5%. A court has stopped the most recent cut and ordered the grants kept at 
$607. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson: "I say we must end services to illegal immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysis: While Wilson has complained forcefully about the cost of these 
services, he is more reticent about which ones he would eliminate. He favors 
continuing emergency health care for humanitarian reasons and would not expel 
illegal immigrants from the state prisons because he fears these felons would 
not be required to serve out their sentences in their country of origin. 
Although he favors Proposition 187, he says he believes its provision requiring 
schoolchildren to prove their citizenship status would lead not to them being 
kicked out of school but to a lawsuit clarifying federal responsibility to pay 
for their education.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / CONTROLLER; CANDIDATES BOTH VOW TO CUT WASTE IN 
GOVERNMENT; BUSINESSWOMAN KATHLEEN CONNELL IS MAKING HER FIRST RUN FOR PUBLIC 
OFFICE AS A DEMOCRAT. SHE FACES FIERY FORMER GOP ASSEMBLYMAN TOM MCCLINTOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in 1952, state Controller Thomas Kuchel loftily cited his job as the one 
elected California position that "provides the necessary independent check on 
the financial operations of the spending agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently in the wake of enactment of another messy state budget by the 
governor and Legislature, Controller Gray Davis likened the job to the "guy in 
the circus following the elephant around." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the controller is the protector of the taxpayer or the sweeper of 
others' messes, or both, political newcomer Kathleen Connell, a Democrat, and 
retired Assemblyman Tom McClintock, a Republican, are fighting for the 
relatively obscure post. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they represent the clash of a political outsider trying to get 
inside and a former insider trying to get back inside. Both offer themselves as 
eager to energize the controller's office into a dynamic enemy of government 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who served as the state's chief financial officer for two terms, is 
vacating the post to run for lieutenant governor. The low-key battle to succeed 
him is heating up as Connell outdistances McClintock in fund raising, including 
loaning her campaign $1.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a businesswoman, an expert in public finance," said Connell, an 
investment banker and former director of housing in Los Angeles. "I'm running 
against a man who is a career politician and spent his entire adult life being 
supported by the taxpayers." 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock countered: "She spent nine years in a city bureaucracy, ultimately 
bankrupting a city agency. I spent 10 years in the Legislature trying to stop 
bureaucrats like her." 
</P>
<P>
 Connell, 47, concedes that the launch of a new housing program she oversaw in 
1976 ran into start-up problems. But she says that no bankruptcy occurred and 
that the program produced more than 10,000 new and rehabilitated housing units. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell is owner and president of a financial consulting firm, taught business 
at UCLA and UC Berkeley, and served in the Administration of Mayor Tom Bradley 
from 1975 to 1983. She holds a doctorate in economics and urban planning from 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Connell switched her voter registration from decline-to-state to 
Democrat and began running for controller, her first bid for elective office. 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock, 38, is a conservative from Thousand Oaks best known for his fiery 
attacks when he was a lawmaker against what he labels the big spending policies 
of Republican Govs. George Deukmejian and Pete Wilson. He accused them of 
making only cosmetic budget cuts when much more severe reductions were 
necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Associates describe McClintock as a true conservative whose beliefs in 
individual responsibility, free market principles and reversing the powers of 
government are genuine. Critics call him an ineffective ideologue incapable of 
compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 One favorite McClintock trademark is the issuance of long lists of specific 
cuts he would make in government spending -- from privatizing management of the 
Department of Corrections to eliminating the governor's Cabinet. He is 
especially proud of a list that recommended cuts totaling $14 billion in a 
$50-billion budget. Most have been rejected by the Legislature as unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 The controller's duties are regarded as mostly routine but important. The 
controller signs virtually all state checks, serves on tax, pension and land 
use commissions and audits a variety of government programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell says her first act as controller would be to try to persuade the 
governor and Legislature to empower her to launch a first-ever wave of 
performance audits of all state government agencies that would identify 
unneeded and duplicative services. She contends that abolishing such waste 
would offset a projected budget shortage next year by $2 billion to $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock says he favors the concept of performance audits, but maintains 
that they can consume valuable time, end up costing taxpayers more money and 
are not really necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not hard to find waste in a government that costs so much and produces 
so little," McClintock said. He favors a highly intensified use of existing 
auditing powers.  
</P>
<P>
 One of his first acts as controller, McClintock says, would be to stop writing 
checks for "giveaways to illegals," about $3.4 billion that he estimates is 
spent by state taxpayers on health, education, penal and other services for 
undocumented immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Refusal to sign the checks, McClintock says, would trigger a legal test that 
could force the U.S. Supreme Court to reconsider the issue of public services 
for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 He favors enactment of Proposition 187, which would cut most services to 
illegal immigrants. Connell opposes the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Connell has received financial campaign support from traditionally Democratic 
constituencies, such as organized labor. She also has received substantial 
contributions from women's organizations, executives of the entertainment 
industry and Southern California financial advisers, investors and developers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Connell is her own biggest contributor, loaning her campaign $1.6 million 
of the $2.2 million the campaign reported receiving in the past 10 months. 
Campaign spokesman Julion Ramirez said the loan came from personal funds of 
Connell and her husband, real estate investor Robert Levenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 In his latest financial statement, McClintock reported raising $737,131 for 
the primary and general campaigns, much of it in small contributions from 
former constituents in his old Assembly district. 
</P>
<P>
 McClintock's largest single donation of $15,000 was made by the Taxpayers 
Political Action Committee, composed of major telephone and electricity firms, 
railroads and oil companies.

SANTA BARBARA WOMAN KILLED WHEN ROCK CRASHES THROUGH WINDSHIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A football-sized rock smashed through a car windshield Friday morning and 
fatally injured a woman who was on her way to Las Vegas with her father for a 
family reunion, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Ann Johnson, 32, of Santa Barbara died after she was struck on the 
head about 10 a.m. by the small boulder that apparently had been kicked up by 
another vehicle, authorities said.The mother of 1- and 3-year-old boys was 
pronounced dead two hours later at Ventura County Medical Center, Deputy 
Coroner Craig Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred on a stretch of two-lane California 126 near Hopper 
Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's father, Ronald Fraas, 60, who was driving a rented car, at first 
thought the boulder was a pine cone bounding on the road. Then the rock crashed 
through the windshield, struck his daughter and broke through the back window, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was as bad as it gets," said county Fire Capt. Mike Lindbery, who rode in 
the ambulance with the victim and her father. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of rubber marks on the rock, found near the accident scene, California 
Highway Patrol Sgt. Mike Cooper speculated that it had been wedged between the 
tires of a truck or bus. GREG RIPPEE

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; GOP LEADERS HOST FEINSTEIN, HAIL HER AS 
STRONG ADVOCATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein enjoyed the gratitude Friday of some Republican hosts 
who said she deserves credit for being a strong California advocate in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday morning, Feinstein was about 10 miles south of the congressional 
district represented by her Republican opponent, Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa 
Barbara). She took a boat tour of a harbor entrance in Ventura where she and 
the local Republican congressman worked to secure federal funding for 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein later flew to California's GOP heartland, Orange County, for a 
fund-raiser that drew about 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Thompson, a prominent GOP contributor and local developer, introduced 
Feinstein at the event by warning voters to study the candidates and not make 
decisions based on television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must demand that this Senate race be run on the record, not the rhetoric," 
she said at the Le Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach. "If we apply that standard, 
there is only one conclusion we can make: We must elect Dianne Feinstein." 
</P>
<P>
 After the lunch, Feinstein joined Republican luminary Peter V. Ueberroth to 
tour a pharmaceutical company that has benefited from tax credits she supported 
to spur research investment. Company officials at Allergan said they have hired 
about 35 researchers with the savings from the tax break. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening, Ueberroth also hosted a fund-raiser at his home for Feinstein 
that raised about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is the most unknown part of Dianne Feinstein: Republican or 
Democrat, if you are living in California, she will go to bat for you," said 
Ueberroth, the former commissioner of baseball and head of the 1984 Olympics in 
Los Angeles. "All of the other Republican leaders who have joined in supporting 
her, what they are pleased about is that California has an advocate." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday was not the first time that Feinstein has been invited into enemy 
territory for accolades. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of prominent Republican farmers and ranchers headed by John Harris 
hosted a fund-raiser for the senator last month near Coalinga. Sherman Block, 
the Republican sheriff of Los Angeles County, has also worked for her campaign. 
And, in Huffington's congressional district, prominent GOP contributor Barney 
Klinger held a fund-raiser in August for Feinstein at his Santa Barbara home. 
</P>
<P>
 The support of prominent Republican leaders, however, has not translated into 
a shift of GOP voters to Feinstein, according to polls. A survey published by 
The Times on Friday found Feinstein supported by 23% of registered Republicans 
while Huffington was backed by 22% of the state's Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Feinstein was leading Huffington in the poll by seven points among

has received was not going to be significant in the outcome of the race.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; GOP LEADERS HOST FEINSTEIN, HAIL HER AS A 
STRONG ADVOCATE FOR THE STATE 
</P>

<P>
 Sen. Dianne Feinstein enjoyed the gratitude Friday of some Republican hosts 
who said she deserves credit for being a strong California advocate in the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday morning, Feinstein was about 10 miles south of the congressional 
district represented by her Republican opponent, Rep. Mike Huffington (R-Santa 
Barbara). She took a boat tour of a harbor entrance in Ventura where she and 
the local Republican congressman worked to secure federal funding for 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein later flew to California's GOP heartland, Orange County, for a 
fund-raiser that drew about 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Thompson, a prominent GOP contributor and local developer, introduced 
Feinstein at the event by warning voters to study the candidates and not make 
decisions based on television commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must demand that this Senate race be run on the record, not the rhetoric," 
she said at the Le Meridien Hotel in Newport Beach. "If we apply that standard, 
there is only one conclusion we can make: We must elect Dianne Feinstein." 
</P>
<P>
 After the lunch, Feinstein joined Republican luminary Peter V. Ueberroth to 
tour a pharmaceutical company that has benefited from tax credits she supported 
to spur research investment. Company officials at Allergan said they have hired 
about 35 researchers with the savings from the tax break. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening, Ueberroth also hosted a fund-raiser at his home for Feinstein 
that raised about $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is the most unknown part of Dianne Feinstein: Republican or 
Democrat, if you are living in California, she will go to bat for you," said 
Ueberroth, the former commissioner of baseball and head of the 1984 Olympics in 
Los Angeles. "All of the other Republican leaders who have joined in supporting 
her, what they are pleased about is that California has an advocate." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday was not the first time that Feinstein has been invited into enemy 
territory for accolades. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of prominent Republican farmers and ranchers headed by John Harris 
hosted a fund-raiser for the senator last month near Coalinga. Sherman Block, 
the Republican sheriff of Los Angeles County, has also worked for her campaign. 
And, in Huffington's congressional district, prominent GOP contributor Barney 
Klinger held a fund-raiser in August for Feinstein at his Santa Barbara home. 
</P>
<P>
 The support of prominent Republican leaders, however, has not translated into 
a shift of GOP voters to Feinstein, according to polls. A survey published by 
The Times on Friday found Feinstein supported by 23% of registered Republicans 
while Huffington was backed by 22% of the state's Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, Feinstein was leading Huffington in the poll by seven points among 
the voters considered most likely to cast ballots Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington campaign officials Friday were critical of the Republicans who have 
broken ranks and backed Feinstein. But they also said the GOP support Feinstein 
has received was not going to be significant in the outcome of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Ueberroth is a Republican, then Beavis and Butt-Head are Rhodes scholars," 
said Huffington spokeswoman Jennifer Grossman. "She's fine to pick off a couple 
of wishy-washy Republicans because we're going after Reagan Democrats, and 
they'll provide us our edge." 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, Feinstein was joined by Rep. Elton Gallegly for a shipside news 
conference about the $6 million federal funding they acquired to improve the 
harbor entrance. With the improvements, the area is expected to generate more 
fishing and shipping activity, creating jobs, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the things being on an Appropriations Committee means," 
Feinstein said at a shipside press conference about 100 yards off the Ventura 
coast. "It means seeing that your community gets a fair share in practical, 
prudent improvements which can encourage and improve the quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said he is not supporting Feinstein, but he has also declined to 
endorse Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-term congressman acknowledged that he still has hard feelings toward 
Huffington, who defeated former Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), to win 
election to the House in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tragedy not that he was defeated, but how he was defeated," Gallegly 
said, referring to the record $5.2 million Huffington spent on his 
congressional race. "There's still some personal feelings there, but sometimes 
you have to put aside those feelings."

AST LAYOFFS: ANOTHER JOLT FOR O.C.; IT TURNED DARK AT DAWN IN FOUNTAIN VALLEY 
PLANT; JOBLESS: A 6 A.M. MEETING BROUGHT WORD OF LAYOFF AND IMMINENT CLOSURE. 
THE 100 WHO LOST JOBS IMMEDIATELY ARE TOLD PERSONALLY BY SUPERVISORS.

<P>
 The bad news broke at dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Corvarruvias, a stockroom worker at AST Research Inc.'s manufacturing 
facility in Fountain Valley, learned of the plant's pending closure at 6 a.m. 
-- two hours into what turned out to be his last day on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yesterday they told us that there would be a meeting at 6 o'clock this 
morning," Corvarruvias said Friday as he commiserated with a fellow worker in 
the parking lot. "There's been lots of rumors lately but nothing for sure . . . 
until now." 
</P>
<P>
 Debra Harris, 35, heard about AST's restructuring on a radio broadcast as she 
was driving to work. "That was not very nice," said Harris, a senior buyer and 
planner. 
</P>
<P>
 Most employees, though, got the word -- that 440 of them will be out of work 
soon -- from AST executives during two early morning meetings inside the plant. 
Supervisors subsequently told employees personally if they were among the first 
100 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 AST, projecting a $40-million loss for its first fiscal quarter, blames the 
closing of its Fountain Valley plant on a fierce price war in the personal 
computer market and new-product delays. And the company had warned as early as 
last November that it would be consolidating some operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The layoff, however, also reflects a continuing erosion of electronics 
assembly jobs in Orange County and nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 14,000 such jobs have disappeared in Orange County since 1998, 
according to industry data. Among the hardest hit have been recent arrivals, 
particularly Asian and Latino immigrants and refugees. Asians in particular 
have gone into electronics assembly work, said Marianne Blank, executive 
director of St. Anselm Cross-Cultural Community Center in Garden Grove, a 
nonprofit group that has helped thousands of refugees, most from Southeast 
Asia, find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County job retraining program administrators urged AST employees who 
get pink slips to take advantage of job retraining and career planning services 
available through the company and government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it takes awhile for people to let the grief settle," said Margo 
West, manager of planning for the Private Industry Council, which oversees the 
county's federally funded jobs retraining programs. "But we really feel that 
the programs give individuals an assist, give them some options for the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 AST said Friday that counselors are helping employees refine interviewing 
skills and update resumes. The company is also contacting other employers to 
help locate job openings. And workers dismissed Friday will receive their 
regular salaries and medical benefits for the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
 But West acknowledged that job prospects in Southern California's ailing 
high-tech industries are not bright. 
</P>
<P>
 "There does seem to be a slight upturn in the economy," West said. "But 
clearly the shift in jobs in Orange County has been to the service jobs, where 
wages are not generally compatible with what these people are leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's layoffs were doubly painful for AST employees, Corvarruvias among 
them, who survived last November's layoffs.  
</P>
<P>
 "The first time they had a work reduction they combined my job with others," 
said Corvarruvias, a 33-year-old Santa Ana resident. "I hoped I was safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, a 35-year-old Fountain Valley resident who purchased materials for AST 
from international suppliers, hopes to sign on with some other Orange County 
company involved in foreign trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way this is a relief," he said. "It's been very stressful for all of us 
for a long time now. Today is the day they finally pulled the plug." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, who started sending resumes out earlier this week, said she is 
"networking with everyone I know. That's the key. I learned from a layoff eight 
years ago with another company that you have to be prepared."

EX-SEN. CARPENTER ORDERED UNTIED FROM BED, COURT SAYS

<P>
 A high court said Friday that it has ordered a former California state senator 
who was convicted on political corruption charges untied from his hospital bed, 
where he is dying of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Carpenter, 66, was convicted in Sacramento on Dec. 1, 1993, of 
conspiracy, mail fraud and obstruction of justice in a complicated bribery 
plot.He faced up to seven years in prison but left the United States before his 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 He was arrested in Costa Rica earlier this year and faces extradition back to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his arrest, he told friends he had come to Costa Rica to seek medical 
treatment he couldn't find in the United States. He has terminal prostate 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 When the United States requested his extradition, Costa Rican authorities tied 
the former Democratic senator to his hospital bed with two steel straps to 
prevent a possible escape. 
</P>
<P>
 The Constitutional Court said in a news release Friday that it had ordered the 
straps removed.

AST LAYOFFS: ANOTHER JOLT FOR O.C.; NEWS COMES AS SURPRISE -- BUT IT SHOULDN'T 
HAVE; DOWNSIZING: COMPUTER MAKER'S FOUNDER DROPPED FIRST HINT IN SPRING. 
INDUSTRY ANALYSTS SAY CUTS ALONE WON'T CURE ALL ITS ILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 AST Research Inc.'s decision to lay off 10% of its workers and close its 
Fountain Valley manufacturing plant caught technology industry observers by 
surprise, but it shouldn't have -- the computer company's top executive dropped 
the first hints last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 At a conference in March, when other executives were complaining about 
corporate changes, the bearded, soft-spoken Pakistani who co-founded AST took 
the floor to present a different view. "If I do not change," AST Chairman Safi 
I. Qureshey said, "I cannot lead, because the company has to change." 
</P>
<P>
 The magnitude of the changes announced Friday at AST may be even greater than 
Qureshey had anticipated six months ago, however, and will surely test the 
leadership of the company's chairman and other executives. AST said it will 
post a loss of about $40 million for its current quarter and will cut 700 jobs 
from its payroll, including 440 in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said that AST's troubles are not simply a result of industry 
competition: Though renowned for its successes, the 14-year-old company has 
been plagued by internal problems and is suffering losses while some of its 
competitors -- notably Compaq Computer Corp. and IBM Corp. -- are reporting 
profits and increased sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the decisions to lay off so many people was a surprise, said Kimball 
Brown, a high-technology industry analyst with Dataquest Inc. in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is reeling from the computer industry price wars but, more 
critically, from internal problems, including delays in new-product development 
and difficulties absorbing the huge Tandy Corp. manufacturing operations it 
acquired for $175 million last year, Brown said. "They are struggling to get 
the Tandy operation assimilated." 
</P>
<P>
 AST President James T. Schraith said Friday that the layoffs are just part of 
the plan to jumnp-start the company. The number of computer models that AST 
offers will be trimmed, he said, as will the number of options -- types of disk 
drives, monitors, graphics adapters and printers, for instance -- that 
customers can order. That will enable AST to cut costs by stocking only the 
most popular configurations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, AST will step up its North American marketing efforts while 
cutting back in areas such as Africa where its growth has been relatively slow, 
he said. The company also will institute a major internal cost-control effort. 
Instead of sending customers expensive printed manuals for the processing unit, 
monitor and other components of a system, AST may program the manuals directly 
into the memory of each machine it sells, Schraith said. While that would force 
the customer to print out the manuals, it would save AST a bundle on printing 
costs -- at an average of six manuals per computer, the company printed and 
shipped nearly 9 million instruction books last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fixing things won't be easy, said Stephen Dube of Wasserstein Perella 
Securities in New York. "There is no quick management fix. It is a matter of 
keeping everything on track." 
</P>
<P>
 That is "a complicated business," he said. "But there is a reasonable chance 
they will pull it out." 
</P>
<P>
 AST cannot make its problems disappear, though, simply by closing a plant and 
weathering a losing quarter, analysts said. And many expect the company to have 
at least six months of poor earnings before there are any signs of recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this kind of market there are no real assurances," said Kevin McCarthy, an 
analyst with NatWest Securities in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In a conference call with analysts early Friday morning, AST officials 
discussed the company's finances and production difficulties and said "this is 
the worst it will get -- that it can only get better," McCarthy said. "But they 
don't completely have a handle on the situation, and that is the greatest 
concern." 
</P>
<P>
 G. Richard Thoman, head of IBM's personal computer operations after a shake-up 
there in May, said the essentials for survival in the PC industry are "quality, 
cost and speed." 
</P>
<P>
 AST has lost the advantage of speed and is being hurt by having to sell an 
older generation of products at steeply discounted prices, analysts said, while 
competitors such as Compaq, Toshiba and IBM are hitting the mercurial PC market 
with a spate of machines using the newest chips -- and are slashing prices 
while doing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry leader Compaq, with 13.6% of all PC sales in the United States, has 
slashed its prices almost 50% over the past several years -- including 
across-the-board cuts of 11% to 22% less than two months ago. IBM followed suit 
a week later, and AST had to cut already reduced prices without anything new to 
offer customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were behind the curve," analyst McCarthy said. "They are having to get 
out the old stuff (while) the competition was on time." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of AST's problems developed last year after the company bought Tandy's 
Texas-based manufacturing operation. To take advantage of Tandy's bigger 
facilities, AST relocated several hundred jobs from California to Texas and 
moved an assembly plant from Scotland to Ireland. A total of 1,000 jobs were 
eliminated, and 850 positions were created in the moves. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuffling slowed both production and product development efforts, which 
have been further hampered by shortages of components manufactured by outside 
vendors. The company consequently announced last month that its newest notebook 
computers and CD-ROM-equipped personal computers would be delayed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dube said the company "will not recover until it gets a great line out and 
beats the competition. Right now they are getting slaughtered by Compaq and 
IBM." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent report by Dataquick shows that AST lost almost a fourth of its share 
of the PC market last year, falling to a 2.8% share from 3.6% in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But AST can get back on track, said Albert Wong, who with Qureshey and Thomas 
Yuen co-founded the company in 1980. "They are doing what they have to do," 
said Wong, an engineering and manufacturing processes specialist who left the 
company in 1989 to strike out on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 AST, with almost $2.4 billion in annual sales, "is a substantial company," 
Wong said. "And they will change their product line and their business 
(strategy) to meet what the market demands." 
</P>
<P>
 The key, though, analysts said, is whether the company can make the changes 
fast enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you miss a month or two, it takes a long time to get back on track," Dube 
said. "The question is whether they can regain the market share they have 
lost."

 STATION PARTY: It's open house today at many local fire departments, part of 
National Fire Prevention Week. In Huntington Beach, firefighters will conduct a 
mock rescue and demonstrate rappelling into buildings. . . . In Fountain 
Valley, youngsters will test their speed at putting on fire equipment during 
emergencies. And parents can get their fire extinguishers charged. Says 
Fountain Valley fire spokeswoman Kathy Williams: "It will be a family-oriented 
day."

 GOING SOLAR: When Mark and Joanna Konno lost their home at 1325 Bounty Way in 
last year's Laguna Beach firestorm, they went to Chris Prelitz of Seacrest 
Buildings. He's a specialist in solar houses, reducing standard energy use in 
both hot and cool weather. . . . Solar product distributors are so impressed 
with the rebuilt home that -- with the Konnos' blessing -- it's included in a 
nationwide tour of such homes they've arranged today -- open to the public from 
10 a.m. to 3 p.m.

 NEW MAY DAY: Remember those waning days of struggling Cal State Fullerton

Titans were losing week after week? What would those Titan coaches from 1991 
think of him now? May has led Kansas State to a 4-0 season, has helped bring 
the team a rare Top 20 ranking, and is now touted as a possible pro football 
draft pick. . . . Today, May meets the biggest challenge of his career when 
Kansas State hosts No. 2-ranked Nebraska.

 Fingerprinting welfare recipients has saved Los Angeles County $4.5 million in

 The program, a potential national model, is designed to ensure that applicants 
for Aid to Families With Dependent Children are not using fake IDs to receive 
more than one set of benefits a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The county spends $160 million each month in AFDC benefits to 900,000 poor 
people, including children. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the $21-million, three-year program, known as AFIRM, has identified 
for prosecutors 62 cases of apparent "multiple-aid fraud," and savings appear 
to be 50% higher than originally projected, according to an audit by the 
accounting firm of Ernst & Young. 
</P>
<P>
 "Preliminary results show AFIRM will lead to significant benefit savings, 
potentially as high as $116 million . . . over the remaining 26 months of the 
pilot," says a summary of a draft Ernst & Young report, submitted this week to 
the county Commission for Public Social Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the county began fingerprinting recipients in the much 
smaller General Relief program in a pilot project so successful that it has 
been copied in Orange, Alameda and San Francisco counties. Last spring, the 
county received federal approval to try the same thing with AFDC recipients, 
most of whom live in poor single-parent families or families in which the 
parents are unemployed or disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the glowing progress report, advocates for the poor remained skeptical 
and questioned whether legitimate recipients were being denied aid because they 
had failed to receive notice of the new fingerprinting requirement or were too 
frightened to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 As the county begins fingerprinting all new AFDC applicants, about 325,000 
already-approved, adult recipients are being asked by mail to come in and have 
their index fingers electronically photographed. Those who don't are 
automatically dropped from the rolls, and it is those case cancellations that 
account for a substantial portion of August's $4.5 million in savings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't make the assumption that because someone didn't come in, they're 
cheating," said Meg Baum of the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Some welfare recipients are forced to move so much they do not receive their 
mail on time, or they live in neighborhoods where mail is often stolen, Baum 
said. And some may have such a deep distrust of authority that they fear their 
fingerprints will be shared with American police, immigration officials, or 
police in their native countries, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wonder why we pour so much energy into creating obstacles for people to get 
enough money to be able to eat and have shelter and take care of their 
children," Baum said. "I mean, why are we so self-congratulatory that we've 
saved $4.5 million? If you want to save a whole lot more than that, then why 
not shut down the whole program?" 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Fast, director of research and statistics for the county's Department of 
Public Social Services, acknowledged that many of the canceled cases were 
probably not fraudulent and that it is just a matter of time before legitimate 
aid recipients are persuaded to get fingerprinted and have their cases 
reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 Once that happens, Fast continued, the savings from the program will be lower 
than Ernst & Young's preliminary projections, though still substantial. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, he said, the department's fraud-investigation unit has randomly 
selected 120 cancellations to determine why the aid recipients failed to get 
fingerprinted -- if they misunderstood the intent of the program, never 
received notice, or were indeed afraid to incriminate themselves in 
multiple-aid fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 In touting the benefits of the project this week to social-services 
commissioners, Fast said it made more sense for the financially strapped county 
to spend money on tracking cheaters "instead of punishing the innocent with 
across-the-board cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $2 billion a year the county spends on AFDC benefits, an estimated 1.5% 
stems from mutiple-aid fraud, or double- and triple-dipping by people with 
false identification, said AFIRM Director Lisa Nunez. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that is not the most rampant form of welfare fraud, Nunez said, it is 
among the costliest. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the concerns of Baum and others, Fast said the county has no plans to 
share fingerprint information with law-enforcement or immigration authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 While the number of county residents receiving all types of welfare has 
doubled in the last five years -- from 1 in 10 to 1 in 5, according to Fast -- 
the number of case workers has remained constant, making it harder for them to 
know their clients personally and spot suspicious cases. 
</P>
<P>
 For its report, Ernst & Young surveyed aid recipients and found that only 3% 
openly resented being fingerprinted, while 95% felt that AFIRM would be 
effective in preventing multiple case fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think recipients feel this will make the (welfare) program more credible," 
Fast said.

CITYSCAPES / LAURA A. GALLOWAY: PARKING SHORTAGE AT COLLEGE CREATES LOTS OF 
AGGRAVATION; "WE HAVE HAD A REPUTATION OF HAVING THE WORST PARKING PROBLEM IN 
THE STATE." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURA A. GALLOWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Pasadena City College, the hunt for parking has taken on Darwinian 
proportions: 
</P>
<P>
 Call it survival of the earliest. 
</P>
<P>
 At PCC, an estimated 28,000 students must compete for only 1,600 spaces, 
turning the school's $20-a-semester parking permit into what Chief of Campus 
Police Phil Mullendore describes as a "hunting license." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had a reputation of having the worst parking problem in the state," 
Mullendore said. 
</P>
<P>
 A rapidly growing student population and the ongoing construction of a new 
parking structure -- which has shut down one lot and a chunk of a second -- are 
pushing the situation toward critical mass. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which was painfully evident one recent morning to Antonio Zarco. 
</P>
<P>
 For 45 minutes and countless sweeps of parking lot B, Zarco had been searching 
for a parking spot -- any spot. Anxious to get to class, he spotted a solution 
in the form of another student on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Slamming the brakes on his Toyota truck, he shouted out of the car window and 
begged for someone, anyone, to hop in his car for a second so he could take 
advantage of the school's car-pool lot. 
</P>
<P>
 He had recently called it quits with his girlfriend, leaving him with no love 
life and, more important, no warm body to help him gain access to the car-pool 
parking area. "We broke up and now it's really hard to get to school on time," 
Zarco said. "Unless you're 
</P>
<P>
 dating someone, it's really hard to park." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even finding a spot in the car-pool lot isn't an easy task in this little 
corner of parking hell. This is where the "survival of the earliest" notion 
comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a 10 a.m. class and we try to get here at 7:30," said Mercy 
Plascencia, a student who had car-pooled with her sister and another friend. 
"We stay from 8 to 10 in the cafeteria, because if we come any later, we just 
can't get any parking," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cars begin creeping down Colorado Boulevard as early as 6:30 a.m., as 
groggy students attempt to scope out one of the few spots along the busy 
thoroughfare. When all else fails, many find their way down the city's tidy, 
bungalow-lined residential streets -- the long walk or threat of a ticket be 
damned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even try to get in a lot. It's no use," said Nancy Mogollon, a health 
management major who had parked her car several blocks away on Walnut Street. 
While the choice of parking spots typically tacks on 10 minutes to her 
classroom arrival time, she said it's easier than circling the parking lots or 
being accosted by students looking for escorts to the car-pool lot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For some time, residents of the usually tranquil, tree-lined streets around 
the campus were less than thrilled with the student invasion that clogged 
roads, created noise pollution and often blocked driveways. So many lodged 
complaints, in fact, that the city of Pasadena took action with what is known 
as the Preferential Parking Program. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, currently in effect on 27 residential blocks, mostly south of the 
campus, allots a 50/50 share of parking for residents and students with permits 
on at least one side of the street. As the plan now stands, parking will shift 
to residents only in January, when the new structure at the college is 
completed, creating 2,000 new spaces for the students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a lot of traffic -- and I'd like to see less," said Sierra Bonita 
Avenue resident Marco Bonifaz. But on the flip side, "I have three friends that 
go to Pasadena City College, and I let them park in my driveway," he said. Even 
with the permit program on many of the streets, Bonifaz often sees cars being 
towed from the area, a result of commuters without permits attempting to score 
the ever-elusive parking spot. And when the neighborhood streets and school 
spaces fill up, some are compelled to seek out customer parking at fast-food 
joints and area strip malls, an act that usually results in a stern warning or 
a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Sanchez, 21, has been dropped from a class for being late because, he 
said, he used his "no parking place" excuse too many times for his professor to 
believe. To avoid suffering the same fate in other classes, he risked parking 
in a nearby lot reserved for customers of a strip mall. The result: two parking 
tickets that are still unpaid. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are only $25 each," he said of the tickets, "but I don't have a job 
right now and I'm not about to ask my parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, he adds defensively: "I needed to park." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, other local colleges have parking problems, too. Across town at 
USC, security officers at the University Village shopping complex have taken to 
videotaping students who masquerade as shoppers for the sake of snagging a 
parking space. When the students return from campus, they find their cars towed 
and their plausible deniability gone. After all, the camera doesn't lie. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pasadena, some merchants have decided to cash in on the parking crisis 
rather than fight it. At the Burger King on Colorado Boulevard and Bonnie 
Avenue, directly west of the campus, students can park all day for a mere $2 -- 
if they arrive in time to secure a spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a unique situation. We have to control the parking, and that's how we do 
it," said Martin Rooney, assistant manager of the eatery. But even that 
solution has its downside. A Whopper does not a parking permit make. 
</P>
<P>
 One student who was curbed by restaurant management for eating lunch and then 
heading to school for an hour and a half threatened to call a lawyer over his 
right to park after eating. Rules are rules, Rooney told him. "I told him that 
the parking limit for the dining room is 30 minutes," Rooney said.

STILL MIGHTY AT 90; ANTON BURG IS LAUDED FOR HIS SCIENCE AS WELL AS HIS 
HUMANITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 That wasn't another Nobel Prize being announced Friday at USC as a happy crowd 
surrounding veteran chemistry professor Anton Burg pumped his hand and offered 
congratulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Burg was winning something even more precious to a 90-year-old -- admiration 
from those who have never forgotten him, or his effect on their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 During three-quarters of a century in the lab, Burg pioneered research that 
led to development of Teflon and plastic polyethylene. The 10 years he headed 
the USC chemistry department are credited by officials for making the place 
attractive to scholars such as Prof. George Olah, who won a Nobel Prize 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Always the individualist outside the lab as well as in, Burg has never driven 
a car. For half a century, he has bicycled around Los Angeles, pedaling to 
research seminars and classroom lectures and waving away offers of rides from 
students and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was fitting that friends and scientists who came from as far away as 
England started an all-day science symposium and birthday celebration in Burg's 
honor by cheering him as he pumped his 21-speed bike onto campus Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Anton," University of Sussex chemistry professor John Nixon said with 
a laugh as his mentor braked to a stop outside the hall where the daylong 
discussion of boranes and fullerenes, phospha-alkynes and icosahedral 
metallacarboranes was about to get under way. "Always enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Burg's enthusiasm for academic research that steered Nixon into his own 
career when he was doing postdoctoral work here in 1960, recalled the British 
professor. Similar testimonials would be given all day long among the more than 
100 scientists and scholars attending the Burg Symposium. 
</P>
<P>
 Between lectures, scientists swapped Burg stories, reminding each other of the 
important discoveries that had come from the old man's test tubes over the 
decades. They talked of how one of Burg's theories laid the groundwork for one 
of his colleagues to years later win a Nobel Prize. They recalled how a 1930s 
lab accident caused by exploding diaborane blinded him in one eye. 
</P>
<P>
 They laughed over Burg's penchant for limericks and his unflagging interest in 
Lewis Carroll's "Alice in Wonderland." They talked of his proposals to take the 
boredom out of spectator sports by rewriting the rules for baseball, football 
and basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a real sense of humor, an ability to bring dry subjects to life," said 
Peter Slota, a retired Riverside research chemist who studied under Burg 
between 1954 and 1958. "He still does." 
</P>
<P>
 Retired USC chemistry professor Sidney Benson told how Burg prevented fire 
marshals from condemning an old Army barracks building that USC was using as a 
chemistry lab in 1946. When they complained that there was only one exit from 
the second floor, Burg jumped out a second-story window. 
</P>
<P>
 "He landed on the ground down below and yelled out, 'See, that's all there is 
to it,' " Benson recalled. "The Fire Department approved the lab for use. The 
rest of us were ready to lynch Anton -- we were hoping they'd get rid of the 
old barracks. We ended up using them for another 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Adamson, another former chemistry professor, recounted how Burg once 
pedaled 22 miles to attend a Christmas party at Adamson's home. "Nobody thought 
it was odd that he did that. But we thought it was an exceptional effort for a 
party," Adamson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burg, who never married, seemed to enjoy talking about bicycles as much as 
talking about boron hydrides -- one of his research specialties. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gone through eight bikes," explained Burg, who quit teaching in 1974. 
"Of course, three of them were stolen." 
</P>
<P>
 He discussed his love of verse and how humor can be used to help teachers and 
students "grow together." He recounted his very first days at USC in 1939, when 
he was tapped to jump-start a science department that "was only one step ahead 
of alchemy" -- in the words of one official. 
</P>
<P>
 "He single-handedly created the department of chemistry," acknowledged Prof. 
Philip Stephens, the department's current chairman. And the work that on 
Wednesday brought a Nobel Prize to Olah "was built on the foundation" that Burg 
laid, Stephens added. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Olah, Burg "never got the recognition I believe he deserved." He 
said Burg was puzzled why he was being honored on his 90th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said it would probably be more appropriate 10 years from now," Olah said. 
"Then Anton looked at me and added, 'Well, maybe all you fellows won't be 
around then.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Another Nobel laureate, chemist William Lipscomb of Harvard University, was 
among those giving lectures during Friday's seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 But Burg was the person that Ryden Richardson, a 73-year-old retired research 
scientist from Whittier who studied under Burg in the early 1940s, wanted to 
see again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came here today out of appreciation," Richardson said. "And love."

BOARD OKS $22.5 MILLION FOR LIBRARIES, REJECTS TAX; GOVERNMENT: SUPERVISORS TAP 
GENERAL FUND FOR ALLOCATION. OFFICIALS HOPE TO RETURN MOST OF 87 FACILITIES IN 
COUNTY SYSTEM TO FULL SCHEDULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Struggling against a deadline to resolve how best to fund its beleaguered 
public library system, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted Friday 
against levying a new library tax, opting instead to allocate $22.5 million in 
disputed general funds to bolster services. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's action effectively restores library funding to its 1992-93 levels 
and will result in the rehiring of hundreds of library workers laid off over 
the last two years. In addition, county officials hope to return most of the 
system's 87 libraries to full seven-day-a-week operating schedules and resume 
regular purchases of books. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decision was a victory for library supporters but failed to 
resolve the issue of long-term funding for the system. Also, some decried the 
plan because of conflicting interpretations about the amount of surplus general 
fund money available. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the tax had counted on it to provide a stable, ongoing source of 
funding. The board left intact its ability to levy a future library tax, but 
the issue would have to be revisited during next year's budget sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 County Librarian Sandra Reuben had mixed emotions about the board's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having just received really strong support from the board, I should be 
jumping in the air," she said. "But I want to get to a position where we don't 
have to rely on general funds. With the actions (Friday), I can't be quite 
certain about the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The failed tax would have been levied on property owners in unincorporated 
areas of the county and in 16 cities that had opted to join the assessment 
district. The annual fee would have cost the average homeowner about $28.50 but 
could have run as high as several hundred dollars for large commercial or 
industrial properties. 
</P>
<P>
 The board was under the gun to resolve the issue by Friday in order to get 2.5 
million tax bills prepared and mailed on time. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors sought to allay some of Reuben's fears by voting to establish 
a future annual minimum general fund allocation of $10 million for libraries, 
with the amount to increase to $20 million if the budget shows a surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics said that approach would still leave libraries vulnerable to 
shifting financial constraints and would hamstring supervisors in meeting other 
county service needs. Some of the funds allocated Friday to the libraries, for 
example, had been set aside for public safety needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money we're giving libraries . . . is a false hope because it doesn't put 
funding on a secure basis, and it takes away from us valuable resources we may 
need," said Supervisor Ed Edelman, who was alone in voting against taking the 
library money from the general fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, who will leave office in December after five terms, said the board's 
action Friday is a grave error, "one of the greatest since I've been here." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing concern about the county's uncertain financial footing, Chief 
Administrative Officer Sally Reed had urged the board to keep the library tax. 
She argued that the county's budget reserves are far less than what has been 
calculated by some supervisors and that any unanticipated revenue has been 
swallowed up in filling 1994-95 budget shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, about $600 million in federal health-care reimbursements that the 
county already included in the budget are in jeopardy because the federal 
government has yet to decide whether to accept the county's claims for the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 If the reimbursements fail to materialize, the board may be forced to make 
sweeping cuts in services, Reed told the board. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of the library tax disputed Reed's assessment and argued that 
the board should not increase property taxes without a referendum. Two taxpayer 
watchdog groups already had filed suit against the county arguing that the tax 
would be illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most taxpayers are saying that this argument about the choice of whether to 
fund libraries or raise property taxes is nuts," said Kris Vosburgh, executive 
vice president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. "The county has the money 
to fund libraries . . . and they should get on to more pressing business." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gloria Molina agreed: "My budget people have looked at it, and I am 
confident the money is there." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision not to levy the library tax, after an hour of public testimony 
and debate, marked the end of several weeks of sometimes bitter deliberations 
on library funding, but few involved in the process were completely satisfied 
with the result. 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, for example, the board's most liberal member and an ardent library 
supporter, found himself in a philosophical quandary. He eventually voted 
against the general fund appropriation and sided with conservative Supervisor 
Mike Antonovich in opposing the majority's decision to keep the assessment 
district intact for a possible future tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke voted with the majority to tap the general 
fund despite grave misgivings about the fairness of using tax money to pay for 
library services that only some county residents will use. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a political decision," Burke said. "I have no question that it is 
ill-conceived and unjustified, but we have to live within reality." 
</P>
<P>
 The reality facing both Burke and Edelman was the shifting alliances on the 
board regarding budget issues, with Supervisor Gloria Molina often playing the 
role of spoiler. 
</P>
<P>
 Only six weeks ago, Molina had voted with Burke and Edelman to approve the 
library assessment. But Molina, a liberal who is generally fiscally 
conservative, also had requested that the matter be brought back for 
reconsideration after the county's financial books were closed to determine if 
the tax would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina went so far as to intervene last month to halt the property tax 
mailing, contending that officials were trying to sneak through the library 
tax. On Friday, however, she voted with the majority to keep the tax district 
in place.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
HEALTH AGENCY URGES NEEDLE EXCHANGE PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Department of Health Services, in a report to be presented to the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors next week, is recommending the 
implementation of a countywide needle exchange program to help stem the spread 
of the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
 The report concludes that needle exchange is an appropriate public health 
measure that could help to prevent or control disease.It urges the board to 
adopt a carefully designed exchange program that would include a strong 
prevention message and community outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 Needle exchanges are illegal under state law, but several cities and counties 
allow private groups to distribute clean needles to drug users to help prevent 
the spread of the HIV infection. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials have declared the AIDS epidemic a local public health 
emergency to facilitate needle exchange.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GARDENA; WOMAN LIVED 
WITH CORPSE UP TO 3 MONTHS, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Gardena woman lived as long as three months with a corpse before neighbors 
complained of an unpleasant odor coming from the apartment, authorities said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The corpse, which was in the middle of the living room, had been wrapped in 
black plastic material, and old newspapers had been placed next to the body, 
said Gardena Police Lt. John Fodor.Officials have not yet identified the body, 
but they believe it is the remains of the woman's 77-year-old mother, who lived 
in the apartment, he said.

 The 47-year-old daughter, whose name has not been released, was taken to 
County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center for psychological evaluation. Police believe 
the elderly woman died of natural causes, and no charges have been filed.  
</P>
<P>
 Police discovered the corpse Wednesday after neighbors complained of a pungent 
odor coming from the apartment building in the 1000 block of West 159th Street. 
Family members apparently had telephoned the 77-year-old woman for months but 
were told by the daughter that she was not home, he said.

 Happy Hollyween!A colleague of ours reports that when she saw "Ed Wood" at the 
Los Feliz Theater, there were some ghoulish treats in the lobby -- free copies 
of the death certificates of Wood and Bela Lugosi. 
</P>
<P>
 Which seemed appropriate (at least for Hollywood), considering that Wood was 
the transvestite writer-director who specialized in schlocky horror features. 
And Lugosi was in his stable of players. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hungarian actor was supposed to have starred in Wood's "Plan 9 From Outer 
Space" but died in the early stages of filming in 1956. Unfazed, Wood kept the 
footage of Lugosi and shot the rest of the movie using a double, whose face was 
obscured the entire time. No surprise that many film buffs regard "Plan 9" as 
the worst movie ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, the death certificate copies, in the true spirit of the City of 
Angles, were publicity handouts of a sort. They carried ads that proclaimed: 
"Compliments of Grave Line Tours -- The Best Tour in Los Angeles. You'll Dig 
It!" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 But what does his sidekick Doug Llewelyn say?One of the opponents of 
Proposition 190, which would restructure the state commission that disciplines 
judges, is retired L.A. Superior Court Judge Joseph A. Wapner. 
</P>
<P>
 He became better known as the star of TV's "People's Court." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in one nationwide poll, Wapner had more name recognition than any 
member of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Art imitates unreality: Turns out there's yet another twist on the old urban 
folk tale about the kinky husband in the Batman costume. Stephen King's 1992 
thriller, "Gerald's Game," involves a woman whose husband cuffs her to the 
bedposts -- one time too many as it turns out. She kicks him below the 
midsection, and he not only falls unconscious but dies of a heart attack.  
</P>
<P>
 In this version, though, the husband has no costume. He's nude. (That's our 
one gripe about Stephen King -- the guy has no imagination.) 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, some readers may consider King's story a humorous twist. The husband 
is a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Decision time: UCLA professor Byron Myhre photographed today's sign on a 
street in Big Bear and was moved to quote Robert Frost: "Two roads diverged in 
a wood, and I -- I took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially with these rising health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Why do we always end up on the road more traveled by?It seems as though every 
time we're stuck in a traffic jam on the freeway, we see a billboard ad that 
says: TIRES JUST AHEAD. 
</P>
<P>
 And we feel like screaming: "We know! We know! All we see are tires just 
ahead!" miscelLAny Mimi Melnick, co-author of "Manhole Covers of Los Angeles," 
the authoritative work on that subject, is coming out next with "Manhole 
Covers." It's a collection of more than 200 photos of ornamental sewer lids 
taken by her late husband, Robert Melnick, all over the nation. Local shots 
will include one manhole cover from the UCLA campus. USC partisans will no 
doubt point out that the UCLA lid is symbolic of the inept Bruin football 
team's position at the bottom of the Pac 10 standings.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPTON; PROTEST ASKS 
FASTER PROBE OF OFFICER ACCUSED OF ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Latino activists urged Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti on Friday 
to quicken his investigation of a Compton police officer accused of assaulting 
a teen-ager in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here . . . to ask our district attorney to give us some kind of 
finding," said Art Pulito of the Community Coalition for Justice. "It's been 
almost three months and nothing has happened."  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Botula, a spokesman for the district attorney's office, said Garcetti 
isn't stalling.  
</P>
<P>
 "These investigations do take time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest outside the Downtown Criminal Courts Building came as a result of 
the July 29 incident in which 17-year-old Felipe Soltero was shown on a 
neighbor's videotape being struck by Compton Police Officer Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer was called to the scene that day to assist a social worker who was 
visiting the house, authorities said.

TEACHER ARRESTED ON CAMPUS AFTER COMPLAINT BY STUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A veteran Alhambra teacher was arrested on campus this week after being 
accused of battery by a student. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Monson, 58, who has taught at Mark Keppel High School for 27 years, was 
taken into custody by Alhambra police officers Tuesday. He was released on his 
own recognizance and could not be reached for comment. His attorney declined to 
give Monson's account of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra Police Chief Russ Siverling said Monson was arrested on suspicion of 
misdemeanor battery after a citizen's arrest initiated by a male student. 
Police and school officials declined to identify the 17-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Rocky Caringello said the student was being disciplined for talking in 
Monson's class and was sent to the dean's office. While in the dean's office, 
the boy complained that Monson had struck him on the shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were called and the process of making a citizen's arrest was explained 
to the student. The boy decided that he wanted Monson arrested, Caringello 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Rudy Chavez was asked to bring Monson to the dean's office, where 
Monson was handcuffed and taken into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Caringello said the case is under investigation by police and has not yet been 
forwarded to the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra School District Supt. Heber Meeks declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Monson's attorney, Richard Schwab, said the incident will have a chilling 
effect on all teachers and other authority figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sign of the times," Schwab said. "Everyone who is in a position of 
authority, whether it's a police officer or a teacher, that rug of authority is 
being pulled out from underneath them. The bottom line is even after (Monson) 
is exonerated, the damage has already been done to him and every other 
teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Clark, president of the Alhambra Teachers Assn., said the association 
retained Schwab to defend Monson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think this has to be without foundation because we know the man and he's a 
wonderful man," Clark said of Monson. "He's a social science teacher with high 
ideals. It's pretty hard for me to believe he could harm anyone."

ETHICS OFFICIALS DROP LIMITS ON LOBBYISTS; POLITICS: PROPOSAL WOULD HAVE 
PROHIBITED CONTRIBUTIONS TO CITY OFFICEHOLDERS. VOTES WERE THERE ON COUNCIL, 
PANEL CHAIRMAN SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Facing opposition from members of the Los Angeles City Council, ethics 
officials dropped a proposal Friday that would have prohibited lobbyists who 
have a matter before a city agency from making contributions to elected city 
officials.  
</P>
<P>
 The ban was part of a long-awaited reform package proposed by the city's 
Ethics Commission to regulate contributions to special officeholder accounts 
controlled by each elected city official. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to delete the ban came as the set of spending limits and 
disclosure rules moved a step closer to adoption Friday. The Council's Rules 
and Elections Committee voted to support some of the limits and scheduled 
hearings to consider other elements of the package. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethics Commission Executive Director Benjamin Bycel said he decided to drop 
the ban after committee Chairman Richard Alatorre told him "loud and clear in 
words that I could understand that it would not pass the committee." 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, Alatorre said he told Bycel that the ban on lobbyist 
contributions was not a key change in the reform package and would not win the 
support of the entire council. He said he did not want to jeopardize the entire 
reform package for the sake of keeping the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Bycel "didn't have the votes for it," Alatorre said.  
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre added that council opposition to the ban stemmed from the belief some 
members had that lobbyists should not be "singled out and treated differently" 
from other contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of contributions from lobbyists vary from officeholder to 
officeholder but in most cases amounts to less than half of all donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bycel said the ban was a key measure in the package, he said other 
changes will give ethics officials more power to regulate the spending of 
elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we had a 10-watt light bulb on the activity in the officeholder 
accounts," he said. "Now we have a 200-watt light bulb." 
</P>
<P>
 The officeholder accounts were created as part of a landmark ethics package 
adopted in 1990 after a conflict-of-interest scandal surrounding then-Mayor Tom 
Bradley. Under the current rules, the city's elected officials can only use 
contributions from officeholder accounts for legitimate governmental or 
political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 But a call for reform grew, in part, out of complaints that former city 
Councilman Mike Woo used his officeholder account illegally in 1991 and 1992 to 
get an early start on his campaign for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson was the latest elected official to run afoul of the 
officeholder regulations when the Ethics Commission accused the San Fernando 
Valley lawmaker in April of failing to provide adequate documentation on 69 
expenditures totaling $30,905 from his account in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Bycel and other Ethics Commission officials said they could not act on either 
case because the law was too vague. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed laws, City Council members, the mayor, the city controller 
and the city attorney would be able to collect and spend a maximum of $75,000 a 
year, an increase from the $25,000 limit. But contributions from individuals, 
which had been unlimited, would be capped at $1,000 annually.

SETTING UP HOMELESS CAMP HAS ITS SKEPTICS; SHELTER: RIORDAN HAS CALLED FOR A 
DROP-IN CENTER IN DOWNTOWN. ALTHOUGH COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PROBLEM, SOME CALL 
FOR A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sandwiched in the middle of the debate over Mayor Richard Riordan's plan to 
build a campground for the homeless in the eastern part of Downtown Los Angeles 
are the people who live and work Downtown. For years, they say, the homeless 
have pestered them by asking for money and disturbing their lunchtime meals and 
strolls to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just get in your face. They get mad if you don't give them any money. It 
gets scary sometimes," said Angie Roman, a clerk with the city who was having 
lunch at the Downtown county mall Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor's proposal, which goes to the City Council and later to the County 
Board of Supervisors for a vote, calls for using a vacant city block in the 
city's core industrial area as a drop-in center for the homeless. The 
$4-million shelter, funded by a federal housing grant, would provide a place 
for the homeless to take showers and sleep. One purpose of luring the homeless 
there is to make Downtown friendlier to tourists and more attractive to 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman and her lunchtime companion and co-worker, Sandra Sims, thought that 
Riordan's plan, though good on paper, will not solve a problem that needs more 
comprehensive government action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Downtown is too accommodating. There are too many bars and missions down 
here. Giving them a place for the day won't move them out of here," Sims said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Sims and Roman said the homeless have become too comfortable Downtown, 
going so far as bathing themselves in fountains and falling asleep in front of 
buildings during business hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Sims, who has worked Downtown for 26 years, said she has seen the once-booming 
area turn into a place where pedestrians often have to sidestep "ranting" 
homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason I come to Downtown L.A. is because I work here," Sims said. 
"Otherwise I would avoid this place like the plague." 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Dominguez, 28, an insurance case manager having lunch with his daughter 
Morgan at the Downtown mall, said the idea is novel, but added that the 
homeless need a permanent alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to teach them some job-training skills," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Store owner Robin Ely, who owns Kian's Flowers on Winston and Wall streets, 
said his shop has been robbed four times in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't constantly check your merchandise, they will run up and steal 
things really fast," Ely said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the city's artists loft district, part of the Downtown industrial 
area, say the shelter would hurt efforts to revive the area.  
</P>
<P>
 Artist Enzia Farrell has lived in the loft district for seven years. Near her 
home on 5th and Palmetto streets, homeless men and women congregate on the 
sidewalks and wait for trucks to bring free food. Farrell said the homeless 
will stay near such food source areas, finding ways to scrounge for money. She 
and her roommate, J. Payne, said homeless people break into their cars and 
vandalize their building. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough situation," Farrell said. "But I'm very irritated with the way 
the city is handling the situation. They are trying to be too politically 
correct about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The 28-year-old artist said she had to call her City Council representative 
more than 30 times before "somebody would give me an answer."

1,500 STUDENTS LEAVE CLASS TO PROTEST AGAINST PROP. 187; IMMIGRATION: 
DEMONSTRATORS FROM HIGH SCHOOLS AND JUNIOR HIGHS WALK OUT OF CLASSES. MOST 
LATER RETURN, BUT SOME ARE SUSPENDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 About 1,500 students from high schools and junior high schools in Los Angeles, 
East Los Angeles, Huntington Park, Bell and South Gate left their classrooms 
Friday and demonstrated their opposition to Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not my fault my parents are here illegally," said a 14-year-old 
freshman. "If they have to leave, what am I going to do?" She was one of about 
200 who walked out at 9 a.m. and marched about two miles from their campus at 
Firestone Boulevard and State Street to Atlantic and Florence avenues in Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 As they marched, the students waved banners and signs bearing such slogans as 
"No to 187," "Viva la Revolucion" and "Down With Wilson." (The governor 
supports Proposition 187.) 
</P>
<P>
 The proposition's best-known provisions would bar illegal immigrants from 
public schooling, non-emergency health care and social services. Proponents say 
the measure would help curb continuing, large-scale illegal immigration. 
Opponents consider the measure to be poorly drafted and a xenophobic invitation 
to harass the foreign-born.  
</P>
<P>
 All of Friday's anti-187 demonstrations were generally peaceful, but Bell 
police ordered the dispersal of the crowd at Florence and Atlantic, explaining 
later that officers "wanted to prevent things from getting out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Steve Weber of the Bell Police Department said two students were 
arrested for truancy. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the case of the other demonstrations at Jordan and Fremont high schools 
in central Los Angeles, Roosevelt High School and Stevenson Junior High School 
in East Los Angeles and high schools in Bell and Huntington Park, most of the 
South Gate students returned to class, according to Los Angeles Unified School 
District officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But at South Gate High, Principal Raul Moreno suspended the demonstrators for 
two days for leaving the campus without permission. Moreno -- himself an 
opponent of the proposition -- said that although he sympathized with the 
students' position, they chose an inappropriate way to express their beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, officials announced the suspension of two students who led a 
walkout demonstration against the proposition Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The students -- from Anaheim High School and Santiago High School in Garden 
Grove -- said they were suspended for trying to get hundreds of other pupils to 
follow them to a rally. One was suspended for three days and the other for five 
days.

MAN WITH 9 DRUNK-DRIVING CONVICTIONS SENTENCED TO 2 YEARS IN PRISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley man with nine drunk-driving convictions was sentenced Friday to 
two years in prison after evading authorities for nearly seven years, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linwood Rose, 34, was sentenced after he pleaded no contest this week in 
Municipal Court to charges stemming from a June 18, 1987, traffic accident in 
Van Nuys, Deputy City Atty. Sharyn Siskel said. Rose was convicted Thursday of 
driving under the influence of alcohol with prior convictions and driving with 
a suspended license. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, who failed field sobriety tests and exceeded blood-alcohol levels after 
the 1987 accident, never showed up for trial and a warrant for his arrest was 
issued in November of that year, Siskel said. At the time, Rose was living in 
Van Nuys and had already been convicted of drunk driving on five previous 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose subsequently moved to Simi Valley. In Ventura County, he was convicted of 
drunk driving in 1988, 1990 and earlier this year. But authorities there were 
apparently unaware of Rose's outstanding arrest warrant in Los Angeles, Siskel 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the intent of the system for these people to move around and to be 
lost track of, but it is possible for people to slip through the cracks," said 
Karen Cullie, the executive director of the Los Angeles County chapter of 
Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Police finally put the brakes on him Sept. 10 after he was involved in his 
ninth alcohol-related crash in Reseda, for which he was convicted and faces 
another sentencing Monday in Van Nuys Municipal Court. Los Angeles Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Susan Gruber said Rose has agreed to a three-year prison term in 
connection with this case, but it will be up to a judge to impose the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 After the latest accident, Rose fled but was captured after "a couple of 
witnesses pursued him and later officers took him into custody," Los Angeles 
Police Detective George Cardenas said. Lila Mary Grimila, the driver of the 
other vehicle, was injured in the accident, which sent her car crashing into a 
tree and fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Information on whether others have been injured in his previous accidents was 
unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Rose's convictions began more than a decade ago, the California 
Legislature has passed tougher laws aimed at stopping drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, California adopted laws calling for instant license suspension and a 
lowering of blood-alcohol levels to 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the state also raised the penalty for misdemeanor drunk-driving 
offenses to a maximum $1,000 fine and one year in jail. Another new law 
requires twice-convicted drunk drivers to equip their cars with a breath 
analysis device that prevents them from starting their engine if they have a 
blood alcohol level higher than 0.02%. 
</P>
<P>
 Gruber said she did not know whether Rose had a breath analysis device 
installed in his truck at the time of the Sept. 10 arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 A new assault on repeat offenders will begin Jan. 1, 1995, when a state law 
sponsored by state Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law requires unlicensed drivers to permanently forfeit their cars when 
caught driving on state roads. The law stipulates that the unlicensed driver 
must be the owner of the car and he or she must have a prior conviction for 
driving with a suspended or revoked license or without a license within the 
past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Another new law, by state Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco), also will 
take effect Jan. 1 and allows authorities to impound for 30 days the car of 
anyone caught driving with a suspended or revoked license or without a license.

BEACH POLLUTION LESSENED OVER SUMMER, GROUP SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the most popular beaches from Malibu to the Palos Verdes Peninsula 
showed signs of improvement over the last three months, according to a report 
card on pollution in the Santa Monica Bay issued by Heal the Bay, an 
environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 The beach near the Redondo Pier and Mother's Beach in Marina del Rey were 
among those getting better marks. Mother's Beach, which was rated most 
improved, has been closed in the past because of pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the beach near Redondo Pier, all of the South Bay beaches scored an 
"A." 
</P>
<P>
 "When people are saying, 'The bay is polluted, I'll never swim there,' there 
is no scientific data that would warrant that response," said Roger Gorke, 
science and policy analyst for Heal the Bay. He noted that the report card gave 
"Ds" and "Fs" to only about half a dozen of more than 50 beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The beach at the Los Angeles County Patrol Dock in Marina del Rey was rated as 
the "class troublemaker," the most contaminated spot in the bay. However, it is 
not used by many people for swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 Beaches scoring "D" for the summer months were the beach just south of the 
Bel-Air Bay Club, the area near the Malibu Pier, the area south of the Santa 
Monica Pier and the beach near the Santa Monica Canyon storm drain at Will 
Rogers State Beach. However, the beach around the Santa Monica Canyon storm 
drain showed signs of improvement, Gorke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bacteria counts for the beach just south of the Ashland storm drain in Santa 
Monica near the Venice border worsened in September. The problem has been so 
bad that officials diverted the storm water into the sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfrider Beach near the Malibu Lagoon -- one of the most popular surfing 
spots in Southern California -- received a "C" for the summer and a "D" for 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heal the Bay continues to see many people, especially young children, 
swimming in the flow existing from the lagoon and in the lagoon itself," Gorke 
said, expressing alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 He offered this advice: "Wherever you see a flowing storm drain or pier, stay 
100 yards away. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when it is raining, don't go swimming for at least three days." 
</P>
<P>
 Beach pollution in the county is largely the result of urban runoff -- an 
accumulation of domestic and commercial waste dumped or inadvertently washed 
into storm drains and swept into the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 To compile its report card, Heal the Bay uses data collected daily at some 
beaches and weekly at others by the Los Angeles City Bureau of Sanitation and 
the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services.

TUTU GRAPPLES WITH NEW POLITICAL ROLE; SOUTH AFRICA: THE ANGLICAN ARCHBISHOP 
SAYS CHURCH MUST CLOSELY MONITOR LONGTIME ALLY NELSON MANDELA'S GOVERNMENT EVEN 
IF THE RESULTS ARE PAINFUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the 27 years of Nelson Mandela's imprisonment, Anglican Archbishop 
Desmond Tutu emerged as the most vocal and compelling opponent of South 
Africa's white minority government and its policy of apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus disobeyed the ruler. So we have a good example," he told worshipers in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But when his longtime ally Mandela won the country's first free presidential 
election in April, Tutu's church lost both its foe and its focus. And the 
archbishop had to ask himself: What is the role of the church in a new and 
fragile democracy? 
</P>
<P>
 "We have discovered that it was a lot easier to be against, far more difficult 
to say what you are for," Tutu said recently in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutu was attending an international conference on religious human rights, 
sponsored by Emory University, in advance of a U.S. tour to promote his new 
book, "The Rainbow People of God: The Making of a Peaceful Revolution." The 
book is a compilation of Tutu's correspondences, sermons and interviews during 
the past 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Church leaders, Tutu said, should not retreat from public involvement. Rather, 
they should act as "vigilant watchdogs," monitoring government activities to 
see if they are consistent with the biblical mandate to provide for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the ANC (African National Congress) government came to power, many 
people thought that we would suddenly shut our eyes to things we thought were 
wrong," he said. "But for God's credibility and the credibility of the church, 
we have to speak the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Tutu's monitoring role was most apparent when he publicly chastised South 
African government leaders in August for voting salary increases for themselves 
and criticized the state-controlled Armscor Corp., an arms procurement agency, 
for planning to double South African arms exports next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, who was stung by the criticism, asked Tutu why he hadn't raised the 
matters privately. 
</P>
<P>
 Tutu maintained that he had spoken to Mandela first, but later questioned the 
ethics of discussing public policy in private. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remembered that we used to criticize the white Dutch Reformed Church very 
much for not criticizing the government openly. They (used to say) 'We have 
spoken to them behind closed doors.' And so now I understood their dilemma. 
It's painful to criticize people of whom you are very fond and with whom you 
are on the same side." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, Tutu said, took the reproach seriously. "He announced here that (the 
Parliament) is going to take cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 The archbishop hopes that the church will be an active participant in 
Mandela's program of reconstruction and development, participating in housing 
and job training projects. Translating a theological commitment to the poor 
into an economic reality is among the church's toughest challenges. Tutu wants 
to convince international lenders to declare a moratorium on repayments of 
South Africa's debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are enlisting our sisters and brothers in other parts of the world to take 
this as seriously as they took the question of apartheid. I think the Third 
World, especially Africa, must be given a chance for a new beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Tutu and church leaders in countries such as Haiti, the former Yugoslavia and 
Rwanda also are grappling with the issue of how to facilitate healing in deeply 
divided countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to deal with our past or it will come back to haunt us," says Tutu. 
"Wounds have to be opened up and cleansed or they will fester. What we are 
looking for is not so much retribution, but restitution -- finding out how you 
can make victims feel they have been rehabilitated, vindicated and that their 
humanity has not been undermined. 
</P>
<P>
 "A commission is going to be appointed, and I said to the minister of justice, 
'I hope that you're going to ensure that some of the commissioners are actually 
victims. . . . Then we can decide how do you get to the truth in such a way 
that it does not become a witch hunt and it doesn't become a thing where you 
condone everything. For some atrocities there can't be just amnesty." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandela, Tutu added, "is going to have to say, 'Although I too am a victim and 
was incarcerated for 27 years, I want to apologize, to ask for forgiveness on 
behalf of the state that did these things.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The special task of church leaders, he said, will be to "persuade people to be 
willing to confess and forgive." 
</P>
<P>
 To facilitate forgiveness, Tutu hopes that the clergy will play a "less 
overtly political role" than they "needed to play when our leaders were in 
exile or in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, he noted, the Anglican bishops "prohibited clergy from being 
card-carrying members of political parties. The objection was: 'If you were in 
the ANC, how could you minister to people in the Inkatha (Freedom) Party when 
they were killing one another?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the clergy objected to the restriction before April's election. 
While most Anglican priests refrained from joining parties, some made their 
political preferences clear, obeying the letter but not the spirit of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some clerics maintained that you couldn't be politically neutral," said Tutu. 
"I said, 'Well, it's easy. Return the license that allows you to operate as a 
priest and you can become a member of a political party.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the Anglican bishops, said Tutu, reviewed the matter and decided that each 
diocese could set its own policy. The archbishop says he changed his own mind 
"very reluctantly." 
</P>
<P>
 "In my diocese I'm probably going to say, 'You can become members of parties, 
but please be discreet.' Maybe in time people won't care two hoots who you 
voted for as a priest. But now in too many places it's a matter of life and 
death."

<P>
 Thanks to the support of local organizations, two separate violence-education 
and prevention programs based in Washington are reaching large audiences in the 
Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cease Fire: Stopping the Gun War Against Children" is the theme of the third 
annual Children's Sabbath, a program of the Children's Defense Fund, being 
observed this weekend by about 100 Jewish, Protestant, Catholic and Unitarian 
Universalist congregations in Southern California and more than 10,000 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're encouraging every church that has bells to toll them every two hours on 
Sunday to remind people that a gun takes a child's life every two hours in this 
country and that homicide is now the third leading cause of death for 
elementary and middle-school children," said Shannon Daley, who directs the 
religious affairs department of the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children's Sabbath is a pragmatic recognition," she said, "that launching a 
movement strong enough to reverse the crises facing children will 
unquestionably take the leadership and participation of the nation's religious 
community -- just as the abolition of slavery and the civil rights movements 
did." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from her Washington office, Daley noted that an unprecedented demand 
arose this year for specialized kits that her organization provides to 
Protestant, Catholic, Jewish and African American Protestant congregations. The 
packets include educational curricula and follow-up activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Ginny Wagener, executive director of the South Coast Ecumenical 
Council, reports that more than 20 of the group's member congregations in the 
South Bay are going all out to participate. The West Side Interfaith Council is 
also taking part, as are 50 churches in the Los Angeles Episcopal Diocese. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past," Wagener said, "churches haven't done a whole lot on these 
issues. Now we're seeing we're all part of this metropolitan community. We're 
all involved." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a nationwide teleconference, "Violence in the Media," will be 
beamed live by satellite from Washington to six sites in the Southland -- and 
124 others across the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The event is sponsored by a broad-based coalition of interfaith and secular 
organizations. They include the National Council of Churches, the National 
Foundation to Improve Television, the National Alliance for Non-Violent 
Programming, United Methodist Communications, the Episcopal Church, the Media 
Action Research Center Inc., the Center for Media Literacy, Americans for 
Responsible Television and the National Assn. of Secondary School Principals. 
Helping them out locally with screening sites and equipment will be United 
Methodist churches. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, audiences in Claremont, Pasadena, Laguna Hills, Orange, Escondido 
and Big Bear will be able to talk to a panel of experts by phone hookup, after 
hearing their presentation at 4 p.m. PDT Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Graham, who is coordinating the Claremont teleconference linkup, 
said, "Anybody interested in finding out about media violence -- including 
parents and educators -- may attend." 
</P>
<P>
 Panel members include Dr. Joycelyn Elders, U.S. surgeon general, and Elizabeth 
Thoman, executive director of the Culver City-based Center for Media Literacy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Media literacy means learning to ask the right questions," Thoman stated. 
"Its principles apply to racism and sexism as well as violence." Thoman said 
that during the conference, she will present part of a "hefty, big project" 
that her organization has been working on for the past year to "empower 
communities." Entitled "Beyond Blame: Challenging Violence in the Media," it is 
a video-based curriculum tailored for children of different age groups, 
teen-agers, adults and parents. The kit, which will be available for purchase 
in a few weeks, will contain nearly 300 pages of activities, exercises and 
teaching material, in addition to videotape, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Children's Defense Fund and the media coalition see their events as 
catalysts to inspire sustained community efforts to educate against violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Congregations interested in receiving kits or information may write: 
Children's Sabbath, Children's Defense Fund, 25-E St. NW, Washington, D.C. 
20001, or phone (800) CDF-1200. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission to the teleconference in Claremont is $7, which includes a packet of 
follow-up materials on media violence. Preregistration is required. For 
information about Claremont or the other sites, phone Graham at (800) 626-7821,

CONGRESS AND FIXING HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Rx for Recovery -- Next Year," by Theodore R. Marmor and Mark Goldberg, 
Commentary, Oct. 9: 
</P>
<P>
 First, the article assumes that Congress wants to change the extant system of 
providing medical care. Second, it assumes that critics of the Administration's 
plan bothered to read it. Both these assumptions are false. We will not see 
reforms of any kind until the Congress is divorced from special interests, and 
becomes responsive to the needs of the nation.

 Re Karen Engberg's "What If Health Care Were Run Like the Schools?" 
Commentary, Oct. 10: 
</P>
<P>
 In comparing single-payer health insurance under Prop. 186 to California's 
public school system, Engberg misses a very important point. Our schools are 
single-provider, like England's health care system, not single-payer. Under 
186, health care providers would still be private, and we would still benefit 
from competition among them. Only the payment would be managed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Engberg's concern over government inefficiency is legitimate, I 
don't believe it would match the billions of dollars in profit California's 
health insurance industry takes out of our pockets every year.

 Gregg Easterbrook's article (Opinion, Oct. 2) is a knee-jerk response to a 
problem which does not fix easily. If only he could throw out the "insurers" 
who "paper shuffle," then he could "price-fix" doctors and end up with a 
wonderful Canadian medical system. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually the problem in solving health care is that each of the component 
"special interest" groups provides valuable services that cannot be thrown out 
without danger to the overall system. The much-maligned "paperwork" to which 
Easterbrook refers is actually "utilization review" -- the only current method 
by which scarce financial resources are allocated within the indemnity medical 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider a medical system without utilization review: More money is spent on 
trivial care while less money is spent to treat major illness and push forward 
the frontiers of care.  
</P>
<P>
 But "utilization review" is only a first-generation solution to medical 
resource allocation. Those who wish to cure health care should push toward the 
second-generation solution of "protocols" -- an "operator's manual" of those 
things which work in health care. Each doctor thinks he knows what works for 
himself through his own lifetime of trial and error, but he doesn't communicate 
his results to a common database. Protocols will take many years to perfect. In 
the meantime, insurance professionals ask intellectuals like Easterbrook to 
respect our determination to allocate medical resources in the best manner 
currently possible.

<P>
 Actually, I much prefer the detailed thoughtfulness of the Clintons on health 
care to the smug, simplistic approach that we hear repetitively from 
Easterbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 In a larger sense the problem is not with his particular point of view -- 
which does have some merit -- but with too many influential Americans all over 
the political spectrum who, like Easterbrook, espouse a belief in universal 
health care and the need to control costs, yet will bash any proposed plan that 
does not conform to their own economic advantage, convenience or sense of 
ideological satisfaction. As a result we get nothing.

HAMAS PLAYS A ZERO-SUM GAME; WEST BANK TRAGEDY DAMAGES THE PEACE PROCESS, AS 
MILITANTS INTENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Late Friday the people who run the militant Muslim organization Hamas 
announced they would give the Israeli soldier they kidnaped last Sunday one 
more day of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it had occurred to Nachshon Waxman's captors that it would be bad 
public relations to kill the 19-year-old corporal on the Jewish Sabbath. 
Perhaps they feared it would look like cheap upstaging if they murdered Waxman 
on the same day that Yasser Arafat, who heads the interim authority that is 
trying to create a Palestinian entity in the Gaza Strip and West Bank, was 
announced as a co-winner of what clearly was a premature Nobel Peace Prize. No 
matter. Whatever Hamas' intentions, Waxman's life was snuffed out anyway, as 
Israeli troops stormed the house on the West Bank where he was being held. 
Besides Waxman another soldier died, along with three Hamas kidnapers. 
</P>
<P>
 And so even as the peace process goes forward, the war between Israelis and 
Palestinians goes on. The difference now, of course, is that on the Palestinian 
side that war is being waged both in defiance of the internationally recognized 
Palestinian political leadership and with no thought of eventual political 
compromise. Hamas is playing a zero-sum game. Its goal is not peaceful 
coexistence, not a modus vivendi, but Israel's elimination. And it seems quite 
ready to bring down all Palestinian hopes for a normal, self-governing 
existence in zealous pursuit of an objective that is wholly unreal and wholly 
unrealizable. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days immediately following Waxman's kidnaping both Israel and the 
United States expressed deep frustration over Arafat's apparent inability to 
control Hamas or to find Waxman. The discovery that Waxman was being held not 
in the Gaza Strip but on the West Bank, in an area still under Israeli control, 
somewhat helps the PLO chairman's standing with Jerusalem and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But this whole tragic episode still represents a setback to the peace process, 
as Hamas intended. Arafat's authority, and Palestinian peace hopes, are now on 
the line. The Palestinians can have progress toward self-rule or they can have 
Hamas running wild. There's no way they can have both.

'NO' TO TOBACCO'S TROJAN HORSE; PROPOSITION 188 IS A CYNICAL ATTEMPT TO ROLL 
BACK RESTRICTIONS ON SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Californians by now have become accustomed to rejecting devious ballot 
initiatives. But seldom have voters in this state been confronted with a 
measure as misleading and mendacious as Proposition 188.Billed as a means to 
"protect" nonsmokers and keep cigarettes away from children, it is actually a 
Trojan Horse carrying the rapacious interests of the tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's be clear what this measure does: it repeals the strong restrictions on 
smoking passed by the Legislature this year and signed by Gov. Pete Wilson; 
annuls all local ordinances on smoking and replaces them with new more lenient 
rules written by -- guess who -- the Philip Morris tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Oct. 7, five tobacco companies, led by Philip Morris, had already 
contributed more than $5 million to the campaign and voters state-wide can 
expect to be deluged by glossy mailers touting how Proposition 188 would give 
Californians "tough" or "statewide" smoking regulations. Do not be misled. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with all this tobacco money, the forces against 188 will not be able to 
mount much counteradvertising. Fortunately the state Department of Health 
Services has stepped up its hard-hitting anti-smoking campaign on radio and 
television in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But several television stations have cravenly knuckled under to threats of 
libel action by the chairman of the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and dropped one 
of the spots. 
</P>
<P>
 We have said this before, but it bears repeating because of the confusion sown 
by the industry: A "yes" vote is a vote against smoking restrictions. To retain 
the progressive California standards on smoking that are being emulated 
nationally, vote no.

JUDICIAL WATCH; DIVERSITY DIVIDEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When President Clinton took office, he said he was committed to appointing a 
more diverse group of federal judges. Yet because of the initially slow pace of 
his judicial appointments and the large number of vacancies Clinton inherited, 
many feared that his promise would prove hollow.Others worried that his 
commitment to diversity would mean the appointment of "lesser" individuals to 
the federal bench. It turns out that those fears are proving unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent information indicates that Clinton has gotten more federal judges 
confirmed by the Senate than any previous President during his first two years 
in office and that he has surpassed all previous records for the appointment of 
women and minorities. U.S. Justice Department statistics show that the Senate 
has now approved 129 Clinton nominees. Those confirmations have reduced the 
vacancy rate among full-time federal judges from the 13.5% Clinton inherited 
from President Bush to 6.3%, or only 53 vacancies. 
</P>
<P>
 No less significant, 63.6% of Clinton's appointees are women or minorities. 
When he took office, one of every five active federal judges was a woman or 
minority; now one in four is. More Clinton appointees have judicial or 
prosecutorial experience and fewer come from large law firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps even more important, a higher percentage of Clinton's nominees have 
obtained the top "well qualified" rating from the American Bar Assn. than did 
those of Presidents Bush, Reagan and Carter. These figures alone should put to 
rest the tired canard that diversity inevitably means lower standards.

WHY REWARD THESE THUGS?; PAYOFF TO CEDRAS IS A BLOT ON AMERICAN HONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States is currently detaining scores of Haitians suspected of 
committing unspecified crimes under the three-year-long military dictatorship. 
Meanwhile, the biggest crooks of all, led by Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, have been 
allowed to leave Haiti with a planeload of possessions to help assure their 
comfort in exile. 
</P>
<P>
 That U.S.-guaranteed safe departure was no surprise. Washington has for some 
time embraced the idea. As President Clinton repeated at Friday's White House 
ceremony for returning Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, there should 
be no "revenge or retribution" after the end of Haiti's latest despotism. What 
does come as a shock -- what comes as something of a national humiliation -- 
was the extraordinarily generous and wholly unnecessary severance package that 
Cedras was able to squeeze out of the United States just before he slunk off to 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next year the United States will provide for the transportation, care 
and feeding of Cedras, his family, his chief of staff, Brig. Gen. Philippe 
Biamby, and 23 members of Cedras' clan who were allowed to enter the United 
States this week. At the same time, the United States has unfrozen at least $79 
million that hundreds of Haitian army officers and backers of Cedras have on 
deposit in U.S. banks. Further, the U.S. government will lease, at a cost of 
some tens of thousands of dollars a year, three homes belonging to Cedras and 
his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Why these apparently late concessions demanded by Cedras were even seriously 
considered, let alone granted, is baffling. With Haiti firmly under U.S. 
military control, with many of the goons who supported Cedras either disarmed 
or in hiding, the deposed dictator had no cards left to play. Washington had 
already promised Cedras that he wouldn't have to face the wrath of his fellow 
citizens. The right response to his outrageous demands should simply have been 
to hustle him aboard the plane waiting to fly him into exile. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Cedras, his cronies and supporters sucked millions out of Haiti's 
desperately poor economy. At least some of the ruling clique are suspected of 
being deeply involved in the international drug trade. This was a regime 
lacking wholly in political legitimacy and utterly without mercy in enforcing 
its will. It was a regime that raped and pillaged Haiti, and yet in the end it 
demanded -- and won -- the right to depart with "dignity." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Lake, Clinton's national-security adviser, calls the deal that led to 
Cedras' departure a success, and says there's nothing to be apologetic about. 
Yes, there is. It's called the moral honor of the United States, and today it's 
looking pretty bedraggled.

AZERBAIJAN AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jane Olson's Sept. 23 column on Azerbaijan, "When Bureaucracy Keeps Water From 
Children," although well-intentioned, suffers from some major errors. The most 
serious of these deals with the Freedom Support Act. Section 907 of this act 
states that the government of Azerbaijan may not receive direct U.S. government 
assistance until it takes "demonstrable steps to cease all blockades and 
offensive uses of force against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh." 
</P>
<P>
 The intent of Section 907 is not to prevent humanitarian assistance to people 
in need. The very reason 907 was enacted was precisely because Azerbaijan was 
-- and two years later still is -- blockading everything intended for "the 
women, children and elderly" in Armenia. This includes food, medical supplies, 
heating oil -- the stuff of humanitarian aid. Azerbaijanis are not denied 
humanitarian assistance from our country. The U.S. government provided them 
with $35 million in humanitarian aid during fiscal year 1994. However, Section 
907 requires that the money be spent through non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) and private voluntary organizations (PVOs).  
</P>
<P>
 Olson reported that Azeri doctors were not allowed to be contracted with by 
relief organizations because the U.S. Agency for International Development 
views the physicians to be government employees and, thus, this would be a 
violation of Section 907. As a result of such incidents, Congress added 
(clarifying) language within the foreign operations appropriations bill, which 
was signed on Aug. 23, stating (in part), "the conferees . . . urge the 
Administration to ensure that NGOs are not precluded from using government 
facilities and vehicles, or from using or making necessary repairs to 
governmental facilities such as health clinics and housing. The conferees also 
agree that NGOs should be able to use government personnel to distribute 
commodities."  
</P>
<P>
 However, Olson was right when she wrote, "The need for food, shelter, medical 
care and sanitation facilities will remain critical at least through the coming 
winter, and U.S. policies are not helping." While the U.S. has provided 
humanitarian assistance, including a desperately needed allotment of 100,000 
tons of wheat, to Armenia, the U.S. is not permitted to deliver any of that aid 
across Turkish territory. Thus, those 100,000 tons of U.S. generosity are 
sailing around Istanbul, being delivered to ports in war-torn Georgia, and then 
being transported via train and truck to their destination.

U.S. ASSISTANCE FOR RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David J. Kramer's column (Commentary, Sept. 26) misstates the Clinton 
Administration's current aid policy toward Russia and displays a serious lack 
of understanding of the program of the Trade and Development Agency (TDA). It 
also ignores the view that President Yeltsin clearly expressed during the 
Washington summit: that what Russia now desires from the West, primarily from 
America, is increased trade and investment, not foreign aid. 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, contrary to what Kramer states, the Administration has not 
abandoned support for technical assistance aimed at improving the investment 
climate in Russia. Indeed, a substantial portion of the U.S. Agency for 
International Development (AID) funding now in the pipeline is focused on 
establishing macroeconomic reforms as well as a legal and regulatory 
environment that will stimulate private sector investment. But such changes do 
not occur overnight, and there is a need to show some real progress during the 
transition to encourage the forces of reform in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 More fundamentally the reality is that Russia remains a risky place to do 
business, let alone make a major investment. It is not surprising that even the 
largest U.S. companies are reluctant to commit the extensive corporate 
financial and human resources that are needed to pursue a commercial 
opportunity that may or may not actually exist, and if it does, may require 
years of nurturing before any profit is turned. 
</P>
<P>
 Several U.S. government trade and investment assistance programs are now 
available in Russia to address the issues facing both countries. TDA provides 
assistance to Russian organizations by funding feasibility studies carried out 
in conjunction with their U.S. partners, the Export-Import Bank provides 
financing and guarantees for U.S. exports to Russia, and the Overseas Private 
Investment Corp. provides insurance and financing for U.S. investments in 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 TDA's feasibility study program is modest in comparison with the much larger 
amounts of funding needed at the project implementation stage. In fact, the 
political message sent by TDA involvement at the initial stage of a project is 
often as important as the financial assistance provided. In these instances TDA 
provides only a small portion of the funding required for the study; the lion's 
share of the cost is borne by the U.S. company involved and sometimes by its 
Russian partner.  
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to Kramer's assertions, TDA's program does help the Russians help 
themselves and does strengthen commercial ties between the two countries. A 
good example is the Ilyushin 96M project, which TDA is supporting. The end 
result will be a cooperative venture to manufacture a wide-body aircraft with a 
Russian airframe and U.S. engines and avionics. This project will create jobs 
in Russia and jobs in the United States. And from a policy standpoint, the 
preparatory work on the project has already had a positive result: the 
privatization of both Ilyushin Design Bureau, the aircraft's designer, and the 
Voronezh plant that manufactures the airframe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's trade and investment assistance strategy for 
Russia is two-pronged: 1) to create a business environment that attracts 
foreign (primarily U.S.) capital, and 2) to directly support trade and 
investment ventures that produce tangible benefits for the U.S. and Russia. We 
recognize that the success or failure of Russia's economic modernization 
program rests mainly on the policies of the Russian government and the 
determination of the Russian people. But we also believe that the U.S. 
government and, more importantly, the U.S. private sector, can play a 
supportive role.

L.A. BUSINESSMAN SAYS HE IS TOP BIDDER FOR MARINELAND SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles businessman confirmed Friday that he is the high bidder for the 
former Marineland site, one of the county's last pieces of undeveloped 
oceanfront property. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim York, head of York Capital Group, said he will consult with city officials 
and conservationists before deciding what to do with the 102 acres on the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula.  
</P>
<P>
 "We will examine all possible uses for the properties," York said in a 
statement, "residential, hotel, retail, golf course and open space -- to make 
this project a centerpiece for our community." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission and the Rancho Palos Verdes City Council 
have approved development of a 450-room luxury hotel and nine-hole golf course 
on site. The new owner would have the same development rights, officials said, 
but a significant change would have to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona-based developer James G. Monaghan, who has filed for bankruptcy, owns 
the land. 
</P>
<P>
 The Resolution Trust Corp., which administers the assets of failed savings and 
loans, is selling the bank note on the property. York declined to say how much 
he bid, but the value of the property has been listed at $24 million.  
</P>
<P>
 RTC spokesman Mike Fulwider confirmed that his agency has notified a bidder, 
but declined to release the bidder's name. He said he expected the deal to 
close by late November after a payment plan and other details are worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 Fulwider said a small percentage of deals fall through if bidders cannot 
secure financing. 
</P>
<P>
 According to York's news release, he was tapped as the high bidder after the 
previous high bidder withdrew. 
</P>
<P>
 If York acquires the bank note, he must still foreclose on the property from 
Monaghan, but he predicted a friendly foreclosure. A spokeswoman for Monaghan 
said she had not been contacted about the sale.  
</P>
<P>
 The bank note also includes a 315-acre parcel known as Filiorum. Most of 
Filiorum is landslide-prone and considered unsuitable for development. JEFF

'MAINSTREAM' CHURCH WILL STAY SEPARATE

 Dave McKibben's article (Oct. 8) about Leon Vickers leaving Stanford and a 
possible pro football career to pursue his "faith" was interesting but left a 
wrong impression. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 20 years, I have been an ordained "mainstream" Church of Christ

attends is "not connected to the more mainstream Churches of Christ." Despite 
this, the cult expert in the article called the Church of Christ "not a safe

 Readers need to know that "mainstream" Churches of Christ don't endorse or 
practice "Hitler" cult tactics. We don't even frown on football.

WHY CAN'T CLIPPERS POSTPONE THE SEASON? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am sick about the baseball strike. The hockey strike, too, is very 
distressing. 
</P>
<P>
 But what upsets me most is the failure of the NBA players to initiate a work 
action.After all, as an 11-year Clipper season ticket-holder, I am less than 
enthusiastic about the start of the season and I was hoping I wouldn't have to 
go. 
</P>
<P>
 With a 300-plus-pound Stanley Roberts, the Clippers' typical inability to sign 
their draft picks, the departure of several key starters and their failure to 
complete any significant trades, this team will be lucky to win 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 With an organization like this, a strike looks like the only way to avoid 
another disappointing season.

 This ex-Clipper fan had to read a recent article twice because Stanley

 My only question is, is it possible to die from uncontrollable laughter?

SEEKING A BRIGHT SIDE TO UCLA'S DIM SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The bad news is that Terry Donahue has produced a poorly coached, 
underachieving UCLA football team. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that former assistant athletic director Angelo Mazzone will 
not be making another $400,000 selling Rose Bowl tickets.

 Vic Slayman (Viewpoint, Oct. 8) asks two pertinent questions: "Why is it that 
when the UCLA football team loses, the blame is put on injuries and players, 
but not the coach. However, when the UCLA basketball team loses, why is the 
blame never on injuries or poor shooting, but always the coach?" Allow me to 
suggest answers: 
</P>
<P>
 Football: UCLA football fans have such diminished expectations that they 
actually care very little about who is at the helm. A winning season, beating 
USC and an occasional trip to the Rose Bowl fills the bill. The time when UCLA 
could compete with Notre Dame, Nebraska, Florida State and Miami for the 
national championship has long since passed and Terry Donahue is the 
beneficiary of that institutional malaise. 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball: The fans are right -- it is always the coach.

 Hawaii beat Cal by 14 points. Cal beat UCLA by 19 points. New Mexico beat 
Hawaii by 17 points. To some this might suggest that the powerhouse from 
Albuquerque is 40 points better than the Bruins. This is obviously ridiculous. 
My guess is that if the two teams were to play, the betting line would favor 
New Mexico by no more than three touchdowns.

 There seems to be a tendency for sportswriters to rag on Notre Dame's Ron

WILLIE BROWN STORY WAS A LITTLE DIFFERENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was like a breath of fresh air reading the Oct. 3 story about ex-Raider 
Willie Brown's noble campaign to help Jordan High's football program. For a 
Hall of Fame member and seven-time Pro Bowl player to choose coaching in an 
underfunded and strife-ridden community over the lure of the fast buck is 
nearly an anomaly in our material culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Am I just imagining it, or do we have a real-life hero in the making for our 
city kids to look up to?

DON'T BLAME MCNALL FOR THIS PROBLEM

<TEXT>

 Your article in the Oct. 6 Sports section, "Kings Ransom," was unfortunately 
misleading. A quick scan of the front page, prominently bearing a photograph of 
Bruce McNall and carrying the sub-headline, "Team Used Advance Playoff Money to 
Meet Payroll," would lead one to believe that Bruce had used such moneys to 
meet payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as the article makes very clear on the carryover page, it was not 
Bruce, but the team's new owners, Messrs. Sudikoff and Cohen, who engaged in 
the practice that was the subject of the article. Moreover, in suggesting that 
this practice might "irk some fans," the article fails to point out that other 
sports franchises engage in the same practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty has been written about Bruce of late. While it would be heartening to 
see a piece about all of his accomplishments and the warmth, decency and 
generosity of his character, let's at least not go overboard and suggest his 
involvement in matters directed by others.

EAGLES KEEPING AN EVEN KEEL DESPITE THEIR HIGH-FLYING START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB GLAUBER, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forgive Philadelphia Eagles Coach Rich Kotite for not getting overly excited 
about what has happened so far this year. After all, hasn't he seen this 
somewhere before? 
</P>
<P>
 While the Eagles are rolling along at 4-1 and getting ready for Sunday's 
important National Football Conference East showdown in Dallas, Kotite isn't 
talking Super Bowl just yet. In fact, the minute you ask him if he believes his 
team has joined the NFL elite, he abruptly reminds you of last year and the 
year before that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got off to great starts the last two years, and look what happened," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what happened: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It is Oct. 5, 1992, and the Eagles have just beaten the Cowboys, 31-7, in a 
Monday night game at Veterans Stadium, improving to 4-0. Al, Dan and Frank are 
gushing in the ABC broadcast booth about how the Eagles are ready to earn their 
first Super Bowl victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But the team loses five of its next eight games, finishes with an 11-5 record 
and is blown out by the eventual Super Bowl champion Cowboys, 34-10, in the 
second round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It is Oct. 3, 1993, late second quarter of the Eagles-New York Jets game at 
Giants Stadium. Randall Cunningham goes back to pass and is tackled as he 
attempts to scramble out of danger. He breaks his left leg and is lost for the 
season. Backup Bubby Brister stages a comeback against the Jets to improve 
Philadelphia to 4-0. But the Eagles lose eight of their next 12 and miss the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 So don't expect the Eagles to start puffing their chests, even if they have 
temporarily quieted the skeptics who said they were entering a rebuilding phase 
and had all the earmarks of another .500 club. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to keep things in perspective, not get too high or too low," says 
linebacker Byron Evans, a veteran of more than a few disappointments in his 
eight-year career in Philadelphia. "There's a lot of football left, and a lot 
can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the early-season success of 1992 and 1993, this year's surprising 
start has featured several elements that bode well for the remainder of the 
season. There's only one catch: They have to stay healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so the Eagles aren't yet in a class with Dallas. But the fact is they have 
improved substantially on both sides of the ball. And, perhaps more 
importantly, they have avoided the locker-room squabbles that tore them apart 
in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensively, the Eagles feature a terrific line with several high draft picks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth-year guard Antone Davis, a first-rounder in 1991; second-year guard 
Lester Holmes, a first-rounder last year, and 1994 first-round left tackle 
Bernard Williams form the nucleus of one of the NFL's best-blocking units. 
</P>
<P>
 And rookie running back Charlie Garner, a second-round pick out of Tennessee, 
has responded in kind with brilliant performances the last two weeks, rushing 
for 233 yards and two touchdowns despite playing with a hairline fracture of 
one of his ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offensive line has been playing extremely well," Garner said, "and 
without those guys, I wouldn't be having any success." 
</P>
<P>
 Garner's success has been so swift and so startling that he's already being 
compared to former Eagles running back Wilbert Montgomery, who gained 6,538 
yards from 1977-84. One radio talk show host has been so taken with Garner that 
he suggested the other day that the Hall of Fame should reserve a spot for the 
rookie runner. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so some folks are prone to a little exaggeration in Philly. But the 
defensive improvement this season is no exaggeration, nor is it a mirage. A 
surprise? Absolutely, when you consider that during the last two years, star 
pass rushers Reggie White, Clyde Simmons and Seth Joyner all have departed as 
free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 But several new players are filling in capably. Houston Oilers free-agent 
defensive end William Fuller is on pace for a double-digit season of sacks, 
former New York Giants safety Greg Jackson and Arizona Cardinals castoff safety 
Mike Zordich solidify a perennially suspect secondary, and former San Francisco 
49ers linebacker Bill Romanowski has filled in capably in Joyner's old spot. 
</P>
<P>
 And guess what? The defensive players are actually trying to foster harmony 
among their teammates. Really. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a pretty good feeling on this team the way things have gone 
so far," Evans said. "The guys have been playing together, and they've been 
pulling for one another." 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever thought you'd be hearing something like that coming out of a locker 
room that for years had been one of the most contentious in football? Show up 
on any given day at Veterans Stadium and you might have seen Joyner pouting in 
one corner about the pitiful state of the offense, or Cunningham whining about 
Kotite's stifling game plan, or White complaining about ex-Owner Norman 
Braman's unwillingness to invest in upgrading the team's weight room. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were once so bad that offensive players feared walking into the shower 
room after games, worried that the defensive players would make critical 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, the 1994 Eagles have been Team Compatible. Except for new Owner 
Jeffrey Lurie's ill-fated decision to demand pay cuts from six players only 
days before the regular-season opener, which set off a torrent of criticism, 
the Eagles haven't had a bad word to say about anyone. And even the pay-cut 
issue has been resolved, with Lurie and the players agreeing on a settlement 
last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my eighth year, and I can honestly say it might be the first time 
since I've been here that everybody's got a common goal," said center Dave 
Alexander. "It's tough to have a common goal when you're worried about what 
somebody thinks about somebody else, and what's going on at the other end of 
the locker room. I think it took away from our play on Sundays." 
</P>
<P>
 Cunningham can also see the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys are playing together," he said. "We don't have that kind of stuff 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Eagles are content simply to play football on Sunday afternoons 
and leave behind the chaos of locker rooms past. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's definitely a good feeling in this room," Cunningham said. "It's great 
to be a part of that." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, anyway. But as Kotite will tell you, don't take anything for granted. 
He has been here too many times before.

2 FROM O.C. INDICTED IN BIG STOCK SCHEME; CRIME: EX-PRESIDENT OF PAGER FIRM, 
THREE OTHERS ACCUSED OF CONSPIRACY, FRAUD IN MANIPULATING PRICE OF SOUTHLAND 
COMMUNICATIONS STOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In what authorities say is the largest stock manipulation case ever uncovered 
in Los Angeles or Orange counties, the former president of a Santa Ana paging 
company and three others were indicted Friday on charges of securities fraud, 
money-laundering and conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Named in the 39-count federal indictment were two Orange County men, Ahmad 
Naim Bayaa, 41, of Lake Forest, former president of Southland Communications 
Inc., and Abdul Deeb, 43, of Anaheim, a former oil consultant.  
</P>
<P>
 They controlled the market for nearly all the company's stock in an attempt to 
drive up its price, according to indictments filed by Assistant U.S. Atty. John 
Libby. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1988 to 1990, the men, along with Shaw Tehrani, 40, an Atlanta 
stockbroker, and Eduardo Anton, 32, a broker in Miami, manipulated Southland 
Communications' stock prices, setting up a "secret network" of accounts at 
stock brokerages across the country, Libby said. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the four defendants could be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the scheme, six brokerage firms holding Southland Communications 
stock allegedly lost nearly $12 million and one firm, Suplee Reed & Co. of 
Media, Pa., was forced out of business, according to the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a complex, thought-out scheme," Libby said. "Basically, they wanted 
to sock away a good portion of the stock in these secret accounts. They opened 
up accounts in the names of people who lived overseas, many with ties to 
Bayaa's family." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the indictment, the men used the names of Bayaa's relatives and 
friends to fraudulently buy nearly every available share in the pager company, 
eventually controlling more than 80% of the company's stock, or about 1.3 
million shares, without telling federal regulators. Under Securities and 
Exchange Commission rules, a stake of more than 5% in a company must be 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 By secretly controlling the shares and keeping out other investors, the men 
were allegedly able to artificially boost Southland Communications' stock price 
dramatically by withholding shares from the market, thereby forcing the price 
upward. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 14, 1992, the company's stock jumped from $8.75 a share to $13.25 a 
share, and the company issued a press release saying it knew of no reason for 
the unusual activity. By April 4 of that year, the stock had risen to almost 
$17 per share, and the SEC halted trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the stock purchased by Bayaa and the others for the secret accounts 
was purchased on margin, Libby said -- meaning they paid half and the brokerage 
firms paid half. 
</P>
<P>
 When trading was suspended by the SEC, the stock's price eventually went to 
zero and the brokerage firms asked Bayaa and others to repay the loans for the 
share purchases. But the men did not, forcing the brokerages to take losses 
estimated at nearly $12 million, the indictment states. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of an extensive investigation by the FBI, Friday's indictment is 
the largest criminal stock manipulation ever charged in the Central District of 
California, according to U.S. attorneys. Although Barry Minkow's ZZZZ Best 
carpet cleaning company was a much larger investment fraud case, it was not 
related to stock manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Bayaa could face 295 years in prison and a $10.2-million fine. 
Tehrani could face 320 years in prison, Deeb 215 years, and Anton could face 50 
years. Each also is subject to an undetermined amount of fines. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayaa appeared Friday before U.S. District Judge Andrew J. Wistrich on the 
charges and was released on $100,000 bail. Neither he nor his attorney, Stanley 
Greenberg of Los Angeles, was available for comment. Bayaa is expected to enter 
a plea Monday and the other three men are slated to appear in court later. 
</P>
<P>
 Bayaa, a Palestinian refugee who moved to the United States in the 1970s, 
founded Southland Communications in 1981 to make radio paging devices in Santa 
Ana. The company, which eventually employed 70 people, went public in 1987 and 
filed for bankruptcy six years later. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a lawsuit in federal 
court in New York accusing Bayaa and others of manipulating the price of 
Southland Communication stock. In January of that year, Bayaa agreed to resign 
as president and pay back $736,935 in stock trading profits to settle civil 
charges that he manipulated the company's stock prices. At the time, he also 
agreed to give up 921,000 shares of company stock.

TWO MAJOR RETAILERS TO END SALES OF TOY GUNS; MERCHANDISING: PROMPTED BY 
SHOOTING TRAGEDIES, TOYS 'R' US AND KAY-BEE SAY THEY WILL NO LONGER SELL 
REALISTIC-LOOKING 'FIREARMS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A string of shooting tragedies triggered by toy guns mistaken for the real 
thing prompted two of the nation's biggest toy store chains to declare Friday 
that they will no longer sell realistic-looking toy firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Toys "R" Us, the world's biggest toy retailer, said it will quit ordering such 
toys, and a second chain, Kay-Bee Toy Stores, said it will immediately begin to 
remove the toys from its shelves and destroy them. 
</P>
<P>
 While the two big retailers are not the first to do so, the decision by No. 1 
Toys "R" Us marks a watershed in the debate over toy guns, analysts and others 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heading into Christmas season, this action is the kiss of death for those who 
rely primarily on these guns for sales," said Jill Krutick, an analyst at Smith 
Barney. "If retailers won't carry the product, the manufacturers have no place 
to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, such giant toy retailers as Target and K mart have quit selling the 
items. Other retailers were reassessing their policies in what amounts to a 
victory for police and anti-crime groups that contend the look-alike firearms 
perpetuate a gun culture that endangers the nation's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening is that corporations are starting to realize that they do 
have a measure of accountability concerning issues of violence," said Khalid 
Shah, president of the Stop the Violence Increase the Peace Foundation of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers at the Santa Ana Kay-Bee and Toys "R" Us stores hailed the move 
Friday as a step toward ending violence and preventing innocent deaths. Parents 
and children agreed that it's a good decision the toy stores should have made 
long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that looks like a real gun can be dangerous," said Rhonda Hathaway, 
26, of Orange. "I think anything that looks like a real gun shouldn't be sold." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the Kay-Bee at 17th Street and Grand Avenue, the only toy guns on the 
shelves were bright- and neon-colored ones, such as a blue "official police" 
pistol and a red Power Rangers soft-dart target set. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Alvarado, 28, of Santa Ana, who shopped at Kay-Bee with his infant 
son, Gabriel, in his arms, said: "It's going to be safer if they stop selling 
those toys guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little boys play with toy guns and then they find real guns -- and they try 
to play with them and injure somebody." 
</P>
<P>
 Alvarado said he will stick to buying his son toy cars and videos. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside a Toys "R" Us on Bristol Street, parent Nguyen Hoang, 45, of Santa 
Ana, said he also favors the toy store's decision because, "I don't want kids 
to die by playing with guns. It will help stop the violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Toys "R" Us, Kay-Bee, Wal-Mart, K mart and Target account for more than 50% of 
all U.S. toy sales. K mart said it stopped selling those toys 10 months ago and 
Target said it hasn't sold such products for years. Wal-Mart officials could 
not be reached. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Friday's announcements were triggered by a New York City case last month in 
which Nicholas Heyward Jr., 13, was fatally shot in the stairwell of a housing 
project by an officer who mistook the youngster's toy for the real thing. Hours 
later, a second teen-ager was wounded under similar circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were only the latest of countless incidents across the country in 
which toy guns -- some manufactured to appear frighteningly realistic, others 
painted or otherwise altered to fool robbery victims -- have led to shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recent tragedy of the Heyward family and other families lead us to 
believe that we can have a positive effect by removing toy guns from our 
stores," said Ann Iverson, president and chief executive officer of the Kay-Bee 
chain, which has more than 100 locations in California, including stores in 
Mission Viejo, Orange, Buena Park, Laguna Hills, Westminster, and Huntington 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Iverson said that the decision is part of the chain's strategy to "reevaluate 
our merchandise mix to address what families need today in the way of toys that 
are fun, safe, creative and developmentally sound." 
</P>
<P>
 The use of toy guns by youngsters, criminals, the mentally unbalanced or 
others has become commonplace. As recently as Aug. 4 in Los Angeles, a man on a 
street corner brandishing what turned out to be a toy gun was shot and killed 
by police. 
</P>
<P>
 In a poignant 1983 incident in the Orange County community of Stanton, a 
police officer who entered an apartment looking for a child reported missing 
from school shot and killed a 5-year-old boy who pointed a toy gun at him. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 federal regulation requiring the toys to carry markings such as a 
brightly colored tip on the barrel has been foiled by customers who paint over 
them or modify them to create a more realistic appearance, according to Toys 
"R" Us, which declared that "more drastic measures are now called for." 
</P>
<P>
 Toys "R" Us said it plans to sell those toys now on its shelves but will not 
purchase such items in the future. Kay-Bee and Toys "R" Us said they will 
continue to offer certain kinds of water pistols and other toy guns more 
clearly identifiable as toys. Such products are often produced in bold colors 
such as red and yellow.  
</P>
<P>
 The moves by the two companies surprised some toy industry leaders who thought 
the issue had been settled by the 1992 federal regulation, said David Miller, 
who heads Toy Manufacturers of America, a New York-based trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toys 'R' Us and Kay-Bee are doing something that is within their discretion, 
and we respect that," Miller said. "However, the manufacturers of these toys 
are not doing anything illegal. . . . This is a lawful product that many 
children enjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 Retail sales of toy guns -- including water guns -- bring in about $327 
million a year, or just 2% of all toy sales, according to the trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Chicago-based Strombecker Corp., one of the nation's leading 
producers of gun look-alikes, took sharp issue with the retailers' decision. 
Myron Shure, chairman, said that retailers continue to sell other products, 
such as some interactive video games, that feature violence. Strombecker, which 
calls itself the nation's oldest toy company, produces such items as the 
American West silver-colored revolver under its Tootsie label. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are an easy target," Shure said. "They found an easy way to ease their 
conscience by eliminating a small part of the market." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Jerry Rubin, director of the anti-gun peace group called Los Angeles 
Alliance for Survival, said studies show that such play often leads to 
inordinate interest in real guns and to tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rubin was also critical of Toys "R" Us and Kay-Bee: "This is an inadequate 
solution to a dangerous situation. A pink or green toy gun can be altered too. 
They should get rid of all toy guns."

TWO MAJOR RETAILERS TO END SALE OF TOY GUNS; TOYS: PROMPTED BY SHOOTING 
TRAGEDIES, TOYS R US AND KAY-BEE SAY THEY WILL NO LONGER SELL REALISTIC-LOOKING 
'FIREARMS.' 
</P>

<P>
 A string of shooting tragedies triggered by toy guns mistaken for the real 
thing prompted two of the nation's biggest toy store chains to declare Friday 
that they will no longer sell realistic-looking toy firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Toys R Us, the world's biggest toy retailer, said it will quit ordering such 
products, and a second chain, Kay-Bee Toy Stores, said it will immediately 
begin to remove the toys from its shelves and destroy them. 
</P>
<P>
 While the two big retailers are not the first to do so, the decision by No. 1 
Toys R Us marks a watershed in the debate over toy guns, analysts and others 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heading into Christmas season, this action is the kiss of death for those who 
rely primarily on these guns for sales," said Jill Krutick, an analyst at Smith 
Barney. "If retailers won't carry the product, the manufacturers have no place 
to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Toys R Us, Kay-Bee, Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target account for more than 50% of 
all U.S. toy sales. Kmart said it stopped selling those toys 10 months ago and 
Target said it hasn't sold such products for years. Wal-Mart officials could 
not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Other retailers were reassessing their policies in what amounts to a victory 
for police and anti-crime groups that contend the look-alike "firearms" 
perpetuate a gun culture that endangers the nation's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening is that corporations are starting to realize that they do 
have a measure of accountability concerning issues of violence," said Khalid 
Shah, president of the Stop the Violence Increase the Peace Foundation of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's announcements were triggered by a New York City case last month in 
which Nicholas Heyward Jr., a 13-year-old boy, was fatally shot in the 
stairwell of a housing project by an officer who mistook the youngster's toy 
for the real thing. Hours later, a second teen-ager was wounded under similar 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were only the latest of countless incidents across the country in 
which toy guns -- some manufactured to appear frighteningly realistic, others 
painted or otherwise altered to fool robbery victims -- have led to shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recent tragedy of the Heyward family and other families lead us to 
believe that we can have a positive effect by removing toy guns from our 
stores, " said Ann Iverson, president of the Kay-Bee chain.

police officer who entered an apartment looking for a child reported missing 
from school shot and killed a five-year-old boy who pointed a toy gun at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "From just even a short distance they look like a real gun," said Officer Rigo 
Romero, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department. "There is really no 
way to tell until you are able to hold it and feel its weight and tell that it 
is plastic." 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 federal regulation requiring the toys to carry markings such as a 
brightly colored tip on the barrel has been foiled by customers who paint over 
them or modify them to create a more realistic appearance, according to Toys R

 "This is an inadequate solution to a dangerous situation," Rubin said. "A pink

</P>
<P>
 But it won't be easy to wean some youngsters away. At Toys R Us and Kay-Bee 
stores in Bell Gardens on Friday, a full complement of real-looking toy guns 
was still on the shelves awaiting purchase. Maria Muro of Los Angeles bought 
her 6-year-old son, Billy Pulido, a silver six-shooter that -- in the dark -- 
might pass for a real handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 While he and playmates wrestled over the gun in the parking lot outside Toys R 
Us, his mother, 30, agreed it was better for her son not to play with toy guns 
and said she hoped his new toy wouldn't put him in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 But she added: "He likes guns. . . . If I take it away, he's going to be mad 
and cry."

MAYOR'S STUDY SHOWS START-UP FIRMS FUELING A ROBUST RECOVERY; ECONOMY: SMALL 
COMPANIES CAN OFFSET JOB LOSSES IN AEROSPACE, THE REPORT SAYS, BUT IT WARNS OF 
DEEP RESENTMENT OF RED TAPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Los Angeles County has enjoyed a surprisingly high rate of new company 
start-ups during the 1990s, highlighting a robust, almost hidden economy that 
may indeed shake off the devastation of aerospace layoffs and rediscover rapid 
growth, according to a study to be released by Mayor Richard Riordan's office 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the New Economy Project, as the report is called, concludes that the 
continuation of the region's economic vitality is anything but a sure thing if 
the area's political institutions don't commit to supporting the private 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economically, these firms are very positive," said David Friedman, an 
attorney and urban economist who headed the project, which was funded by public 
and private sources. "In terms of . . . the gestalt of doing business in Los 
Angeles, they were very negative, and that's the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The $150,000 study, touted as the most detailed assessment ever of several 
overlooked industries in Los Angeles County, surveyed companies in 
metalworking, environmental consulting, biomedicine, textiles, computers and 
entertainment crafts, and collected detailed information from thousands of 
small firms that are usually overlooked by official state and county data 
collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also came up with four "action steps" for regional policy-makers to 
consider as they try to address the problems of the business community. 
</P>
<P>
 It says that, despite the recession, the creation of companies has been a 
crucial force for economic growth in this decade, actually matching the rate 
achieved in the heady days of the 1980s. But the study also found that the city 
of Los Angeles has not performed as well as the county in attracting new firms, 
because of perceptions of deterioration and a poor business climate. Feelings 
ran so deep that the project's staff members, in conducting follow-up 
interviews, were frequently subjected to several minutes of verbal abuse by 
company owners, who then apologized and calmly answered questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the interviews were very vituperative because people had a lot of 
pent-up economic rage," Friedman said. Many of these companies, although they 
were selling products and making money, "felt like they were on a balloon about 
to pop" and so were refraining from necessary expansions and investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The constant drumbeat of negativity has led to arrested development. 
Companies are actually quite healthy, but their growth is restrained beyond 
what it should be because they don't want to invest another nickel" in an area 
they are afraid is deteriorating, he said. "They don't want to be the last one 
on the boat." 
</P>
<P>
 The study appears at a time when Riordan is attempting to focus more intently 
on economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 In a major speech two weeks ago, pledged to consolidate the city's economic 
development efforts to help boost the economy out of recession. He vowed to 
improve the atmosphere for doing business and to reduce regulation at City 
Hall, but he offered no new tax reductions or other economic incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty clear what the first year was about: public safety," said Mary 
Leslie, deputy mayor for economic development. "This is the year of jobs, the 
economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The New Economy study "is not our economic development program. But it fits in 
nicely," Leslie said. "The reason this study is so important is that it gives 
us some very basic data. . . . It tells us how much we don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 The New Economy Project targeted 18,500 firms with 376,000 employees and $41 
billion in revenues, providing a detailed snapshot of nearly 10% of the Los 
Angeles-area work force. About 350 firms returned comprehensive surveys and 
more than half agreed to follow-up interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an economy after aerospace," the report says, noting that from 1980 
to 1993 there were 3,644 jobs lost in the aerospace and computer hardware 
companies that were surveyed. These were offset by 3,636 jobs created by the 
textiles, software, biomedical, entertainment, environmental and mechanical 
engineering firms in the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, close to two-thirds of all companies in the studied sectors were 
founded since 1980, and 20% were founded since 1990. Jobs created by newer 
firms in the survey almost completely offset job losses recorded by the older 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overall rate of new company growth in the county since 1990 has been 
almost identical to the 1980s, which was a period of record expansion," 
according to the study, which was launched two years ago with funding from AT&T 
and the city's Community Redevelopment Agency, Community Development Department 
and Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report criticizes the city and county for failing to make "an explicit 
commitment to economic development in the manner of many smaller jurisdictions 
in the region or neighboring counties." 
</P>
<P>
 It calls on the city and county to make private-sector development a top 
political priority, develop basic data on economic and social conditions that 
can be used to promote Los Angeles, review state and federal taxes and 
regulations that affect business activity, and talk to the business community 
to see what it really needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is possible to imagine that, come what may, the regional economy will 
recover and grow largely on its own while political institutions pursue the 
agendas of the past," the report concludes. "The project data and survey 
responses strongly suggest, however, that the continued vitality of Los 
Angeles' industrial legacy is far from assured.

AST TO CLOSE SOUTHLAND PLANT; AREA MAY LOSE AS MANY AS 515 JOBS IN LATEST 
RETRENCHMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 AST Research Inc., struggling to keep pace in the cutthroat personal computer 
business, said Friday that it will close its Fountain Valley manufacturing 
plant and lay off all 440 employees there as part of a major restructuring that 
will reduce its work force by 10% worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's sixth-largest computer maker, which employs 6,900, also said it 
expects to post a quarterly loss of up to $40 million -- far worse than 
analysts had expected. AST stock dropped $1.50 a share Friday to close at 
$10.75 in heavy Nasdaq trading. The shares traded as high as $33 early this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 AST attributed its problems to an unusual confluence of product delays, parts 
shortages and atypically low profit margins. But all companies in the PC 
industry -- which in many ways is now a marketing-driven business that relies 
on commodity parts and suffers chronically thin margins -- are wrestling with 
similar issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts were not convinced that Friday's announcement was the last of the bad 
news. "They don't completely have a handle on the situation, and that is of 
greatest concern," said Keven McCarthy, an analyst at NatWest Securities Corp. 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 AST said the notebook computer manufacturing that takes place in Fountain 
Valley will be transferred to the company's Taiwan plant. In addition to the 
Fountain Valley workers, about 250 employees worldwide -- including 50 to 75 at 
AST's Irvine headquarters -- will be terminated by Feb. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a gut-wrenching thing to have to do," said James T. Schraith, AST's 
president. "But for the sake of the remaining employees and the people who have 
a stake in the company, we simply had to make the necessary changes to become a 
stronger company." 
</P>
<P>
 The layoff is AST's second in just over a year. The company laid off 1,050 
employees, including 650 in Orange County, in the aftermath of its July, 1993, 
purchase of Tandy Corp.'s computer manufacturing operations. Since then it has 
shifted some of its Fountain Valley operations to the former Tandy plant in Ft. 
Worth. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of percentages, AST's latest job cuts are "not a lot," said Anil 
Puri, chair of the economics department at California State University, 
Fullerton. "But AST is an important company, a local, home-grown company, and 
when they make a decision like that, we need to pay attention." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's decision to close the plant is part of the continuing loss of 
high-technology jobs from Southern California, Puri said. In August, Hughes 
Aircraft Co. said it would relocate most of its Fullerton operations, laying 
off 1,000 workers. Last month, Northrop Grumman Corp., a Los Angeles aerospace 
company, said it would lay off 8,650 workers, including 4,150 in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Schraith said AST has no plans to move its Irvine headquarters, which has a 
staff of 800. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts attributed AST's problems to an oversupply of older products and an 
inability to get new models out the door quickly. In the PC business, products 
can become obsolete in a matter of months, and companies are under constant 
pressure to bring out new products with more features for less money -- and 
accurately predict how many they will sell, so they neither get stuck with 
excess inventory nor lose business because they can't meet orders. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last several years, most PC companies -- including IBM, Compaq and 
Dell -- have at one time or another botched this delicate balancing act and 
suffered the financial consequences.  
</P>
<P>
 But AST has had more than its share of volatility, and its current problems 
come at a time when the PC market, driven by strong sales of fully featured 
"multimedia" PCs to consumers, is booming. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of August, AST said it would report a loss for its first fiscal 
quarter, but Friday's announcement of red ink totaling $39 million to $40 
million was as much as three times what had been predicted by analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterly sales will also be much lower than anticipated. AST said revenue 
will probably be $495 million, down from $514 million for the comparable period 
last year and well below analysts' predictions of $515 million or more. Final 
financial results will be released Oct. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as early August, AST executives were painting a rosy picture for 
Wall Street. But less than 30 days later, the company said the profit it had 
projected would instead be a loss and that it was taking steps to rectify the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 From then on, Schraith said, senior executives were researching the company's 
options, and they settled about 10 days ago on the cost-cutting action 
announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The closing of the factory was expected," said Stephen Dube, an analyst at 
Wasserstein Perella Securities in New York. "The surprise was the manpower cuts 
outside of Fountain Valley. We won't find out at least until the March quarter 
if AST is back in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Employees have suspected for some time that last November's layoffs weren't 
the last of the bad news. Speculation surged Thursday when executives told 
employees to report for plant-wide meetings Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I slept OK last night, but it was tough waiting for the 6 a.m. meeting," said 
stockroom worker Jose Corvarruvias, 33. "They started the meeting by saying, 
'Good morning,' but we told them it sounded like a bad morning."

 Saying Jay Leno's humor is on the wrong track, Amtrak has decided to bypass 
NBC stations for its advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Weary of being the target of Leno's jokes on "The Tonight Show," Amtrak, the 
government-supported passenger train corporation is protesting by pulling 
nearly $2 million in advertising from the NBC-TV network. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that NBC can write Amtrak jokes 
faster than we can spend advertising dollars on your network. I give up," 
Amtrak Chairman and President Thomas Downs said in a letter to the network. 
</P>
<P>
 Downs said Amtrak has been unfortunate enough to be involved in a series of 
accidents during the past year, "none of which was our fault," and he is tired 
of hearing Leno joke about safety problems at the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to Amtrak's recent announcement that it would lay off 600 managers, 
Leno cracked that the railroad wasn't going to fire them, just put them on a 
train.

 Providing further evidence that the national economy is purring along without 
serious inflation, the government reported Friday that consumer prices edged up 
modestly in September while retail sales surged and manufacturing production 
remained relatively strong.

<P>
 The consumer price index rose just 0.2% last month on a seasonally adjusted 
basis, after rising 0.3% in each of the previous three months, the Labor 
Department reported. The modest increase was due to declines in the price of 
gasoline, heating oil and apparel and stabilization in the price of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the smallest rise since a 0.2% gain in May, and it came a day after the 
report of an unexpected drop in September wholesale prices. Even excluding the 
volatile food and energy prices, the so-called core CPI rose just 0.2% in 
September after rising 0.3% in August. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first nine months of the year, consumer prices have risen at a modest 
2.8% annual rate, adjusted for seasonal variations. That barely outpaces the 
2.7% rate for all of 1993, the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CPI showed inflation cooling down a bit from the previous three months," 
said Gary L. Ciminero, chief economist at Fleet Financial Group in Providence, 
R.I. "It is not as troublesome as the bond market seems to think." 
</P>
<P>
 However, investors reacted lukewarmly to Friday's reports. The Dow Jones 
industrial average gained 20.52 points to 3,910.47, but the broad market was 
weak: Losers edged winners on the New York Stock Exchange in slow trading. 
Yields on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dipped to 7.83% from 7.85% on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But with less than a month before critical midterm congressional elections, 
the Clinton Administration was quick to take credit for the positive figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, the Administration laid the foundation for a healthy economic 
expansion by a credible deficit-reduction strategy that made room for 
broad-based, investment-led growth in the private sector," said Laura D'Andrea 
Tyson, head of the President's Council of Economic Advisers. "This week's 
reports, like other reports on the economy issued this year, indicate that this 
strategy is working for the American people." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the moderate price report, analysts nevertheless believe the Federal 
Reserve Board is likely to increase short-term interest rates in November to 
head off any sharp price rises in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 A 0.7% decline in energy prices, attributable in part to a glut of crude oil 
worldwide, was the biggest contributor to the CPI's modest growth last month. 
Home fuel oil prices fell 0.4% and gasoline prices dropped 0.6%. In addition, 
coffee prices stabilized after soaring more than 20% in August and July in the 
wake of a brutal frost in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, retail sales showed the economy growing strongly. They jumped in 
September for the fourth straight month, increasing 0.6% to a record $188.4 
billion, the Commerce Department said. For the third quarter, retail sales are 
up 7.5% over the comparable period a year ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is . . . consumer demand is still cooking, it's still humming 
along," said Brian Jones, an economist at Salomon Bros. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding autos, a volatile sector that accounts for about a fifth of all 
sales, total retail sales rose 0.6%, following a 0.7% increase in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The growth was strongest among durable goods, including automobiles and other 
long-lasting items, which rose 1.1% after a 2.4% hike the month before. New car 
sales were up 0.6% after a strong 2.6% gain in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales of non-durable goods, including food and apparel, rose 0.3% on the heels 
of the same increase in August. A notable exception to the general trend was 
apparel, where sales fell 1.5% in September. Analysts attributed the softness 
in non-durable goods to warm weather and the desire by consumers to save money 
to buy more big-ticket items such as cars. 
</P>
<P>
 In a third report, the Fed said a strike by workers at General Motors Corp. 
kept industrial production flat in September after 15 months of increases. The 
production figure was also attributable to a decline in electrical utility 
output, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Capacity utilization -- the rate at which manufacturers run their factories -- 
remained a healthy 84.6%, but that was off from a revised 84.8% in August, the 
highest level since the late 1980s. The September manufacturing figures allayed 
fears that bottlenecks, which could lead to future price rises, are likely.

 Mervyn's Chairman Resigns: The company did not say why Joseph Vesce, 45, 
stepped down, except that it was by "mutual agreement" and that his resignation 
was effective immediately.Mervyn's stores are the weak link in Dayton Hudson 
Corp.'s lineup of retail chains. "It's not surprising," given the problems 
Mervyn's has had, said retail analyst Dean Ramos of Dain Bosworth Inc. Vesce's 
departure comes as Mervyn's is gearing up for a pilot project of store 
renovations and new strategies it hopes will spark a turnaround. Mervyn's, 
which focuses on moderately priced apparel in its 286 stores, has posted weak 
sales and profit figures for nearly three years. Nearly 45% of the chain's 
stores are in California.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks finished mixed Friday and bond yields eased, as investors failed to 
react with much enthusiasm to a new round of economic data showing inflation 
well under control. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.52 points to 3,910.47, but much of 
that move was driven by a jump in shares of Alcoa, the Dow's highest-priced 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market, losers narrowly beat winners on the New York Stock 
Exchange in slow trading of 253 million shares. Most broad market indexes were 
up marginally or down slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond slipped 
to 7.83% from Thursday's 7.85%, and shorter-term yields also eased. 
</P>
<P>
 Some traders were disappointed that investors didn't step up to buy 
aggressively after the government reported that consumer prices rose a modest 
0.2% in September. 
</P>
<P>
 In other news Friday, the nation's industrial production level was reported to 
be unchanged in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Both reports suggested that the economy remains on a moderate growth path 
without serious inflation pressures. That should have relieved investor fears 
that the Federal Reserve Board will be compelled to raise short-term interest 
rates again soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because, at least temporarily, the marketplace believes inflation is not a 
problem, you can have more confidence in the underlying fundamental economic 
scenario, without fear of the Fed choking it off," said Timothy Straus, manager 
of institutional sales at Hancock Institutional Services. 
</P>
<P>
 But traders said the stock market, at least, may well have anticipated the 
good news: The Dow had shot up earlier in the week, and with Friday's gain the 
index was up 113.04 points for the week and within shouting distance of its 
all-time high of 3,978.36. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite of mostly smaller stocks, while down 0.81 point to 767.08 
on Friday, still was up 17 points or 2.3% for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, both stock and bond markets may have been held back Friday by another 
decline in the dollar. It sank to a three-month low against the German mark on 
expectations that Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition will win Germany's 
elections Sunday, thereby bolstering German stability. 
</P>
<P>
 A weak dollar makes it unlikely foreign investors will buy U.S. securities, 
for fear that their investments will be devalued. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.520 marks, down from 1.529 
Thursday, and at 98.20 Japanese yen, down from 99.47. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks getting a lift on expectations of a continuing economic 
expansion included Alcoa, up 3 5/8 to 87; Union Carbide, up 1 to 33 3/4; IBM, 
up 7/8 to 73 1/8, and Dow Chemical, up 1 3/8 to 76 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the tech sector, Intuit rocketed 17 1/8 to 67 3/8 one day after Microsoft 
agreed to buy the software company, which makes the popular home computer 
finance program Quicken, for $1.5 billion. Microsoft lost 1 5/16 to 55 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
 * Long Island Lighting led the actives list on the NYSE, rising 1 1/8 to 17 
5/8, after New York Gov. Mario Cuomo suggested the state buy the utility for 
about $9 billion, or about $21.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 * McKesson tumbled 3 3/8 to 98 on worries that its sale to Eli Lilly & Co. 
will be delayed further. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo's Nikkei index fell 179.54 points to 19,969.29. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX index gained 23.10 points to 2,105.73 in advance of 
Sunday's elections, while London's FTSE 100 index fell in profit-taking, 
dropping 35.2 points to 3,106.7. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index added 18.08 points to 2,777.69. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, renewed worries about dry weather in Brazil fed 
violent swings in coffee and orange juice markets. November orange juice 
futures in New York jumped 9.45 cents to $1.05 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, crude oil prices closed modestly lower, capping a bearish week that 
pulled the November crude contract down $1.29 a barrel, or 7%. That contract 
eased 16 cents to $16.97 on Friday on the New York Merc.

FCC CLEARS WAY FOR NEW SATELLITE TELECOM SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal regulators cleared the way Friday for a new national and, eventually, 
global satellite service offering an array of two-way communications, including 
phone and fax. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike conventional satellites that orbit thousands of miles in space, the new 
service uses satellites that orbit close to Earth.The orbit is low enough for 
people on the ground to use special hand-held phones and other devices to send 
and receive calls, messages, pages and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly five years of work, the Federal Communications Commission 
completed a plan on how companies may provide the service. Specifically, the 
commission, with the help of industry, resolved how public airwaves will be 
shared among companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Six companies have requests before the FCC to provide service. Only five 
national licenses are available, agency officials said. If the commission finds 
all six companies qualified, it will auction the licenses, spokeswoman Susan 
Sallet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications before the FCC are in the names of Ellipsat Corp., Motorola 
Satellite Communications, Constellation Communications Inc., Loral Cellular 
Systems Corp./Qualcomm Partnership, TRW Inc. and AMSC Subsidiary Corp., 
officials said.

MASTER CHORALE TO START SEASON WITH EYE-OPENER; MUSIC: THE GROUP HOPES TO RAISE 
AIDS AWARENESS WITH A MEMORIAL CONCERT TONIGHT AT THE ORANGE COUNTY PERFORMING 
ARTS CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An AIDS memorial concert is one thing, an AIDS memorial concert as a season 
opener is another. But an AIDS memorial concert at the Orange County Performing 
Arts Center -- where they only started allowing coffee last season -- might 
seem downright revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet that's how and where the Master Chorale of Orange County opens its 39th 
season tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the center's yearling director Tom Tomlinson mending more fences? Would 
such a concert have been possible under former director Tom Kendrick? 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I don't think (Kendrick) would have had a choice in the matter," 
said William Hall, the chorale's music director. "We're local, but we're an 
outside group -- we just rent the center." Still -- and although this won't be 
the first AIDS-related program in the building (the Pacific Symphony played 
John Corigliano's Symphony No. 1 there in 1991) -- Hall notes that "for some 
reason, Orange County has not really been in the mainstream of taking hold of 
some of these awful diseases. I just felt it was time."  
</P>
<P>
 Tomlinson did improve the chorale's play dates (along with ordering the java): 
The group has three Saturdays at the center this year. Tonight's program 
includes Faure's Requiem with soprano Rebecca Semanie and baritone Douglas 
Lawrence as soloists. The Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles will join the men of 
the Master Chorale for the first half of the concert, which is devoted to Ned 
Rorem's "Love Alone" and Brahms' "Alto Rhapsody" with mezzo-soprano Wendy 
Hillhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The decidedly seasonal season, dubbed "Love and War," continues Dec. 10 with 
"Reflections of Christmas" at the center and Feb. 12 when "A Valentine's Gift" 
will feature Romantic (in both the historic and amorous senses) melodies by 
Brahms, Schumann and Schubert at St. Andrews Presbyterian Church in Newport 
Beach. The chorale will mark Armed Forces Day, May 20, back at the center with 
Benjamin Britten's "War" Requiem. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall commented on each of the works on the AIDS program: 
</P>
<P>
 * Faure: "I've performed the Faure Requiem probably 40 or 50 times around the 
world, but because I'd performed it so often with other groups, (I'd never done 
it) with the Master Chorale. But I was looking for something very lyric, very 
melodic, that would immediately reach anyone . . . (and people would) 
immediately be amazed at how beautiful it is." 
</P>
<P>
 * Rorem: "I worked briefly with Ned Rorem (on 'Love Alone'), and when we lined 
up before the concert, I had 12 men, and he said, 'Where's the rest of the 
choir?' The work is based on a very intimate poem about two people very much in 
love and one speaking about his sorrow -- I think of it as a chamber work. Now 
we're doing it with 190 men -- the way Ned wanted it done." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about Brahms' "Alto Rhapsody," which was written shortly after the 
deaths of two of the composer's close friends, Hall recited excerpts from 
Goethe's text: 
</P>
<P>
 Who will heal the pangs  
</P>
<P>
 Of him for whom balsam turned to poison?  
</P>
<P>
 Who drank hatred of mankind  
</P>
<P>
 From the fullness of love . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If there is on your psalter,  
</P>
<P>
 Father of Love, a tone  
</P>
<P>
 That will reach his ear,  
</P>
<P>
 Revive then his heart!  
</P>
<P>
 "Those great lines speak to all of us, but very differently to all of us," 
Hall said. "I recently was asked why I chose the 'Alto Rhapsody' for this 
concert. How could you not choose the 'Alto Rhapsody'? 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make a difference if it's Orange County or Los Angeles or anywhere 
else -- people are divided about how they feel (about AIDS). I wanted people to 
come to grips with their faith and understanding and find that music can take 
them beyond some of their hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is genuine love and excitement over this concert," he added. "Where 
people have been afraid to express that (love), here is a way they can express 
it and feel good about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 To Hall, there is nothing abstract about the impact of AIDS. "I've been afraid 
to count over the years," he said. "We have a soprano in the group who lost her 
son recently. We (in the musical community at large) have lost so many people 
to this dreaded disease. To them, I thought it was time to say thank you for 
your time and your talent and your gifts." 
</P>
<P>
 * William Hall leads the Master Chorale of Orange County and the Gay Men's 
Chorus of Los Angeles in an AIDS memorial concert tonight at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa. The program: Works 
by Ned Rorem, Brahms and Faure. 8 p.m. $15 to $40. (714) 556-2787.

 The 49th annual convention of the Radio-Television News Directors Assn. winds 
up here today after four days of discussions and debates ranging from the 
latest digital technology to methods for keeping tired viewers awake to see the 
late news. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the latest state-of-the-art equipment being demonstrated on the 
massive exhibit floor at the Los Angeles Convention Center and several panels 
about politics and technological advances, however, much of the buzz among the 
about 2,000 attendees centered around the evaporating line of ethics 
surrounding the coverage of sensational stories and celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Rios, news director at KTTV-TV Channel 11, said, "Here in Los Angeles 
especially, with all the recent examples we've had, the whole profession is 
long overdue for some healthy self-examination." 
</P>
<P>
 During one of the livelier panels at the convention, attorney Howard Weitzman, 
who has represented Michael Jackson, Kim Basinger and O.J. Simpson, and others 
blasted the news directors for stories filled with rumors and innuendo that 
they said have damaged the lives and reputations of celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one of those who feel that journalists have not only stepped over the 
line, but you can't see the forest for the trees," Weitzman said during a panel 
discussion Thursday titled "Private Lives of Public People." "You don't even 
know where the line is anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman, who represented Simpson before he was charged with the murder of his 
ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman, called the 
television news coverage of that case "outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be this sick obsession with the voyeuristic aspect of 
celebrities, and people are getting overdosed on it," said another panelist, 
Roy Aarons, president of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But panelist John Tomlin, executive producer of the tabloid TV newsmagazines 
"American Journal" and "Inside Edition," defended the intense interest of 
journalists in the comings and goings of celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe celebrities think they have privileges that most of us don't have," 
said Tomlin. "We should look into their private lives. We have an obligation to 
see what they're up to." 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzman also complained that news organizations are too slow to apologize or 
issue retractions when mistakes are made in their coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The moderator of the session, Emily Rooney, a former ABC News producer who is 
now working on a new newsmagazine for Fox, blasted KNBC-TV Channel 4 for its 
apology concerning a recent erroneous story about the Simpson case by reporter 
Tracie Savage. Several days after her report about tests conducted on socks 
seized at Simpson's home was denounced as false by Judge Lance Ito and 
prosecutors, Savage went on the air and blamed her sources for supplying 
erroneous information. 
</P>
<P>
 "That apology was wimpy and mealy-mouthed," Rooney said. "I would have been 
happier if they had said, 'We made a mistake; we blew it.' People are ready for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Illustrating her point, Rooney praised KCBS-TV Channel 2 for its explanation 
and apology for an error on a Simpson-related story about what time prosecutor 
Marcia Clark had been present for a search of the former football star's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Some news directors at the session also said they were horrified at some of 
the coverage surrounding celebrities and at the intense focus on the Simpson 
case. And in the hallways, some expressed concern about the direction of 
television news.

PLAYTIME IS NOT YET OVER FOR THE BOYS OF IMMATURE; POP BEAT: THE TEENS' HIT 
BALLAD 'NEVER LIE' INVITES COMPARISONS TO THE JACKSON 5. BUT MANY OTHER KIDDIE 
GROUPS END UP IN THE HAS-BEEN BIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The 13-year-old boys in Immature, the Los Angeles R&B vocal group whose 
soulful "Never Lie" is one of the fall's biggest singles, seem determined to 
live up to their name as they gather to discuss their suddenly escalating 
career. The youngsters' nicknames are Batman, Romeo and LDB, but you could 
easily substitute Larry, Moe and Curly. 
</P>
<P>
 In their manager's North Hollywood office, Marques (Batman) Houston, Jerome 
(Romeo) Jones and Kelton (LDB) Kessee -- can't sit still very long. 
</P>
<P>
 Crammed on a small couch and constantly jockeying for more comfortable 
position, they squirm, poke each other, giggle, trade insults and constantly 
interrupt each other. 
</P>
<P>
 They do one have serene moment -- crooning an a cappella version of their hit 
ballad. After finishing, Houston boasts: "I told you we were good." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the group started getting airplay last summer, there has been an endless 
series of comparisons to the Jackson 5. That may be a stretch. How many times 
does Michael Jackson come along in a century? 
</P>
<P>
 Still, these guys are far better than most pubescent singing groups, most of 
whom have lots of attitude and flash but scant talent. Immature can not only 
carry a tune and harmonize effectively, they can also play instruments -- Jones 
on bass, Houston on keyboards and Kessee on drums. 
</P>
<P>
 For a kiddie soul collection, the trio's "Playtyme Is Over" is solid stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think we're too young to be good singers, but we fool them all the 
time," Kessee says in a serious moment. "We're young, but we've had a lot of 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Though barely at puberty, these teen-agers already have made two albums and 
been on two different labels. They were signed in 1991 by Virgin Records, but 
were dropped after their 1992 album, "On Our Worst Behavior," flopped. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear the group tell it, the failure was no surprise. Even they didn't like 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That album was too bubblegum," Jones says, sliding off the couch onto the 
floor. "It was just for kids. Our image was for kids too . . . weird clothes, a 
bright, colorful look. But a lot of people weren't relating to the look or the 
record." 
</P>
<P>
 Reclaiming his spot on the couch, Jones continues: "The new album is less 
bubblegum, something kids and adults can relate to. It's not immature, it's 
more mature." 
</P>
<P>
 Immature got started about four years ago when Jones, who was born in Venice, 
and his manager, Chris Stokes, were looking to start a group. They recruited 
Houston, who appeared on the first album, and ultimately Kessee, who joined 
after that album was recorded. Both are from South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have always wanted to be in show business in some way," Jones says. 
"We're natural performers, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the music career doesn't work out, all have acting experience to fall back 
on. They appeared in the movie "House Party 3" and the last few episodes of the 
TV show "A Different World." Houston is the most experienced actor of the 
group, with a regular role as a pesky neighbor on the ABC sitcom "Sister 
Sister." 
</P>
<P>
 Highly rated during a trial run this past spring and summer, the show is 
scheduled to return at the end of this year as a replacement for one of the new 
season failures, a show spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The demands of a hit series, though, could cause conflicts with Immature's 
singing career. If faced with the choice of TV series or Immature, Houston 
insists, "I'd stick with my boys." 
</P>
<P>
 He looks serious and sincere until Kessee declares, "I don't believe that." 
</P>
<P>
 The trio trades insults for a short while before winding into a discussion of 
what's clearly their favorite subject -- girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the idea of girls screaming over me," Houston gushes. "It makes me 
feel great. I hope that part never ends." 
</P>
<P>
 But that part, as well as their music career, faces familiar obstacles. Most 
singers geared to the fickle kiddie market are has-beens after a few albums. 
Even New Kids on the Block -- one of the biggest sellers of the last decade -- 
have been placed in the has-been hall of fame by most pop observers. And don't 
forget all the talk about big careers for such other fading hit-makers as Kris 
Kross and ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters, however, appear to be confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far ahead as I can see, we're doing very well, selling million of albums, 
going on tours, with girls screaming and crying," Houston boasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Should they last for several more years, that name Immature won't fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've thought of that," Houston says. "We'll just change it to I'm Mature. 
We'll be mature by then." 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't bet on it," Jones quips.

TAKING AN EARLY PEEK AT THE NEW AHMANSON; THEATER: THE $17-MILLION FACE LIFT 
WILL BE COMPLETED IN TWO MONTHS. THE NEW INTERIOR HAS A MORE INTIMATE FEELING 
FOR AUDIENCE AND ACTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Gordon Davidson, temporary tour guide as well as artistic director of the 
Center Theatre Group, strode past a corps of construction workers on lunch 
break as he pointed to the new box office for the Ahmanson Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's off to the side rather than being a pimple in the middle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the 27-year-old Ahmanson has been going through 16 months and $17 million 
worth of plastic surgery, including a new facade and extensive interior work. 
Two months from today, the renovation will be formally dedicated. "Miss Saigon" 
will be the first show to test the new configuration when it officially opens 
Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are more than cosmetic. With mobile walls installed in the 
mezzanine and balcony, the seating capacity of the hall will be flexible. 
Davidson predicts the most popular capacity in the future will be around 1,400, 
which would entail closing off the back of the mezzanine and the back of the 
balcony. That arrangement is supposed to promote intimacy for spoken drama but 
also retain lower-priced seats for those who can't afford the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 A capacity of 1,700 is also easily available, if the entire mezzanine is open, 
but the back of the balcony is cut off. First, however, for the giant-sized 
"Miss Saigon," the capacity will return to the neighborhood of 2,000 that 
prevailed before the makeover. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever seating configuration is used, the interior of the auditorium should 
be more intimate now. The mezzanine and balcony have been extended forward two 
rows. Suspended acoustical panels and architectural lighting will make the 
ceiling look lower. 
</P>
<P>
 The mezzanine and balcony now extend around a graceful curve into the sides of 
the hall, where you'll find five boxes on each side -- two on each side of the 
mezzanine level, and three on each side of the balcony level. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that if you were in the balcony," Davidson said, "you didn't 
see anybody else in the audience. But in Shakespeare's day, the audience saw 
each other as part of the event. It was a community as opposed to an 
unidentified mass like in a movie theater." He hopes the boxes will help 
restore that sense of a community event to the Ahmanson. 
</P>
<P>
 "But regardless of whether there are people in them, the boxes embrace the 
audience," Davidson continued. "They become acoustical enhancers, pushing the 
sound back toward the center of the hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course theater boxes often connote an element of elitism, Davidson noted. 
These probably won't be an exception. A donation of $350,000 will buy 20 years 
of rights to opening night tickets plus fringe benefits for a balcony box 
seating four, while $500,000 will get you one on the mezzanine level for the 
same term. So far, one box has sold at each price level. 
</P>
<P>
 Down on the orchestra floor, the new seating will be more flexible, allowing 
aisles rather than the previous unbroken rows of continental seating. Not only 
will this encourage more audience mingling, but it will allow directors more 
freedom to use the aisles. "Before, there was no access to the stage except 
from the sides," Davidson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The east backstage area is now much larger. The cafe that used to be there has 
been moved to the plaza, where the Music Center store used to be, and five 
dressing rooms were removed (three have been moved upstairs). That whole area 
"has been a problem for many, many shows," Davidson said. In fact, producer 
Cameron Mackintosh has said he couldn't have brought "Miss Saigon" to the 
Ahmanson without the expanded backstage. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage itself wasn't ignored. "We now have the ability to thrust the stage 
into the audience 8-10 feet, using any shape you want," Davidson said, wiping a 
glob of wet cement from his shoe. He added that this stage design was "a 
personal request of Charlton Heston," veteran Ahmanson actor and CTG board 
member. 
</P>
<P>
 "I nagged everybody about that," confirmed Heston in a separate interview. A 
British colleague once told Heston that acting onstage at the Ahmanson was 
"like playing on the cliffs of Dover, except the audience is in France." 
</P>
<P>
 "From the beginning, the Ahmanson has been close to a disaster as a stage 
machine," added Heston, "and everyone who played there knew it." But Heston now 
believes "we finally got it right. I think it'll be a knockout." Even when the 
stage isn't thrust out 10 feet, he said, the front row of seats is now only six 
feet from the lip, "compared to what seemed like a mile and a half." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the work hasn't been completed, the lobby and forecourt are designed 
to have a more open feeling. In addition to the shift of the box office, the 
pool behind the Taper and the colonnade in front of the Ahmanson have been 
removed, mapping out a larger court. Green glass has replaced the darker glass 
in the front windows, which now wrap around the east side of the lobby. The 
mezzanine and balcony offer more far-reaching views. 
</P>
<P>
 The customer service areas also have changed. The hall is now said to be 
completely up-to-date in facilities for the disabled. Because of a change in 
the law, the bar no longer is situated behind a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's restrooms have been enlarged -- although, noted Davidson ruefully, 
while leading his tour group past the restrooms, "I will go to my grave never 
being able to satisfy the ladies." 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag on the project remains at the $17.1 million projected when 
construction started a year ago. Five sources contributed: L.A. county ($5 
million), the Music Center ($3.5 million), Center Theatre Group ($3.8 million), 
the Ahmanson Foundation ($2.8 million) and the Theatre and Forum Lease Company, 
the nonprofit group that issued the original bonds that built the Music Center 
($2 million). Ellerbe Becket, the architectural firm descended from the 
original building's architect, Welton Becket, designed the project with the 
help of Theatre Projects Consultants and acoustician Robert F. Mahoney. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave us the building we wanted at the price we could afford," said 
Ahmanson general manager Ellen Fay-Lee.

IT'S GONNA BE A VIDEO JUNGLE OUT THERE; VIDEO-GAME STARS DONKEY KONG AND SONIC 
THE HEDGEHOG WILL BATTLE IT OUT WITH NEW GAMES BACKED BY TECH ADVANCES AND 
MEGA-MARKETING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 On movie screens this fall, Tom Cruise will compete with Robert De Niro. On 
television, Tim Allen and Kelsey Grammer are duking it out. In record stores, 
Pearl Jam will square off against Michael Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the world of video games, look for the battle of Sonic the Hedgehog and 
Donkey Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 The expected hit titles, Sega of America's Sonic & Knuckles (due in stores 
Tuesday) and Nintendo of America's Donkey Kong Country (due Nov. 21), both 
purport to radically advance 16-bit video-game technology (the former on Sega's 
Sega Genesis system, the latter on Nintendo's Super NES system). They will also 
be backed by unprecedented marketing campaigns: Sonic & Knuckles will be 
propelled by a worldwide, $45-million drive, while Donkey Kong Country will be 
boosted by $16 million in advertising in America alone. By contrast, a 
high-profile video game usually receives a $5-million send-off. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Franco, supervisor of Game Dude, a video-game shop in North Hollywood, 
calls the battle "the Nintendo mascot vs. the Sega mascot." 
</P>
<P>
 These Hollywood-sized campaigns are reflective of a business that has become 
as lucrative as movie-making. While the cost of developing a video game is 
roughly the same as a modest, independent motion picture -- roughly between 
$100,000 and $2 million -- they can make blockbuster-style money, with hits 
earning more than $100 million in sales. If both games, each retailing for 
$69.95, meet their sales goals, they'll make at least $140 million in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonic & Knuckles is the fifth Sega Genesis game starring Sonic the Hedgehog, 
whose $1 billion in sales of games and ancillary merchandise makes him easily 
the hardest working hedgehog in history. This game teams him up with Knuckles, 
a red Australian Echnidna with dreadlocks, in an effort to defeat Dr. Robotnik 
and his fearsome Death Egg.  
</P>
<P>
 The game's gimmick is its unique "Lock-On" technology, in which previous Sonic 
games can be inserted into the top of Sonic & Knuckles while it in turn is 
inserted in the Sega Genesis game. This will introduce Knuckles and his 
distinctive movies into the previous Sonic games and allow players to discover 
new playing fields hidden in the old games. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that has been two years in development, and we weren't sure 
we'd be able to do it until maybe the last six or eight months," says Roger 
Hector, director of the Sega Technical Institute. "We were pretty far along in 
developing this game before we proved to ourselves that technically we could 
modify the other games." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lock-On," or the physical connection between the two game cartridges, "allows 
for potential sharing of game memory, and what was a 16-megabit game, Sonic 3, 
when combined with an 18-megabit game in Sonic & Sonic & Knuckles, in effect 
becomes a 34-megabit game," Hector explains. "We had to develop a pretty 
highfalutin program to allow for that kind of swapping of memory." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the two games are merged, Knuckles becomes the featured character in both 
Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and 3. "Knuckles has different abilities. He can climb, 
fly, glide and punch his way through things that Sonic couldn't do," says 
Hector. "So not only does he get transported into the game, but the game itself 
becomes modified, with new places Knuckles can go to. Knuckles can actually 
climb to places that Sonic never could. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the one thing that kids and parents appreciate," Hector says. "Once 
they've breathed new life in an older game that isn't being played as much 
anymore, that's definitely more bang for the buck." 
</P>
<P>
 Franco of Game Dude says, "I think it's a really great idea on their part. 
It's the first time anyone has done something like that, but it's good 
marketing. It will get people to go out and buy the older cartridges." 
</P>
<P>
 Sega's overall sales goal is to sell 2 million units in America, and another 2 
million worldwide. But Nintendo's goals for Donkey Kong Country are even more 
ambitious -- the company hopes to sell 2 million games in the month between the 
game's release and Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Donkey Kong Country revives the ape from Nintendo arcade and video games a 
decade back (said games spawned the string of Mario Bros. games), unites him 
with a sidekick named Diddy Kong, and sets them loose on a playground of some 
60 regular playing levels and another 40 secret, hidden levels. Their exploits 
are rendered in spectacular 3-D images and animation created on Silicon 
Graphics workstations. 
</P>
<P>
 Donkey Kong Country, Franco marvels, "has some of the best graphics I've ever 
seen in a video. It can't be compared to anything else. It's like high-end 
computer graphics." 
</P>
<P>
 That 2-million sales figure in one month is "unprecedented," admits Peter 
Main, the vice president of marketing for Nintendo of America, "but it's based 
on the off-the-chart reactions we've received from game players and retailers. 
It's something they haven't seen enough of, in terms of breakthrough 
components, that advances the state of game-play, visuals and audio (the music 
from the game will be released separately on CD). 
</P>
<P>
 "They see in this product the same things that have been promised for (more 
expensive and more powerful) CD-ROM and 32-bit games and it's a miracle that it 
can be delivered in a 16-bit cartridge." 
</P>
<P>
 In order to significantly enhance the texture of the graphics, very little in 
terms of game play or response time was lost, according to Dan Owsen, product 
manager for Nintendo of America. "We did have to sacrifice some color, but it's 
still a 256-color screen, so it's close to a personal-computer level of 
colors." Owsen adds that an upcoming racing game, UniRacer, will incorporate 
some of the same style of 3-D graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 All well and good, but what are the characters in these games like, up close 
and personal? 
</P>
<P>
 Main describes the ape Donkey Kong as "meaningful," "lovable" and 
"empathetic." Diane Fornasier, group marketing director for Genesis and Game 
Gear, allows that "Knuckles is definitely a bit edgier than Sonic. . . . He 
definitely has a mission in life, and it's a very strong commitment. His edgy 
attitude is reflected by the knuckles on his fists and his dreadlocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It actually gets to be funny," Fornasier says, "how we start talking about 
these characters like they're real. They do have their own personalities. We'll 
say, 'Knuckles would love that' or 'Knuckles would love to do that.' "

THEATER REVIEW; OUTRAGEOUS FORTUNE; RICH 'HAMLET' CAST BEQUEATHED WEALTH OF 
EXQUISITE COSTUMES, LIGHTS, SET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 There have been as many Hamlets as there have been actors to play him. 
Burton's was as different from Barrymore's as Barrymore's from Kean's. With 
Andrew Pinon as the Melancholy Dane under Pamela Richarde's direction at 
Fullerton College, the play takes on the fiery cloak of melodrama, in the good 
19th-Century meaning of the word. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the drab-toned stone battlements and colonnades of William D. Meyer's 
effective Elsinore, the gentle and fluid shades of Steven Pliska's exquisite, 
painterly lighting design makes the perfect background for the rich reds, 
whites, blacks and deep blues of Mela Hoyt Heydon's Napoleon-era costumes. At 
moments, with Richarde's expert blocking, the scenes look like paintings from 
the Romantic period, though the whole is given a cinematic feel through Kreg 
Donahoe's sound design. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinon's Hamlet is a firebrand with an infectious sense of humor. This is not a 
psychologically oriented performance; its emotions are simple and basic. If 
Pinon doesn't go much below his character's surface, he still hits all the 
right notes. His is an amusing Hamlet that can flash out with surprising 
bravado, and he has a flair for derring-do that fits his interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
 In a young company that has great respect for and understanding of the text, 
and speaks it quite well, Nathan Baesel's staunch Horatio and Kimberly Jones' 
delicate Ophelia stand out. Baesel is one of those actors who accomplishes as 
much being subtle, amplifying his meaning with intuitively informative physical 
action, as many do with bombast. It's a solid performance, as is the girlish 
Ophelia that Jones introduces as a squeaky-giggly innocent who quickly matures 
and then slides imperceptibly into nicely underplayed distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Gavin Carlton's restrained and very funny Polonius and the buoyant and later 
explosive Laertes of Matthew Damico also stand out. The one imbalance in the 
staging has T. Joel Fairley, who is quite funny as the Gravedigger, made up as 
a very elderly Ghost, looking like the grandfather of the brother he was 
murdered by and assuming that because he is dead his Ghost should be lifeless. 
Michael Martin is strong as the murderous sibling, as is Lisa Rohr as Hamlet's 
mother, widow of that aged specter. 
</P>
<P>
 The production features two Hamlets; Sean McNall alternates performances with 
Pinon. It's a safe bet that the company will mold itself to McNall's 
interpretation of a role that every young actor wants to stamp with his own 
imprint. 
</P>

 I was delighted to read about Leila Josefowicz's splendid playing of the 
Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto in Cerritos with Neville Marriner and the Academy 
of St. Martin in the Fields ("A Crowded House . . . and Stage," Sept. 27). But 
I must say that Marriner was not introducing this exciting young musician to 
Southern California, as reviewer Daniel Cariaga wrote.Among her prior public 
performances in the area, I am proud to count her Los Angeles Philharmonic and 
Hollywood Bowl debuts, performing the Vieuxtemps Concerto No. 5 in September, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Josefowicz was a student of Robert Lipsett's in the Colburn 
School of Performing Arts in Los Angeles. As Cariaga noted, she is now studying 
at Philadelphia's Curtis Institute with Jaime Laredo, and I am happy to say 
that she will be back, performing with Laredo and the Los Angeles Philharmonic 
in Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante, K. 364, and Bach's D-minor Concerto for Two 
Violins, at the Music Center, Feb. 9, 10, 11 and 12, 1995.

 Digital 'Crow': "The Crow," starring the late Brandon Lee, has soared to the 
top of video charts and will soon enter the video-game arena. Philips Media 
Games and the newly formed Interactive Company Content announced that they will 
produce a multi-platform compact disc video game based on the urban comic-book 
fantasy. "We see this video game as an extension of the movie, with the same 
Gothic style and hot alternative rock soundtrack," said Miles Mogulescu, 
executive vice president of Content. "The Crow," which was released earlier 
this summer, grossed more than $50 million in domestic box office.

 'Paradise' Postponed: Twentieth Century Fox cited positive test screenings and 
an opportunity to expand its marketing plans as the reasons for pushing back 
the Oct. 21 release date of "Trapped in Paradise," a comedy starring Nicolas 
Cage, Jon Lovitz and Dana Carvey as three New York brothers who come to a small 
town to rob the bank. The film will now open Dec. 2, where it will face

several seconds after each break. In the future, ABC will decide when to use 
the logo on a week-by-week, episode-by-episode basis, said ABC Entertainment

 Rush to Court: Hey, Rush, you shouldn't have used that song. So says the 
writer of the 1963 hit "Hey, Paula," who's suing Rush Limbaugh for playing a

President Clinton. Limbaugh used the tune in July and August with a Clinton 
impersonator singing new lyrics about the sexual misconduct allegations leveled 
against the President by Paula Corbin Jones. Songwriter Ray Hildebrand of 
Overland Park filed a copyright infringement lawsuit this week in federal court 
in Kansas City, Mo., seeking unspecified damages. Attorneys for Limbaugh's

'NYPD BLUE'S' CARUSO LEAVES A SURE THING ON TV FOR . . . ?; TELEVISION: THE 
BIAS OF TIERED STATUS FOR FILM AND TV ACTORS IS BREAKING DOWN. THE REAL ISSUE 
IS MATERIAL. WHETHER DAVID CARUSO FINDS IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When David Caruso returned this week in the season premiere of "NYPD Blue," 
there was a quick, vivid reminder of the big gamble he's taking in leaving the 
hit drama series to shoot for motion picture stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 The ratings for the premiere of the ABC cop drama were potent. Caruso, despite 
his upfront movie money, could easily have had a sure-thing annuity by sticking 
out the run of the series. Instead, he's departing after the show's first four 
episodes, to be replaced by Jimmy Smits. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the siren call of the movies has lured a successful TV star into 
films. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not so long ago, for instance, that Bruce Willis, who came to fame as 
David Addison in TV's "Moonlighting," turned to the big screen in a gamble that 
paid off -- as witness his new movie "Pulp Fiction." 
</P>
<P>
 Another onetime TV star in "Pulp Fiction," of course, is John Travolta, who 
first really drew attention as the character Vinnie Barbarino in the series 
"Welcome Back, Kotter." 
</P>
<P>
 And, hey, isn't that huge movie star Tom Hanks, now headlining the film 
"Forrest Gump," the same guy we remember from the television comedy series 
"Bosom Buddies"? 
</P>
<P>
 When folks like Hanks and Willis make it big-time in the movies, you can bet 
it has an impact on budding TV actors. The money can be enormous, and there is 
still snobbery in certain motion picture quarters toward the folks in 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth is, of course, there can be tremendous money in TV as well. Producer 
Aaron Spelling, who is primarily identified with TV, can buy and sell most 
movie producers in town. As another example, "The Cosby Show" earned more than 
$500 million on just its initial rerun cycle in syndication. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the snobbery is still there, but it's not as pronounced as it used to be. 
Steven Spielberg's company has a piece of the new NBC medical series smash, 
"ER," and also produces two other weekly dramas on the network. 
</P>
<P>
 With good dramatic parts not always in strong supply in films, serious actors 
such as Sam Waterston have no qualms about going to TV or wherever they can 
find them. Example: 
</P>
<P>
 Waterston, who has starred in such films as "The Killing Fields," became a 
regular this season on NBC's "Law & Order." And not long ago, he headlined 
another admired NBC series, "I'll Fly Away." 
</P>
<P>
 The general rule of thumb in TV's early days, when most home-screen stars were 
definitely regarded as second-rung personalities compared to their film 
counterparts, was to get out of a weekly series fast if you wanted to avoid 
being strongly identified with the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 The late 1950s offered an excellent example, when an array of young TV stars 
who would go on to become major film personalities had their own weekly series: 
Steve McQueen played a bounty hunter in the Western "Wanted: Dead or Alive," 
Lee Marvin was a cop in "M Squad" and Charles Bronson portrayed a photographer 
in "Man With a Camera." 
</P>
<P>
 None of their series were on very long. But just to show that the movies' 
attitude toward TV stars was shortsighted and that talent eventually would out, 
there was another young comer who ran for seven years, from 1959 to 1966, in a 
TV Western. The series was called "Rawhide," and the actor was Clint Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastwood, of course, made a real impression on TV. But only truly dedicated 
couch potatoes may recall that for one season, from 1959 to 1960, the sitcom 
"The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis" featured another young comer named Warren 
Beatty. If you want to prepare for "Jeopardy!," just remember that the 
character he played was Milton Armitage. 
</P>
<P>
 The snobbery has also been reduced by some other pro-television turns. Once 
upon a time, TV stars were often cast as second leads in movies, as studios 
figured their fans would simply add to box-office returns. But as the recent 
spate of films based on old TV shows -- "The Addams Family," "The Beverly 
Hillbillies" -- has illustrated, the movie industry now has been taken over by 
the television generation, which is less hostile to the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, we have Ted Danson of "Cheers" as a movie idol. And Dana Delany of 
"China Beach" and Dan Aykroyd of "Saturday Night Live" are starring in the film 
"Exit to Eden." The "Saturday Night Live" cast broke through the film barrier 
like no other group in TV history, with such performers as Bill Murray, Eddie 
Murphy, Aykroyd and John Belushi going on to movie fame. 
</P>
<P>
 Caruso, who reportedly wanted a hefty raise after just one season to remain 
with "NYPD Blue" -- and was rejected by producer Steven Bochco -- is still a 
question mark when it comes to major film stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 But TV, it turns out, can still be a return haven for some headliners whose 
movie careers are not exactly skyrocketing. This season alone, for instance, 
Dudley Moore, Martin Short and Gene Wilder have network sitcoms. None has done 
very well in the ratings -- a reminder that movie stardom rarely counts for 
much on television, which generally creates its own icons, such as Alan Alda in 
"MASH." 
</P>
<P>
 One notable exception, of course, is Candice Bergen, who came to TV after such 
films as "Carnal Knowledge" and "Rich and Famous" and struck it rich in "Murphy 
Brown." Another movie name, karate whiz Chuck Norris of the "Delta Force" 
films, is doing fine in the ratings in "Walker, Texas Ranger." 
</P>
<P>
 Caruso may, of course, return to TV some day in one of the various common 
forms -- on all fours, hoping for acceptance again, or as a movie star who 
wisely has no prejudice about accepting good roles wherever they are, the way 
Holly Hunter does. 
</P>
<P>
 Stars like Dean Martin, who had an NBC variety series as well as a movie 
career, helped dilute the snobbery attached to shuttling between the big and 
small screens. Angela Lansbury, one of the grand performers of stage and 
screen, also made it perfectly respectable to move on to TV, in "Murder, She 
Wrote." 
</P>
<P>
 And in the 1970s and '80s, when TV was often turning out the kind of important 
social dramas that movies had abandoned in their pursuit of the teen-age 
audience, performers such as Vanessa Redgrave -- who appeared in notable 
home-screen films like "Playing for Time" -- often gave the tube the upper hand 
and added immeasurably to its respectability for serious artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Caruso is leaving a great series for a question mark. Nothing is certain in 
Hollywood. Roseanne is big in "Roseanne" but hasn't had much impact in films; 
on the other hand, her co-star on TV, John Goodman, has made it in motion 
pictures. And Rob Morrow of "Northern Exposure" is in a movie hit, "Quiz Show." 
</P>
<P>
 The smartest actors just keep looking for the bread and butter. Dabney 
Coleman, once a hit in such motion pictures as "9 to 5," has become a cult TV 
personality ("Buffalo Bill") and now seems to have a winner, "Madman of the 
People," because it follows "Seinfeld." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Van Dyke, a TV legend, has had a movie and stage career and now is back 
on the tube in "Diagnosis Murder." John Ritter has also made the show-biz 
rounds and has returned to TV in "Hearts Afire." The great actress Cicely Tyson 
is also back on TV in "Sweet Justice." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no best medium. There is only good material. Bette Midler proved it 
again by bringing "Gypsy" to TV. And now Caruso, who left a good thing in "NYPD 
Blue," can only hope that he finds something better.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; STEVEN CURTIS CHAPMAN'S CHRISTIANITY GOES SO FAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bars were closed at the Universal Amphitheater last Saturday night. And 
security was virtually nonexistent, unnecessary. Which isn't to say the 
Christian pop concert there by Steven Curtis Chapman was a sleepy night out. 
The singer-songwriter never stopped moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman -- who sings at UC Irvine tonight -- is at the pinnacle of Christian 
pop with a smooth folk-pop sound somewhere between Michael McDonald's and Bruce 
Hornsby's. He won a Grammy for his previous album, and his newest, "Heaven in 
the Real World," took in more than 500,000 orders before it was shipped. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a level of success that points to further crossover into the secular 
mainstream. The clean-cut Chapman has enough wave in his blond hair to be on 
bedroom posters. But crossover poses as many risks as rewards (it was good news 
for Amy Grant, bad for the rock group Stryper). At the amphitheater, the 
Kentucky native seemed in no hurry to head that way, pausing again and again 
between songs to preach a word or two. 
</P>
<P>
 He told stories from his life, of his three young children and of his 
childhood misadventures with older brother Herbie. Most of all, he spoke of his 
wife of 10 years, Mary Beth, and when he sat down to strum an acoustic love 
ballad to her, he sounded like Kenny Loggins in one of his warmer folk-pop 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope you hear these things as coming from the heart of a friend," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His onstage messages included a lengthy plea at show's end for support of the 
Prison Fellowship, founded by convicted Watergate figure Charles Colson to 
counsel prisoners and bring aid to their families. Chapman has become deeply 
involved in the ministry and suggested his fans stop by the Prison Fellowship 
booth outside the auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 He was an otherwise pleasant and upbeat presence, dressed in a black, 
three-piece suit over a white shirt buttoned to the throat -- an outfit that 
didn't keep him from doing some high-kicking dance steps with one of his 
keyboard players. 
</P>
<P>
 His six-man band had come onto the stage amid enough colored lights and spacey 
mist to make Pink Floyd feel at home. Shortly after an acoustic medley of 
Chapman's earlier music, the group did an amusing rap parody, though the 
Almighty was never more than a verse or two away. 
</P>
<P>
 And then out came Chapman. There were many catchy pop hooks throughout the 
show, sung in his earnest tenor. There was little musically to challenge him or 
his listeners. It was slick pop, well played. But as the concert neared the 
two-hour mark, the good cheer began to wear thin, and the chosen limits of his 
musical scope became all too apparent -- a sign that he really is ready for pop 
radio. 
</P>
<P>
 * Steven Curtis Chapman sings tonight at 7 in the Bren Events Center at UC 
Irvine, Campus Drive and Bridge Road, Irvine. $17.50 to $19.50. (714) 856-5000.

TORK, GOODMAN: ON COMMON GROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two recent pop reissues have an Orange County connection. 
</P>
<P>
 With Rhino in the process of re-releasing the entire Monkees catalogue 
album-by-album, a tidbit worth noting is that Peter Tork, who played the 
lovably muddled bassist, stumbled into Orange County before he stumbled into 
the Monkees. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1965, Tork moved from New York to Long Beach and supported himself by 
pouring beers and washing dishes at the Golden Bear nightclub in Huntington 
Beach. He also began playing in pickup bands at the Golden Bear, backing some 
of the performers booked there -- which is how he renewed acquaintance with 
Stephen Stills, whom he had known on the New York folk scene. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Stills who, after failing his own audition for "The Monkees" TV show, 
called to alert Tork to the tryouts. You and your Auntie Grizelda know the rest 
of the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Also recently released is "No Big Surprise: The Steve Goodman Anthology," a 
double-CD collection of 23 studio tracks and 19 live songs from the 
singer-songwriter best known for writing Arlo Guthrie's hit "City of New 
Orleans." The compilation was released Sept. 20, the 10th anniversary of 
Goodman's death (of leukemia, at 36). 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman was a Chicagoan (the compilation includes songs called "Go Cubs Go" 
and "A Dying Cub Fan's Last Request") but he lived the final four years of his 
life in Seal Beach, where he had moved at the behest of his friend Steve 
Redfearn, then-general manager of the Pacific Amphitheatre.  
</P>
<P>
 In the album notes, Goodman's widow, Nancy, recalls him setting up his own 
custom label, Red Pajamas Records: "The records originally were sold out of his 
little 'Mom and Pop' shop in our garage in Seal Beach. It was the realization 
of his American dream." 
</P>
<P>
 "No Big Surprise" is available from Red Pajamas Records at its new address, 33 
Music Square West, Suite 102A, Nashville, TN 37203, or by phone, (800) 
521-2112.

MUSIC REVIEWS; NYMAN, PACIFIC SYMPHONY PLAY 'THE PIANO' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The music of Michael Nyman leaves this listener with some wildly differing 
impressions. 
</P>
<P>
 The overriding impression it left after his Thursday night concert in 
Segerstrom Hall was that it is almost incredibly inane. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old British composer seems not to know, or not to care, that many 
of his chord progressions -- chord progressions he seems to take seriously -- 
are so well worn that even pop performers have sent them up. Ever heard "Rock 
Lobster" by the B-52s, Mr. Nyman? The classic Looney Tunes cartoons used a 
piece called "Powerhouse" to depict comic evil of the Tasmanian Devil, Yosemite 
Sam and the like; Nyman uses the same progression without a hint of tongue in 
cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Nyman seems shameless, employing the hoary method of appoggiatura in 
its simplest form to tug at the heartstrings of his unsuspecting listeners. In 
the music to "The Draughtsman's Contract," heard on the first half of the 
Orange County Performing Arts Center event, he borrows bass lines from Henry 
Purcell (1659-1695), gives them a beat, adds saxophones and, presto, vintage 
Nyman. 
</P>
<P>
 His music also seems humorless -- a few Spike Jones-style gun shots, whistles 
and burps would do much of this music a world of good -- and rhythmically flat 
and sentimental. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, some of it is undeniably effective. The rhythmic games and brash 
drive of the selection from "The Fall of Icarus" had a Zappa-like energy. Most 
of the music to "The Piano" -- played on the second half of this concert, with 
eight string players from the Pacific Symphony augmenting the 10-member Michael 
Nyman Band -- also falls into the effective category. There is something 
irresistibly warm and gooey about it, but also spacious and more original. The 
harmonies aren't so tired, the textures are busier and more tantalizing than 
those heard earlier in music from "The Draughtsman's Contract," "Zoo" and 
"Water Dances." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that "The Piano" excerpts were so special on this occasion. Nyman's choice 
of, or settling for, a blaring, shrill sound design made the music hazy, bright 
and confused, where on the soundtrack it woos you with its luxury, clarity and 
glow. His seeming indifference to polished ensemble playing also compromised 
his music. Minimalism -- a term reportedly coined by Nyman himself when, in a 
former life, he was a music critic -- should at least gleam.TIMOTHY MANGAN

MUSIC REVIEWS; PIANO COMPETITION WINNER HARVEY RETURNS TO PASADENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before he began the opening Liszt group at his Ambassador Auditorium recital, 
Thursday night, Michael Kieran Harvey sat down at the German Steinway and 
improvised for a couple of minutes. Although such warm-ups used to be standard 
practice, half a century and more ago, Harvey's inspired noodling must have 
startled the large audience gathered in the Pasadena hall for his official U.S. 
debut performance. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, this was only the first of many surprises in a generous, if 
not comprehensive, program. The major upset was that the 33-year-old Harvey, 
the insider's favorite at the 1993 Ivo Pogorelich International Piano 
Competition held at Ambassador, and then the controversial co-winner of first 
prize, gave an impressive but disappointing recital. 
</P>
<P>
 So disappointing that a handful of cognoscenti , some of whom had admired the 
Australian pianist during the competition, last December, voted with their feet 
when intermission arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake: This pianist deserved his Gold Medal, and still commands 
respect. He plays the instrument with a stunning virtuosity and stamina, a 
poet's insights and abundant musical/mechanical resources. He makes music as 
effortlessly as he breathes.  
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, self-indulgence, glibness and a certain disconnection from his 
listeners seemed to mark much of this event. A quick -- hopefully, short-term 
-- assessment of his present state is that he thinks too much, feels not 
strongly enough and shares too little. 
</P>
<P>
 Always fleet, sometimes light to a fault, Harvey's digitality remains a 
wonder. He literally flies over the keyboard, drops few if any notes, 
specializes, admirably, more in softness than loudness, yet can produce plenty 
of power when that is needed. His tone, even in the most complex of convoluted 
passages, remains pure and edgeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Interpretively, he seems to choose standoffishness in almost everything he 
plays. His Bach, the F-sharp Toccata, became surprisingly moony, but not 
personal. His fascinating but quirky playing of Chopin's B-minor Sonata -- 
sometimes he seems to stop dead between musical sentences -- had beauties 
galore, but those moments were interspersed with weirdnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 What Harvey played most convincingly was the raft of 20th-Century pieces he 
sprinkled through this agenda: his own, very engaging, "Toccata DNA," 
Stravinsky's Three Movements from "Petrushka," Messiaen's "Ile de feu," I and 
II, and Carl Vine's quarter-hour Sonata (1990), with which Harvey had made a 
great impression last December. On all of these he lavished myriad colors and 
an irresistible continuity. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end, when 10:30 approached, he offered two encores: Mark Pollard's 
"Carillon for Sacha" and Messiaen's Prelude No. 1, "The Dove."

VIOLINIST JOSEFOWICZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was delighted to read about Leila Josefowicz's splendid playing of the 
Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto with Neville Marriner and the Academy of St. Martin 
in the Fields ("A Crowded House . . . and Stage," Sept. 27). But I must say 
that Marriner was not introducing this exciting young musician to Southern 
California, as reviewer Daniel Cariaga wrote.Among her prior public 
performances in the area, I am proud to count her Los Angeles Philharmonic and 
Hollywood Bowl debuts, performing the Vieuxtemps Concerto No. 5 in September, 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Josefowicz was a student of Robert Lipsett in the Colburn School 
of Performing Arts in Los Angeles. As Cariaga noted, she is now studying at 
Philadelphia's Curtis Institute with Jaime Laredo, and I am happy to say that 
she will be back, performing with Laredo and the Los Angeles Philharmonic in 
Mozart's Sinfonia Concertante, K. 364, and Bach's D-minor Concerto for Two 
Violins, at the Music Center, Feb. 9, 10, 11 and 12, 1995.

THE 'SHAWSHANK' REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding " 'Shawshank': Solid Portrayals but a Dubious Treatment" (Sept. 23): 
The picture I saw was gripping, taut and crisp. The photography was a stark 
tapestry, and the art direction and costumes were flawless.The performances of 
Morgan Freeman, Tim Robbins and ensemble were heartfelt and wrenching. So, 
where does Kenneth Turan come up with the words "cotton candy" and "rosy glow" 
in looking at prison life in the '40s-'60s? Where was the "warm and cuddly 
fantasy" of survival in prison that I saw? 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that a felon can adjust to the horrors of incarceration, with hopes 
of self-betterment, is not a "rosy glow," it is a base sense of survival -- 
adaptation. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that some long-term prisoners fear freedom more than jail isn't 
"cotton candy" -- freedom is sometimes scarier than we care to admit! 
</P>
<P>
 The "pre-mixed . . . dollop of . . . violence" that Turan writes about was not 
put in the film to shock or titillate the viewer but to remind us that violence 
is always there, all the time, just waiting -- especially for a prisoner who 
won't "play nice."

LET KIRK BE GONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In regard to " 'Star Trek': Even Space Has Its Road Bumps" (Sept. 30), as a 
fan of every incarnation of the "Star Trek" galaxy of spinoffs, I'm trying to 
figure out how The Times came up with the theory that fans would be mad that 
the character of Kirk might expire. With the exception of a very few holdouts, 
I can't think of a single "Star Trek" fan who can't wait for the character that 
was Kirk to kick the bucket. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Generation X fan, I am bored with the first series' stranglehold on the 
development of "Star Trek." Kirk is from a time laden with swashbuckling, 
pseudo-science and imperialism. The new "Star Trek" must face a new generation 
of viewers who are pragmatic, intelligent and have a TV savvy that watches 
Kirk's exploits with a smirk and disinterest. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing against William Shatner, but my and other Trekkies' peeve with the 
latest film is that Kirk is in it at all.

WILLIAM BLAKE: A CREATOR, NOT A MYSTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an otherwise fine review of the Huntington Library and Art Gallery's 
current William Blake exhibition, Times art critic William Wilson resurrects 
the terrible groaner of pegging the man as a "mystic" and a "metaphysical seer" 
("William Blake's Vision Shines in His Prints at Huntington," Oct. 4). 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Northrop Frye, Blake scholars have spent the better part of 40 years 
patiently pleading with various Victorian graveyard poets, alchemists, Druids, 
beats, hippies and New Agers to stop reading Blake as a mystic.Blake remains 
misunderstood largely because of the "mystic-seer" label that distorts his 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake hated mystery and transcendence because they hint at illusory things 
beyond the human. The imaginative act is the only reality in Blake. He didn't 
buy into the spirit world, nor did he believe that the Bible and physics had 
any objective existence apart from their imaginative constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before Einstein, Blake's art argued that Newton's clockwork universe, 
unbending time and even atoms were illusory. Blake never saw the artist as a 
mystifier. Indeed, he saw certain theories becoming a mystified "priesthood" 
and became furious when artists worshiped them. Blake is not Wilson's "seer"; 
he is a creator, defending a human perspective.

THEATER REVIEW; MARGOLYES' 'DICKENS' A PASSIONATE OUTING; ENGAGINGLY, BRITISH 
ACTRESS CRISSCROSSES FROM THE AUTHOR'S BIOGRAPHY INTO HIS WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The UK/LA Festival continues, and unless it adds "Faye Dunaway Salutes the 
Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber," I can't imagine anything in the series more 
satisfying than Miriam Margolyes performing her one-woman show, "Dickens' 
Women." 
</P>
<P>
 Margolyes, a roly-poly British actress who portrayed Flora Finching in the 
film version of "Little Dorrit" and Mrs. Manson Mingott (Winona Ryder's 
grandmother) in Martin Scorsese's "Age of Innocence," is a passionate reader 
and intelligent critic of the great man's work. She would use "great," however, 
only to describe Dickens' artistic gifts. Her evaluation of his life, 
particularly his treatment of his wife, Catherine Hogarth, is less 
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 She is also a delightful actress with a terrific vocal range, which she uses 
to capture young boys, teen-age girls and a variety of silly and touching older 
women. Like the most engaging professor, she freely crisscrosses from the 
author's biography into his work; her extrapolations make both his personal 
history and his characters astonishingly vivid. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickens lived with Catherine and her younger sister, Mary, and the author 
loved to go to the theater with a sister on each arm. He was in love with the 
17-year-old Mary, whom he saw as an angel, a woman who "had not a single fault" 
(as only a very young woman with no claims on a man can have). 
</P>
<P>
 One night, after coming home from the theater, Mary was ascending the stairs 
in front of Dickens, and she fell back into his arms and died. She became the 
basis for many of his angelic heroines, all of them 17, such as Kate in 
"Nicholas Nickelby" and Ada Clare in "Bleak House." They were "mini-breasted, 
pre-pubescent love objects," and, the actress adds, "I find them icky" (she 
rolls her eyes to call attention to her rotund body) "for obvious reasons." 
Margolyes sides with Oscar Wilde, who famously remarked, "One would have to 
have a heart of stone to read the death of Little Nell without laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 Dickens never got over the death of Mary, but, as Margolyes points out, he 
never got over anything. The nadir of his childhood occurred when his mother 
sent him back to his miserable job as a worker in a shoe-blacking factory that 
he had momentarily escaped; it formed the basis for a gallery of loveless 
children he wrote about so heartbreakingly. Margolyes tells this story with 
great compassion for the boy, but her kind, open face clenches with fury when 
she shares Dickens' description of his wife, who delivered 12 children in 16 
years: "Catherine is as near being a donkey as one of her sex can be." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is the older women, the "ones he didn't want to sleep with" and who 
"teeter on the edge of grotesque," who truly "erupt with life." She performs a 
string of them, from Mrs. Gamp in "Martin Chuzzlewit" to Mrs. Micawber in 
"David Copperfield" to Flora Finching in "Little Dorrit" to her wonderful Miss 
Flite in "Bleak House." As a piece de resistance she performs the major roles 
in "Great Expectations," looking up from the podium with the wide eyes of Pip, 
down with the tired eyes of Mrs. Havisham and straight out with the arrogance 
of Estella. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolyes is a fan more than a critic. She says of Dickens: "If he hadn't made 
me laugh so much he would have made me very angry." With the help of Stuart 
Anderson's dramatic lighting, she makes every scene riveting. Her passion is as 
much a subject of the evening as the author himself. Anyone who loves to read 
will recognize her devotion, her attention, and will be enchanted by her gift 
at transforming the pleasures of the text into the pleasures of the stage.

ART REVIEW; EXPLORING THE ALLURE OF THE ANOMALY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The allure of the ideal is matched by the allure of the misshapen: deformed 
lemons with ulcerated skins; tortured bits of volcanic debris in which one can 
see romantic landscapes; hydrocephalic children with flowerlike heads; bottled 
organs preserved on dust-caked shelves; and aberrant skeletons that may not be 
for real.  
</P>
<P>
 At the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities, guest curator 
Rosamond Purcell gathers illustrations of such anomalies from books, 
manuscripts, catalogues and prints in the Getty collection -- mixing up 
literary conceits, historical wonders, biological errors and sideshow phenomena 
with the indiscriminate zeal of one obsessed. 
</P>
<P>
 These illustrations are displayed along with a cabinet of curiosities on loan 
from Purcell's own collection; and color photographs Purcell has taken in the 
back rooms of anatomical museums and medical schools. Her curatorial endeavor 
recalls a range of contemporary work, from Zoe Leonard's recent images of wax 
models in natural history museums to Joel-Peter Witkin's photographs of 
tarted-up grotesques. Yet whereas these artists indulge our baser instincts in 
order to make us question our own voyeurism, Purcell stops short at indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
 On that level, the exhibition is marvelous. Filled with things like Queen 
Victoria's stocking, a five-headed lizard and a voluptuous bunny toy, it is 
quite like a Dali painting come to life -- the uncanny represented with manic 
exactitude. Yet, on the whole, the show feels like a series of missed 
opportunities. Among them, the opportunity to analyze how all art objects are, 
by definition, anomalies, and to acknowledge the cultural specificity of 
"normalcy," in opposition to which these "freakish" artifacts acquire their 
morbid charm. 
</P>

GOOD ACTING IN NOISE WITHIN'S 'LEAR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sabin Epstein's staging of "King Lear," which opens A Noise Within's fall 
season of rotating repertory in Glendale, is a workhorse production -- 
sometimes a muscular, sleek Belgian, pulling the enormous weight of 
Shakespeare's attenuated drama without a quiver; sometimes a broken-down old 
nag threatening to drop in its tracks. However, for all its faults -- and they 
are many -- this "Lear" has staying power. 
</P>
<P>
 So does Neil Vipond, an actor mature enough to convincingly capture Lear's 
descent from robustness to frailty, yet vigorous enough to meet the prodigious 
physical demands of the role (notwithstanding a hint of Bill Clinton throat on 
opening night). Vipond's most impressive feat is finding the irony, even the 
laughter, between the lines of his archetypally tragic monologues. Sometimes 
more querulous than pitiable, Vipond overbalances the delicate blend of 
residual majesty and pathos that would make him a great Lear, but he is 
certainly a good Lear, one with comic timing, no less. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast is consistently competent, but along with Vipond, the acting honors 
go to Deborah Strang and Jenna Cole, who play Goneril and Regan as simmering, 
face-clawing vixens straight out of an Aaron Spelling series. Teflon actresses, 
these two never get stuck in Epstein's sometimes plodding pace, and even glide 
serenely through the play's most overblown moments, in which they fling 
themselves at the men in their orbit like oversexed mud wrestlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Seemingly intent upon idiot-proofing his Shakespearean interpretation, Epstein 
reaches into his bag of tricks too frequently. One of his less successful 
gimmicks is the double-casting of Ann Marie Lee as both the Fool and Cordelia. 
Lee's Cordelia is more successful, but the conceit behind this double-casting 
remains murky. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater, currently in the process of a massive upgrade, features 
jury-rigged seating that was only OKd by city inspectors within days of opening 
night. Perhaps last-minute alterations in the seating arrangement might account 
for heavily shod actors frequently pounding within inches of the front-row 
patrons' toes, a persistent distraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Eigenbrodt's minimalist set consists primarily of an enormous, crown-like 
circlet that hangs above the actors. Swathed in silver fabric, the circlet is 
doubtless intended to convey the weight of majesty and the circular workings of 
fate, but instead gives the odd, anachronistic impression that it has been 
covered with foil. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the production itself, Roxanne Femling's costumes are a mixed bag, often 
handsome, especially in the court attire of the royals, most particularly 
Goneril and Regan. However, Femling's use of gold and silver-flecked synthetics 
as accent notes seems jarringly modern, as does the all-black garb of the 
ensemble, who resemble hooded Ninja assassins. 
</P>
<P>
 * "King Lear," A Noise Within, 234 S. Brand Blvd., Glendale. Plays in rotating 
repertory. Call for days and times. Ends Dec. 11. $17-$19. (818) 546-1924. 
Running time: 3 hours, 35 minutes. 'Powerless' Search for Power at Coast 
</P>
<P>
 "Power of the Powerless" at the Coast is intended to be a riveting drama about 
the insidious effects of racial hatred and the endemic bias against Latinos in 
American society. Written and directed by Martha Velez, the play is 
well-meaning but misguided. 
</P>
<P>
 The gentle Marco (Del Zamora), an illegal Latino day laborer, scraps for 
whatever jobs he can get to support his wife and sprawling brood of kids back 
in Mexico. The embittered Jarvis (Nathan LeGrand), a racist white, has lost his 
wife and kids to divorce and his highly paid job to his own splenetic temper. 
The men, who meet while vying for minimum wage jobs on a Los Angeles street 
corner, clash a little, bond a lot, face adversity together and profoundly 
change each other forever. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a promising concept that Velez hammers into mush. Velez's characters are 
cardboard, her dialogue painfully reiterative, her plot just plain sloppy. The 
play is over-acted and under-directed, with florid performances and painfully 
pregnant pauses; when the actors aren't chewing the scenery they are evidently 
forgetting their lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Those trapped in the audience of "Power of the Powerless" are the truly 
powerless. -- F.K. F.

AMERICAN RENEGADE'S TENSE 'BABY DANCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHILIP BRANDES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jane Anderson's "The Baby Dance" is a fertile-enough script to sustain two 
consecutive -- and markedly different -- Los Angeles stagings. More overtly 
confrontational than the delicately nuanced Theatre 40 production that closed 
last month, the American Renegade Theatre Company's tense version makes for 
profound moral dilemmas and some particularly sharp exchanges when a childless 
Hollywood yuppie couple (Janet Wood, Noel Webb) contract with an impoverished 
Southern family (Tammy Kaitz, Paul Gunning) to assume the expenses for Kaitz's 
pregnancy in exchange for adoption rights to the child. 
</P>
<P>
 From Wood's early grimace at the sight of the white bread and Spam her 
surrogate thrives on, an eventual culture clash explosion is inevitable. Solid 
performances from Kaitz and Wood make the women's outbursts compelling, and 
Gunning's portrait of a slovenly bigot is frighteningly believable. 
</P>
<P>
 But director Jessica Kubzansky amplifies the emotional intensity across the 
board, sometimes to unnatural heights. Simultaneously delivered dialogue 
originally scripted as statements and responses prove glaringly artificial. 
</P>

HOME ENTERTAINMENT; A FRED AND RITA DOUBLE BILL: NEVER LOVELIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred Astaire danced with practically every female movie star who could move 
her legs, but for purists, there was only one partner good enough for Fred and 
that was Ginger Rogers. Columbia TriStar Home Video, however, has put together 
a double laser-disc package ($60) that just might challenge that conventional 
wisdom. 
</P>
<P>
 The films are from the early 1940s and they feature one of Astaire's most 
ravishing leading ladies, Rita Hayworth, who matches Astaire's grace and skill 
step by step. The plots of 1941's "You'll Never Get Rich" and 1942's "You Were 
Never Lovelier" may be as bad as any that put Fred and Ginger together, but the 
dances are sublime and Hayworth never looked better. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a shame that the black-and-white transfer did not come from a better 
print or negative: There are far more blips, pops and flashes than viewers 
expect of laser discs transferred from films of that era. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Astaire pictures were never known for their complex story lines, it is 
tempting to use the laser technology to flit from one song and dance number to 
the next. But that would be a mistake, because the supporting performances in 
these two films (Xavier Cugat and Larry Parks in "Lovelier"; Robert Benchley in 
"Rich") are a notch better than the earlier RKO Astaire-Rogers vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Informative liner notes help put both films in the context of their times, 
especially Astaire's partnering of Hayworth, whom he considered a very quick 
study. "I'd show her a routine before lunch. She'd be back right after lunch 
and have it down to perfection," he's quoted as saying. "She apparently figured 
it out in her mind while she was eating. But she was better when she was (on 
camera) than at rehearsal. She danced with trained perfection and 
individuality." 
</P>
<P>
 Both films boast top scores by two of America's greatest composers. Cole 
Porter did "You'll Never Get Rich," which includes his seldom heard "Dream 
Dancing," "Since I Kissed My Baby Goodbye," "Wedding Cake Walk" and "So Near 
and Yet So Far." Porter had a good deal of fun with another number aptly called 
"A-Stairable Rag." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerome Kern and lyricist Johnny Mercer were responsible for "You Were Never 
Lovelier," which includes the familiar "Dearly Beloved," reprised several 
times, the silly "Ding Dong Dell," the spectacular "Audition Dance," the 
classic "I'm Old Fashioned" and the title song. Both "I'm Old Fashioned" and 
"You Were Never Lovelier" went on to become standards. 
</P>
<P>
 MCA Universal Home Video, in the meantime, has a terrific pre-Christmas gift 
with a double bill ($60) featuring Astaire and crooner Bing Crosby. The 1942 
classic "Holiday Inn" and the 1946 "Blue Skies" have the thinnest of plots and 
the best of Irving Berlin's familiar melodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Holiday Inn," of course, introduced holiday standards to movie audiences that 
ultimately had to have their own films built around them: "White Christmas" and 
"Easter Parade" (no matter if it had been in the stage musical "As Thousands 
Cheer"). With songs, and dances, for just about every holiday possible to 
celebrate, there's also the lovely "Be Careful, It's My Heart" and the 
incredible dance number Astaire filmed 38 times before giving his OK: "Say It 
With Firecrackers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Blue Skies" offers, among other delights, "A Pretty Girl Is Like a Melody," 
"All by Myself," "Puttin' on the Ritz," "Getting Nowhere," "How Deep Is the 
Ocean," "You Keep Coming Back Like a Song," "A Couple of Song and Dance Men" 
and the title tune. You can use the chapter stops to sample some of Berlin's 
greatest hits, but don't miss the tender lullaby Crosby sings to his daughter, 
the enchanting "Getting Nowhere," one of Berlin's little-known masterpieces. 
</P>
<P>
 While the incomparable Astaire and Rogers films have virtually all been 
available on laser, new re-mastered editions are scheduled in a $125 boxed set 
from Image Entertainment this month. Among the most anticipated of these is 
"Top Hat," which was released in early laser days, before the technology 
reached its present state. It's hard to imagine anything, however, matching 
Criterion's superb edition of the 1936 dance classic "Swing Time," one of 
Astaire-Rogers' best films with a Jerome Kern-Dorothy Fields score that 
includes "The Way You Look Tonight" and "A Fine Romance." It is still available 
(CLV, at $40).

COMPELLING JOURNEY OF 'LAKOTA WOMAN'; TV REVIEW: THE TNT DRAMA SHOWS CULTURAL 
PRIDE AND SPIRITUAL AWARENESS THROUGH THE EYES OF A WOMAN TRANSFORMED BY 
POLITICAL ACTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "I found my life, my center, my people," says Mary Crow Dog, a Lakota Sioux 
whose triumphant journey to rebirth and rediscovery during the historic 
occupation of Wounded Knee frames TNT's compelling movie "Lakota Woman: Siege 
at Wounded Knee." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Ted Turner's series on Native Americans, "Lakota Woman," shot in South 
Dakota with virtually an all-Native American cast, is not merely another Native 
American movie created by a white person. It goes deeper than that, mirroring 
squalor, humiliation and ultimate cultural pride and spiritual awareness 
through the eyes of the entitled woman whose published autobiography inspired 
the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The heroine, Mary Crow Dog, who literally rises from the trash heap, is 
impressively captured by the luminous Irene Bedard, making her movie debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Frank Pierson (who wrote "Dog Day Afternoon" and helmed HBO's 
estimable "Citizen Cohn") catches both the comical and tragic side of the 
classic 71-day siege in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Watergate distracts the media, caravans of reporters flock to the 
sight; even a few hippies join the parade to the little church that became the 
Native Americans' battleground. 
</P>
<P>
 But long before we get to Wounded Knee, in some of adapter Bill Kerby's most 
trenchant scenes, we experience Mary Crow Dog's adolescence in a society 
rapidly changing in the 1960s and early '70s.  
</P>
<P>
 Mary, after a childhood spent in a Catholic mission school determined to 
assimilate her into the white world, becomes a Native American without a soul. 
She wanders the streets, partying, boozing, hurtled into a life of jails and 
dead-ends -- the plight of most young Native Americans, the movie infers. 
</P>
<P>
 Her transformation and salvation is the American Indian Movement, where she 
finds political idealism, her native roots and friends whose eyes aren't glazed 
over by alcohol. Sobering up and joining 2,000 other angry Native Americans in 
a battle for dignity at Wounded Knee, Mary gives birth under the fire of the 
FBI, local yahoos and U.S. marshals who act as if they're storming the citadel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was there, I saw it," she says simply at fade-out. This is her affecting 
story, often shot with almost painterly strokes by cinematographer Toyomichi 
Kurita, reawakening what we are told the White House wanted so badly to erase 
from memory. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Lakota Woman: Siege at Wounded Knee" airs at 5, 8 and 11 p.m. Sunday on 
TNT. It repeats Wednesday at 5 p.m. and Friday at 7 p.m.

GARDENING; THESE BLOOMS ARE NO FLASH IN THE PANSIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON COHOON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pansies outsell every other spring annual on the market, and not justbecause 
they have such sweet faces. These plants perform. 
</P>
<P>
 "They bloom from October until summer," says Gary Hayakawa of Three Star 
Nursery in Fountain Valley. "They'll last through May easily. Along the coast 
they'll go even longer -- through June and sometimes July." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the industry has introduced many new faces in recent years, it is the 
older, more familiar pansies that continue to be the best sellers, according to 
growers. 'Majestic Giants,' the first hybrid pansies introduced more than 25 
years ago by Sakata Seeds, are still the ones to beat, according to Paul 
Brackman of Progressive Growers in Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone is always saying they've got something better, but we've yet to be 
convinced," he says. Progressive likes the 'Majestic' mixture for its vigor 
("It seems to improve every year") and its exemplary heat-tolerance ("Great 
choice for inland gardens"). But what impresses customers, says Brackman, are 
the variety's big, bold faces. 
</P>
<P>
 'Majestic' so dominates the market, in fact, that if most people closed their 
eyes and pulled up the image of a pansy, one of the velvet-petaled cultivars 
from this series is what they'd be likely to envision on their mental screen. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is any criticism of the 'Majestic,' it may be that its flowers are 
too large. (They are as much as four inches across at the height of the 
season.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of their weight, 'Majestics' tend to nod their heads," says Larry 
Amling, general manager at Armstrong Nursery in Newport Beach. 'Bingo,' a new 
series bred for strong upper stems, have more upcast faces, he says, but very 
similar color patterns to the beloved 'Majestic' mix. 
</P>
<P>
 'Beacon's Field Blue,' also known as 'China Blue,' a pansy with the same 
indigo tones bleeding into white as 'Chinese Willowware,' is another old 
favorite. Hayakawa at Three Star finds it particularly pleasing when mixed with 
the soft clear yellow of 'Cream Crown.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people think all pansies have to have faces," he says, "but I think a 
combination of clears and faces can be more beautiful. One sets off the other." 
</P>
<P>
 He likes clears alone, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bright yellow with medium blue clear pansies is a classic bedding scheme," he 
says. "Disneyland uses it at the entrance to Tomorrowland most years. It's a 
very clean look." 
</P>
<P>
 Although growers are naturally most fond of their bestsellers, which tend 
toward well-tested cultivars in traditional blues, yellows and whites, both 
Brackman and Hayakawa are excited about one particular newcomer, 'Imperial 
Frosty Rose.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like a big spoonful of raspberry parfait," says Hayakawa, describing 
the white pansy with deep rose markings. "And it is a very strong performer." 
That is unusual in that red pansies are often weaker than other strains. 
</P>
<P>
 Novelty pansies like the 'Antique Series' are not usually favorites among 
growers, but these pastel shades often look better in the garden than in a 
grower's field, and local nurseries found them to be strong sellers last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pastel pansies of all kinds -- especially pinks -- did very well," says 
Cristin Fusano, general manager at Roger's Gardens.  
</P>
<P>
 "One idea we really encouraged -- I've done the same thing in my own garden 
for several years now -- is combining pansies with other annuals in the same 
color range. For instance, apricot pansies and similarly colored Nemesia and 
orange Ranunculus are pretty together. So are 'Imperial Pink' pansies with pink 
Nemesia and rose-colored Ranunculus . Or, if you prefer the traditional colors, 
try blue pansies with blue poppy-flowered anemones and pale lavender Nemesia. " 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Hackman of Heard's Country Gardens in Westminster does something similar 
in her own garden. "I like to combine 'Beacon's Field Blue' and clear white 
pansies with taller cool weather annuals like stock, delphinium and larkspur," 
she says. "It's a cool, pretty look." 
</P>
<P>
 Another way Hackman uses pansies is as an edging plant in front of roses. "I 
like the yellowy-pinks and peaches of the 'Antique Series' with my 'Lavender 
Pinocchio' and 'Bonica' roses," she says. "And 'Masterpiece' is beautiful with 
darker roses." 
</P>
<P>
 'Masterpiece,' a big seller at both Heard's and Roger's last year, is a new 
series with the same jewel tones as the 'Majestic' mix but with the novelty of 
ruffled edges. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are really drawn to it," says Hackman, "but ask, 'Is this really a 
pansy?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Still another way to use pansies is as a bulb cover. 'Beacon's Field Blue' 
over daffodils is a great way to utilize the classic spring combination of 
yellow and blue, says Amling at Armstrong. 'Delft Blue,' a medium blue/yellow 
pansy, over yellow tulips, is a similar idea suggested by Hackman. 
</P>
<P>
 "All white combinations -- very popular at the beach -- are another way to 
go," says Amling. "You could combine white pansies with white tulips, Narcissus 
, and Ranunculus. The bulbs would come up at different times, but the look 
would always be monochrome and delicate." 
</P>
<P>
 As the above suggestions demonstrate, you don't need a large area devoted 
exclusively to annual bedding plants to find room for a few hard-working 
pansies. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever you do, though, choose your pansies carefully. You're going to be 
looking at their little faces a long, long time.

A LITTLE CARE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH FOR THESE PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite their delicate appearance, pansies are tough customers, growers say. 
Get them off to a good start by planting in a location with plenty of sun and a 
nice loamy soil enriched by compost or a potting mix, and they will bloom 
practically nonstop until the heat of summer kicks in.The only additional help 
they'll need is regular watering and dead-heading (snipping off spent flowers 
to keep the plant from going to seed). You'll get better performance if you 
fertilize regularly, but if you're a lazy gardener, you'll be happy to know 
pansies produce quite generously without it. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've had problems with pansies before, here are some additional tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant pansies a bit higher than usual so that the root ball is slightly 
above ground when the soil settles, suggests Larry Amling at Armstrong Nursery. 
This will help prevent stem rot, a common problem. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't over-water once the plants are established, says Gary Hayakawa at 
Three Star Nursery. Over-watering is one of the prime causes of stem diseases. 
Once a week would be sufficient in many locations, he suggests, or perhaps 
twice a week in a hot, inland spot. But never water a pansy bed as often as you 
would a lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider adding a fungicide to your soil at the time of planting if you've 
had problems with damping off in the past, says Cristin Fusano at Roger's 
Gardens. Damping off is a fungus-caused disease that makes plants break off at 
the stems. It has no cure. Public gardens and commercial establishments use 
fungicides regularly to prevent losing large beds of annuals, she says. Ask at 
your local nursery for a product formulated for pansies. SHARON COHOON

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; A SOLUTION FOR PROBLEM OF CABINET MOLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. I'm getting a moldy smell from the inside of one of my kitchen cabinets. 
What causes this, and how can I get rid of it? 
</P>
<P>
 L.C., Anaheim Hills 
</P>
<P>
 A. What you'll want to look for first is the source of the mold, says 
cabinetmaker Steve Alvarez of Santa Ana. Generally, mold is found in cabinets 
under the kitchen sink, where there's a leak in one of the water lines or in 
the drain. If it's coming from a different cabinet, check the walls or 
surrounding area for leakage. Use a solution of bleach and water to wash the 
insides of the cabinet and kill any mold. After it dries, apply in the cabinet 
a sealer or a paint that contains a mildewcide. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We have a hardwood floor in our kitchen that's about 12 years old and in 
need of refinishing. Is it possible to turn a waxed floor into a no-wax floor? 
</P>
<P>
 E.P., Westminster 
</P>
<P>
 A. It depends on the type of floor, but it should be possible, says Mark 
Chamberlain of Chamberlain Floors in Westminster. Most of the floors made then 
had a veneer thick enough to take refinishing. If your floor has bevels between 
the planks, you may have a problem removing the wax that has built up over the 
years. Basically, the floor is sanded and refinished, stained to the color you 
want, and the urethane is applied over the stain.  
</P>
<P>
 Before you go to a no-wax floor, you may want to reconsider. Many people feel 
that a urethane finish is best for high-traffic areas. However, when you get 
scratches in a waxed floor, you can hide them by applying a new coat of wax. 
When you scratch a no-wax floor, you must cover it with urethane, a more 
involved process. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I'm considering putting a ceiling fan in my den, but I'm concerned about 
safety. I'm afraid that if the fan is on I might forget about it, raise my 
hands up and get hurt by the blades. Do any fans come with some kind of safety 
clutch that prevents these kinds of accidents? 
</P>
<P>
 W.B., Brea 
</P>
<P>
 A. Generally, you won't get hurt if you get hit by one of those blades, says 
Bob Owenby of A-1 Fans in Anaheim. They're wood, not metal, and it will 
probably scare you more than it will hurt. Of course, you should be careful 
about keeping children away from a moving fan blade and also stay away from 
commercial fans with metal blades. The blade bracket for most home fans is made 
of metal, but that would break before it did you any harm if it hit you in the 
arm or hand. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I know this probably sounds odd, but I'm thinking about making my asphalt 
driveway red. Is there some kind of special paint that can be applied to 
asphalt? 
</P>
<P>
 C.C., Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 A. Pete Gorman of Rancho Lumber in Westminster says there are different brands 
of driveway coatings, but he only knows of those that come in black. There is a 
curb paint that's used by municipalities to paint red curbs that could work, 
and you may be able to find a paint dealer who could alter the shade to the 
color you want. Before painting your asphalt, make sure it's in good condition. 
Give it a good washing and remove as much dirt and grease as you can. Also, use 
an asphalt patch to fill in holes and cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We're getting new carpeting in our house. We want a cut-pile throughout, 
except for two bedrooms, where we want a Berber style. Is it a problem having 
carpets of two different heights meet? How can that be handled? 
</P>
<P>
 L.O., Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
 A. There is a device that's used to connect different types of carpets that 
creates a professional look, says Mark Silverberg of New York Carpets in 
Anaheim. It's a metal or plastic channel screwed or nailed into the floor, and 
it makes a smooth transition from one carpet to the other. You can also use a 
wood or metal strip at the threshold to hide the seam.

LINENS; THE SENSITIVE REST EASY ON CHEMICAL-FREE SHEETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Printed, swirling, vibrantly colored bedsheets may be a decorator's dream, but 
to Mary Lamielle they are nothing short of a nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 If she sleeps on them, she gets a burning feeling in her nose and lungs; her 
skin feels hot, and she may get a rash and a headache. 
</P>
<P>
 To Lamielle, beige is beautiful, the kind of beige you get with cotton that is 
unbleached, undyed, untreated. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for her, simple nature is re-emerging as a force in a world long 
dominated by brighter-than-life blossoms and Day-Glo graphics. 
</P>
<P>
 Bed and bath retailers have started offering a growing selection of sheets, 
towels and other products made from untreated, all-natural fabrics. Once nearly 
impossible to find, these products now are manufactured by such major American 
mills as Fieldcrest Cannon and Westpoint Stevens. They can be found in 
mail-order catalogues -- such as Garnet Hill, Cuddledown of Maine and Coming 
Home (a subsidiary of Lands' End) -- as well as bed and bath specialty stores 
and upper-end department stores.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's gratifying to see what's happening with marketing of less-toxic 
products. There are more options," said Lamielle, who developed a serious 
sensitivity to chemicals in 1979 and has since had to make her home in 
Voorhees, N.J., as chemical-free as possible. In 1986 she founded the National 
Center for Environmental Health Strategies, a nonprofit education and advocacy 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The market for these untreated products, which are relatively expensive, is 
growing but still small -- perhaps 2% to 5% of their bedding sales, 
manufacturers and retailers estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Regular sheets usually are treated with chlorine or peroxide bleaches, 
starches, dyes, resins and formaldehyde. 
</P>
<P>
 Those chemicals even out fabric irregularities, create pleasing colors and 
patterns, set the dyes and keep the sheets from shrinking or wrinkling. For all 
those reasons, chemically treated sheets are bound to remain popular. 
</P>
<P>
 John Fraley, vice president of department and specialty stores for Westpoint 
Stevens, says the market for these products consists primarily of either 
"upscale, very well-educated consumers or someone who specifically has an 
allergy problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be a narrow market, and now it's a much broader market," said 
Christopher Bradley, president of Cuddledown of Maine. "It's consistent with 
the general awareness with the environment that has taken place over the past 
five to 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The development of chemically untreated products has dovetailed with a fashion 
trend toward more natural colors and more emphasis on comfort, Bradley added. 
"When you don't bleach or dye fabric, it becomes very soft," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers are becoming increasingly creative about making untreated 
products more attractive. They have created stripes and patterns by using 
different weaves and darker and lighter shades of untreated cotton and linen. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest innovation in the all-natural market is color, not from dyes but 
from subtle hues that develop naturally right in the cotton or flax boll.  
</P>
<P>
 Untreated cotton has always been available in a range of colors, but the white 
variety was used commercially because its strength and quality was best suited 
for commercial processing and it could be dyed any color, explained Sally Fox, 
an Arizona cotton researcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox has developed her own breed of naturally colored cottons of commercial 
quality, called Fox Fibre. Colored breeds also are being developed in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Fieldcrest Cannon started marketing the first Fox Fibre products two years ago 
in light brown. This fall the company is offering a line of Israeli-made sheets 
called Colorcot that uses browns and greens in stripes and plaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, who does her research at a 50-acre facility in Arizona, sees a potential 
to breed all the colors that occur naturally in the cotton plant, from ebony to 
redwood to yellow, and says even a blue may be possible. An added advantage of 
the brown shade, Fox added, is that, for reasons still unknown, it is naturally 
very fire resistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Untreated products are expensive. Cuddledown of Maine sells untreated cotton 
sheets for $20 per double flat or fitted, while Garnet Hill's 310-thread double 
flat or fitted sheets go for $68 apiece. Fieldcrest Fox Fibre double sheets 
were recently selling for $24 apiece at department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers say it costs more to make the chemical-free products because 
they require special handling, including double- and triple-cleaning equipment 
to remove chemical residues, and because the items must be cut bigger to allow 
for shrinkage.  
</P>
<P>
 Fox predicts that once production is done on a larger scale, manufacturers 
will save considerable money in dyes, and untreated cotton will become "not 
only the environmental choice but the economical choice." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's also for people who like the idea of using renewable and reusable fabric 
rather than some of the bulletproof synthetics, (that) go to the landfill and 
never die," said Louise Kosta of the Human Ecology Action League. 
</P>
<P>
 Sleeping is a time when the body is supposed to recover from the stresses of 
the day, not to fight off more chemicals, Kosta said. "It's a comfort choice; 
it's a health-related choice, it's an environmental choice."

<P>
 About 6,000 people are expected to participate in a walkathon Sunday to 
benefit Children's Hospital of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Registration is at 6:30 a.m. next to the Performing Arts Center near South 
Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The walk begins at 8:30 a.m. and is sponsored by CHOC. It costs $25 to enter, 
and participants who raise $1,000 through sponsors can win a weeklong trip to 
Walt Disney World in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have babies in strollers, kids in wagons, and people walking 
in costumes just for fun," said Janet Nagurski, a support group assistant for 
the hospital's fund-raising activities. "The money goes to help for the 
children's care. This way, no child will be turned away. It's kind of like 
socialized medicine." 
</P>
<P>
 Children's Hospital, in the city of Orange, is the only pediatric facility in 
Orange County. This is the fourth consecutive year the hospital has held the 
five-kilometer walk, which takes in South Coast Plaza and surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
 Walkers can win prizes, depending on how much money they raise from their 
sponsors. TOM RAGAN

 If Fountain Valley residents are feeling an uncanny need to display 
jack-o'-lanterns this Halloween, there's good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, known as Gospel Swamp in the late 1880s, was once considered the 
pumpkin capital of the state, growing some of the nation's biggest and tastiest 
pumpkins. 
</P>
<P>
 According to reports published by turn-of-the-century pioneers Max Reinhaus 
and Tom Talbert, the Len Layman ranch in Gospel Swamp once produced a gigantic 
pumpkin. Talbert claimed it weighed 301 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the housing boom of the 1960s, Fountain Valley was an agricultural area 
with a village at Talbert Avenue and Bushard Street. Today 
</P>
<P>
 What will, or should, Orange County look like in the year 2020? 
</P>
<P>
 A group of experts in ecology, land use and transportation will gather at UC 
Irvine to discuss that question. 
</P>
<P>
 The symposium is part of a national effort to respond to the 1992 Earth 
Summit, which called on leaders to make cities more friendly to people and the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 The $40 workshop is sponsored by the EOS Institute. Information: (714) 
497-1896.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; FORMER GANG MEMBER TO LEAD WORKSHOP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former gang member George Morales will deliver an anti-gang message at a 
workshop at 2 p.m. Sunday at the Oakview Community Center, 17261 Oak Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 The free workshop is designed "to make kids aware about gangs, so they don't 
glorify it as much," said Maricela Rios, an organizer with the Community 
Service Program's gang prevention effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales, a Tustin resident, grew up on the streets of Santa Ana. A member of 
the F-Troop gang, he said he used and sold drugs from the age of 15. After 
serving 15 months of a two-year sentence for selling PCP, he turned his life 
around, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mixing comedy and harsh descriptions of reality, Morales will talk about the 
consequences of gang activity, give advice to parents and answer questions. He 
will also display some prison-made knives to show young adults what prison is 
really like. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will just try to teach them how not to make the same mistakes I made -- and 
to the parents, not to make the same mistakes my parents made," Morales said.

APPLES FOR TEACHERS; THE COUNTY'S 5 BEST WILL BE RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR 
ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN THECLASSROOM AND THOSE AFTER THE DAY'S LAST BELL

 Social science teacher Renae Boyum just treated herself to a brand-new car. 
It's a 1995 Camaro, hunter green with T-tops. Leather seats, compact-disc 
player, the works. Power everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyum, who works at Garden Grove High, didn't get lucky on a TV game show, or 
enter the lottery. She is one of Orange County's five Teachers of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money's already spent," the 47-year-old educator said sheepishly of the 
$15,000 check she will receive this morning at an awards breakfast. "When I 
heard I was going to win the money, I thought I could do something practical, 
put it away for my kids' college. Then I thought, 'No, this is a 
once-in-a-lifetime thing.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I drive it," she said, "I can think of the honor." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyum and the four other outstanding teachers will be feted today by more than 
300 educators at a breakfast at the Red Lion Hotel in Costa Mesa. The five will 
be eligible for California's Teacher of the Year Award, scheduled to be 
announced next month. Each state's winner will be entered in a national contest 
sponsored by Good Housekeeping magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants must write autobiographies and essays explaining their educational 
philosophies. Many are nominated by their individual districts, where they have 
already won accolades and often perform extra duties, such as grant-writing, 
training colleagues or developing innovative curricula. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lois Knudson, becoming a teacher "was as natural as breathing." 
</P>
<P>
 In school, Knudson recalled, she "was the kid who was never absent because I 
thought I'd miss something." As a teen, she volunteered at a school for the 
emotionally disturbed. For the past 15 years -- a dozen of them in the Irvine 
Unified School District -- she has been working full time with special-needs 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Knudson, 36, said she makes her lessons exciting by bringing in speakers and 
taking students on field trips: weekly shopping expeditions that allow them to 
practice math and use public transportation. Other visits include the post 
office, police station and museums. 
</P>
<P>
 "I laugh all day. You have to," said the Dana Point resident, a special 
education teacher at Lakeside Middle School. "I'm always tired, but I have a 
lot of energy during the day. When (disabled students) have a small gain, and 
it's something that someone said, 'I don't think they're ever going to get it,' 
it makes it all worthwhile. It doesn't matter that you're tired." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Archer, an English teacher at Trabuco Hills High in Mission Viejo, said 
his background as a broadcast journalism student helps him communicate in the 
classroom. But he said the key to effective teaching is making students take 
responsibility for their own educations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot learn for them," said Archer, 40, who has 18 years of teaching 
behind him. "I can teach. But only they can do the work, only they can get the 
grade. I can't teach and learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Archer said he also tries to emphasize context for his lessons: showing 
students not just what they need to know, but why. 
</P>
<P>
 "Learning how to spell tomato is not the key," he said, "as much as it is 
learning how to memorize." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Irini Rickerson's classroom at Orange Coast College, context is key. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Athens, Greece, Rickerson teaches the history of art, architecture 
and furniture. Along with paintings, sculpture and artifacts, though, she 
introduces the psychology and anthropology of each period. 
</P>
<P>
 To make lessons relevant, Rickerson tries to get students involved in the 
community. Recently, she and her class helped design a building for a new 
homeless shelter in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Rickerson, the real rewards come through personal contact with 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I have students that have a major problem. It doesn't have anything 
to do with art history. So many people, they never have a chance to have 
someone there to listen. By listening to them you can really change things 
around," she said. "When I lecture, they can see that I never judge. They feel 
very safe to come to talk to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like all of this year's winners, Marilyne Coats emphasized the importance of 
diversifying lessons to appeal to different types of youngsters. In her 
language arts classroom at Willis Warner Middle School in Westminster, the 
50-year-old veteran educator uses drama, music and art to help students 
understand literature and encourage their writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Students with limited English proficiency or children who are particularly shy 
often surprise her with their abilities through untraditional forms of 
expression, Coats said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students will work toward our expectation," she said. "When we expect high, 
they will reach for it. When you see them reaching, it's exhilarating." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boyum, who has been teaching for nearly two decades, said she joined the 
profession because she saw the powers teachers have. 
</P>
<P>
 It started in sixth grade, when an instructor embarrassed her in front of the 
whole class by asking her to mouth the words instead of singing with the chorus 
because her voice was off key. In high school, two teachers showed a positive 
side of this power by instilling a love of history and political science in 
Boyum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We impact kids' lives . . . in ways that sometimes we're not even aware of," 
she said. "Sometimes kids go off to college and come back and thank us, and 
I've had many who've said they became teachers because I inspired them," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we also impact them in many smaller ways: by being kind to them, by 
noticing that they're there, by noticing that they're not there."

ONE YEAR AFTER THE MURDER OF STEVE WOODS SHOCKED SAN CLEMENTE, THE CITY LAYS A 
FOUNDATION OF CULTURAL AWARENESS, YOUTH PROGRAMS; OPPORTUNITY BORN OF TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES and ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The October attack of a San Clemente High School student who was speared 
through the head with a paint-roller rod sent this seaside city into turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, on the one-year anniversary today of the fatal stabbing of Steve Woods, 
elected officials, educators, police and residents say the city has gone 
through great changes, including a new respect and awareness for youth 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Scott Diehl said the tragedy had a lasting effect for the city and South 
County. It has not only made neighbors cautious, but also motivated residents 
who attended community forums to volunteer time for anti-gang projects. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, officials point to new community programs that include the 
Orange County Sheriff Department's anti-gang detail, a task force on youth, the 
hiring of a volunteer coordinator to funnel residents into community projects, 
and finding jobs for unemployed youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of tragedy, you have to look for the opportunity to make things better," 
Diehl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the high school Woods attended, students were encouraged into 
social awareness programs, offering insights into other cultures and generating 
awareness of youth and gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "South Orange County has come to the realization that we are not immune from 
the same problems that are seen across the country," said Christopher Cairns, 
the principal of San Clemente High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, a 17-year-old senior, died three weeks after the Oct. 15, 1993, 
incident that began as a late-night confrontation at Calafia Beach County Park. 
The roller rod, thrown by Latino youths while Woods was in a moving vehicle, 
entered his head above the ear and passed through the brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustration with rising crime and gang violence turned to anger in the 
community after Woods died. Residents wanted answers, Diehl recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a realization that a kid out to have a good time with his friends 
at the beach could suddenly have his life snuffed," Diehl said. "There is such 
a stark realization there: 'That could have been my child. That could have been 
my neighbor. That could have been my grandchild.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of the attack, hundreds of students and residents had rallies and 
packed City Council meetings, demanding an end to gang violence. It did not 
help that the crime occurred in one of the bloodiest weekends in Orange County 
-- a two-day series of shootings, assaults and robberies, many of them 
gang-related, that left six people dead and eight wounded from Anaheim to San 
Clemente. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, defying their principal's warnings, about 75 students walked off 
the high school campus and marched to City Hall to protest violence and show 
support for Woods. Because Woods was white and his attackers Latino, racial 
tensions flared. While whites still far outnumber Latinos in the community of 
43,000, the Latino population had doubled in the past decade to 5,285, about 
13% of the city's population, according to the 1990 U.S. Census. 
</P>
<P>
 City and school officials have sought to ease those tension through the new 
programs. Cairns is a member of the city's Task Force for Youth, which had 
volunteers during school registrations signing up people for a new tutoring and 
mentor program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other new programs on campus include a Peer Assistance Leadership program, 
known as PAL, and a program known as AVID, which is designed to help prepare 
under represented students for a four-year university. While these programs 
were being planned before the crime, the incident reinforced them. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Byers, a math teacher at San Clemente High School, said she believes 
there is positive direction at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students are getting more involved and they're trying to get the students 
more aware of different cultures," said Byers, an adviser to the campus AWARE 
Club, which is dedicated to increasing understanding of other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 The school celebrated Mexican Independence Day in September. This month 
students are trying to organize Asian cultural activities. Last year, students 
organized a daylong Multicultural Fair, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Woods case raised tensions, Byers noted that the violence never came 
onto campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our problems like any other school," she said. "But we have to take 
it one day at a time and deal with the problems." 
</P>
<P>
 No one wants change more than Kathy Woods, the dead teen-ager's mother who has 
spent much of the last year fighting for tougher juvenile laws she hopes will 
prevent other youths from suffering the same fate as her son. But while she 
said she supports the increased sheriff patrols, she believes the city could do 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Woods said she has seen changes in all of South Orange County in 
wake of her son's death. "There are some awful things that have happened to 
people out there," she said. "I'm zeroing more in on getting these laws 
changed." 
</P>
<P>
 For Sheriff's Lt. Tom Davis, San Clemente chief of police services, the 
dilemma was to somehow placate a citizenry that wanted to put blame on an ethic 
segment of the community, yet retain the public's enthusiasm to help improve 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, gang members from outside the city exacerbated the problem by 
pouring in on weekends, Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right after that incident happened, we were getting gang members from San 
Diego, Oceanside, L.A., San Bernardino and Riverside," Davis said. "We were 
actually stopping gang members cruising up and down (El Camino Real) telling us 
that they came to San Clemente because they had heard or read in the media that 
this was a place for action." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To help combat local gangs, Davis said they formed a four-person anti-gang 
detail, that worked nights. Authorities also targeted the top 20 youthful 
offenders in San Clemente and followed their progress through the criminal 
justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of the 20," Davis said, "18 have a been in custody for parole violations or 
other crimes. And, (U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service) has helped us 
by deporting four of those 18 for being here illegally." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest program with the greatest effect, Davis said, was one to 
change people's attitudes about gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people were very frustrated at some areas in the city that were 
heavily impacted with possible gang members," said Jan Sener, a crime 
prevention officer and co-chairwoman of the task force for youth. 
</P>
<P>
 People wanted the city to do something about overcrowding, junk cars, vehicles 
parked on lawns, even shopping carts left in residential areas, she said. 
Sheriff's deputies could not do everything, but did forward complaints to other 
city departments which has increased inter-department communication, Sener 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to reach 10,000 homes, sheriff's deputies embarked on an enhanced 
neighborhood watch program by offering training and gang seminars to 390 block 
captains. The seminars focused on gang attire, graffiti, how to spot gang 
members and what to do, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis noted with pride that a side benefit occurred when deputies were tipped 
after a seminar to a gang initiation rite known as "jumping in," a ritual 
during which members kick and pummel a prospect for several minutes. He said 34 
young men were arrested on various charges while jumping in five gang recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 And there has been individual efforts, such as that of Ben Villa, a city 
engineer, who helped 15 unemployed city youths find jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one actually wanted to do a one-on-one contact with the kids and that's 
what I wanted to do," Villa said. "I kind of went out on my own and I wanted to 
help just one or two kids. But I ended up with finding jobs for 15." 
</P>
<P>
 For Amanda Miller, a 16-year-old San Clemente High senior and ethnic relations 
commissioner, "the tragedy was a learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she believes that the students, much like the community have 
matured. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like we're moving on from this."

NEWEST TEST BUOYS COUPLE; HEALTH: MISSION VIEJO WOMAN LEARNS THERE'S NO LASTING 
DAMAGE TO KIDNEY SHE HOPES TO DONATE TO HUSBAND OF 4 DAYS. MISHAP COMPLICATED 
TRANSPLANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A pair of Orange County newlyweds whose planned kidney transplant attracted 
nationwide attention before a medical mishap postponed the surgery, said Friday 
they remain hopeful of going through with the crucial operation as soon as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's spirits were buoyed by test results showing no lasting damage to 
the kidney that Victoria Ingram-Curlee hopes to donate to Randall Curlee, her 
gravely ill husband of four days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm feeling great," a beaming Victoria Ingram-Curlee said at a news 
conference at Sharp Memorial Hospital before leaving with her husband for their 
Mission Viejo home. "We got a lot of really good news, which I knew was going 
to happen anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Groggy from anti-rejection drugs given in anticipation of Wednesday's 
scheduled transplant, Randall Curlee, 46, was more philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of ups and downs this week," he said, looking pale and gaunt. 
"The doctors involved" in the routine procedure that went awry "had performed 
it for 25 years without a problem. But it happened for a reason, I suppose." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Sharp Memorial said the switchboard had been flooded with 
hundreds of calls since the couple exchanged vows. The calls accelerated 
sharply after Wednesday's mishap, and included one from a U.S. senator who 
asked to remain unidentified. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the calls came from people hoping to donate a kidney to Curlee should 
Ingram-Curlee's somehow fail to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who was married in a ceremony Tuesday in the hospital chapel, beat 
enormous odds when it was discovered that Ingram-Curlee was a near-perfect 
organ donor for her mate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the preoperative procedure, called an "arteriogram," Ingram-Curlee, 45, 
suffered a small, linear tear in one of three arteries leading to the lower 
part of her left kidney from a narrow catheter tube inserted in the artery to 
check blood flow. 
</P>
<P>
 The mishap forced doctors to delay the transplant three to four weeks to allow 
time for Ingram-Curlee to heal. That day, they said Ingram-Curlee stood as much 
as a 35% chance of permanent kidney damage that would have eliminated her as a 
donor. Curlee needs the transplant because his kidneys are failing from the 
effects of diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ingram-Curlee's behest, doctors conducted a test late Thursday that allowed 
them to observe the function of her kidney and whether any lasting damage had 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the transplant team at Sharp Memorial Hospital here labeled the 
test a resounding success, saying it revealed no damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have waited to give the test," Dr. Arturo Martinez, a member of the 
transplant team, said Friday. "That's because I didn't want to give them false 
hopes either way. But Victoria insisted." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram-Curlee is a remarkable woman and an "overwhelmingly positive" one at 
that, Martinez said, noting that the transplant should occur within three to 
four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted, however, that Curlee may yet receive a kidney from a donor other 
than his wife, should one materialize. Doctors said those chances are minimal, 
but said Curlee remains on a national waiting list. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram-Curlee said emphatically that she did not blame the mishap on the 
hospital, and particularly invasive radiologist Dr. Harold Coons, whose 21-year 
career has included more than 20,000 previous arteriograms -- none with 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Human error," Ingram-Curlee said, then corrected herself. "No, it wasn't even 
human error. Who knows what it was? Why should I be angry? Things happen. Who 
knows what caused that to happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 Without putting odds on a complete recovery, Martinez said Friday that 
Ingram-Curlee's chances of being able to donate either kidney to Curlee "are 
certainly much better now." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing the couple's sentiments, Martinez said he hoped the publicity 
generated by the nationally televised wedding ceremony and the planned 
transplant represented a kind of turning point in more donors coming forward 
for the 25,720 Americans waiting for kidneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's brought some attention and some education to the whole process," said 
Curlee, who met his wife, an Orange County real estate agent, two years ago 
during an open house. "Six months ago, Victoria and I didn't know any of this. 
We think it's important people know they can help others. The outpouring of 
support and people volunteering their kidneys has been tremendous, and we're 
very thankful for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the couple acknowledged feeling jolted by Wednesday's mishap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was devastated," Ingram-Curlee said. "I was terribly disappointed. I was 
kind of in shock." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she mentioned only reluctantly to Coons, the radiologist, that she 
was feeling a twinge of pain, which forced him to repeat the arteriogram. He 
then noticed the nick in one of the arteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Robert Mendez, who directs the transplant team at Sharp Memorial, "told me 
a story about his family," Ingram-Curlee said Friday. During a vacation, his 
"nephew forgot his visa in the hotel room, which forced the entire family to 
take the next flight. The flight they were supposed to have taken? It crashed, 
killing everybody on board." 
</P>
<P>
 She paused, then added, "So I just didn't take that flight. And now I'm ready 
for the next flight. I know it will turn out well." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram-Curlee is to have another test on her kidney Oct. 26, after which "I 
hope we can schedule (the transplant) within a week," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Had the tear not been detected, the surgery would have gone ahead as planned 
and, doctors said, everything might have been fine. 
</P>
<P>
 But had he received a damaged kidney, "I might have rejected the kidney and 
formed antibodies toward all kidneys," Curlee said. "On down the road, it could 
have made it difficult for another transplant, had this one not worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Curlee could receive a kidney from a donor other than his wife, but doesn't 
want that -- mainly because she doesn't. Doctors say she remains an 
almost-perfect candidate as a donor. "I would be more concerned with how it 
would affect Victoria," he said, should another donor be used. "This is 
something she really feels strongly about. She wants to show others that this 
is possible, and that they should consider it."

TOT'S KILLER GETS LONG PRISON TERM; COURT: WAYNE YOSHISATO WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE 
FOR PAROLE FOR AT LEAST 30 YEARS. HE MURDERED HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND'S DAUGHTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A Huntington Beach laborer was sentenced to 53 years to life in prison Friday 
for sexually assaulting and beating to death his former girlfriend's 
14-month-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge William Froeberg handed down the sentence 
during an emotional hearing packed with relatives and friends of the girl and 
the man convicted of killing her, 31-year-old Wayne Yoshisato. 
</P>
<P>
 The toddler's uncle tearfully asked the judge for the maximum sentence for the 
death of Felicia Lynn Grunbaum. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother and our family will never be able to cherish those special 
occasions or moments that would have occurred during Felicia's life," said 
Richard Grunbaum, a captain with the Huntington Beach Fire Department. "Her 
first day in kindergarten, her first school play . . . her high school prom, 
her graduation, her wedding day." 
</P>
<P>
 The speech caused Felicia's mother, Pepper Purvis, to run from the courtroom 
sobbing. Felicia's father, 29-year-old Steven Grunbaum who is divorced from 
Purvis, said afterward that his daughter's death is a warning to all parents to 
be constantly vigilant. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had been, we wouldn't be here today, and I wouldn't have gone to my 
first funeral," Steven Grunbaum said. "I tell parents now to hold onto their 
children and to hold onto them forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said Yoshisato's actions showed a "high degree of cruelty, 
viciousness, and callousness." Froeberg said medical evidence showed that 
Felicia was beaten and sexually assaulted at least twice before she died on 
July 10, 1990, and that the assaults would have caused her "extreme pain, and 
to cry out." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the hearing, Yoshisato sat doubled over, with his head nearly 
touching the counsel table and turned away from a news camera. 
</P>
<P>
 His sentence was 10 years shy of the maximum.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Carolyn Kirkwood said she was pleased that Yoshisato will 
spend much of his adult life behind bars, especially because he has never 
expressed remorse for his crimes. He will be eligible for his first parole 
hearing when he is 61, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney William Kopeny maintained his client's innocence. He 
called the sentence "harsh" and said he plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshisato was convicted on July 28 of first-degree murder, four counts of 
sexual assault and felony child endangerment for beating Felicia to death 
during a rape with a foreign object. 
</P>
<P>
 The unemployed laborer who raised dogs had been living for a short time with 
Purvis after a "whirlwind relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Kirkwood told jurors that Yoshisato disliked the toddler's 
crying and became increasingly impatient and abusive during the few weeks she 
and her mother lived with him. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a probation department report, Yoshisato said he found a child's 
crying "very irritating," and admitted that he had occasionally spanked 
Felicia. But he accused Purvis of assaulting and killing the girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators, however, concluded that Yoshisato had attacked the girl 
when her mother left her alone with him. Yoshisato's roommates told police they 
heard him hitting the girl, asking her if she "wanted more" the night before 
she died, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 A witness told police he overheard Yoshisato say he hated the girl and was 
going to kill her. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a county probation report, Yoshisato had a reputation for being 
quick-tempered and physically abusive toward women and small animals, once 
throwing his pregnant wife out of a car, kicking a pregnant dog, and throwing 
small animals against a wall at a pet shop where he once worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshisato's case gained some publicity when it was used as a basis for a state 
Supreme Court decision in June, 1992, to allow for the death penalty for people 
convicted of killing while raping with a foreign object. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they did not pursue the death penalty in Yoshisato's case 
partly because Yoshisato had no prior record of convictions for violent crimes.

COUNTY UNVEILS PROPOSED RAISES FOR TOP OFFICIALS; WORK FORCE: PAY HIKES RANGE 
UP TO 4%. LEFT OUT UNTIL AFTER ELECTION ARE CLERK AND RECORDER.

<P>
 County government department heads -- including Sheriff Brad Gates and 
District Attorney Michael R. Capizzi -- would receive their first pay raises in 
three years under a plan the Board of Supervisors is scheduled to consider on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed salary increases, which range from 2.5% to 4%, are based on job 
performance reviews recently completed by the Board of Supervisors and county 
administrative officer Ernie Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 Absent from the list of county executives receiving pay hikes are Clerk Gary 
L. Granville and beleaguered Recorder Lee Branch, whom supervisors censured 
earlier this year after an investigation concluded that he sexually harassed 
two female employees and mismanaged his department. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters on Nov. 8 will elect either Granville or Branch to serve in the newly 
combined position of Recorder-Clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider insisted Friday that the decision to deny Branch and Granville pay 
raises was not related to job performance. Rather, the supervisors will 
consider granting a raise to whomever wins the election, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The raises reflect the county's improving fiscal picture, Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 But county government watchdog Shirley Grindle questioned whether the proposed 
raises for top county executives are warranted. "I think (their pay) should 
stay where it is," Grindle said. "My feeling is that they are overpaid to begin 
with." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the county's 27 top managers, 14, including Gates, Capizzi and 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert Citron, are slated to receive the highest raises 
available -- 4%. That total indicates they are doing an "outstanding job," 
Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another top official not granted a raise under the proposal is Murry L. Cable, 
manager of the Integrated Waste Management Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Cable will be considered for a raise only after he completes an internal 
review of his department that could lead to a reorganization, said Russ Patton, 
the county's human resources manager. The department operates the county's 
landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure (the department) is as cost-effective as possible," 
Patton said. "We want to make sure our (sanitation) rates for contract cities 
are as low as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said some supervisors have concerns about the way the department is 
being run. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are putting his salary increase on hold until an evaluation of the 
department is done," Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said. "What is needed is 
some more (industrial) expertise in the department." 
</P>
<P>
 Also set to receive 4% raises are Schneider, Patton, County Counsel Terry C. 
Andrus and Larry J. Holms, director of fire services. 
</P>
<P>
 If the recommendations are approved, Schneider's salary would rise from 
$135,512 to $140,940. Capizzi's salary would rise to $126,214 and Gates' would 
jump to $115,689. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the nine managers set to receive 2.5% raises are Ronald Y. Butler, head 
of the public defender's office, and Assessor Bradley L. Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Department heads were judged on their ability to increase efficiency in their 
departments, stay within their budgets, generate new revenue and practice 
innovative management techniques, Patton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors also considered the officials' interpersonal skills and 
whether they motivated employees. Schneider said he looked at whether managers 
"are team players or have their own agendas." 
</P>
<P>
 County rank-and-file employees received salary increases of 2.5% to 3.5% this 
year and have received pay hikes for two of the last three years, Schneider 
said. Proposed Raises 
</P>
<P>
 Most county department managers would receive raises of as much as 4% under a 
plan to be discussed by the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. A look at top 
county officials, their current salaries and their proposed salaries:

MAN CASTIGATES WIFE'S KILLERS; REWARD ANNOUNCED IN SLAYING OF 72-YEAR-OLD 
SURVIVOR OF HOLOCAUST

 Aliza Levi was a survivor. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, most of her family perished in concentration camps. But 
she managed to elude the Nazis, slipping out of her native Prague, 
Czechoslovakia, aboard a train with 200 other youngsters. She then hid in a 
French convent. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Van Nuys, in a fortress-like home with high, ivy-covered walls and 
iron-barred windows where she lived for 13 years, her survival skills were not 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The 72-year-old grandmother was stabbed to death Tuesday after two burglars 
entered her home in the 7900 block of Norwich Avenue. And Friday, her husband 
-- who was running errands when she was slain -- denounced her killers at an 
emotional news conference that announced a $25,000 reward for information on 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You animal murderer, watching now and listening to my voice," an angry Zvi 
Levi, 80, said into a score of TV cameras arrayed outside his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you a conscience? Have you God in your heart? Why . . . why you supposed 
to kill her? You could have taken anything from the house . . . and you take 
her life," said the Israeli immigrant, staring fiercely at the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 "You remember her face, her crying. And she calls my name . . . and I couldn't 
go to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Department Detective Dan O'Hanian said Aliza Levi "did a 
lot of screaming. She fought as hard as she could for a 72-year-old." But the 
burglars, whom police describe as two male Latinos, left a clue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing that is unique in this is that (one of the burglars) left a 
shoe behind," said O'Hanian. "He was obviously in a hurry to get out of there." 
</P>
<P>
 The shoe is so distinctive that police believe they are certain someone can 
identify it. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hanian described it as a black, deck-style shoe with small black laces, 
decorated with a white reptile-like design. It is about a size 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody has got to know something about the shoe or the foot that fits in 
it," said Detective Roberta Moore, who is also investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The description of the suspects is more sketchy. O'Hanian said a witness 
described the one who lost the shoe as about 5 feet, 4 inches or 5 feet, 5 
inches tall, 18 to 24 years old, about 140 or 150 pounds, with short, black 
wavy hair. He was wearing an acid-washed jean shirt and baggy pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the suspects may be linked to other burglaries in the area. 
About 50 have been reported over the past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Levi home had not been burglarized before, and police said they are unsure 
what, if anything, was taken during Tuesday's incident. There were no signs of 
forced entry at the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Levi was the second elderly woman in less than a week to be killed in her Van 
Nuys home. Berneda McMackin, 77, was found dead Sunday after being beaten and 
her body set afire in an apparent attempt to hide the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hanian said there is no evidence to connect the two slayings. About the only 
thing in common is the fear and outrage they have generated. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty tragic irony and a sad statement on society that a woman as 
strong as she was could survive the Holocaust but could not survive the 
sanctity of her own home in Van Nuys," said Los Angeles City Councilman Joel 
Wachs, who urged the council to offer the $25,000 reward. 
</P>
<P>
 Zvi Levi and his relatives seemed shell-shocked after attending Aliza's 
funeral earlier Friday. As he spoke to the cameras, tears welled in listeners' 
eyes and his two grandsons hugged each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife was a person who loved everybody," he said, his voice trembling in 
anger. "All the neighbors loved her. She used to pray day and night for them." 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this the real America?"

MAN GETS 2 YEARS ON 9TH DRUNK-DRIVER FINDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former Van Nuys man with nine drunk driving convictions was sentenced to two 
years in prison Friday after evading authorities for nearly seven years, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linwood Rose, 34, now of Simi Valley, received the prison term after he 
pleaded no contest this week in Municipal Court to charges stemming from a June 
18, 1987, traffic accident in Van Nuys, Deputy City Atty. Sharyn Siskel said. 
Rose was convicted Thursday of driving under the influence of alcohol with 
prior convictions and driving with a suspended license due to a prior 
drunk-driving conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, who failed field sobriety and blood-alcohol level tests following the 
1987 accident, never showed up for trial and a warrant for his arrest was 
issued in November of that year, Siskel said. At the time, Rose was living in 
Van Nuys and had already been convicted of drunk driving on five previous 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose subsequently moved to Simi Valley. In Ventura County he was convicted 
three more times of drunk driving in 1988, 1990 and earlier this year. But 
authorities there were apparently unaware of Rose's outstanding arrest warrant 
in Los Angeles, Siskel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the intent of the system for these people to move around and to be 
lost track of, but it is possible for people to slip through the cracks," said 
Karen Cullie, executive director of the Los Angeles County chapter of Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Police finally put the brakes on Rose on Sept. 10 when he was involved in his 
ninth alcohol-related crash, in Reseda, for which he was convicted and faces 
another sentencing Monday in Van Nuys Municipal Court. Los Angeles Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Susan Gruber said Rose has agreed to an additional three-year prison term 
in connection with the case, but it will be up to a judge to impose the final 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reseda accident occurred when Rose, driving a white Ford pickup truck west 
on Victory Boulevard, collided with a Cadillac traveling north on Wilbur 
Avenue, said Los Angeles Police Detective George Cardenas, who is assigned to 
the Valley traffic division. 
</P>
<P>
 After the accident Rose fled but was captured after "a couple of witnesses 
pursued him and later officers took him into custody," Cardenas said. Lila Mary 
Grimila, the driver of the Cadillac, was injured in the accident that sent her 
car crashing into a tree and fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Information on whether others have been injured in his previous accidents was 
unavailable. Rose's attorney could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Rose's convictions began more than a decade ago, the California 
Legislature has passed numerous tough laws aimed at stopping drunk driving. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, California adopted laws calling for instant license suspension and a 
lowering of legal blood-alcohol levels to 0.08%. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the state also raised the penalty for misdemeanor drunk driving 
offenses to a maximum $1,000 fine and one year in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Another new law requires twice-convicted drunk drivers to equip their cars 
with a breath-analysis device that prevents them from starting their engine if 
they have a blood-alcohol level higher than 0.02%. 
</P>
<P>
 But apparently none of the laws stopped Rose from becoming involved in the 
Sept. 10 accident in Reseda. Gruber said she did not know whether Rose had a 
breath-analysis device installed in his truck at the time of his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 A new assault on repeat offenders will begin Jan. 1, 1995, when a state law 
sponsored by state Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) takes effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Motivated by drunk drivers, the law requires unlicensed drivers to permanently 
forfeit their cars when caught driving on state roads. 
</P>
<P>
 To forfeit a car, the law stipulates that the unlicensed driver must be the 
owner of the car and must have a conviction within the past five years for 
driving on a suspended or revoked license, or driving with no license. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he sponsored the bill after watching drunk driving continue to be a 
problem despite the passage of increased fines and penalties over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of that seemed to be making a difference particularly for drunk 
drivers," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another new law, by state Sen. Quentin L. Kopp (I-San Francisco), will also 
take effect Jan. 1, allowing authorities to impound a car for 30 days of anyone 
caught driving without a license or with a suspended or revoked license.

ETHICS PANEL DROPS BAN ON LOBBYISTS; CONTRIBUTIONS: CITY COUNCIL OPPOSITION 
PROMPTS DELETION OF ITEM FROM REFORM PACKAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Facing opposition from members of the Los Angeles City Council, ethics 
officials dropped a proposal Friday that would have prohibited lobbyists who 
have a matter before a city agency from making contributions to elected city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban was part of a long-awaited reform package proposed by the city's 
Ethics Commission to regulate contributions to special officeholder accounts 
controlled by each elected city official. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to delete the ban came as the set of spending limits and 
disclosure rules moved a step closer to adoption Friday. The Council's Rules 
and Elections Committee voted to support some of the limits and scheduled later 
hearings to consider other elements of the package. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethics Commission Executive Director Benjamin Bycel said he decided to drop 
the ban after the panel's chairman, Councilman Richard Alatorre, told him "loud 
and clear in words that I could understand that it would not pass the 
committee." 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, Alatorre said he told Bycel that the ban on lobbyist 
contributions was not a key change in the reform package and would not win 
support of the entire council. He said he didn't want to jeopardize the entire 
reform package for the sake of keeping the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Bycel "didn't have the votes for it," Alatorre said. "Why put something out 
there that he didn't have the votes for?" 
</P>
<P>
 Alatorre added that council opposition to the ban stemmed from the belief some 
members had that lobbyists should not be "singled out and treated differently" 
from other contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 The amount of contributions from lobbyists vary from officeholder to 
officeholder but in most cases amounts to less than half of all donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Bycel said the ban was a key measure in the package, he said other 
changes will give ethics officials more power to regulate the spending of 
elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we had a 10-watt light bulb on the activity in the officeholder 
accounts," he said. "Now we have a 200-watt light bulb." 
</P>
<P>
 The officeholder accounts were created as part of a landmark ethics package 
adopted in 1990 after a conflict-of-interest scandal surrounding then-Mayor Tom 
Bradley. Under current rules, the city's elected officials can only use 
contributions from officeholder accounts for legitimate governmental or 
political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 But a call for reform grew, in part, out of complaints that former City 
Councilman Michael Woo used his officeholder account illegally in 1991 and 1992 
to get an early start on his campaign for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Hal Bernson was the latest elected official to run foul of the 
officeholder regulations when the Ethics Commission accused the San Fernando 
Valley lawmaker in April of failing to provide adequate documentation on 69 
expenditures totaling $30,905 from his account in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Bycel and other Ethics Commission officials said they could not act on either 
case because the law was too vague. 
</P>
<P>
 After the committee meeting, Bernson declined to comment, saying he had not 
seen the reform package. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed new laws, City Council members, the mayor, city controller 
and the city attorney would be able to collect and spend a maximum of $75,000 a 
year, an increase from the $25,000 limit. But contributions from individuals, 
which had been unlimited, would be capped at $1,000 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The laws would also put a halt to the practice by some council members of 
spending the funds to pay for memberships in athletic clubs and religious 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, the Rules and Elections Committee will begin considering several 
other new requirements to provide increased disclosure to show how an 
expenditure is related to legitimate governmental or political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Bernson was criticized for spending thousands of dollars on 
dozens of expensive meals, gifts and sports and entertainment tickets. Under 
the proposed disclosure laws, elected officials must explain who those meals 
were with, who received the gifts and why those tickets were essential to 
"assisting, or serving or communicating with constituents." The changes would 
also require more disclosure on travel expenses.

10 ARRESTED IN ANTI-GANG SWEEP AFTER SHOOTINGS; CRIME: MULTI-AGENCY STRIKE 
FORCE INVADES WEST COUNTY CITIES, NETTING OFFENDERS, WEAPONS AND, POSSIBLY, 
EVIDENCE IN ATTACKS. A FATHER OF FOUR WAS SLAIN IN ONE INCIDENT.

<P>
 In response to a series of gang-related shootings that left a Ventura man dead 
and three others wounded, a law-enforcement strike force arrested 10 people 
Friday during an early-morning sweep through west Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The pre-dawn raids also netted several weapons, including a handgun and two 
illegal knives, according to the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. Seventeen 
teams of five officers each hit 23 houses in Ventura, Santa Paula, Saticoy, 
Oxnard and Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 10 people arrested, three were juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's investigators hope that the arrests and evidence gathered during the 
gang sweep will produce new information about two shootings earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of those shootings, a 37-year-old father of four was gunned down Oct. 1 
in the east Ventura community of Cabrillo Village as he was walking home from 
an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. Ventura police say Jose G. Gutierrez was the 
innocent victim of gang warfare. 
</P>
<P>
 And a week ago, a shootout between rival gang members in a Saticoy 
neighborhood sent three people to area hospitals with gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's crackdown represented the first major operation for the sheriff's 
newly formed gang suppression unit, said Sgt. Ken Warren, who heads the 
2-month-old enforcement team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided that we had seen enough, that we had better get on it right away," 
Warren said. "I know there is some good evidence there. Hopefully, there will 
be some link to these incidents." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since Gutierrez was killed, Ventura police have established a storefront 
station in Cabrillo Village. And Lucio and Josefina Gutierrez have struggled to 
cope with their loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Gutierrez died after a small-caliber bullet pierced his heart. His wife 
died of cancer a few years ago, and now their four children -- ages 5 to 18 -- 
have been orphaned. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't have any enemies, he was a very peaceful person," a grieving 
Josefina Gutierrez said Friday. "He was innocent in all of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said gang members fired on Cabrillo Village with a handgun and two 
shotguns, and that Gutierrez happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong 
time. Gang members from outside the area often spray the community with 
gunfire, police and residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez said she was pleased to know that law-enforcement officers were 
searching Friday for her son's killers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be very hard to find them," she said. "But they have to do 
something. They can't let this happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:30 a.m. Friday, the countywide multi-agency gang suppression strike force 
went to work. Armed with arrest warrants and probation search teams, officers 
raided homes of suspected gang members and their associates. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those arrested were picked up on warrants. While Sheriff's Department 
officials would not say why the warrants were issued, they did say that most 
involved outstanding traffic matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the adults arrested were: Michael Centeno, 18, of Ventura for possession 
of a concealed weapon; Gilbert Garcia, 23, of Ventura for warrants; Phillip 
Cabral, 29, of Ventura for warrants; Ramon Arrellano, 21, of Saticoy for 
violating probation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others arrested were David Sibrian, 35, of Ventura for warrants; Albert Gaona, 
30, of Saticoy for warrants; and Alfred Mendez, 20, of Port Hueneme for 
warrants. Sheriff's deputies also arrested two 16-year-olds and a 17-year-old 
for violating probation. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 law-enforcement personnel -- including members of the federal 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Ventura County district attorney's 
office and police agencies throughout the county -- participated in the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar sweeps have been conducted throughout Ventura County since 1992, as 
part of a regional push by area police agencies to confront the growing 
strength of street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the cities visited Friday, the raids also have been conducted 
in Thousand Oaks and Fillmore. And as in Friday's operation, the sweeps often 
are in response to shootings, stabbings and other violent gang-related acts. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise in gang crime prompted the Sheriff's Department to create its 
anti-gang unit two months ago, Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sheriff's jurisdiction alone in recent years, drive-by shootings by 
youth gangs have tripled and gang weapon assaults have doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the community to know that we are tired of these gang members doing 
these things," said Warren, who has been traveling to Southern California 
cities to learn how their gang units work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, my Lord, we are sitting out here in the Garden of Eden compared to 
them," Warren said. "But we need to make the effort now. I don't want that 
coming here."

RUSSIANS IN HUENEME TO STUDY SPILLS; PETROLEUM: OFFICIALS MEET WITH A NONPROFIT 
COMPANY FORMED AFTER THE EXXON VALDEZ DISASTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As an environmentalist in Russia's most important oil region, scientist 
Vladimir P. Melnikov is trying, slowly, to reverse a long history of ecological 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His first challenge is educating fellow environmentalists. His second is 
persuading oil industry executives that change can occur, even in the face of a 
crippled economy. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Melnikov and nine other officials from western Siberia visited the 
Port of Hueneme as part of a crash course on the latest technology for cleaning 
up major disasters at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanied by two interpreters, the delegation met with members of the Marine 
Spill Response Corp. -- a nonprofit company formed in the wake of the Exxon 
Valdez disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Aboard the center's $13-million California Responder ship, they inspected 
skimmer heads used for vacuuming oil from the ocean and rubber booms used to 
contain a floating slick. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 90,000-square-foot warehouse, they peeked at rigid-hulled, inflatable 
boats used to place the booms and transport people and supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 To the delegation, the quality of such equipment was impressive. But equally 
stunning was the fact that the corporation is a $1-billion joint venture 
between giant oil companies. 
</P>
<P>
 During a question-and-answer session before the tour, the Russian ecologists 
-- many of whom head departments within regional governments -- asked about 
American regulations for reporting spills. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must understand, the law in the U.S. is that if you create the sheen of 
oil on the water, you must report it," said Lindon A. Onstad, regional manager 
for the center. 
</P>
<P>
 Onstad also told the delegation that approximately 1,000 spills are reported 
in the U.S. each year. However, only about 5% of those are big enough to 
require a full-scale cleanup effort. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, he said, the nationwide Marine Spill Response Center tackled six 
spills, all of which were larger than 1,200 barrels or too big for local 
agencies to handle. 
</P>
<P>
 Melnikov, who heads the Tyumen Scientific Center, said ruptured pipelines and 
leaking reservoirs are responsible for the majority of the disasters that have 
scarred the Western Siberian landscape. In some areas, vast stretches of land 
are covered by lakes of oil and oil-byproduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of the pipelines and drilling equipment are old and have 
deteriorated over time, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many years . . . any attention at all to the environment was completely 
subordinate to the oil industry," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Awareness of the environment is growing, he said, but it is overwhelmed by the 
need for greater oil production to support the struggling economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of all of this," Melnikov said, "our environment is not changing at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to make up for lost time, we need vast financial resources," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation was scheduled to leave Ventura County today for Alaska, where 
it will tour oil fields on the North Slope, visit an offshore rig and meet with 
private environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian delegation's trip is being funded through the U.S. Agency for 
International Development as part of a $2.5-billion economic aid program to the 
countries of the new Russian Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the same program, a team of Americans visited western Siberia 
earlier this year. Their mission was similar to this week's visit: to bring 
western environmental technology to the Russian region.

SURPLUS NAVY LAND MAY OFFER HARBOR, CITY OPPORTUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Port Hueneme city leaders and harbor officials hope to acquire surplus Navy 
property to expand economic opportunities at the regional port, officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city and Oxnard Harbor District Commission will consider plans in the 
coming week to acquire jointly a 31-acre, oceanfront parcel that once housed 
the Naval Civil Engineering Lab (NCEL), shut down last year in the base closure 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would be a win-win situation for both the city and the harbor district," 
said Port Hueneme Mayor OrveneCarpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tentative plans call for using an eight-acre strip contiguous to the port to 
enhance traffic in and out of the south harbor, according to Ray Fosse, 
president of the Oxnard Harbor Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The beachfront section would be open to the public, and the remaining 20 acres 
would be leased to a potential industrial customer connected with the port, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Working jointly, the two government bodies will try to persuade the Navy to 
donate the land, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope it won't cost anything," Carpenter said. "The government could just 
transfer the land to the city. We think the possibility is good." 
</P>
<P>
 But officials cautioned that the plan is still in its early stages, and there 
is competition for the site. Neither group has formally agreed to work with the 
other, or indeed, even to the acquisition. The plan is to be discussed at 
separate meetings next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming both parties approve the plan, a presentation outlining the proposal 
must be made to a committee appointed to consider new uses for the lab. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of the Navy will make the final decision on who gets the 
former lab. Several others have expressed an interest in acquiring the space, 
including nonprofit homeless groups, Oxnard Union High School District, and the 
state university. 
</P>
<P>
 Port Hueneme city Councilman Dorill Wright said vying for the land with 
homeless groups could produce an emotionally charged and complicated situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are politically touchy issues, no question about it," Wright said. "But 
at the same time, there are other military properties that may lend themselves 
better to their purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they believe they can persuade the Navy their plan provides the 
best all-around economic impact to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done a feasibility study," said Carpenter. "And it says that the 
highest and best use for that property is harbor related." 
</P>

 The study was recently completed by Williams/Kueblebeck and Associates, he

 Fosse pointed out that the Navy transferred a parcel in Oakland to the Oakland 
Port Authority a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that it is possible," Fosse said. "We know there is precedent for it. 
But we don't know if it will happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said it is too early to say how much money the acquisition would 
actually bring into the region. The proposal is still a long way from 
realization, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably not going to develop overnight," Carpenter said. "And this 
is not going to be something that bails the city out of needing money."

NEW JOBS SEEN WITH RENOVATION OF VENTURA HARBOR; FISHERIES: REFURBISHED 
FACILITY HAS ALREADY ATTRACTED 17 FISHING BOATS FROM LOUISIANA AND FLORIDA AND 
CREATED 150 POSITIONS, ITS MANAGER SAYS.

<P>
 The renovated Ventura Harbor should bring $4 million a year into the Ventura 
County economy and create about 200 jobs, local and state officials said Friday 
during an oceanside appearance at the port. 
</P>
<P>
 The renovations, which began a year ago, include 300-foot extensions of the 
detached breakwater and the north jetty that make it safer for commercial 
fishing boats to enter and leave the harbor, said Richard Parsons, general 
manager of the Ventura Port District. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Parsons said the initial beneficiaries of the project would be 
commercial fishing boats, "all the benefits of that industry will spin off." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of their supplies -- such as fuel, food, baits and ice -- will be 
purchased locally," Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
 It costs $35,000 to get a commercial fishing boat ready to go on a three-week 
trip, Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
 During an appearance at the harbor Friday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein called the 
renovations "state of the art" and predicted improvements in the quality of 
life in Ventura County.  
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein and Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), who was also at the 
ceremony, played key roles in allocating federal funds to pay for most of the 
$7.7 million in renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This project is really a major uplift for the entire port, in particularly 
for commercial fishing boats," Feinstein said from the deck of a 110-foot 
research boat. "I am proud to be here and to see something that is actually 
finished. . . . Sometimes we start things and we don't see them get finished." 
</P>
<P>
 The newly renovated harbor has already attracted 17 additional commercial 
fishing boats from Florida and Louisiana and created 150 jobs, Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor officials predicted that within a year the harbor, which can 
accommodate 200 commercial boats, will be at capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was designed to save millions of dollars in dredging costs and 
reduce the impact of waves at its the harbor entrance, which had been 
considered one of the most dangerous in Southern California.  
</P>
<P>
 Construction, which ended in August, also included a 650-foot rock seawall on 
the beach south of the harbor and extension and deepening of the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The renovations already have saved nearly $2.5 million in dredging costs, 
Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week we canceled a dredge for this winter, and we expect to dredge it 
every two years instead of every year," Parsons said.  
</P>
<P>
 The harbor has had to be dredged yearly since 1963, when it was built, Parsons 
said. It has cost up to $2.5 million annually to move about 1.62 million cubic 
yards of sand trapped in the entrance channel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein, who had spent Thursday night in Ventura and was to go to Orange 
County Friday, praised harbor officials and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers -- 
which made the renovations -- for finishing the project a month early and for 
spending some $300,000 less than had been budgeted.

 Orange County's new Urban Search and Rescue squad should be ready for action 
by the end of the year, officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 168-member squad, which county officials have been assembling for the past 
two years, is designed to respond swiftly to natural disasters such as 
earthquakes and hurricanes. 
</P>
<P>
 The group consists of firefighters, doctors and nurses, as well as structural 
engineers and building experts who can be dispatched quickly to trouble spots 
within the county and around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The team is one of eight in the state and 25 in the nation, said Patrick 
Walker, an Orange County Fire Department marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials created the team in a partnership with the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency, which donated $100,000 to the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 About $500,000 worth of equipment has been purchased for the team, which is 
scheduled to train at March Air Force Base in the fall. The squad should be 
fully operational by the first of the year, Walker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the squad helped during the Northridge earthquake. Members of the 
team also were readied for action when a hurricane was headed for Hawaii in 
July. Ultimately, the team was not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The team can respond to a variety of disasters. During a major quake, the team 
would use search dogs and sound equipment to search for people under the rumble 
of collapsed buildings, Walker said. SHELBY GRAD

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SIMPLIFIED ANTENNA RULES CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wowed by new, unobtrusive satellite-dish antennas, Thousand Oaks council 
members on Tuesday will consider simplifying city rules so that residents can 
skip a cumbersome permit process and install back yard antennas with minimum 
fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will weigh several options: eliminating the permit entirely, 
streamlining it to a simple one-step application or sticking with the existing 
rules, which require notifying every property owner within 300 feet and posting 
a sign on the proposed satellite-dish site. 
</P>
<P>
 The original city code was drafted to deal with antennas six to 12 feet in 
diameter. Because technology has slimmed the antennas down to 18 inches, 
council members are no longer as concerned about the satellite dishes blocking 
scenic vistas. 
</P>
<P>
 "These seem minuscule, really," Councilwoman Elois Zeanah said. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Thousand Oaks residents have always had to buy cable service to 
get clear television reception, Councilman Frank Schillo said he views the 
mini-antennas as a way to break the effective monopoly held by local cable 
franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a lot of frustration in our community that we're stuck with the 
one method of (broadcast) delivery," Schillo said. "This gives many people 
another option -- not to have cable." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members will consider the issue at its 5 p.m. session Tuesday. They 
cannot formally change city codes until after a public hearing at a later 
meeting, but they will discuss their preferred approach. STEPHANIE SIMON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Traffic delays may occur when work on Encino's drainage system begins in 
December, but the improvements should be worth the inconvenience, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When completed, this project should substantially ease chronic flooding in 
the surrounding area," Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers plan to install about 7,000 feet of storm drain pipe beneath Haskell 
Avenue, Ventura Boulevard and Hartsook Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.53-million contract will be carried out by workers of Malden Buntich 
Construction of Sunland and administered by the county's Department of Public 
Works. 
</P>
<P>
 While the work may close some lanes to through traffic, local access will 
remain open at all times, Edelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The projected is expected to be completed in June. ERIC SLATER

</P>
<P>
 "We're really very thrilled about this," said Gerald Kleinman, Birmingham 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants were awarded based on a high school's commitment to teaching higher 
math and science, teamwork among teachers, and dedication to continuously 
reforming school curriculum, Kleinman said.

 Bumper to bumper, the traffic inched forward. But these drivers said they 
loved the gridlock. And they also said they got a kick out of being behind the 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've waited a long time to have my own car," said Katie Branstine, 5, as she 
walked her make-believe auto, painted black and white to look like a Dalmatian 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far away, Kelsey Wood, 5, with a big smile on her face, gleefully steered 
her cardboard motorcycle. "I like it 'cuz it goes fast!" she exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene Friday morning was the Transportation Parade at Serrano Elementary 
School for kindergarten and first-grade students. First-graders, dressed as 
firefighters and police, were grand marshals. Kindergarten students walked 
around inside homemade planes, trains and automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The colorful parade included a Batmobile, Santa's sleigh, several school buses 
and a mail truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the culmination of our transportation study," teacher Diana Larsen 
said. "We're showing the children how important transportation is. And we've 
also been teaching them safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Christy Covington, another teacher whose students took part in the parade, 
said parents helped make the fanciful vehicles. "This is a wonderful way for 
the students to learn safety rules, including school bus safety," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents stood on the sidelines and applauded as the children marched 
around the school grounds. Occasionally, some of the kiddie vehicles bumped 
together, producing giggles from the tiny drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Batmobile driver Thomas Neal, 5, from time to time bumped into the airplane 
piloted by Steven Peterson, also 5. No one crashed, however, and both drivers 
seemed in high spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did Thomas pick a Batmobile? "'Cuz I like it!" he exclaimed. And what did 
Steven think was significant about his airplane? "It's red, white and blue like 
the American flag," he beamed.BILL BILLITER

 Wearing yellow vests with red letters urging, "Help Retarded Children," a 
group of senior citizens began handing out candy Friday in an effort to raise 
money for mentally disabled youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The members of St. Angela Merici Knights of Columbus passed out Tootsie Rolls 
to shoppers all day in front of the Vons supermarket on Brea Boulevard and the 
Thrifty drug store and Albertson's supermarket on Associated Road.The seventh 
annual Tootsie Rolls for Retarded Children campaign will continue until Sunday 
evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The candy was free but shoppers were encouraged to make donations to the 
charity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have a free Tootsie roll," said Jack Eso, handing the candy to Taylor Witt, 
5, and his brother Andrew, 3, as they walked into Vons. As they were leaving, 
each child donated $1. 
</P>
<P>
 Another shopper, who gave only his first name, Randall, contributed $20. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all the years I've been doing this, I've never gotten a $20 bill. It's 
always dollars and cents," a surprised Eso said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights of Columbus is a worldwide Catholic family service organization 
that works to help the needy. Many Orange County chapters are participating in 
the Tootsie Roll campaign, said Francis LeBlanc of the Brea organization. 
</P>
<P>
 LeBlanc said his chapter expects to raise about $1,000. Proceeds go to the 
Columbian Foundation for Mentally Retarded Children Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "Years ago, people with mental disabilities were made outcasts, and we just 
want to help them because they are human beings and we should love them just 
like we love people who have no disabilities," the 71-year-old LeBlanc said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of people out there who need help in so many different ways," 
said Tony Amato of Brea, "and this is our way." MIMI KO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; PRODUCER BUSY CARVING OUT PUMPKIN FEST

<P>
 Inside the tiny offices that house Pumpkin Central, it's beginning to feel 
like a political campaign headquarters during the final, harried, headlong rush 
toward Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 As the third annual Calabasas Days Pumpkin Festival draws near, the phones 
seldom stop ringing. 
</P>
<P>
 In one office, Ray Upton, the event's producer, is talking on the phone, 
earphones on his head and a laptop computer on the table in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is scheduled for Oct. 22 and 23 at Paramount Ranch, but there are 
still permits to be obtained, celebrities to be booked and hundreds of other 
details that need attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call ourselves traffic control," said Upton, taking off his earphones. 
"Part of organized traffic control is to keep it calm, keep it level, keep it 
going in a nice way." 
</P>
<P>
 Not an easy task. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't sleep at night now," said Jeff Blum, president of the Calabasas 
Chamber of Commerce, which is helping organize the event.

<P>
 "It's at that point now where it's like when they launch the space shuttle, 
checking and double-checking every aspect of the operation, to make sure it 
goes off without a hitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Upton's company, Wipeout Productions, is paid to organize the event, but most 
of the work is done by volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are at least 35 volunteer coordinators, handling everything from 
publicity to food and beverages, to ticket sales, to a person in charge of 
getting our pumpkins," said Margery Gould, volunteer head of publicity for the 
festival.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is even a volunteer coordinator who helps other volunteer coordinators 
find staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year there were at least 500 volunteers involved in the event, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another volunteer, Tony Roberts, owner of an after-school children's camp, 
looks for ways to keep smaller children entertained during the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Upton, meanwhile, works on ways to keep the volunteers entertained and 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we have a meeting here (at Pumpkin Central), everybody has to wear a 
straw hat, or they cannot be in the meeting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just something to have some fun with." FRANK MANNING

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CONEJO VALLEY; SCHOOL BOARD'S 1ST STUDENT VOTE CAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a historic first vote, it was entirely routine -- Westlake High School 
senior Scott Nussbaum voted along with the Conejo Valley school board to 
approve the minutes of the last meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the board's first student representative, Scott is looking forward to 
delving into more complex issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a start," he said after his first meeting Thursday. "I don't know how 
involved students should be in district decisions -- right now, this is 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of sitting with his fellow students in the audience, the 17-year-old 
sat alongside four trustees and cast the first student advisory vote ever 
"ayed" in the Conejo Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott is one of four students who share a Board of Education seat this school 
year. They will cast non-binding advisory votes on all public matters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first acceptance of a student's opinion by the school district," 
Scott said. "If the students have an opinion, it won't be brushed under the 
carpet." 
</P>
<P>
 Having a new member on the dais will take some getting used to for board 
President Dolores Didio, who must remember to seek the student vote before 
trustees take a ballot on an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be new for all of us," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Previously, student representatives from each of the district's four high 
schools presented brief reports on campus events at the beginning of each board 
meeting. They did not cast votes or participate in board discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 But under state law, student representatives must be allowed to cast advisory 
votes if at least 500 students sign a petition supporting the idea. In June, a 
Thousand Oaks High School student presented the board with a petition carrying 
the necessary number of signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 For this school year, Brandon Michael of Conejo Valley High School, Katie 
Petrick of Newbury Park High School, Lorrie Houchin of Thousand Oaks High 
School and Scott will take turns sitting and voting with the board members.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY SCHOOL GROUP ENDORSES NEWCOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County school employees overlooked two incumbent school board members 
and endorsed, instead, two newcomers intent on defeating conservative Christian 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for the seat representing Ventura and Oxnard, the Ventura County 
Federation of School Employees gave the nod to Jeffrey Moss, a college teacher, 
instead of incumbent Juanita Sanchez-Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
 The 200-member union did not consider Angela Miller, a conservative Christian, 
who declined the union's request for an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Simi Valley district, the group chose attorney Daniel Gonzales over 
incumbent Al Rosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Walt Madrid belongs to the conservative Christian group Citizens for 
Truth in Education. Madrid failed to show up for an interview with the 
federation. 
</P>
<P>
 The federation opted against endorsing any candidate in the race for the 
Thousand Oaks district board seat when union representatives split in their 
support for candidate Marty Bates and incumbent Doylenne Johnson, union 
president Larry Keegan said. 
</P>
<P>
 But support was unanimous for both Moss and Gonzales. The board oversees the 
13 county-run schools and helps set policy for teacher training throughout the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sanchez-Valdez is a former school administrator in the Oxnard School 
District, union members were impressed by Moss' background in education, Keegan 
said. Moss is a part-time English teacher at Cal State Northridge who is 
working toward a Ph.D. in education at UC Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales won support, Keegan said, because of his background in business and 
economics and his record of community volunteer work in Simi Valley. Incumbent 
Rosen is a former teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in their campaigns, both Moss and Gonzales said they were motivated to 
run partly out of concern that conservative Christians could gain control of 
the county school board. MAIA DAVIS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; MAN SENTENCED IN '87 TRAFFIC ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Simi Valley man with nine drunk driving convictions was sentenced to two 
years in prison Friday after evading authorities for nearly seven years, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linwood Rose, 34, formerly of Van Nuys, received the prison term after he 
pleaded no contest this week in Van Nuys Municipal Court to charges stemming 
from a June 18, 1987, traffic accident in that city, Deputy City Atty.Sharyn 
Siskel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose was convicted Thursday of driving under the influence of alcohol with 
prior convictions and driving with a suspended license due to a prior 
drunk-driving conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose, who failed field sobriety and blood-alcohol level tests following the 
1987 accident, never showed up for trial, and a warrant for his arrest was 
issued in November of that year, Siskel said. At the time, Rose was living in 
Van Nuys and had already been convicted of drunk driving on five previous 
occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose subsequently moved to Simi Valley. In Ventura County he was convicted 
three more times of drunk driving in 1988, 1990 and earlier this year. But 
authorities were apparently unaware of Rose's outstanding arrest warrant in Los 
Angeles, Siskel said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the intent of the system for these people to move around and to be 
lost track of, but it is possible for people to slip through the cracks," said 
Karen Cullie, executive director of the Los Angeles County chapter of Mothers 
Against Drunk Driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Police finally put the brakes on Rose on Sept. 10 when he was involved in his 
ninth alcohol-related crash, in Reseda, for which he was convicted and faces 
another sentencing Monday. JULIE TAMAKI

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; BIGGER BANQUET ROOM AT CENTER ENDORSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have endorsed a plan to double the size of the banquet room in 
the proposed community center, despite uncertainty about how to pay for the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting as the Redevelopment Agency, the City Council voted unanimously this 
week to spend $6,300 for new architectural designs that would increase the 
banquet room's seating capacity to 400. 
</P>
<P>
 The community center is part of a $7-million project that includes the 
construction of a park on 3.8 acres to be bought from the Westminster 
Elementary School District. The project also would involve improvements to the 
15th Street apartments across from City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope to finance the project with a $5.3-million loan from the 
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, money from the Redevelopment 
Agency and a city reserve fund for Civic Center improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 But the $420,000 expansion of the banquet room would take space allocated for 
the park, which officials say is crucial in obtaining the HUD loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The loan would be an advance of community development block grants that the 
city expects to receive from HUD over the next five years. The city hopes to 
repay the loan over 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Block grants are intended to improve neighborhoods and to provide jobs and 
affordable housing to low- and moderate-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD turned down the city's $5.3-million request because the community center 
was not eligible for block grant money. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Hjelm, the city's housing and grants coordinator, said that an 
amended application was submitted to HUD this week requesting $2.9 million to 
pay for the land, build the park and renovate the 15th Street apartments. BERT

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; 2 TOO-TALL SIGNS ORDERED REMOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest battle in the local war over freeway pole signs, the Calabasas 
Planning Commission has ordered two business people to remove their signs 
within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 The Calabasas Mobil and Red Robin restaurant signs, facing the Ventura Freeway 
from their posts on Calabasas Road, violate a city ordinance prohibiting signs 
higher than 60 feet, the commission ruled Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city officials, the signs, installed about 22 years ago, have 
been non-complying since 1977, when the county adopted an ordinance setting a 
42-foot height limit. Calabasas adopted the county's ordinance when it 
incorporated in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mobil sign is 100 feet, and the Red Robin sign is 75 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 John Barkhordar, owner of the Mobil station, said Friday that he's not sure if 
he will comply and that he has a lawyer looking into the matter. Officials from 
Red Robin could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkhordar said he plans to place a flag on his sign at a height of 42 feet, 
to see if a sign at that height would be visible from the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he would not take down the sign "until we check everything out," 
adding that if a 42-foot sign is "really visible, we will go with it. But if 
it's not visible, then we will not go with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Because his business and the Red Robin are next door to each other, he said, 
he also wants to make sure that if he did install a lower sign it would not be 
obscured by a new Red Robin sign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to fight with the city," he added. "I live in Calabasas and I 
work in Calabasas." 
</P>
<P>
 The businesses can appeal the decision to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, Calabasas and Agoura Hills have begun taking steps to force 
business owners to comply with pole sign ordinances.  
</P>
<P>
 The issue has created hard feelings between opponents of freeway signs, who 
say they spoil the scenery, and many business people, who say they will lose 
customers if the signs come down. 
</P>
<P>
 In Agoura Hills, where pole-mounted signs were banned in 1985, 10 business 
owners filed lawsuits against the city in May in an effort to keep their 
freeway signs, which were to have been removed by March, 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 One recent case was settled amicably. In May, Agoura Hills announced an 
agreement with Shell Oil Co., under which Shell would take down a 70-foot pole 
sign in exchange for permits to build a carwash and a mini-mart. FRANK MANNING

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; COUNCIL WILL DEBATE PROP. 187 MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than a month before voters statewide cast their ballots on Proposition 
187, the Ventura City Council will debate the measure aimed at denying most 
government services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one council member wants the city to stay out of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an item that we should even be considering," Councilman Jim Monahan 
said Friday. He said he plans to make a motion to that effect at Monday night's 
council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the federal government, not the city of Ventura, should take 
responsibility for controlling the borders. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Richard D. Thomas said it was rare for the city to take a 
position on a ballot initiative, but he said passage of the initiative may 
affect the local government. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters believe the measure would save millions spent on health care and 
education for illegal immigrants. But opponents argue it will end up costing 
schools, which would have to check the immigration status of their students. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors, the county Board of Education and the 
Oxnard City Council have voted to register their opposition to the measure. The 
Ventura city staff has not recommended a position on the measure. But at Monday 
night's meeting, Councilman Gary Tuttle is expected to make a recommendation. 
Tuttle, who was away this week, put the matter on the council's agenda. IRA E.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; UNION ENDORSES 2 INCUMBENTS, HORNE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ojai teachers union announced Thursday that it is backing trustees Muriel 
Lavender and Vince France along with candidate Rikki Horne in the race for 
three school board seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Representing 165 teachers and counselors in the Ojai Unified School District, 
the Ojai Federation of Teachers made its endorsements after hearing the six 
candidates in the race speak at a recent forum, union President Don Ainsworth 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavender and France won endorsements, Ainsworth said, because of their policy 
of involving teachers in district decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Four challengers are vying for the seats held by Lavender, France and Robert 
Emhardt, who is not seeking reelection. Of the four, the union endorsed Horne, 
Ainsworth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Horne, who owns a medical claims management business, is "very highly 
educated," Ainsworth said. Also, he said, union officials were impressed by 
Horne's distaste for censorship in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The district was rocked by controversy last year when some parents said a 
literature anthology used in the schools contained passages that were 
inappropriate for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Horne, Ainsworth said, "felt that all citizens ought to be involved in the 
adoption process of a textbook and we shouldn't be barring students from 
reading a textbook." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the union sometimes refrains from making endorsements in school board 
races, Ainsworth said it decided to take a stand in this election. 
</P>
<P>
 "This race seems to be more closely contested than it has in the past, so we 
felt we needed to listen to all the candidates and make a choice," he said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; SENIOR CENTER WINS ONE-YEAR EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council gave a show of support this week for the Rancho San Joaquin 
Senior Center, which once was considered for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted to keep the senior center open through June 30 -- the 
end of the fiscal year -- and attempted to quell rumors that it would either be 
closed or its programs would be sharply curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a segment in the senior population who are scared to death that is 
what is going to happen," Councilwoman Paula Werner said. "I think by listening 
to the consensus of the council, we put those fears to rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Some seniors feared that programs were going to be eliminated at the 
15-year-old center to make rental space available to increase city revenues. 
But council members also voted Tuesday night that senior programs there should 
be given first priority. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Lakeview Senior Center opened in Woodbridge Village last spring, 
officials at the city's Community Service Department considered closing the 
older senior center. But a recent survey determined there is a continuing 
demand for programs offered at Rancho. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to make sure that Lakeview wasn't just going to take everybody 
away, that Rancho wasn't going to just sit there empty," Mayor Mike Ward said. 
"They were considering closing it, but after they looked at it they saw that it 
was needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the city's 121,000 residents, 11,848 are 55 to 84 years old, according to 
the 1990 Census. About half of them -- 5,697 -- are 65 to 84. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine senior Frank Hurd said he was pleased with the council's support, but 
wary that only a one-year extension was granted. Hurd told council members he 
would like to see a longer commitment, "so it won't be subjected to annual 
potshots by those who would consider another use for it." RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; BEACH EROSION USHERS CITY INTO TIMES OF SAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beachfront residents are looking nervously out to sea as the winter storm 
season approaches, while city officials continue to search for sand to dump on 
badly eroded beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The mile-long section of beach between the Seal Beach pier and the Naval 
Weapons Base is losing seven inches of sand each year because of erosion, 
bringing high tides closer to beachfront homes in the Surfside community.A 
storm in April pushed seawater onto the boardwalk and into nearby garages. 
</P>
<P>
 The last major flooding in Seal Beach occurred in 1983 when winter storms 
destroyed the pier and swamped Surfside homes. The city has since barricaded 
beaches by scooping sand into a 12-foot-high berm during the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been testing sand from the Whittier Narrows and Santa Ana River 
excavation projects. But the cost of filtering and trucking sand from Whittier 
Narrows is too high, City Manager Jerry L. Bankston said. A recent discovery of 
sand at the Santa Ana River project looks more promising. 
</P>
<P>
 "The initial price looks good and the sand grain size is within 
specifications," Bankston said. "It's the most favorable option for us right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 Before sand can be dumped on city beaches, it must meet standards of purity 
and grain size established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has budgeted $400,000 to pay for the cost of adding 70,000 to 100,000 
cubic yards of sand to city beaches. One double-trailer truckload of sand 
amounts to only 15 cubic yards. If the cost of the Santa Ana River sand proves 
favorable, city officials still would need a month to obtain state and federal 
permits and City Council approval before beaches could be replenished. RUSS

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; SALE OF LAVISH PLAYHOUSES AIDS HOMELESS

<P>
 Adults squealed with childlike delight Friday morning as they got their first 
glimpses of six miniature homes at Fashion Island installed to attract buyers 
for an auction to benefit HomeAid, a nonprofit group that builds transitional 
shelters for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting prices on the Project Playhouse homes will be equal to a small down 
payment on the real thing.Last year, playhouses fetched between $2,500 and 
$18,000 each, HomeAid spokeswoman Yumi Sera said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, Project Playhouse, is in its third year. HomeAid began the annual 
event to remind visitors that for an estimated 12,000 people in Orange County 
-- half of them children -- any home is just a fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 The houses, built by some of the Southland's best known home builders, are 
laden with clever details. Electrical fixtures, chandeliers, working plumbing 
and shingle roofs are standard equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the work and materials, from design and construction to interior 
decoration, are donated. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who can't afford to bid can buy $1 chances to win the Hard Rock Cafe 
jukebox house. It will be given away before the auction begins at 5 p.m. Nov. 
12. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, nine playhouses will be on the block. Builders working on Mickey's 
Toon Town House, a reverie-inspiring castle and a storybook gingerbread house 
were unable to deliver by Friday's setup time, but the homes will be added 
within two weeks, co-organizer Lee Rogaliner said. 
</P>
<P>
 HomeAid builds and renovates shelters to house homeless families while they 
get off the street and regain self-sufficiency. HomeAid has raised $4.5 million 
in in-kind donations for 19 county shelters over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about the auction, call HomeAid at (714) 555-9510. HOLLY

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; REJUVENATION SOUGHT FOR NEIGHBORHOODS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Adams Square, Tropico, High Line Road and a dozen other neighborhoods are all 
part of the puzzle that equals southern Glendale. But have they lost their 
identity as the city has grown and their unique houses and shops were razed to 
make way for apartment buildings? 
</P>
<P>
 A group of 48 people, consisting of many residents and merchants who live and 
work in all areas of the city south of Glenoaks Boulevard, plus a few city 
officials, is working to help the area counteract the effects of rapid 
population growth and development during the second half of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Neighborhood Task Force, as it is called, was formed this year after a 
city study showed that 40,000 people had come into Glendale in the past decade 
-- most moving into the city's southern half -- creating "a new city within the 
city," said Madalyn Blake, community development director. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the data we collected shows is that there has been a tremendous impact 
as a result of the increase in population and density," Blake said. 
</P>
<P>
 Increases in crime, deterioration of schools, overcrowded housing, traffic 
problems, scarcity of parks and unsightly development are among the problems 
facing neighborhoods once considered quaint, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the task force has concentrated on identifying the unique traits of 
different neighborhoods. The next step, Blake said, is a sort of empowerment 
program.  
</P>
<P>
 Many residents of southern Glendale are renters and apartment dwellers who 
feel less connected to city affairs and issues than the better-organized 
homeowners' associations in the city's northern part, Blake said.  
</P>
<P>
 The task force will meet Monday with representatives of organized neighborhood 
associations from Long Beach, San Diego and Portland, who will discuss ways to 
give residents more of a say in issues affecting their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an educational process," Blake said. "The outcome hopefully will be a 
set of tools that people will have to begin dealing with problems, be it a 
zoning issue or a traffic problem," she said. STEVE RYFLE

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: HOME TOUR TO RESUME AFTER 1-YEAR HIATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTONIO OLIVO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a year's hiatus, the San Fernando Valley chapter of the American 
Institute of Architects on Sunday will resume its 30-year tradition of 
showcasing architecturally significant houses in the Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, a tour of houses in a gated community at Vista Point was canceled 
at the last minute when a group of homeowners protested extended public access 
to their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the tour will feature houses throughout the Valley -- from Granada 
Hills to Encino to Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The residences consist of a lakeside cabin-style pool house, two transformed 
early 1960s tract houses, and a house designed by renowned Los Angeles 
architect Bernard Zimmerman in 1960 to which several additions have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 AIA Home Tour Chairman Craig P. Earl said the significance of this year's tour 
lies in both the commitment to form and architectural innovation displayed in 
the structures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The additions to the Zimmerman home were made to meet the homeowners' needs 
for more room, but they were done in a way that carries through the original 
design theme," Earl said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of adding their signature to the structure, the architects simply 
continued Zimmerman's philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meanwhile," Earl said, "the tract houses were placed on tour to give people 
an idea of how to give tract homes their own distinctive personality. They are 
both modern, functional homes, but fully unique in their design." 
</P>
<P>
 The tour is scheduled from noon to 5 p.m. Tickets are $12 for adults and $10 
for students. For ticket information, call (818) 781-7108. Proceeds will 
benefit scholarships for architectural students at local colleges. ANTONIO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: CLEVELAND HIGH TRIES PARTNERSHIP PLAN

<P>
 While the Parent Teacher Student Assn. at Cleveland High School in Reseda has 
managed for several years to raise money by selling refreshments at high school 
football games, some of its members have decided they have to get beyond 
hotdogs and sodas. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they're trying to go corporate. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowing from his experience as a computer system engineer for the Department 
of Water and Power and teaming up with Cleveland's new principal, Eileen Banta, 
PTSA President Jai Rao has started a campaign to set up corporate partnerships 
with the high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools have tried to do the same, often with successful results. Mark 
Keppel Elementary School in Glendale has set up for itself a foundation to 
receive grants. Brian Ellis, the chairman of Make Keppel Special, recently 
managed to gather $40,000 to build a playground for the school. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter Rao drafted and sent out to local corporations asks for $1,100 to be 
donated to the school for the purchase of an IBM-compatible computer. Cleveland 
has two new occupational teachers who are trained in teaching computer classes. 
But with only two PCs and a handful of outdated Apple IIs, the school could use 
some newer computers, Rao said. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, Rao wrote: "The (high school) will provide, as pay-back to the 
corporate partners, a number of its graduates with good English language and 
math abilities, proficient in the use of the PC . . ." MAKI BECKER

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PIRU; WOMAN IN CAR HIT, KILLED BY FLYING ROCK 
</P>

<P>
 In a freak accident that left even emergency crews shaken, a father driving to 
Las Vegas for a family reunion watched in horror as a football-sized rock 
smashed through his windshield Friday morning near Piru and fatally injured his 
daughter, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Ann Johnson, 32, who was to celebrate her birthday Monday, died after 
being struck in the head by the small boulder that apparently had been kicked 
up by another vehicle about 10:07 a.m. east of Fillmore, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara woman, the mother of 1-year-old and 3-year-old boys, was 
pronounced dead two hours later at Ventura County Medical Center, Deputy 
Coroner Craig Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hospital were her father, 60-year-old Ronald Fraas of Santa Barbara, 
and her husband, Mark Johnson, who had planned to take his children to Las 
Vegas later Friday to meet his wife, Stevens said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was as bad as it gets," said county Fire Capt. Mike Lindbery, who rode in 
the ambulance with the victim and her father. 
</P>
<P>
 The rock -- about 6 inches by 7 inches by 4 inches -- was found beside an 
orange tree, about 15 feet from the stretch of two-lane California 126 that 
cuts through orchards by Hopper Canyon Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraas, who was driving a rented car, had seen what he thought was a pine cone 
bounding on the road when it suddenly crashed through his windshield, struck 
his daughter and broke through the back window, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of rubber marks on the rock, Sgt. Mike Cooper of the California 
Highway Patrol speculated that it had been wedged between the tires of a truck 
or bus and had suddenly worked free. But neither Fraas nor any other witness 
could recall where the rock had come from, Cooper said. GREG RIPPEE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; NONPROFIT AGENCY TO REFURBISH HOUSING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an expanding effort to rehabilitate earthquake-ravaged buildings into 
low-income housing, two more red-tagged apartment buildings in Van Nuys will be 
repaired and restored by a nonprofit group specializing in affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, dubbed Delano Court, will convert two adjacent nine-unit 
buildings at 14716 and 14722 Delano St. into an 18-unit complex for formerly 
homeless and low-income families and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Expected to be completed by February, Delano Court is the second 
earthquake-damaged rehabilitation project funded by L. A. Family Housing Corp. 
The first was Alabama Court in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, five more damaged apartment buildings in the San Fernando Valley 
are being considered for purchase and rehabilitation, L. A. Family Housing 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think with the amount of buildings that were damaged in the earthquake and 
the number of people that were displaced by it, there is a need for more such 
rehabilitation projects," said Allison Lee, the agency's director of 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 L. A. Family Housing will spend about $740,000 to purchase the buildings in 
Van Nuys and repair damage from the Jan. 17 temblor, said Vera Fleischman, the 
agency's housing director.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to sealing countless cracks and shoring up structural damage, the 
agency must add new kitchens, plumbing, a security system and other features. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were in horrible condition," said Fleischman, who said about $630,000 
will come from the Los Angeles Housing Department. The agency will take out a 
loan for the remaining funds. 
</P>

MAN SUES FEMALE BOSSES FOR ABUSE; WORKPLACE: ANTHONY ERVIN SMITH'S LAWSUIT 
ALLEGES HE WAS THE VICTIM OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND RACIAL DISCRIMINATION. 'IT 
WAS VERY EMASCULATING,' HE SAYS. 
</P>

<P>
 An African American man has accused his two former female employers of sexual 
harassment and racial discrimination, alleging the pair repeatedly abused him 
with epithets, a lawsuit filed in Orange County Superior Court contends. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Ervin Smith of Costa Mesa is suing Exclusive Investigations Inc. of 
Santa Ana and its owner, Sherry Howard, and manager, Marilyn Farley, for 
creating what the suit described as a hostile work environment that forced 
Smith to leave his $10-an-hour position as an investigator with the firm, said 
court documents filed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said Friday that she had not seen the lawsuit and referred questions to 
her attorney, Robert H. Swensen. Swensen and Farley could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 31, contends in his lawsuit that his employers ridiculed him with names 
such as "Long Dong Silver," a character in pornographic movies who was 
mentioned in the Supreme Court nomination hearings for Clarence Thomas in the 
U.S. Senate -- and with disparaging remarks such as, "The best man for the job 
is a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who worked at the firm from May, 1991, to August, 1992, is seeking 
compensation for lost wages and damages for emotional distress, the lawsuit 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very emasculating," Smith, who was attending law school at the time, 
said Friday. "The only thing that kept me there was I had too many bills to 
even count. They knew that and they knew they had me. . . . I basically had to 
sit and take it." 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Fair Employment and Housing, which filed the lawsuit 
on Smith's behalf, is pursuing the case because it found Smith's complaint had 
"merit," said Victor E. Salazar, the department's attorney. Salazar said sexual 
harassment complaints filed by men against women are not unusual. 
</P>
<P>
 "While perhaps the public perception is that it's only male on female, our 
experience is that it happens the other way also," he said, declining to 
comment on specifics of Smith's case. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith also contended that written jokes of a sexual nature were distributed in 
the office and that Howard showed semi-nude photos of herself to male 
employees, court documents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who has since been hired by an Orange County business management firm, 
contended the intolerable work atmosphere caused him pain and suffering and a 
loss of self-esteem, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the stress of the workplace caused him to lose 20 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was obviously devastated," he said, adding that he was reduced to part-time 
hours at the firm before finally quitting.

COUPLE SEEKS CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST INSURER IN QUAKE CASE; LAW: THEY SAY 
FARMERS DENIED THEM CHANCE FOR COVERAGE. COMPANY CALLS CLAIM 'ABSOLUTELY 
UNTRUE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Canoga Park couple who have sued Farmers Insurance Group, claiming the 
company illegally failed to offer earthquake coverage as part of its homeowner 
policies, are seeking to broaden their case into a class action lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In papers filed in Van Nuys Superior Court, attorneys for Helene and Alan 
Apper, whose house was damaged in the Northridge earthquake, claim that 
thousands of Farmers' homeowner policyholders may have been similarly denied 
the opportunity to obtain earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Los Angeles-based Farmers, the state's third-largest 
homeowners insurance carrier with about 1.3 million policies, called the 
allegations "absolutely untrue" and said the company's share of earthquake 
policies actually has been increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Farmers did agree in February to pay a $100,000 fine to settle 
charges by state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi that the company had 
failed to make proper earthquake coverage offers in 150 of 200 customer files 
examined after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We offer earthquake coverage to every one of our homeowner customers in 
California," said Jeffrey Beyer, a Farmers vice president. "There may have been 
some procedural issues in 1988-89. But that was five years ago," Beyer said, 
insisting the problems have been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1984 state law, insurance companies in California offering residential 
policies must also offer would-be customers earthquake coverage at the same 
time. If a customer declines that coverage, insurers then must again offer the 
earthquake coverage every two years, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Appers originally sued Farmers in June for misrepresentation and breach of 
contract. On Thursday, their attorney filed an amended complaint seeking to 
broaden the case into a class action lawsuit, in which other Farmers customers 
could join. A judge still must rule on that request. 
</P>
<P>
 The Appers claim they asked their Farmers agent, Greg Kusnierek of Thousand 
Oaks, for an earthquake quote in December, 1991, but never received one. Their 
lawsuit claims Kusnierek or someone else several months later forged Helene 
Apper's signature on a form rejecting earthquake coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple accepted a homeowners policy from Kusnierek in March, 1992, that 
contained no earthquake coverage. But they say they didn't learn of the alleged 
forgery until dealing with Farmers after their house suffered between $50,000 
and $100,000 damage in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's suit claims Farmers originally refused to pay for their 
earthquake repairs because they lacked an earthquake policy. But in May, amid 
the couple's forgery claim, the company agreed to cover them with a $100,000 
policy with a 10% deductible, both sides said in interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Paul, the Santa Monica attorney representing the couple, said the 
decision suggests Farmers realized the company had engaged in wrongdoing. But 
Beyer, the Farmers official, said the company found "no evidence" of forgery 
and simply gave the Appers "the benefit of the doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul did not provide evidence in his court filing to back up the claim that 
thousands of Farmers customers are being denied earthquake coverage. In an 
interview, he said he based it on Kusnierek's claim in a memo that he followed 
company policy in handling the Appers' case.

ELECTIONS / THOUSAND OAKS COUNCIL; ZEANAH AND LAZAR DEFEND THEIR RECORDS AMID 
SHARP CRITICISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Attacking incumbents with gusto, challengers and voters alike tossed sharp 
barbs at the two Thousand Oaks councilwomen running for reelection, during a 
televised campaign forum that took several nasty twists. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwomen Judy Lazar and Elois Zeanah took the most hits -- including 
pointed jabs from one another -- during the Thursday night debate in the Civic 
Arts Plaza. The cross-fire drew cheers and jeers from the audience of nearly 
200 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Michael Friedman threw the first punch during his opening statement, 
by deliberately shunning the most popular issues of the council campaign. "I 
could talk about open space, crime or ridge lines . . . but the real issue, the 
thing all of us are talking about behind the scenes, is Elois Zeanah," Friedman 
asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 As audience members shouted "You jerk" and "Who is this guy?" Friedman blasted 
Zeanah for "trying to circumvent and dominate politics in this city" and for 
creating a "political machine." Insisting that he was fed up with "negativity," 
Friedman said: "If there are candidates who work on trying to create innuendo 
and fear, don't check their boxes" on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman, 27, who owns a financial services firm, is making his first run for 
public office. He joins 13 other challengers and the two incumbents vying for 
three council seats in the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise volley against Zeanah set the tone for the two-hour forum, as 
residents used the question-and-answer period to attack both incumbents, 
despite the moderator's plea that they stick to issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Jane Rieder, for example, asked one challenger: "Do you have any idea 
how we can help Judy Lazar find new employment?" Another audience member 
questioned Lazar herself about "what intelligence it took to overturn every 
rule in this city" and allow millionaire businessman Charles Probst to 
landscape and develop estate grounds designated as open space. 
</P>
<P>
 Under assault, both Lazar and Zeanah staunchly defended their records, and 
promised to build on their first-term accomplishments if reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have done what I said I would do -- stand up and fight for residents' 
rights," Zeanah said. "I am not afraid to challenge government as usual."  
</P>
<P>
 In her one-minute closing statement, Zeanah condemned Lazar for crafting 
compromises. "The most important job of a council member is to do what the 
citizens want, not to play 'Let's Make a Deal' every Tuesday night," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Lazar stuck by her campaign theme: that she gets more done by building 
consensus than by sowing dissent. "Thousand Oaks is a can-do city, and you 
don't get to the point of doing things by voting 'no' consistently," she said, 
in a rebuke of Zeanah. 
</P>
<P>
 While the two incumbents faced the most intense criticism, other candidates 
also fielded questions about their records as policy-makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineer Lee Laxdal, a former councilman, and firefighter Andy Fox, a former 
planning commissioner, were asked about their votes on the controversial Dos 
Vientos project in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Laxdal, who has touted himself as "the father of growth control" in Thousand 
Oaks, defended his vote in favor of the 2,350-home development. Other council 
members had been ready to approve even more homes, Laxdal said, but he 
persuaded them to shrink the project's size. Rather than cast a futile "no" 
vote, Laxdal said, he chose to negotiate for the smallest possible development 
and then support the compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Fox said he was not on the Planning Commission when the Dos 
Vientos project was debated. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he did not vote on the entire 2,350-home project, Fox did participate 
in a 1992 hearing on a particular subdivision within Dos Vientos Ranch. He was 
the lone planning commissioner to support the 220-home tract. Later approved by 
the council, the project is now the subject of a lawsuit as the Sierra Club 
tries to block construction. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Fox said he did not intend to mislead voters about his role in the 
Dos Vientos hearings. Before he could adequately explain his vote on the 
subdivision, Fox said he would have to review his notes. "I think my feelings 
at the time were that we were held up by the development agreement" which 
guaranteed 2,350 homes on the Dos Vientos Ranch, Fox added. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the hot topic of Dos Vientos, the candidates addressed a few other 
substantive issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate salesman Chuck Morsa promised to rid the city of pornographic 
magazines if elected. Mobile car wash owner Lance Winslow vowed to work for a 
second public golf course. And retired businessman Marshall Dixon said he would 
push for more ball fields in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates present were Greg Cole, a dentist; David Hare, city 
operations manager; Mike Markey, a police detective; Ekbal Quidwai, 
self-employed salesman; Jeannette Scovill, public access television producer; 
Irving Wasserman, a member of the Planning Commission; and Bill Williams, a 
mortgage banker. M. Ali Issari, a retired film professor, did not attend.

ELECTIONS / SIMI VALLEY COUNCIL; MUD-FREE CANDIDATES FORUM FOCUSES ON CRIME 
FIGHTING AND PROSPERITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The tone was civil and the discussion firmly focused on safety and prosperity 
as seven candidates for Simi Valley City Council faced off in the first forum 
of the election season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sticking to earlier pledges to keep their campaigns mud-free, the candidates 
concentrated on the issues Thursday night, vowing to recruit new businesses 
aggressively and ensure that the city remains the safest of its size in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is our biggest problem? Nothing stands still," Mayor Greg Stratton said 
in his opening statement. "Just like your garden, you can get it perfect but 
the next day the weeds come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Stratton, who is running unopposed for reelection, sat in on the forum, 
offering historical context for some of the questions and describing Simi 
Valley as a well-run city in need of constant care. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with the format of the hourlong forum, sponsored by the American 
Assn. of University Women, participants did not question one another or respond 
to comments by other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, each made a four-minute introduction speech and took turns fielding a 
dozen written questions submitted by the audience on growth, schools and crime. 
All of the candidates participated, including incumbent Sandi Webb and six 
challengers vying for two council seats in the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing a recent surge in car thefts in Simi Valley, several candidates offered 
suggestions to improve the city's Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Police Chief Lindsey Paul Miller, who is now running for the council, 
said he would propose a volunteer-driven crime-prevention program and called 
for the creation of a fund-raising board to supplement the department's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Citizens afraid to venture forth on our streets may not patronize our 
businesses," Miller said, explaining the need for increased protection against 
crime. "Graffiti lowers property values." 
</P>
<P>
 Another candidate, Planning Commissioner Dean Kunicki, said police cruisers 
should be equipped with computers. A third, Ernest Federer, pledged that if 
elected, he would work to have funds from the Proposition 172 sales tax 
funneled directly into the city's public-safety programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to get that money back into Simi Valley," Federer said. "We need to 
make sure people we elect do what they say they will do." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked their positions on new construction in Simi Valley, all of the 
candidates said they support the city's growth-control ordinance. The law, 
approved by voters in 1989 and up for reconsideration next year, sets an annual 
cap on new home permits and prohibits most construction in the hills 
surrounding the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, the economy has probably had more impact on growth than any 
ordinance we've ever passed," Webb said. "I don't see (growth control) being as 
much of a problem as the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates fielded several questions from parents eager for an elementary 
school to be constructed in the Wood Ranch housing tract. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stratton told the audience that the school cannot be built until the 
district finds a buyer for a large parcel of the estate that it is trying to 
sell. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to raise enough money to build a school, "all we need is a buyer for 
the land," Stratton said. "We have all the tools. We just need a buyer." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael S. McCaffrey, a former Chamber of Commerce president, said that if 
elected, he would work with the school board to find a buyer for the property. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever the council can do to facilitate that process, we will do," 
McCaffrey said. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's City Council forum, which was filmed by Comcast Cablevision, will 
be broadcast on Channel 19 in Simi Valley Oct. 19 at 6 p.m.

COUNTY MAY SET UP MOBILE TEAM TO RESPOND TO MENTAL HEALTH CRISES; THOUSAND 
OAKS: IF APPROVED, IT WOULD BE BASED AT THE EAST VALLEY SHERIFF'S STATION AND 
WOULD FREE DEPUTIES FOR STREET PATROL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An out-of-control man was wandering through Thousand Oaks, smashing windows 
and kicking in doors. The police got the call. They responded immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But as soon as he arrived at the scene, Chief Deputy Bob Brooks recognized 
that the vandal needed psychiatric counseling, not jail time. Like many violent 
outbursts, this one stemmed from "a mental health problem, rather than a 
criminal problem," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the county's mental health team stationed a half-hour away in Ventura, 
however, the police had to step in. Six sheriff's deputies, a fire engine 
company and an ambulance crew spent hours trying to subdue the troubled man and 
get him into custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, such massive deployments may not be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's mental health department plans to set up a mobile crisis team in 
Thousand Oaks to handle flare-ups ranging from domestic violence to suicide 
threats to child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a countywide budget crunch, mental health director Randy Feltman 
believes he has found enough money -- about $500,000 a year -- to run the 
mobile crisis team. The county's special mental-health account, which is fed by 
the sales tax, will pick up about $300,000 a year, Feltman said. Medi-Cal and 
private insurance companies will cover the remaining costs, as reimbursement 
for patient services. 
</P>
<P>
 The county once had a mobile crisis team in the east end of the county, but 
disbanded it in the 1980s because of funding cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is becoming such a high priority that even if we had to cut back on 
something (in our budget), we would cut back on something else," Feltman said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, a crisis requires a timely response," he added. "If we're in 
Ventura while a crisis is in Westlake . . . by the time we get there, the 
situation may have gotten worse. This has been a serious problem." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To create a swift, mobile response team for the east county, Feltman plans to 
hire eight more staffers, buy a new van and renovate a room in the East Valley 
Sheriff's Station for on-site counseling. The center would be open 12 hours a 
day, seven days a week, and would serve Thousand Oaks, Moorpark and Simi 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council, which owns the East Valley Sheriff's Station 
and must approve all renovations, will vote on the proposal Tuesday night. The 
Board of Supervisors will consider the funding issue within the next month. 
</P>
<P>
 In pitching the proposal, Feltman emphasizes two goals: better service for 
patients, and relief for sheriff's deputies who now spend significant chunks of 
time dealing with mental-health crises. 
</P>
<P>
 While he could not estimate the number of hours deputies spend counseling, 
Chief Brooks called the incidents "routine enough to be significant." 
</P>
<P>
 A mother might call 911, for example, to announce that she will kill her 
toddler if he throws another tantrum. A man might tie up the switchboard with 
complaints about a neighbor's barking dog. Or a citizen might report a 
dazed-looking stranger stumbling through the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The police now handle most such calls. But if approved, the mental health 
crisis team could take over the burden and "leave police on the streets, where 
we need all the patrol time we can get," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The patients would benefit as well, because they would be treated by trained 
psychiatrists or psychologists, said Irene King, a member of the nonprofit 
Alliance for the Mentally Ill in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly helps to have a team come in and talk to them in very soft 
voices and reassure them," King added. "If left to the police department, it 
could become a more volatile situation. Sometimes when people are in these 
episodes, they are frightened of the police, or they have resentment toward the 
uniform." 
</P>
<P>
 Such arguments have persuaded Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski to support the 
program. Calling the lack of local county-run counseling "a real gap in our 
social services," Zukowski said she would welcome a quick-response team in the 
East Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see a need," she said, "and if we can meet it in this way, well, let's go 
for it."

MAN FACES MORE CHARGES OF MOLESTATION

<P>
 A San Juan Capistrano man already facing charges that he molested 10 girls in 
South County has been charged with additional counts of molestation. 
</P>
<P>
 At his preliminary hearing Friday in Laguna Niguel Municipal Court for the 
South County charges, Thomas Michael Cimino, 30, was charged with two more 
counts involving one of the girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges also were filed in Los Angeles last week involving a Culver City girl. 
</P>
<P>
 Cimino, who is free on $100,000 bail, will surrender to authorities next week 
on the Los Angeles charges, his attorney said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The preliminary hearing here will resume Oct 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County sheriff's deputies arrested Cimino June 20 after they showed 
pictures of him to 10 girls age 6 to 10 in Dana Point, San Clemente and San 
Juan Capistrano, Sheriff's Investigator Mark Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities allege that Cimino lured girls from their homes and in parks by 
asking if they could help him find his black-and-white cat.

JUDGE ORDERS PSYCHIATRIC TESTING IN CHILD-TORTURE CASE; COURTS: CYNTHIA MEDINA 
PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO HARMING NEPHEW. 'SHE IS NOT EMOTIONALLY AND MENTALLY WELL' 
AND IS UNABLE TO ASSIST IN HER OWN DEFENSE, HER LAWYER SAYS.

<P>
 A judge ordered an Orange woman, charged with torturing and abusing her 
10-year-old nephew, to undergo psychiatric testing after her lawyer contended 
Friday that she is incapable of standing trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The action came after Cynthia Medina pleaded not guilty to the charges against 
her in the county's first child-torture case. Criminal proceedings against the 
31-year-old woman in Municipal Court in Santa Ana will be halted until the 
questions of her mental capability are resolved in Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is not emotionally and mentally well," said Medina's lawyer, Richard C. 
Gilbert. "She can not assist us with the case. . . . Now we will have the 
guidance of the court on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert said he consulted a therapist who agreed that Medina is incapable of 
standing trial. He did not elaborate on reasons leading to the conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina faces a hearing in Superior Court on Monday, at which time a judge will 
likely appoint two psychiatrists to evaluate her mental competency, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Charles Middleton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the results of the psychiatric testing, Medina could face a court 
hearing, possibly involving a jury, to determine her mental competency, 
Middleton said.  
</P>
<P>
 If she is found competent either through the evaluations or a hearing, she 
would go back to Municipal Court for further criminal prosecution. A finding of 
incompetence would mean she would be sent to a state mental hospital until she 
is able to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina is charged with three counts of felony child abuse and one count of 
torture in a case that has caused a furor in Orange County and raised awareness 
of the role and legal responsibilities of teachers, social workers, police, 
doctors and others who are required by law to report suspected abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say Medina abused her nephew over the last year by burning his 
tongue with heated knives and whipping him with electrical cords. On Sept. 7, 
authorities allege, she punished him for playing with her marijuana cigarettes 
by searing his tongue again and anally penetrating him with a miniature 
souvenir baseball bat, causing internal injuries so severe he required a 
colostomy. Her lawyer has said that Medina admits abusing the boy, but says the 
allegations about hot knives are untrue and that the anal penetration was a 
"freak accident." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The former elementary school playground supervisor could receive a life 
sentence if convicted of torture. She is also charged with abusing her own 
9-year-old son and remains in custody in lieu of $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Municipal Judge Charles Margines denied a defense motion to dismiss 
all charges against Medina. Gilbert said he believes the California statute on 
torture is vague and unconstitutional, and said he will now take the issue to 
the state Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney contended that under the torture statute, just about anyone could 
be charged with the crime, and that his client has been singled out unfairly. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution has countered that the statute, which prohibits inflicting 
unusual or extreme suffering resulting in great bodily injury, matches the 
facts in the case exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina's husband, Edward, has been charged with three counts of felony child 
abuse for allegedly failing to stop the abuse of his nephew and his own son. 
Edward Medina, who has been released from custody on his own recognizance, also 
appeared in court Friday. He was ordered to return Nov. 18 for a hearing to 
determine if there is enough evidence to send his case for trial in Superior 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the 10-year-old boy was living with his maternal aunt and 
uncle because his mother could no longer care for him. The boy's father and 
maternal grandmother say they intend to seek custody. The boy and his cousin 
were removed from the home by the county Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's father, who is not being identified to protect the child's 
anonymity, said he agreed with the court's decision to keep the torture charge 
against the Medinas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it was torture," he said. "I don't think they should get away with 
it. If they get away with it, others will get away with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Choking back tears, the father said he had recently visited his son, who still 
requires a colostomy bag because of his injuries. He didn't know when it might 
be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he planned to attend every court hearing to make sure the Medinas are 
adequately punished, but he added that it is difficult to control himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm holding back," he said. "It was my son they tortured."

NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS SPARED RENT INCREASE BY IRVINE COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three nonprofit organizations being forced to move from one city building to 
another were temporarily spared a rent increase by the City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
 While the City Council indicated it will keep lease rates permanently low for 
Irvine Temporary Housing, the council also agreed a policy is needed to 
determine when exceptions on fees and rents charged to community organizations 
are warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen nonprofit organizations housed in the city's Multiservice Center will 
move to the city's Operations Support Facility by early next year. The city 
plans to sell the Multiservice Center to cut $65,000 in annual operating losses 
and avoid the $500,000 cost of earthquake retrofitting and air conditioner 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 13 organizations moving to new city facilities, the council voted to 
continue current lease rates for Irvine Temporary Housing, the Irvine 
Children's Fund, and Human Options. The new lease rate of 30 cents per square 
foot will be deferred until June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members say most of the rent increases are marginal, except for Irvine 
Temporary Housing which currently pays only 6 cents a square foot.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Paula Werner said it would be "petty" of the city to extract a 
higher rent from the privately run organization, considering that it provides 
$2 million in services each year to Irvine residents. Irvine Temporary Housing 
offers food, counseling and housing for homeless families. Werner and council 
members also agreed to develop more concrete guidelines on waiving fees and 
rent increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been doing it based on who asks us and what we know about the 
organizations," Werner said. "We really do need a broader policy."

MAN KILLED IN AUTO CRASH

<P>
 A 52-year-old man was killed Friday on the Foothill toll road when his car 
crashed into an abutment, becoming the first fatality on an Orange County 
tollway, the California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred when Joseph Herman of Santa Ana swerved across the 
northbound lanes into the center median, where his station wagon hit a bridge 
pillar near Alton Parkway, CHP Officer Bruce Leon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't even tell there was a front end to this car," Leon said. "The 
impact was that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The motorist was pronounced dead at the scene about 8:30 a.m., Leon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic investigators were not sure what caused the accident, Leon said. There 
were no signs of mechanical problems or obstructions on the roadway, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no witnesses," Leon said. "It's so quiet out there, you can actually 
do something and not be seen." 
</P>
<P>
 The $37-million Foothill toll road stretches for more than three miles, from 
Portola Parkway to Lake Forest Drive in Irvine. It is the only public toll road 
in California. Since its opening Oct. 16, 1993, more than 2 million motorists 
have driven the four-lane road, said Lisa Telles of the Transportation Corridor 
Agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 I February, 4.3 miles of roadway will be added to the south end of the toll 
road, said Terry Geohegan, director of operations for the Transportation 
Corridor Agencies. Future plans for the roadway include an extension to San 
Clemente, Geohegan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unrelated accident, Huntington Beach police were trying to identify a 
woman who was struck and killed by a van on Beach Boulevard Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The van's driver, identified as Guy Churchouse, 48, of Huntington Beach, told 
police he was traveling north on Beach Boulevard about 35 m.p.h. when his 
windshield exploded, officers said. The driver said he stopped his van and 
found a woman in her 50s lying in the traffic lane, police said in a prepared 
statement.

WOMAN, 50, FOUND DEAD IN CONDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 50-year-old woman was found bludgeoned to death Friday in her condominium, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police identified the woman as Marie Evans Powell, who had just moved to the 
townhome in the 22000 block of Caminito Tecate.She was found in her bathrobe 
just before noon by family members who were called by the woman's concerned 
employer, according to Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said Powell, who was found on the lower level of her home, had 
been beaten on the upper portion of her body with a blunt instrument. There was 
no sign of forced entry, and no neighbors reported hearing unusual noises, he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Martini said the neighborhood where the killing occurred is "a quiet area. We 
don't get many calls from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies canvassed the area, looking for witnesses.

ETHNIC RESTAURANT OWNER CLAIMS RACISM BY LANDLORD; DISPUTE: SUIT ALLEGES SLURS 
AGAINST CUSTOMERS AND DESTRUCTION OF FLAG OUTSIDE ETHIOPIAN EATERY. LANDLORD 
DENIES ACCUSATIONS AND ATTRIBUTES TROUBLE TO TENANT NOT PAYING HIS RENT.

<P>
 An Ethiopian restaurant owner alleges in a lawsuit filed this week that his 
landlord made racist comments to his customers and destroyed an Ethiopian flag. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the past two weeks, I have been burning inside.I am just searching for 
justice," said Michael B. Belay, owner of Ras Dashen Ethiopian Restaurant on 
Harbor Boulevard at Lampson Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 The landlord, Silvio Fiorentin, denied the accusations. Belay "can't pay his 
rent and is having problems,' Fiorentin said, adding that he had reduced the 
rent at Belay's request but that Belay still was not paying on time. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed in Orange County Superior Court alleges that Fiorentin 
complained to Belay in racist language that the business attracted African 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Belay, whose restaurant opened in March, said the problems began when he 
started having evening reggae concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fiorentin, who has an office in the shopping center, said he was not aware 
that Belay had music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go home at 5 p.m. every day. I'm never around at night," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His landlord also ridiculed the way he served food, in the traditional 
Ethiopian style, without silverware, Belay said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told the customers I didn't have any spoons. And he told me that this is 
America. You have to have spoons. I work hard for a living. That is over the 
limit for me the way he talks." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges that Fiorentin removed the Ethiopian flag hanging in front 
of the shopping center and later destroyed it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the landlord contended Friday that he routinely removes the flags every 
six months to replace them with new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping center displays American, Costa Rican and Mexican flags and 
includes a sushi bar, Thai-Chinese restaurant, soul-food restaurant, beauty 
salon and mattress shop.

OXNARD STUDENTS GET AN UP-CLOSE LOOK AT OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD EXHIBIT; SCIENCE: 
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASS PEERS THROUGH MICROSCOPE AT MOON ROCKS AND SOIL ON LOAN 
FROM THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For 11-year-old Michael Gonzales, looking at moon rocks and soil through a 
microscope may be the closest he will ever get to the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But he is closer than the thousands of children who will never see the 
hard-to-obtain samples of extraterrestrial rocks and soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'll ever forget it," said Michael, a sixth-grader at Elm 
Street School in Oxnard, as he gazed at the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools throughout the country wait as long as a year to be able to borrow the 
moon rocks and soil for a two-week period from the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration, said Garth Hull, chief of NASA's Educational Program 
Office for 11 Western states. 
</P>
<P>
 Hull said his office at Moffett Field in Mountain View, Calif., has 20 sets of 
lunar rocks and soil it loans to schools in the 11 Western states. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a rare opportunity for children . . . to see moon rocks and soil," Hull 
said. "For every child who looks at moon rocks under a microscope, there are 
millions who will never have that chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Toops, Michael's teacher, said the lunar items have stirred excitement 
among her students. 
</P>
<P>
 "This experience has expanded their knowledge and widened their expectations 
of themselves and the world around them," Toops said. "We feel privileged that 
we have been able to have the moon rocks." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NASA requires that teachers who get the rocks become certified by taking a 
NASA seminar on matters involving the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a popular program, and before we send anything out, we want to make sure 
that the teacher has knowledge and appreciation for the moon," Hull said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toops, who took the seminar four years ago in Texas, said she is the only 
NASA-certified teacher in the Oxnard Elementary School District. She also said 
this is the first time the district has been able to borrow the 
extraterrestrial components. 
</P>
<P>
 After Toops received the rocks, her class of 18 students served as host to 
other students who wanted to learn about moon rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent three-hour class, students watched a video on manned trips to 
the moon and then asked questions. 
</P>
<P>
 They learned that the moon is roughly 240,000 miles from the Earth and that 
some scientists believe it was created more than 4 billion years ago when a 
huge space rock hit Earth and parts of it became the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the seminar, students lined up by the microscope to observe the three 
moon rocks and three samples of moon soil stored inside a clear plastic disc. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe these rocks are really from the moon," 11-year-old Anthony 
Torres said. "It has orange soil. I always thought the moon was gray." 
</P>
<P>
 Toops said she also took the disc to several other schools to allow students 
elsewhere in the district to expand their horizons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they see the moon rocks and soil, they want to know everything," Toops 
said. "They want to know how many times men have gone to the moon, and why 
there was never a woman on the missions."

COUPLE NEAR END OF LONG LITTER WALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 An Anaheim couple who have walked across the country picking up trash for 12 
months are down to their last few white garbage bags. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Glen and Susan Hanket, both 38, have walked more than 4,000 miles across the 
nation's highways, from New England to the Northwest. They have picked up about 
3 1/2 tons of society's leftovers in all their forms: from foam cups to old 
bras, tennis shoes to cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Today they will make the last leg of their cross-country trek, going from 
Astoria, Ore., to Fort Stevens State Park on the northwest tip of the state.  
</P>
<P>
 "It feels pretty neat," said Glen Hanket, who has worn out three pair of heavy 
boots. "It's hard to believe we've made it 4,100 miles. It was a good way to 
see the country and do something productive." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the just-married couple were looking for a reason to take a long trip 
together. Both avid hikers, the Hankets were driving home on the San Diego 
Freeway back from a softball game in Irvine when they saw a big pile of trash 
on the freeway. That gave her an idea: Fighting litter seemed like a good theme 
for a cross-country walk. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hankets started their long journey in April, 1993, to call attention to 
the nation's trash problem. They set out from Acadia National Park in Maine, 
and at Shenandoah National Park, Va., turned west and made a beeline to St. 
Charles, Mo., with litter sticks in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We picked up an inordinate amount of underwear," Glen said. "We picked up 
just about everything: pornographic books in Polish, a butterfly collection and 
foreign coins." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Idaho is the messiest state in the union, according to the Hankets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't figure out why, but that's the state where we picked up the most 
trash by far. It was a whole lot of beer cans and bottles. There was one 
stretch of 50 yards where we picked up three full bags of cans and bottles." 
</P>
<P>
 They have slept in parks and motels, as well as the houses of people they met 
along the way. As the environmentally conscious pair moved from town to town 
with their tent and backpacks, they left behind bulging trash bags on roadsides 
where state transportation workers could pick them up as they passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout their journey, mostly on side roads and state highways, people 
applauded their efforts to spruce up. But there were a few exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had one person tell us, 'I'm not going to pick anything up. That's why I 
pay taxes, so someone else will do that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the trash-bagging trip hasn't been easy. Blisters were just the start.

 Susan, a former teacher's assistant, had to stay off her feet for seven weeks 
after she tripped on a porch in Maine last year and broke her leg. She was 
forced to give up the walk for good after she broke her arm near Vancouver, 
Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Not satisfied to stay behind, she followed her husband in a rented car the 
rest of the way to Oregon, logging 12 to 15 miles on the highway pavement 
daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Glen Hanket, a software engineer, will leave the highway and take 
narrower roads to Fort Stevens State Park, where the Columbia River spills into 
the Pacific Ocean.  
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Lines, a park administrator, said, he's not scheduled to work today, 
but he might go in anyway.

FEATHERS RUFFLED AS HOBBYISTS ENJOY WIND BENEATH THEIR WINGS; OAK PARK: 
LONGTIME MODEL GLIDER FLIERS DISTURB AND IN SOME CASES ALARM RESIDENTS OF NEW 
DEVELOPMENT AROUND RIDGE CALLED KANAN HILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nancy Tohl was squinting toward the weedy ridge when the large model glider 
plane burst back into view and sent its shadow across her concrete driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very nice way to enjoy life," the Oak Park resident said. "I can't see 
why anyone wouldn't like them up there." 
</P>
<P>
 Far up the ridge, Ken Kegler stood against the morning sun and used his remote 
control to ease his glider into the thermals that had swept off the distant 
Oxnard coast and risen from the tile roofs below. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes (people) will come up here and watch us and enjoy our silent 
flight," said Kegler, 53, of Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Down below, Cleavant Derrick gazed up from his new house on Burano Court and 
watched a vulture drift toward the soundless glider. Their shadows mingled as 
they moved over the weeds. And bird and plane, as they receded into the blue, 
soon became indistinguishable in the glaring sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I like about this neighborhood is things like this," the actor from New 
York said. 
</P>
<P>
 But to some residents in the new Monte Carlo housing tract that is being 
erected off Kanan Road and Hawthorne Drive, all is not necessarily well. 
</P>
<P>
 As so often happens when housing developments penetrate deeper into previously 
unoccupied areas -- whether beach, farmland or open space -- adjustments must 
be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Glider fliers suddenly find themselves fending off residents' complaints of 
increased auto traffic and the annoyance, if not danger, of aircraft crashing 
into their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanan Hill, as the ridge is known, has been luring model glider lovers for 
years, because its shape and location make it one of the best launching sites 
in east Ventura County. Nobody really minded the small squadrons of gliders 
that took flight from its brushy spine, either, until now. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're saying they've been coming here for 10 to 15 years," said Brenda 
Saturday, 38, a psychotherapist who moved into her house on Burano Court four 
months ago. "But there's a development here now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While appreciative of the aerobatics of the gliders, Saturday and other 
residents are rankled by enthusiasts who park near a public-access entry to the 
ridge at the end of Burano Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The entry is for hikers, mountain bicyclists, glider fliers and others who 
frequent the 317 acres of open space above the Monte Carlo tract, said Ranger 
Pat Lyman of the Rancho Simi Recreation and Park District. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever the wind is right -- weekend or workday -- small groups of glider 
fliers park near the cul-de-sac to climb the railroad ties that lead to a trail 
up the ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The public stairs, which cut between two homes, are not too far from another 
entry off Kanan, on the other side of a slump-stone wall that borders the 
tract. The entries are equidistant from the launch area. And some homeowners 
say glider enthusiasts should use the Kanan entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's an issue of who has a lesser burden," said Saturday's husband, 
Terry, 37, a law clerk at a Los Angeles firm that defends aviation firms. "They 
can park on Kanan. (But) they put up the response that they've always done 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dane Vannett, 28, a Moorpark resident who is a friend of Kegler and a fellow 
glider lover, said he and others try to accommodate neighborhood concerns by 
parking elsewhere, farther from the cul-de-sac next to the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go out of our way to be nice," said Kegler, an aircraft instruments 
salesman. "We invite and encourage kids in the area to come up and watch us. . 
. . It beats the hell out of taking drugs and all the other things kids could 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Tohl, who lives on another cul-de-sac at the end of adjoining Carmento Drive, 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 She said of her 13-year-old son: "I'd rather have him doing something 
productive in life and enjoy flying . . . instead of some other things kids do, 
like drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 But it is their children's welfare that has some other residents concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 A growing neighborhood in more ways than one, the dozen houses huddled under 
the ridge can dispatch as many as 17 children into the street. And with four 
pregnant women, according to Brenda Saturday's count, more are coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "You buy into a cul-de-sac to cut down on traffic. You pay a premium for it, 
too," said Larry Hawkinson, 43, who lives on Burano Court. "And now you get 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Another concern is gliders crashing in the neighborhood, as one did in May, 
Nancy Menia said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Maloney, 31, a neighbor, said a glider with a three-pound weight on its 
nose crashed into the roof of an unoccupied house at the end of Burano Court, 
forcing the builder to replace about 15 tiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you could imagine what would happen if it had hit a child," said Menia, 
38, who lives next to the house that was hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Acknowledging the problem, Kegler said he and others have elected to fly 
smaller gliders on tighter routes so they do not pass over the homes. His 
gliders -- replicas of World War II warplanes -- have a wing span of about four 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions are best for both fliers and residents when the winds are coming 
from the west, Kegler said. The thermals then tend to push the planes eastward, 
particularly when the sea breeze eddies over the narrow ridge and plunges into 
the thick chaparral on its east slope, sometimes pulling gliders down with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kanan is an advanced, difficult hill," Kegler said. "The landings could be 
treacherous." 
</P>
<P>
 He said residents can rest assured that only so many enthusiasts -- and most 
of them are experienced fliers -- can use the thin crown of Kanan Hill at any 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it's small, it gets difficult with more planes there," Kegler said. 
"The airspace gets crowded and there's the chance of midair collisions." 
</P>
<P>
 With the more expensive gliders and their remote-control devices costing 
$1,500 or more, that can be a major concern, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Harrison, an administrator for the park district responsible for the open 
space above Monte Carlo, said the glider fliers are permitted to launch from 
the ridge because their planes are not motorized, and thus present no fire 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 That is just fine with Tom Kunz, 35, of Agoura Hills. Long an observer of his 
father's hobby with motorized airplanes, Kunz has found himself instead drawn 
to silent flight and occasionally to Kanan Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like flying gliders because it's cleaner," he said. "You don't have all the 
messy fuel and the accessories to carry around with it."

FILLMORE TEEN SENTENCED IN FATAL STABBING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Fillmore teen-ager who pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in the 
stabbing death of a man almost a year ago was sentenced Friday to seven years 
in custody of the California Youth Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the objection of the prosecutor, Superior Court Judge Allan L. Steele 
decided to send Armando Murillo to a juvenile facility instead of state prison, 
defense attorney James M. Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele made his decision after CYA officials conducted a diagnostic study of 
Murillo and concluded he would benefit from their programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is only a 16-year-old kid," Farley said. "He's not a sophisticated 
criminal and (CYA) is where he belongs." 
</P>
<P>
 Murillo originally was charged with murder in the Dec. 11, 1993, stabbing 
death of Rodolfo Molina Mora, 27. Mora died after a 3:40 a.m. altercation in 
the 700 block of Blaine Street in Fillmore. 
</P>
<P>
 Farley said Mora was fighting with a friend of the defendant's when Murillo 
stepped in and stabbed Mora. The fight started after Mora drove by and threw a 
can out his car window, Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murillo was prosecuted as an adult because a judge concluded the teen-ager was 
not fit to remain in the Juvenile Court system. Once he was convicted, however, 
Murillo was eligible for incarceration at the CYA because of his age. BARBARA 
MURPHY

MERCHANTS SUE OVER PAY PARKING IN DANA POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Dana Point merchants sued the leaseholders of Mariner's Village this week, 
alleging that a pay-to-park policy has ruined their business. 
</P>
<P>
 Shop owners Peggy Pearson and Susan Finn claim the installation of parking 
gates in April, after 21 years of free parking at the popular seaside complex, 
kept customers away. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit accuses Mariner's Village leaseholders Gary Bushman & Associates of 
violating the bylaws of the Dana Point Harbor Assn.

BLANTON'S LONG TRAIL BACK ENDS; FOOTBALL: FORMER MATER DEI QUARTERBACK FINALLY 
GETS A CHANCE TO CALL THE SHOTS FOR SAN DIEGO STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Billy Blanton is in command again. It can be a dangerous thing for opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanton, a sophomore at San Diego State, has pushed and prodded a team before. 
He took Mater Dei to the Southern Section Division I title in 1991, setting 
Orange County records for yards passing and touchdown passes in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 He strutted and swaggered, confident that no one could stop him. No one could. 
Ah, but that was eons ago. Ancient history. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Blanton will dust off the skills that made him so successful at Mater 
Dei and direct the Aztec offense against New Mexico. He is in command again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been three years, it seems like a lot more," Blanton said. "It's does 
feel different. But I certainly feel like the quarterback going into this game. 
I'm the leader. I'll be in charge. I have no doubts, none at all." 
</P>
<P>
 That could be whistling in the graveyard. Then again, he could be dead right. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanton is ready to deliver but is still an unknown parcel at this level.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm as comfortable as a coach can be with a quarterback who's making his 
first start," Coach Ted Tollner said. "Sure I'm concerned, but that's not 
because it's Billy Blanton. I would be with any guy making his first start. 
He's an unknown." 
</P>
<P>
 This was not the position the Aztecs (2-4) wanted or expected to be in, not at 
this position. They had senior Tim Gutierrez, who was seasoned and talented; he 
had thrown for 3,033 yards and 24 touchdowns as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also had a rather lengthy medical log. Three years, three surgeries -- 
back, shoulder and knee. No. 4 came after last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanton was his clipboard-toting self at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium. Then, 
Gutierrez was flattened by a Utah defender and suffered a broken collarbone. 
Blanton saw he wasn't getting up. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mind started working," Blanton said. "I had to warm up, I had to get 
loose. I was going in." 
</P>
<P>
 First play: A play-action fake. The safety bit. An open receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Blanton: "I overthrew him by five yards. I guess I got a little anxious." 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the day wasn't much better. Blanton completed 14 of 22 passes for 
121 yards. But one of his passes was intercepted and he fumbled once. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied, 7-7, when Blanton entered the game. Utah, ranked 21st in 
the nation, cruised to a 38-22 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there were some good moments for Blanton. He drove the Aztecs to a late 
touchdown. He was nearly devoured by a blitz on the conversion attempt but 
wiggled free and hit Will Blackwell in the end zone for two points. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a little victory in a big loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough day," Blanton said. "It took me awhile to get into the flow. I 
was rusty, definitely rusty." 
</P>
<P>
 He has had a week to scrape and polish. 
</P>
<P>
 With Gutierrez out for the season, Blanton has crammed all week because the 
Aztecs' no-huddle offense is not exactly the type of scheme that runs smoothly 
with rotating quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't just hand off," Tollner said. "He has to be in control. It's an 
upbeat offense and the emphasis is on the quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a good place to put it when playing New Mexico. Blanton catches a 
break; the Lobos (1-5) don't exactly excite people. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems like a perfect opponent for a quarterback who had thrown only nine 
passes entering this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel really good this week," Blanton said. "I've watched films and had more 
time with the offense. I don't kid myself. It's not going to be easy. But I'm 
getting a chance to do more than just hand off and run out the clock." 
</P>
<P>
 Blanton was accustomed to more responsibility, at least in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 As Blanton went, so went Mater Dei in 1991. He threw for 3,485 yards and 36 
touchdowns. He led the Monarchs to a 35-14 victory over Rialto Eisenhower in 
the title game. He won the Glenn Davis Award as Southern California's top high 
school player. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a gambler," Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson said. "The bigger the 
game, the bigger he played." 
</P>
<P>
 In playoff game against Los Angeles Loyola, Blanton scrambled 19 yards, going 
face first into two linebackers. He suffered a broken nose, missed one play, 
then returned to throw a touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 But no matter how big he played, he didn't stand any taller. Blanton was 
listed as 6 feet 2, but was actually just a shade under 6 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 College coaches would see him play and all but sigh. Blanton was great but too 
short.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what they were thinking," Blanton said. "I knew I was big 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State Coach Al Luginbill was ready to believe. It did help that 
former Trabuco Hills quarterback David Lowery, who was also around the 6-foot 
mark, was the Aztecs starter. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanton had broken Lowery's single-season passing record. Lowery had taken the 
Aztecs to the Freedom Bowl. Luginbill did the math. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked me one thing, 'Can Blanton throw the comeback route from the hash to 
the wide side of the field,' " Rollinson said. "I got out some game films and 
he said, 'We're going to offer him a scholarship.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Blanton accepted and redshirted. He came back last season, but was shoved off 
to the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Practice would begin with passing drills. Blanton would warm up, throw a few 
balls, then kneel on the sideline while Lowery and Gutierrez ran the offense. 
Nothing could be more excruciating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would do mental reps," Blanton said. "I run the plays through my head, over 
and over, and imagine how I would run them. That kept me in it. I wasn't mad, I 
was just frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 That turned to concern when Luginbill was fired last December. Three days 
later, Tollner was hired and Blanton was elated. 
</P>
<P>
 Tollner had a reputation as a quarterback coach. He was the Aztecs' offensive 
coordinator from 1973-80, then worked with Jim McMahon at BYU before being 
hired at USC. Add to that years of experience on the professional level. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanton was more excited when Tollner hired Tom Craft as offensive 
coordinator. Craft, who led Palomar to a pair of national junior college 
titles, brought the no-huddle offense with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That makes it fun," Blanton said. "When you get everything clicking, when 
you're completing passes, you really get a good feeling for the game. You get 
confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Blanton showed that confidence in the spring game. He threw for 206 yards, 
including a 60-yard touchdown pass on the last play. 
</P>
<P>
 It secured the No. 2 spot for Blanton, which was fine. He was satisfied to 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next year was going to be my year," Blanton said. "But I had to be prepared. 
You never know when your chance is going to come. In the back of my mind, I 
knew I had to be ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Like any good commander.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; CITY TO IGNORE HIRING FREEZE, SEEK DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials say they will ignore a hiring freeze and replace the public 
works director who resigned last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something that is as critical as this job needs to be looked at a little 
differently than like, say, somebody at the clerical level," said Agoura Hills 
City Councilman Denis Weber."I personally have no problems with a search." 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Mastrosimone resigned Oct. 6 as public works director to take a similar 
job in Covina, near his home in San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
 The hiring freeze is one of the ways the city is trying to cope with a 
projected $700,000 deficit -- the worst shortfall in the city's 12-year 
history. The City Council voted in July to lay off two full-time employees and 
five part-time workers. 
</P>
<P>
 To pick up the slack until a new public works director can be found, the city 
will increase the number of hours it contracts City Engineer Elroy Kiepke, said 
City Manager Terry Matz. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, (Kiepke) operates one day a week," said Matz. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're probably going to use him for some additional time to assist us in some 
other areas. He probably would be in the office as many as three days a week." 
</P>
<P>
 The city needs a full-time public works director to oversee numerous ongoing 
projects, said Matz, including the widening of Kanan Road and the construction 
of a new park to replace Old Agoura Park.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; SYSTEM FOR SALE, BUT CABLE TO BE UPGRADED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The oft-criticized cable company serving Glendale and Burbank is up for sale, 
but company officials say it won't affect an estimated $15-million renovation 
of the system to increase channels and provide other service improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 The system is owned by Dallas-based Sammons Enterprises, which announced this 
week it intends to sell its interests in the cable TV business, including 
systems in 19 states with more than 1.1 million subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials said the announcement could benefit Glendale and Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously they're going to get a higher price for their business if they have 
a signed contract and bring their system up to current standards," said 
Glendale Mayor Eileen Givens. 
</P>
<P>
 Sammons, which has 43,000 subscribers in Glendale and another 35,000 in 
Burbank, has been criticized for having too few channels -- 41 -- while cable 
operators in neighboring communities typically offer 60 or more. Residents have 
also long complained about service interruptions and poor customer service. 
</P>
<P>
 But under a new contract, which is expected to be signed by the company and 
approved by the Burbank and Glendale city councils before the end of the year, 
the firm agrees to increase its system's capacity to 78 channels and replace 
its 20-year-old coaxial wire system with a fiber-optic network to improve 
picture quality and service reliability.  
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year contract requires that the system overhaul be completed within 
three years.  
</P>
<P>
 If the company is sold, the contract would transfer to its new owners, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vartan Taikaldiranian, a Glendale resident who said his family has subscribed 
to Sammons for more than 10 years, said the addition of more channels is long 
overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible, because whenever you visit your friends in Los Angeles or 
other cities, they have ESPN-2 and all these channels that we don't have," said 
Taikaldiranian, 29.  
</P>
<P>
 "And we're paying good money for it, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Customers pay $24.05 a month for basic service on the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Sammons officials said the new agreement will bring the system up to the level 
of other local cable operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the customers are going to be very pleased with the end result," said 
Shirley Orr, general manager of Sammons Communications in Glendale. "With the 
quality of the fiber-optics and the increase in channels, the system will be up 
to date." 
</P>
<P>
 Sammons Enterprises spokesman Joe Barta said the privately owned company -- 
which also has interests in insurance, bottled water and industrial equipment 
-- has decided to get out of the cable business because of the high cost of 
upgrading outmoded systems and because of projected competition from telephonic 
and direct-broadcast satellite systems. STEVE RYFLE

MAN IN TRUCK KILLS DAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 34-year-old Sylmar man accidentally ran over and killed his 4-year-old 
daughter Friday when the girl ran into the path of his pickup truck, the 
California Highway Patrol said. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco Olea Barragan had backed up about 20 feet with a load of lumber in 
his truck when his daughter, Lydia O. Garcia, ran into its path, CHP Officer 
Rich Perez said. The accident occurred at a ranch near Sierra Highway and 
Foothill Boulevard just before 1 p.m., Perez said.

<P>
 "He didn't realize she was standing behind the truck and he ran over the 
daughter," Perez said.

PACOIMA MAN SENT TO JAIL AGAIN FOR BEATING HIS WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Pacoima man, convicted of repeatedly punching his wife in the face and 
stomach after she refused to have sex, received his second six-month jail term 
in less than two years Friday for beating her, a prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Van Nuys court commissioner imposed the sentence on Eduardo Valentin, 26, 
after he pleaded no contest to spousal battery this week, said Deputy Los 
Angeles City Atty.Sharyn Siskel. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence stems from a Sept. 11 incident in which Valentin came home drunk 
and demanded sex from his wife, then ripped off her clothes and punched her, 
Siskel said. Police reported that the woman's lips were swollen and the right 
side of her head bruised, Siskel said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the jail term, Van Nuys Municipal Court Commissioner Mitchell 
Block placed Valentin on three years probation, ordered him to undergo a year 
of domestic-violence counseling and to attend at least 104 Alcoholics Anonymous 
meetings, Siskel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentin was sentenced to a six-month jail term in 1993 after he was arrested 
for assaulting his wife in their apartment while he was drunk, Siskel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said Valentin demanded that his wife cook him two dinners that 
night and grew verbally abusive as she served the food. 
</P>
<P>
 When the woman went into the bedroom, her husband attacked her, striking her 
repeatedly in the face with his fists and attempting to smother her with a 
pillow, Siskel said. He then hit her in the face with a cordless telephone but 
she managed to break free, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valentin's wife grabbed their infant son from a crib and fled the apartment on 
foot. Valentin chased her, but was later arrested by police, Siskel said.

MARCH PROTESTS LAPD OFFICERS' JAIL TERMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A march and rally will be held today at Canyon Country Park to launch a 
national petition campaign protesting an appeals court order that resulted in 
longer jail sentences for two former Los Angeles police officers convicted of 
violating Rodney G. King's civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The events, which will feature a speech by Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon 
(R-Santa Clarita), will be in support of ex-Officer Laurence M. Powell and 
ex-Sgt.Stacey C. Koon, who have homes in Valencia and Castaic, respectively, 
according to Dennis Lebman, representing family and friends of Powell. 
</P>
<P>
 The U. S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals on Aug. 19 ordered U. S. District Judge 
John G. Davies to resentence the two men, who at that point had served nearly a 
year of their 30-month sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 Rally organizers characterized the resentencing mandate as unjust and plan to 
petition for Powell's and Koon's release. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not really a fund-raising event per se, but we will be selling 
T-shirts and bracelets there," Lebman said. Sponsor of the event is the Officer 
Laurence Powell Defense Fund, based in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 The march will start at 2 p.m. at the intersection of Soledad Canyon Road and 
Camp Plenty Road. The marchers will proceed two miles up Soledad Canyon Road to 
Canyon Country Park, where a picnic will be held. The rally will begin at 3:30 
p.m.

RELIGION / STEVE HENSON; CHALLENGING BIBLICAL ASSUMPTIONS; BOOK: GOSPEL 
RESEARCHER OFFERS SOME RADICAL NOTIONS IN SELF-PUBLISHED WORK. DESPITE HIS 
AMATEUR STATUS, IT HAS DRAWN PRAISE FROM MANY SCHOLARS. 
</P>

<P>
 After spending years selling sophisticated computer systems, Evan Powell is 
marketing something he believes is every bit as revolutionary: his own findings 
in Gospel research. 
</P>
<P>
 His conclusions challenge long-held assumptions about which Gospel was written 
first, and even the authorship of portions of the Gospels, with consequences 
for understanding early Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, 41, self-published his first book, "The Unfinished Gospel: Notes on 
the Quest for the Historical Jesus," in May, and it has been in bookstores 
since Oct 1. Praised by some biblical scholars despite Powell's amateur status, 
the first printing of 3,000 has sold out and a second printing of 10,000 is 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is one of a recent spate of works that attempt to dig behind the 
Gospels to establish a historical Jesus, including a book by a coalition of 
American Bible scholars who concluded that Jesus said only 18% of what has been 
attributed to him in the Gospels. 
</P>
<P>
 But, while many of those books were published by major houses, Powell's is the 
fruit of his own determination. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a salesman through and through, and that expertise enabled him to do 
something almost unheard of for a novice author with a self-published hardback: 
He cut a deal with a major distributor. National bookstore chains are carrying 
the book and it will be distributed in four English-speaking foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The selling point? His conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Many biblical scholars have long thought that the Gospel of Mark lacks a 
coherent ending, and that there may have been a final chapter, lost centuries 
ago. Powell contends that it wasn't lost at all, but was taken off the Gospel 
of Mark and moved to the Gospel of John, where it is known today as John 21, a 
curious last chapter that has long been considered awkward and redundant where 
it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime during the 1st Century, the ending of Mark's Gospel was appended to 
John's for political reasons within the church, Powell believes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Gospel of John was written to demonstrate that Peter was not to be 
trusted as a leader of the church," Powell said. "I believe Mark was written as 
a rebuttal to John. In their original form, these Gospels are quite at odds." 
</P>
<P>
 John 21 describes an encounter after the Resurrection between Jesus and Peter, 
one of the original apostles. Jesus forgives Peter and tells him to take an 
active role in the leadership of the church, an admonition that Catholics 
believe made Peter the first Pope. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell believes the chapter was shifted from one author to the other to weaken 
John's criticism of Peter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adding the last chapter to John has the effect of neutralizing the attack on 
Peter," Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Powell offers a second radical notion: That John wrote the first 
Gospel. Most scholars believe it was the last of the four, written near the end 
of the 1st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "If John was written closer to Jesus' life (than the other Gospels), then the 
attacks on Peter take on more authenticity," Powell said. "There is greater 
potential that John was written by eyewitnesses to events." 
</P>
<P>
 Leading biblical scholars might be slow to warm up to Powell's conclusions. 
The author, after all, has no formal religious training, despite a lifelong 
interest in the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 "His ideas are very attractive at first glance, they make you stop and think," 
said Ronald F. Hock, a professor of religion at USC who has read "The 
Unfinished Gospel." 
</P>
<P>
 "What is needed now is a very careful analysis of what he has proposed, 
especially the lost ending to Mark." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell also offers a radical notion in explaining the Resurrection. He 
believes that Jesus did not die during the Crucifixion, but went through a 
"near-death experience" -- or NDE -- and lived several days until he died of 
the wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggesting that Jesus experienced the same near-death feelings described by 
many modern survivors -- who frequently say they returned from a spiritual 
realm of incredible tranquillity -- helped Powell resolve a contradiction that 
had troubled him since his early 20s when he contemplated entering the 
Presbyterian ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesus spent his life trying to re-establish the tradition of Judaism in a way 
that was less institutional and political," Powell said. "How does the movement 
of a religious reformer suddenly transform itself into a movement expounding 
salvation and eternal life? Those two things just do not connect. 
</P>
<P>
 "NDE provides the spiritual element that changed Jesus' reformist movement 
into a spiritual movement." 
</P>
<P>
 Powell's marketing instincts told him to avoid mention of his theory of Jesus' 
survival on the book jacket and in advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it is separated from the context of the book, saying that Jesus survived 
the Crucifixion comes across as sensationalistic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Unfinished Gospel," despite its radical offerings, is anything but 
shrill. Powell wrote it with the lay reader in mind, but his arguments are 
consistent with historical-literary critical methods, knowledgeable readers 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell established an 800 phone number at his home in Westlake Village for 
book sales and has bought print advertisements. And rather than holding his 
breath worrying how the book will be received by biblical scholars, he actively 
solicited reviews, mailing more than 200 copies to religion writers and book 
reviewers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Early reviews are in, and they are encouraging. Samples: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Powell is an original thinker. There is something here to challenge or 
offend virtually every reader. Not a book for the fainthearted, 'The Unfinished 
Gospel' is an open invitation to debate over vital issues in the life of 
Jesus." -- R. Alan Culpepper, Baylor University. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Powell's thesis is clear, complete and convincing. His argument is 
provocative . . . challenging scholars to rethink views that have for too long 
been taken for granted." -- Hock. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Powell has proposed solutions which demand to be taken seriously. I like 
his boldness and applaud his work." -- Robert McKenzie, San Francisco 
Theological Seminary. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, who used personal funds to publish the book after spending two years 
writing it, has come to like the Jesus he describes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a charismatic individual, brave, willing to challenge authority," 
Powell said. "He inspired people to follow him and he put his life on the line 
for what he believed."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; BUS DRIVER ATTACKED ON FREEWAY; VIOLENCE: HE 
GRAPPLES WITH A KNIFE-WIELDING PASSENGER WHILE TRYING TO CONTROL THE SWERVING 
VEHICLE NEAR GORMAN. SUSPECT IS IN CUSTODY. 
</P>

<P>
 In an incident reminiscent of the movie "Speed," a bus driver had to control 
his swerving vehicle on the Golden State Freeway as he grappled with a 
knife-wielding passenger, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Benjamin Espinosa, 31, of Whittier was driving a 40-foot touring coach from 
Bakersfield to Pasadena Thursday when a passenger walked up to Espinosa and 
pressed a five-inch-long razor knife against his throat, Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're a dead man," the passenger allegedly told Espinosa, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinosa grabbed the man's hand and began struggling with him, causing the bus 
to swerve as it sped southbound along the Golden State Freeway. Another 
passenger, James Hole, 39, of Pasadena helped wrestle the assailant away from 
the driver, deputies reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinosa regained control of the bus, pulled over at a brake-inspection site 
in Gorman and radioed for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, identified as 63-year-old Edward Macias of La Puente, was 
arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon. He is in custody at the 
Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station in lieu of $20,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities are unsure what triggered the attack, which occurred at about 8:30 
p.m. Thursday, a mile north of Gorman. Macias and Hole were the only riders on 
the bus, and no one was injured in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 The bus route between Bakersfield and Pasadena is a connector service that 
Amtrak provides for train riders. Antelope Valley Bus Inc. in Lancaster 
operates the service under contract with Amtrak. 
</P>
<P>
 Bus-company officials said they were surprised by the incident, especially 
because it occurred on a long-distance route rather than on a local route in a 
major city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unusual," said Roy McDaniel, safety director for the Antelope 
Valley bus company. "We normally don't have this sort of thing happen, thank 
God." 
</P>
<P>
 Bus company officials will conduct an investigation of the incident. Espinosa 
reported to them that Macias had been arguing with Hole earlier, and may have 
been intoxicated, McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Espinosa, who declined to be interviewed, was back on duty Friday.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HISTORIAN'S LEGACY STUFFED INTO TRAILER; 
CRIME: SANTA CLARITA MAN WHO ANSWERS AD TO HAUL IT AWAY IS ARRESTED FOR GRAND 
THEFT. A.B. PERKINS' HEIRS WANT ITEMS RETURNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Times correspondent and Goldman is a Times staff writer. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There are two ways to look at the legacy of the late A.B. Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Either he was an important north county researcher and historian, whose 
collected belongings are an invaluable resource, or he had merely collected a 
lifetime's worth of family portraits and knickknacks, no more valuable to 
outsiders than the crayon drawings a proud mother hangs on the fridge. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Perkins' stuff is causing a heap of trouble for Stephen Steele, 
a Santa Clarita man who in June answered a newspaper ad placed by Perkins' 
heirs. The ad offered a free trailer to anyone who would haul it away. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the family didn't know that A.B.'s treasures had been stored in 
the trailer. On Thursday, Steele -- who allegedly was trying to peddle some of 
the items at local swap meets -- was arrested for grand theft of 20 boxes of, 
well, stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins moved to the Santa Clarita Valley in the 1920s to mine for gold. He 
bought property and as he grew older he enjoyed researching the area's history. 
He wrote a history column for the Newhall Signal newspaper as well as for other 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
 But judging by the 20 brown boxes lined up along a hallway at the sheriff's 
station here, Perkins collected more than history. As bewildered passers-by 
walked along the row of crates, deputies picked through dust-laden photo albums 
and yellowing papers and books. They joked that they had raided a garage sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Civilian employee Dianne Avery was incredulous. 
</P>
<P>
 "People actually reported this stuff stolen?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 One stray black and white photo in a box showed three children getting snow 
cones from a woman at a table, perhaps at a long-ago county fair. A yellowing 
three-ring vinyl folder contained unlined, once-white paper covered with 
algebra problems. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also a wooden and clay life-sized bust of a frowning Perkins. Legend 
has it that it was the work of late newspaperman Scott Newhall, but the 
artist's true identity is a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not Scotty, I can tell you that," said Ruth Newhall, the 
newspaperman's widow. 
</P>
<P>
 More mundane items were sprinkled throughout the boxes: An old pair of pliers, 
odd pieces of silverware, a wooden end table and a porcelain teacup with 
stenciled abstract shapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said they had no way to determine what the items were worth. Most of 
those not deemed junk would probably be of more historical than monetary value. 
</P>
<P>
 But what some would call "junk" holds sentimental value for the Perkins 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle over Perkins' collection began when Ray and Jody Hegge, who rent a 
house belonging to the Perkins family, moved the boxes to the 1937 trailer kept 
on the land. Unbeknown to the Hegges, the Perkins family had placed an ad 
offering the trailer to the first taker. 
</P>
<P>
 When Steele came to pick up the trailer July 2, according to statements made 
by the Hegges to sheriff's deputies, they begged him to let them get Perkins' 
belongings out. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele claimed not to have time and drove off, the Hegges said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Brad Stone said that is the crux of the case. Because 
Steele was on the Perkinses' property, the Hegges should have been allowed to 
remove the trailer's contents, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about a person who received a gift and when he was told there 
was other stuff there, he took it against the will of the owner," Stone said. 
"We call that thievery."  
</P>
<P>
 The Perkins family didn't know his collection had been hauled away until weeks 
later when they read a local news account about Steele's "find." 
</P>
<P>
 When they asked for Perkins' goods back, Steele allegedly asked for $10,000 to 
account for the time he and his wife spent cleaning and sorting the items. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the stuff for 12 or 13 weeks, cleaning it, preserving it, repairing 
it," Steele said. "Everything was broken up real bad."  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of paying, Perkins' heirs went to sheriff's deputies who on Thursday 
served Steele with a search warrant, confiscated the items and threw him in 
jail in lieu of $20,000 bail. Charges are expected to be filed next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Steele posted bond Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was the historian of this valley," Perkins said. "A lot of his 
manuscripts and research papers were involved. That type of information has no 
value and yet it's irreplaceable." 
</P>
<P>
 So why hadn't Perkins removed the items from storage at the rented-out house? 
</P>
<P>
 He was getting around to it, Perkins said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 DIE IN TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS

<P>
 Two men -- one riding a bicycle and the other a motorcycle -- were killed in 
separate Antelope Valley traffic accidents, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bicyclist, who was carrying no identification, was riding north on 10th 
Street West near Avenue M-8 at 8:45 p.m. Thursday when he was struck by a 1995 
Ford Windstar van, also heading north, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the van apparently had trouble seeing the man because the 
bicycle did not have lights or reflectors, which state law requires for night 
riding, sheriff's Sgt. Gary Olson said. In addition, the bicycle and the man's 
clothing were dark-colored, making him even more difficult to see, Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bicyclist was taken to Lancaster Community Hospital, where he died, 
deputies said. The man, who appeared to be Latino and between 30 and 40 years 
old, had not been identified Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson urged anyone with information on his identity to contact the Antelope 
Valley Sheriff's Station at (805) 948-8466. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the van, Trina Grabher, 30, of Lancaster, was not injured and 
was not cited. Her five children, who were passengers in the van, also escaped 
uninjured, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other accident occurred at 6:45 a.m. Thursday on Sierra Highway near 
Mountain Springs Road, just south of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad R. Carson, 33, of Palmdale, was passing traffic by crossing the 
double-yellow line, when a 1993 Ford Thunderbird began turning left into the 
Vincent Metrolink Station parking lot in front of the motorcycle, California 
Highway Patrol Officer Jerry Borne said. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorcycle slammed into the driver's door, the officer said. Carson was 
taken to Desert Palms Community Hospital in Palmdale, where he was pronounced 
dead at 8:28 a.m.

ANALYSIS; COACH GOT CAUGHT IN HIS BACKLASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of this city's highest rollers and biggest movers and shakers waited 
eagerly one February afternoon last year to hear Nevada Las Vegas Coach Rollie 
Massimino speak about their favorite subject -- Rebel basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting was a Rotary Club luncheon, and the assembled bank presidents, 
business people and political figures were there to enjoy and digest whatever 
nuggets Massimino might impart. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Massimino's second season of occupying Las Vegas' most visible 
position, and the luncheon was supposed to be a quick schmooze session, another 
of those dog-and-pony shows that are required of college coaches. Show up, 
shake hands and smile -- a lot. And because the room was packed with 250 
ardent, big-money UNLV basketball boosters, smiles were definitely in order. 
</P>
<P>
 But a funny thing happened that February afternoon. Massimino failed to show. 
He didn't even call. The boosters weren't amused and became incensed when 
Massimino later dismissed his no-show to a local newspaper as unimportant. 
</P>
<P>
 The backlash lingers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this was the most grievous example, it was a typical Massimino 
misunderstanding with the UNLV community, according to many observers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, Coach Massimino did not establish the kind of overall 
community relations that were expected of him," UNLV Athletic Director Jim 
Weaver said. "I don't believe Coach Massimino missed that Rotary meeting on 
purpose, but it was missed." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nevada Board of Regents member Lonnie Hammargren: "There are some parts 
of the community that wouldn't have liked him no matter what, but there are 
other parts that could have, and he didn't try." 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino's brief but rocky tenure as coach of the Runnin' Rebels ended Friday 
when the university bought out his lucrative and controversial contract. And 
although the basketball team's poor performance was the key factor in the 
breakup, numerous people familiar with the situation said Massimino's aloof 
attitude was also a major factor in his fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino disagrees with this assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a great relationship with a lot of marvelous, marvelous people in 
this community," he said. "This experience was a great one because of the 
amount of fine people I've met." 
</P>
<P>
 But by this week, what little support Massimino had was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the wrong guy for the job," said Chuck Thompson, a longtime UNLV 
booster who also served as former coach Jerry Tarkanian's attorney. "He was the 
wrong person at the wrong place at the wrong time." 
</P>
<P>
 Poor timing defined Massimino's 57-game career as the leader of the Runnin' 
Rebels, several influential community members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems began before he rolled out his first ball in the Thomas & Mack 
Center. After 19 seasons, Massimino, 59, left the relatively tame confines of 
Villanova in 1992 to become the first coach to succeed the legendary Tarkanian, 
who brought victories and alleged NCAA infractions in bunches. 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino was charged with keeping the program clean, a concept he embraced in 
the news conference to announce his hiring. In a few seconds, Massimino 
declared that "in no way will any student-athlete ever embarrass this 
university . . . ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarkanian supporters, and there are many in Las Vegas, perceived the statement 
as a knock against the former coach, who still resides in the area. Moreover, 
he couldn't make the lofty proclamation stick. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been problems and embarrassing situations involving Rebel players 
under Massimino, most notably star forward Isaiah (J.R.) Rider, now a member of 
the NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves. Rider, who was brought in by Tarkanian, was 
accused of academic fraud, a charge that was dismissed when an independent 
investigation cleared Rider. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for Massimino, memories don't disappear so quickly. Some 
university supporters, who said they were neutral about Massimino before the 
situation, are still irked by his handling of the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Tarkanian faithful? Well, they already were leery of Massimino because 
he was the choice of former UNLV and current Long Beach State President Robert 
Maxson, one of Tarkanian's least-favorite people and a longtime antagonist. The 
Rider mess provided the doubters with more ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came in and made a lot of people angry right from the beginning," said 
Fred Glusman, a Las Vegas restaurateur and formerly proud booster. "You go back 
to the first day and it only got worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino admits he did not realize the extent of the rift in the community 
left from the Tarkanian-Maxson battles. This was a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I had learned a lot in my life until I went through this," 
Massimino said. "But there were many, many, many more positives than 
negatives." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarkanian said he considered Massimino a friend before he arrived in Las Vegas 
and still does. However, friends of Tarkanian said Massimino tried to set up a 
meeting once to clear the air after his first-day statement but Tarkanian 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of the local press, whom Tarkanian had masterfully brought in as if 
they were family members, had trouble working with Massimino. Tarkanian was a 
media favorite even during the tense times of NCAA probes and the final days 
before he was forced out in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 As the losses mounted in the Rebels' sub-par 15-13 1993-1994 season, dealing 
with Massimino was almost impossible because of his volatile temper. 
</P>
<P>
 KVBC-TV's Colin Cowherd, the co-host of Massimino's weekly TV show, said 
dealing with Massimino was one of the most difficult experiences of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very distant, difficult and aloof," Cowherd said. "At his worst he is 
belligerent. After two years of doing the show we still have absolutely no 
rapport." 
</P>
<P>
 Some longtime supporters attribute a portion of Massimino's public-relations 
problems to his coming from the East Coast. They said he exemplifies the 
stereotypical brash, bombastic Eastern transplant, which did not play well in 
what essentially is a closed community with a population of about 1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver, UNLV's athletic director, acknowledged that sentiment was strong -- 
and shared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard from a lot of people in the community that Coach Massimino had a 
'back East attitude,' " Weaver said. "It's really unfortunate that a wedge was 
created." 
</P>
<P>
 But could it have been avoided? 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Finfrock, a former UNLV interim athletic director, said the community 
did not give Massimino a break. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel the town welcomed him from the start," said Finfrock, a vice 
president at the MGM Grand hotel. "The town didn't embrace him like a new coach 
should have been. He should have been given the benefit of the doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Although, the majority of opinion seems to be that Massimino created many of 
his problems in Las Vegas, even his most die-hard critics say the deck was 
stacked against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Regent Shelley Berkley, who angrily criticized Massimino for his initial 
refusal to accept a buyout, admits that his task might have been 
insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came in with some very high expectations, but he made a lot of mistakes," 
Berkley said. "But I'm not sure if God almighty could have handled this."

TAKING ANOTHER NOSE DIVE; FINANCE: THE FLYING SYMBOL OF BRUCE MCNALL'S HEYDAY 
WILL GO ON THE BLOCK SUNDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN and JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The biggest decision for the well-treated Los Angeles King players aboard 
shiny, glossy Air McNall used to run along the lines of: "Red wine or white?" 
"Skip the Caesar salad and save room for another Haagen-Dazs ice cream bar?" 
</P>
<P>
 But like its once high-flying owner, the 1966 Boeing 727-100 has landed in a 
similar state. It has been grounded by lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce McNall's former jet -- which once shuttled his hockey players, 
celebrities and even future President Bill Clinton -- now sits at the Ontario 
International Airport, where it will be auctioned Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane is another remnant of McNall's free-spending days. Those now seem 
like ages ago, in the aftermath of his personal bankruptcy filing and his 
anticipated plea to four criminal counts related to a federal bank fraud 
investigation. The plane might be sold to another sports team or could even go 
unsold. There are scores of empty jets in airline graveyards out in the desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Each prospective buyer has to bring along a $100,000 check to be taken 
seriously. And, because the market is glutted and the plane was marketed 
unconventionally last year in a catalogue of Upper Deck Authenticated, the 
Carlsbad sports-collectible company, it is uncertain whether it will sell at 
all. In the catalogue offer, there was a promise that King players would 
autograph the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, the asking price was $5 million in 1993, far more than it is 
expected to fetch Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando L. Camarena, vice president with Nationwide Commercial Auction Systems 
of City of Industry, said that many surplus planes can be sold only for salvage 
and not certified for flying. He predicted that the former King plane would 
sell for $600,000 to $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarena said the plane is certified to fly by the Federal Aviation 
Administration, but needs about $1 million in improvements to bring it up to 
recommended safety standards for possible wind shear. It also needs 
modifications to reduce noise levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was seized after a unit of Chase Manhattan Bank, owed about $4 
million, obtained a judgment when McNall's aviation company failed to make its 
payments. The company also had not paid a $307,131 maintenance bill to an 
Oklahoma City firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane's value is nowhere near the $5 million McNall paid for it in 1990, 
when he boasted of purchasing it from the president of Mexico. Court records 
show it was recently appraised at only $410,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave it up because it wasn't worth the debt on it," said Richard Wynne, a 
lawyer at the bankruptcy law firm of Levene & Eisenberg. Wynne is handling 
McNall's personal bankruptcy case. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane has 24 leather first-class-style seats, 36 conventional 
fabric-covered seats in the back, and 12 television monitors. The Kings' black 
and silver colors are visible throughout the interior and in stripes painted on 
the outside of the plane. It also includes a large galley and accommodations 
for three flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
 One tape remains stuck in one of the VCRs: "In the Line of Fire," an ironic 
title given McNall's problems the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane has had an interesting history since McNall bought it. Once a cadre 
of celebrities -- other than the King players -- used the plane at different 
times. Clinton leased it for a couple of weeks during his campaign in the 
spring of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A planeload of celebrities -- including actress Mariel Hemingway and actor 
James Belushi -- and 25 other luminaries traveled to Toronto for the 1991 
Canadian Football League debut of Rocket Ismail. As the plane taxied on the 
runway, a formation of 10 limos met the plane, with comic actor John Candy as a 
welcoming host. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all part of McNall's image of success. He once told reporters that it 
is not bad in the collectibles and horse racing businesses if you are thought 
to have more money than you really do, because then you are offered more deals. 
</P>
<P>
 This philosophy, critical to his business approach, was illustrated in a 
proposed McNall Sports and Entertainment restructuring plan presented to Bank 
of America in September of 1993, which was filed among recent bankruptcy 
documents. One argument made to Bank of America by McNall and his business 
associates against liquidation or bankruptcy was that "the McNall good will, 
which is largely based upon his perceived financial success, would be 
destroyed." 
</P>
<P>
 That is why it was so important for McNall, who was then besieged by 
creditors, to present a $275,000 Rolls-Royce convertible to King superstar 
Wayne Gretzky in a highly publicized ceremony on March 30, after Gretzky broke 
Gordie Howe's NHL record for goals scored. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rolls-Royce was not paid for by McNall but by new King owners Jeffrey 
Sudikoff and Joseph Cohen. But then, the airplane, and so much of the entire 
McNall empire, all eventually crumbled under the inevitable price tag of such 
opulence.  
</P>
<P>
 Recent documents filed in McNall's bankruptcy case suggest a remarkable record 
of spending and excesses: 
</P>
<P>
 Some examples: 
</P>
<P>
 -- A former McNall employee, James Bailey, described stories of what he called 
abuse of corporate assets, in recent sworn testimony in McNall's bankruptcy 
case. Bailey said one story making the rounds was that Suzan Waks, McNall's 
chief financial officer, once flew to Toronto for a dinner and didn't like her 
shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had another pair of shoes flown up from Los Angeles at the company's 
expense," Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey also said another story had Waks ordering chicken soup, sent by 
messenger at company expense, from the Stage Deli in Century City to her home 
in Palos Verdes when she had a cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Waks' attorney, Carla M. Woehrle, did not return calls and McNall's attorneys 
have challenged the general credibility of Bailey's statements. 
</P>
<P>
 -- McNall once spent $2.8 million on personal expenses between January and 
July of 1992, according to Bailey's statement. And in one month, according to 
Bailey, McNall spent as much as $736,000 in personal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey described the situation as being "like a disaster," and added, "I mean, 
I didn't know where to start. . . . Well, that he was spending an incredible 
amount of money. The negative cash flow of the company was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Cash flow, in whatever direction, and general opulence were part and parcel of 
McNall's scene. At a party celebrating Gretzky's first 100 games with the 
Kings, a former Times reporter, Tracy Dodds, accidentally knocked over and 
broke a rare piece of art at McNall's art gallery in Century City. The price 
tag listed on the item was in excess of $200,000. Gretzky saw the incident and 
went pale. McNall laughed and cracked jokes about it.  
</P>
<P>
 Another time, McNall misplaced the 1956 World Series ring won by Mickey 
Mantle, valued at $250,000, leaving it on a stool in a TV studio. He eventually 
found the ring, but while it was missing, he acted more as if he had misplaced 
a soft drink. 
</P>
<P>
 His philosophy? 
</P>
<P>
 "Enjoy it while you have it," he told a Times reporter in October of 1991. "I 
have yet to see a Brink's truck following a hearse."

JOHNSON RETURNS FOR USC; TROJANS: HE WILL FACE FORMER TEAMMATE STENSTROM OF 
STANFORD FOR LAST TIME IN COLLEGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC's Trojans go up against their one-time ball boy today, hoping to keep Bill 
Walsh's team in the downward spiral that has generated an upward spiral of 
second-guessers and the first rumblings of discontent in Walsh's second 
Stanford era.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1945, Walsh was a 14-year-old ball boy for the football team at USC, scant 
blocks away from his home, at Vermont and Gage.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, Walsh is a 63-year-old professor emeritus of football, winner of 
three Super Bowls and coach of a Stanford team that is 1-3-1, not what Cardinal 
backers had in mind this year. 
</P>
<P>
 One Bay Area newspaper report this week referred to "the collapse" of the 
Stanford football program. 
</P>
<P>
 Another report had Walsh so despondent that he wasn't expected to finish out 
his five-year contract, that football was no longer fun for him.  
</P>
<P>
 "Football is still fun," Walsh said Thursday after practice, laughing.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed, we're struggling right now, but I'm still optimistic 
about our future here. The talent pool right now is as good as it's ever been 
at Stanford, but our players are very young and they're still learning how to 
make things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 USC, with a 3-2 record, wants to win two in a row for the first time this 
year. The Trojans won at Oregon State last Saturday, 27-19, after a 22-7 upset 
loss to Oregon.  
</P>
<P>
 Stanford has lost three in a row. The Cardinal scores plenty of points but has 
so far been unable to stop anyone.  
</P>
<P>
 Today's Stanford Stadium game is the final amateur Rob Johnson-Steve Stenstrom 
matchup. The two quarterbacks won't meet again until some distant Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Both played on the 1989 El Toro High team, Stenstrom the senior quarterback 
and Johnson the junior wide receiver. Four years later, Stenstrom leads the 
Pacific 10 in passing efficiency with a 148.70 rating. Johnson is fourth at 
138.30.  
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom has thrown eight touchdown passes and has a completion rate of 67%. 
Johnson -- in one fewer game -- has thrown for three touchdowns and is 
completing 68% of his passes.  
</P>
<P>
 This will be Johnson's first start in two weeks. He sat out last week's Oregon 
State game because of a sprained right ankle and was troubled by a sore back 
before that. Johnson will have some additional help today. Wide receiver Ed 
Hervey returns from a knee injury for the first time in four games. And 
tailback Leonard Green will play for the first time this season, Coach John 
Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Defensive back John Herpin, who suffered a shoulder injury early in the Oregon 
State game, is healed and will be at cornerback today.  
</P>
<P>
 One of Stanford's few reliable offensive players will be sidelined, Walsh 
said. Leading rusher Mike Mitchell, who was averaging 108 yards a game, has a 
sprained ankle and has sat out the last two games. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing Stanford does not need is another Walsh book. 
</P>
<P>
 His "Rough Magic," with Lowell Cohn, had some choice words for USC and Walsh 
has spent considerable time smoothing ruffled feathers. 
</P>
<P>
 Samples:  
</P>
<P>
 -- On USC alumni: "They all want to think they're from Hollywood. Look how 
they're dressed. Fifty-year-old women with miniskirts." 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Being a teacher, an educator, does have redeeming value . . . unless it's 
at USC." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Once, speaking to his wife while watching the movie "Quo Vadis:" "Look at 
that big gladiator with the sword and that funny-looking outfit . . . you know 
what that is, that's the USC band." USC TROJANS

SEEKING A NEW ROUTINE; BRUINS: OLD METHODS ARE DISCARDED AS UCLA TRIES TO END 
SLUMP AGAINST OREGON STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Monday, practice was late, after weightlifting, rather than the reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, things were normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, breaks were taken during drills with the offense, and Bjorn Merten 
trotted onto the field to kick field goals, as though drives had been stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, normally 12 practice periods of five minutes each in T-shirt and 
shorts, became 14 periods of six minutes each in shoulder pads that were 
expected to be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, instead of the usual light walk-through, there was a team meeting and 
no practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to break UCLA's routine tonight against Oregon State at the Rose 
Bowl. The Bruins, 2-4 and 0-3 in the Pacific 10, have lost four games in a row, 
and Coach Terry Donahue is trying anything -- everything -- to break the 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did a man say? If it ain't broke, don't fix it?" he said. "When it's 
broken, you've got to fix it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're in this type of situation, you want to, No. 1, have new hope. You 
want things to change and not have just the same old stuff. . . . It's a lot 
different when things are going right." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, when UCLA was on a seven-game winning streak in a Rose Bowl 
season, the practice routine was inviolate and Oregon State was a bump in the 
road to a showdown game against Arizona that had Pac-10 championship 
ramifications. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins nearly stumbled over the bump, winning in Corvallis, 20-17, when 
Merten -- who has kicked two field goals in his last eight attempts -- had two 
35-yard field goals in the fourth quarter. UCLA players acknowledged that they 
had Arizona on their minds and were glad to escape Oregon State with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, their minds are no farther away than the Rose Bowl tonight. 
Oregon State (1-4, 0-3) looks like Penn State when you have lost four in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona is the opponent next week, which might as well be next year if UCLA 
does not beat the Beavers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just trying to get a win," Donahue said. "Saturday night, we're 
approaching it that this is a big test for us, and we've got to pass the test. 
It'll be hard. They're a good team. They took SC all the way to the end, and 
we've got to make some plays Saturday night." 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State's 27-19 loss to USC last Saturday provided an example of the 
Beavers' problems. They led the Trojans in the second quarter, 13-2, fell 
behind, 27-13, then rallied behind freshman quarterback Tim Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State's hope for the future, Alexander, the high school player of the 
year in Florida last season, rushed for 117 yards, including a run to the USC 
four, on which he was knocked out of bounds and broke his collarbone. 
</P>
<P>
 Rahim Muhammad replaced Alexander and fumbled on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander is out for the season, and Oregon State's starter, Don Shanklin, who 
suffered a recurrence of a sprained foot against the Trojans, is expected back 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beavers run the wishbone offense, and Shanklin runs it well. He averages 
6.9 yards a carry and has even thrown the occasional pass, something Oregon 
State is not known for. The Beavers have thrown only 39 times all season, but 
Shanklin completed a 64-yarder to Cam Reynolds for their first touchdown 
against USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Oregon State has 318 yards passing in five games. It had only 311 yards all 
last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanklin and Alexander notwithstanding, the Beavers' offense is built around 
halfback J.J. Young, who is averaging 6.2 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning has been a big problem at Oregon State, which has beaten only Wyoming, 
44-31, and has lost three games in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some heart-wrenching losses, and we've been able to get to the 
point in a game where we've had two or three plays that, if we had made the 
play, we were going to be successful," Coach Jerry Pettibone said. "We've not 
been able to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither has UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 In the losing streak, UCLA has shown an alarming tendency to give points away 
with offensive mistakes. The Bruins have been outscored, 133-38, in their 
losing streak and five touchdowns have followed UCLA turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just got to move the ball and do some good things," Donahue said. "It's 
interesting in how all this is intertwined. We've got to give our defense some 
hope that the offense can score, so the defense doesn't get demoralized. What 
happens to you in football is that when people make big plays, you get juiced 
up, excited. None of that is happening for us." 
</P>
<P>
 It's another routine that UCLA is trying to change. UCLA BRUINS

SUPER SATURDAY; FIRE UP THE REMOTE CONTROL, IT'S A FOOTBALL BONANZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a day when marriages, couch cushions and TV remote controls will be 
tested like never before. A day created by a college football scheduling quirk 
that features nine key games involving 14 teams ranked in the top 25, many of 
them playing each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is there quantity, there's quality, the kind that will help determine 
which teams win what conference titles, which teams go to what bowls and which 
one finishes with a national championship. If you're a fan or a network 
executive, it is a day to give thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Presenting the matchups that matter: NO. 6 AUBURN AT NO. 1 FLORIDA 
</P>
<P>
 Why you should care: Auburn has the nation's longest consecutive winning 
streak, 17, and unbeaten Florida has more depth than a sinkhole. Both coaches 
-- Auburn's Terry Bowden and Florida's Steve Spurrier -- have egos that require 
tether lines, which adds to the dramatics. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing fact: The Tigers are 16-point underdogs. "I don't know if that's any 
more insulting than being a three-point favorite last week (Auburn beat 
Mississippi State, 42-18) or a one-point underdog last year against Georgia 
when we were 10-0 (Auburn won, 42-28)," says Bowden. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake: If Auburn, which is ineligible for postseason play, wants any chance 
at a national championship, it must finish 11-0, which would run the two-season 
streak to 22-0. A Gator victory would keep Florida atop the polls and out of a 
possible first-place tie with South Carolina in the Southeastern Conference 
Eastern Division. Florida can't win a national title unless it first wins the 
SEC championship. NO. 16 KANSAS STATE AT NO. 2 NEBRASKA 
</P>
<P>
 Why you should care: Kansas State, which was off-the-charts awful a few years 
ago, is one of the five surprise teams of the season. Meanwhile, Nebraska has 
lost so many quarterbacks that its coaches are scouting intramural flag 
football games. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing fact: For the first time since 1969, Nebraska might lose to Kansas 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake: A Big Eight Conference championship, two undefeated records and an 
Orange Bowl bid. NO. 3 PENN STATE AT NO. 5 MICHIGAN 
</P>
<P>
 Why you should care: Because the earth revolves around the Big Ten and the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing fact: Nobody has ever had the guts to tell Penn State Coach Joe 
Paterno that his pants are too short. He looks like a doofus on a clambake. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake: A rare chance at a Rose Bowl that really means something. NO. 22 
OKLAHOMA AT NO. 4 COLORADO 
</P>
<P>
 Why you should care: Because if Colorado's Rashaan Salaam keeps stacking up 
200-yard games, you might see a Heisman Trophy on his mantle and a national 
championship ring on his finger. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing fact: This is Colorado's fourth ranked opponent in five games. And the 
Buffaloes have Kansas State and Nebraska after this. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake: Well, Oklahoma Coach Gary Gibbs' job, for one. This was supposed to 
be his best team, but a loss to Colorado and a 3-3 record aren't going to help 
his employment status. Oklahoma hasn't won a league title since 1987. For 
Colorado, it's a chance to remain in the national championship hunt. BAYLOR AT 
NO. 7 TEXAS A&M 
</P>
<P>
 Why you should care: Uh. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Amazing fact: Texas A&M might be the best team you'll never see this year. The 
Aggies, in the first of a five-season NCAA probation, are ineligible for TV and 
postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake: Baylor's chance at a Southwest Conference championship and a Cotton 
Bowl bid. Beat the Aggies and Baylor doesn't have another truly difficult game 
until Nov. 24 against Texas. NO. 10 ALABAMA TENNESSEE 
</P>
<P>
 Why you should care: Because there's a chance the Crimson Tide might become 
the worst undefeated team in the history of college football. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing fact: Alabama's margin of victory against Division I-A opponents is 
7.2 points. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake: For the Crimson Tide, a chance at an unbeaten season. Alabama is 
comfortably ahead in the SEC's Western Division standings, so a loss doesn't 
significantly damage its SEC championship game hopes. NO. 14 ARIZONA AT NO. 20 
WASHINGTON STATE 
</P>
<P>
 Why you should care: With Washington on NCAA probation, somebody has to lose 
to Penn State or Michigan in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing fact: Washington State has yet to use its goal-line defense this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake: The granddaddy of them all. BRIGHAM YOUNG AT NO. 17 NOTRE DAME 
</P>
<P>
 Why you should care: Because NBC needs viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing fact: This is Notre Dame's worst ranking in 32 polls. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake: Forget the national championship; if the 4-2 Irish don't win four of 
their next five games, the bowl coalition might think twice about inviting them 
to one of the Big Four -- Orange, Cotton, Sugar or Fiesta. CLEMSON AT NO. 25 
DUKE 
</P>
<P>
 Why you should care: Duke normally begins the season 5-0 . . . in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing fact: If Clemson loses, it will mark the first time since 1975 that 
the Tigers have begun a season 2-4. Duke historians will note that the last 
time the Blue Devils were 5-0, which was 1988, they lost their next game -- to 
Clemson, 49-17. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake: An eventual medium-sized bowl bid for the Dookies, who are ranked 
for the first time since 1989. So Far, So Good 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeaten and untied major college football teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida: 5-0 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska: 6-0 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State: 5-0

BASEBALL: FORMER LABOR SECRETARY HAS A REPUTATION FOR GETTING RESULTS IN 
DIFFICULT SITUATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Negotiators for major league baseball players and owners said Friday that they 
welcomed the help of former Labor Secretary William J. Usery as a mediator in 
the bitter bargaining dispute, though neither side expressed confidence in a 
swift settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointment of Usery, former head of the Federal Mediation and 
Conciliation Service and a labor secretary in the Ford Administration, was 
announced at the White House by Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich. The selection 
marks the most significant effort to date by President Clinton to help settle 
the bitter strike, which began Aug. 12 and has wiped out the 1994 playoffs and 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no easy undertaking, but Bill Usery is no ordinary man," Reich said. 
"Bill Usery is truly the Mr. October of labor negotiations. . . . Baseball fans 
across the country want these two sides to reach an agreement. And with the 
addition of Secretary Usery, we've got a process in place to help make that 
happen. The rest is up to the players and the owners." 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations are expected to resume Tuesday in New York, but there was no 
display of optimism. Acting baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said the sides are 
willing to join Usery at the table, but he made it clear that the owners and 
players have hardly moved from their bargaining positions of two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had some discussions, but they've been very informal and I think 
that, relative to where we are now as opposed to where we were two months ago, 
it's safe to say that we're generally in the same areas," said Selig, who 
answered reporters' questions at the White House with Usery, Reich and baseball 
union chief Donald Fehr. "That's the very reason we need to come back in an 
organized and a structured way and resume conversations."  
</P>
<P>
 Said Fehr: "The negotiations need to resume, and we've been working toward 
that end. . . . I think it's safe to say we can use all the constructive help 
we can get." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, however, that Usery will need time to familiarize himself with the 
issues, and Usery agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a dispute that can't be resolved easily, nor quickly," Usery said. "In 
fact, what little bit that I do know about the things in the dispute, it will 
take considerable time and considerable effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Two months into the dispute, negotiations between the players and owners 
remain at an impasse over the owners' demand for a salary cap, the divisive 
issue that is now at the heart of labor disputes throughout professional 
sports. The baseball players' union believes the owners eventually plan to 
implement the cap unilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed curb on player salaries has also led to a management lockout in the 
NHL that has delayed the start of the season, and players in the NBA are 
pressing for removal of their league's salary cap. A new cap in the NFL has 
prompted turmoil and sparked deep resentment among players.  
</P>
<P>
 Reich noted that Usery was brought in only after the failure of earlier 
efforts at federal mediation. Reich added that the Administration turned to 
Usery after John Calhoun Wells, the current national director of the mediation 
service, contacted Reich and suggested that "the time was right to appoint a 
special mediator." Officials of the mediation service, led by Wells, joined the 
talks the day after the strike began but were unable to move the sides toward a 
settlement.  
</P>
<P>
 Usery may be tailor-made for the job of stepping in where others have failed. 
He is known for displaying a stubborn persistence and a willingness to endure 
marathon bargaining sessions -- sometimes lasting as long as 44 hours -- to 
close a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, he helped negotiate the first labor agreement between the 
United Auto Workers, General Motors and Toyota at the GM-Toyota joint venture 
assembly plant in Fremont, Calif. Last fall, he successfully mediated an end to 
a six-month coal operators' strike. And this is not his first foray into the 
world of sports labor relations. When football players struck for 44 days 
before the 1974 NFL season, Usery's mediation helped settle the dispute before 
the season began. 
</P>
<P>
 Reich suggested that cancellation of the season might have drained some of the 
acrimony and tension from the negotiations, enhancing chances for successful 
mediation, but Usery faces a situation that is complicated by other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Management lawyer Chuck O'Connor said Friday that the owners will decide next 
week whether to impose a 45-day freeze on contract signings. The union has 
indicated that it will not agree to the freeze request and would challenge 
unilateral imposition by the owners with a collusion grievance. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have also requested a delay in today's scheduled start of 
free-agent filing until Nov. 30, but agents contacting the union on Friday were 
told to begin filing their players today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're proceeding under the old rules," agent Alan Meersand said, adding that 
he will file on behalf of Dodger third baseman Tim Wallach today. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 170 players eligible for free agency. Those filing can talk to 
any club but can sign only with their own until Nov. 1.

 Pat Sullivan of the San Francisco Chronicle recalls the time senior golf tour 
player Walter Zembriski was doing odd jobs between appearances on the Florida 
mini-tours. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day at a posh club, two hotshots showed up looking for a game," Sullivan 
writes. "An astute club member suckered the wise guys. 
</P>
<P>
 "'I'll take that guy over there,' he said, pointing to Zembriski, who, at the 
time, was up on a ladder slinging a paintbrush. "Guess who won."

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; QUIET RULE COOKED UP TO REALLY LIMIT FIELD GOALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As the kicker slowly sinks beneath the NFL horizon -- along with good 
officiating and coaches who wear hats -- let us pause to remember what once 
made kickers so great. 
</P>
<P>
 "Preheat the oven to 250 degrees, bake for 10 minutes," said Gary Zauner, who 
coaches the Minnesota Vikings' special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Come again? 
</P>
<P>
 "OK, so maybe you don't need the oven," Zauner said. "So maybe you put it in 
the dryer with a towel." 
</P>
<P>
 Put what in the dryer? 
</P>
<P>
 "The football," Zauner said. "It's long been the secret of the kicking world." 
</P>
<P>
 What has? 
</P>
<P>
 "Working the football," Zauner said. "The reason that field goals are not as 
long this year, and the reason more are being missed, has nothing to do with 
the rules everybody is talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all about kickers no longer being allowed to work up the football." 
</P>
<P>
 According to interviews with players and league officials, Zauner is not 
kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't blame the lack of long and important field goals this season on the new 
rules. Those rules have simply reduced the number of attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason kickers are no longer heroes is that they are no longer allowed to 
cheat. 
</P>
<P>
 "That could be a reason," agreed Pete Stoyanovich of the Miami Dolphins. "I 
don't know if people are still tampering with the ball, but I know when they 
do, that makes a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoyanovich might have engaged the Raiders' Jeff Jaeger in a dramatic kicking 
duel when the teams meet Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 But if this week is like the season's previous six weeks, they will probably 
spend the most important parts of the afternoon staring into that silly 
sideline net. Here's the breakdown: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Of 22 field-goal attempts of 50 yards or longer, NFL kickers have connected 
on exactly one -- Kevin Butler's 50-yarder for the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season after six weeks, in eight fewer games, kickers were 23 for 39 in 
50-yard attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a 96% decrease. 
</P>
<P>
 John Carney of the San Diego Chargers kicked two field goals from 50-plus 
yards in his first game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There have been only two game-winning field goals in the final five seconds 
of regulation play this season -- by Carney against the Raiders and Matt Bahr 
of the New England Patriots against the Green Bay Packers. 
</P>
<P>
 After six weeks last season, there had been six game-winning kicks in the 
closing moments. 
</P>
<P>
 But those are merely numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The real story here can be found in the smell of burning pigskin. And the 
threat of burning money. 
</P>
<P>
 While publicly promoting the new rule that returns missed field-goal attempts 
to the point of the kick -- a seven- or eight-yard penalty -- the league has 
been quietly implementing a rule with greater impact. 
</P>
<P>
 NFL officials have sent a directive to all teams, threatening a $20,000 fine 
for tampering with the ball. The fine would not necessarily be charged against 
the kicker -- for some of these guys, that's just pedicure money -- but against 
working stiffs, such as the equipment managers. 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of liberally passing out the 24 game balls that each home team 
receives during the week before its games, equipment guys are hiding them. For 
many, the fine would amount to serious money. 
</P>
<P>
 And the kickers? 
</P>
<P>
 Their goal is to turn a slick, tightly-sewn ball into a softer, baggier one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only use new balls here, nothing tampered -- (Coach) Dennis Green would 
never allow that -- and you can tell that when you bring in guys for tryouts," 
said Zauner, a noted kicking coach who has run schools that have attracted most 
of the league's top kickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy who is tampering with the ball looks great on film, and then he comes 
here and loses five to seven yards a kick," Zauner said. "And they are a lot 
less accurate. It happens all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't believe him, just look at the record of kickers at the Metrodome 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 There not only has not been a touchback, but reliable kickers Fuad Reveiz, 
Jason Hanson and Stoyanovich are three for eight in field-goal attempts there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that new balls are not hit as well as balls that are broken in, that's 
a fact," Stoyanovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 What exactly can kickers do to a new ball? First it is inflated a bit beyond 
the league's official limit. The slick surface is then deadened with alcohol to 
make it more pliable. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball is then baked or heated in a dryer, causing it to expand further. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before game time, the ball is deflated to the maximum allowed weight so 
it appears to be regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "But after three or four days of work, after deflation the ball can actually 
be about an inch wider than normal," Zauner said. "And it's much, much softer." 
</P>
<P>
 So without that advantage, kickers will continue to disappear? 
</P>
<P>
 Not quite. Expect them to regain that edge as their bravado increases with 
each week. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that the new rule is nearly impossible to police, expect to see more 
balls sneaked into more laundry rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Or expect kickers to use a loophole in the edict that allows balls to be 
molded to the quarterback's liking. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Stoyanovich and Dan Marino have the same tastes, but. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times, quarterbacks do want balls the same way that kickers want 
them," Stoyanovich said. "Not that they talk about it or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 He was speaking during a phone interview, so it was impossible to tell if he 
said that with a smile. But something makes us think he did. GOLDEN TOE AWARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody else gives awards to kickers, so let us. 
</P>
<P>
 They are considered equal to about one-third of a regular player, so this 
point, one-third through the season, seems as good a time as any. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Right Award: To the only two kickers who have not missed a field-goal 
attempt, Eddie Murray of the Philadelphia Eagles and Steve Christie of the 
Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Murray hasn't tried anything longer than 41 yards. And Christie 
hasn't attempted anything longer than 45. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think part of the reason we are missing longer field goals is that guys are 
feeling the pressure of having the ball returned that extra distance if they 
miss," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Name: Chris Boniol of the Dallas Cowboys had to listen to Coach Barry 
Switzer mispronounce his name until the final week of training camp. For the 
record, it's Bone- yo. 
</P>
<P>
 Best Nickname: Michael (Como Esta) Husted of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Toughest Guy Award: Greg Davis of the Arizona Cardinals recently suffered a 
pulled hamstring. We didn't know kickers even had hamstrings. 
</P>
<P>
 Oldest Guy Award: Bahr of the Patriots is the only active player who played on 
the Pittsburgh Steelers' last championship team in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Phantom of the Hash Marks Award: After declaring Todd Peterson the winner of a 
seven-kicker tryout to replace Davis, Cardinal Coach Buddy Ryan announced that 
"Phillips" had finished second in the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 There was nobody named Phillips in the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Dummy Award: Gary Anderson of the Steelers turned down a four-year 
contract extension offer this summer that would have averaged $812,500 a year. 
Instead, he held out for a $1-million annual salary. 
</P>
<P>
 After Anderson missed all of training camp, the Steelers decided that a kicker 
probably wasn't worth all that money anyway. They rescinded their extension 
offer and he finally rejoined the team for his original $400,000 salary. EXPERT 
OPINION 
</P>
<P>
 In town for a charity function this week, original Cowboy Tom Landry showed 
there is still something left in his holster. 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview before he was honored by the players' union-sponsored 
Goals for Life education project, Landry was unusually candid. He said that: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Even though he lives in Dallas, he has attended only two Cowboy games since 
being dismissed in 1989 after serving as the only coach in the franchise's then 
29-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 -- He supported Switzer's recent trips to see his son play college football on 
the Saturday night before Cowboy home games. 
</P>
<P>
 These trips were condemned by former Cowboy coach Jimmy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any problem with what Barry did -- everybody overplays what 
happens with a football team on Saturdays," Landry said. "You go out, you warm 
up a little bit, then you go to your room and go to bed. I never missed a 
Saturday, but then, I never had a son playing football then." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Johnson's criticisms of Switzer, Landry said, "That is the difference 
between Barry and Jimmy. Jimmy has said that his family values aren't as 
strong." 
</P>
<P>
 -- He thinks Switzer is doing a good job, and, barring injuries, can do just 
what Johnson did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy was never a coach who coached, he was a motivator," Landry said. "Barry 
is doing the same thing. He has adjusted well to a difficult situation. They 
can win it all again, but injuries are the key." 
</P>
<P>
 -- He gets the feeling that the players like Switzer more than they did 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just from what I've read, you hear players saying that they feel like Barry 
really cares about them and respects them as people," Landry said. "They are 
saying it like Jimmy didn't respect them." 
</P>
<P>
 Landry now works for an investment company headed by his son. QUICK HITTERS 
</P>
<P>
 * THE WAY WE HEAR IT: Amid all the talk that the expansion Carolina Panthers 
will give their coaching job to the University of Miami's Dennis Erickson, we 
bring word of this dark horse: 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 Believe it or not, there is talk around the league that football's best active 
coach is tired of quietly sparring with football's best general manager, George 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves' New York Giants, who visit the Rams this weekend after two consecutive 
losses, have recently engaged in locker-room back-stabbing and finger-pointing 
while realizing that their young defense and quarterback Dave Brown might not 
be good enough to lead them to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves loves the South, and the idea of building another powerhouse as he did 
in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 * GO FIGURE: After averaging 46.6 points a game in the first week of the 
season, last week teams averaged nearly a touchdown less, at 34.7 points a 
game. That is even less than last season's mark of 37.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody seen that new no-chucking edict by defensive backs enforced lately? 
Who says the officials aren't embittered by the new labor agreement? 
</P>
<P>
 Some other observations: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Kansas City Chiefs, who play in Denver on Monday night, haven't won 
there since 1982. Their coach, Marty Schottenheimer, has yet to win there in 
seven tries. Monday is one day shy of the one-month anniversary of the Chiefs' 
last touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Indianapolis Colts have been outscored, 66-3, in the fourth quarters of 
games this year. They haven't scored a point in the final 10 minutes of any 
contest. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Running back Craig (Ironhead) Heyward said this about his Atlanta Falcons 
without Deion Sanders, who visits the Georgia Dome with the San Francisco 49ers 
on Sunday: "This is a new team. We got rid of some things. It's not a one-man 
show anymore like it used to be, when they'd go out and do this little 
prime-time thing." 
</P>
<P>
 How would Heyward know? This is his first year there. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On announcing that the Green Bay Packers will no longer play at Milwaukee's 
County Stadium, where they have appeared sporadically for the last 62 seasons, 
General Manager Ron Wolf said this of Lambeau Field: "I think we've got the 
best facility there is in the National Football League. You still get a chill 
when you go out there to play. I don't know if that's true when you go play in 
Milwaukee." He obviously has never been to Milwaukee in December. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Charlie Garner, who will play for the Philadelphia Eagles this week in 
their showdown with the Dallas Cowboys, despite a rib injury, has a chance to 
become the first rookie in NFL history to rush for 100 yards in each of his 
first three games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Since blowing a lead and losing to the Detroit Lions on a Monday night, the 
Cowboys have outscored their last two opponents, 72-10. They have scored on the 
first drive of each of their five games. 
</P>
<P>
 -- And the Rams and Arizona Cardinals are still the only teams in the league 
that have not scored 20 points in a game. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUR FAVORITE COACH: Twice this season, Bobby Ross has had to pay $5 for 
parking at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium after forgetting his pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sure did," Ross told reporters. "It was a lady and she didn't know who I 
was. And why would she have any reason to know who I am? I just paid and kept 
going, there was a line behind me." 
</P>
<P>
 * AND THE ANSWER IS, "THE COLTS, CARDINALS, CHIEFS AND JETS": What are the 
four teams that had cut cornerback Anthony Parker before he returned an 
interception 44 yards for a touchdown for the Minnesota Vikings Monday night in 
New York? 
</P>
<P>
 This former World League star, along with other unsung stars such as John 
Randle, Roy Barker, James Harris and Henry Thomas, is one reason the Vikings 
represent the NFC's best hope of stopping the Cowboys.

 After taking on the New York Giants on Sunday, Ram defensive tackle D'Marco 
Farr will shuck his uniform in a rush to get to the Anaheim Convention Center 
to see his idol, Hulk Hogan, take on Ric Flair in the World Championship 
Wrestling heavyweight title bout. 
</P>
<P>
 "Flair's an 11-time world champion, but a little small and I have to go with 
my idol anyway, the Hulkster," Farr said. "I met Hulk when I was 12 backstage 
at the Oakland Coliseum after he wrestled Brutus Beefcake. He's been a big part 
of my life; some kids have idols, and mine's been a wrestler." 
</P>
<P>
 Farr will start against the Giants in place of Sean Gilbert, the Rams' best 
defender. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my second time filling in for a big star," said Farr, who became the 
Pacific 10 defensive lineman of the year while playing at the University of 
Washington. "In college I stepped in for Steve Emtman. "I'll just keep the 
position warm for Sean until he gets back." 
</P>

 Steve Israel, who opened the season as a starting cornerback, has been plagued 
by tendinitis in his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried one form of treatment and it didn't work like we thought it would," 
Israel said. "Now we're working with something else. It's gotten better, but 
it's at a standstill. I played with it last year, but didn't have the constant 
fluid buildup. It's something that's stopping me from cutting, stopping and 
bursting." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel said he has been advised the knee does not require surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could get scoped, sit out a week and come back," Israel said. "I'm 
extremely disappointed, but what can I do?" 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox ruled Gilbert out of Sunday's game. Gilbert is suffering from 
an impingement of his left rotator cuff and tendinitis, which will require 
rest. He will be re-evaluated next week. . . . Safety Anthony Newman did not 
practice after injuring a finger Thursday, but Knox said he will start. T.J.

the season, but they will pay for the use of practice facilities and will not 
use club-owned dressing rooms.

<P>
 A spokesman for the NHL Players Assn. said the decision, made during a 
conference call among union representatives, should not be taken as a sign 
players are preparing to play. 
</P>
<P>
 No talks have been scheduled in the dispute, which is in its 15th day. NHL 
officials continue to call the work stoppage a postponement instead of a 
lockout, but that term might change today. The league had proposed delaying 
play until today if an agreement could be reached, but that was withdrawn and 
the start has been delayed indefinitely.

 Canuck Vice President George McPhee said players have a legal right to play 
elsewhere during the labor dispute, but the club will be unhappy if its top 
player risks injury and a lucrative future by joining a European team.

 Bure, who last spring signed a $24.5-million, five-year contract to stay with 
the Canucks, has received offers from teams in Germany and Switzerland.

GOLF ROUNDUP; PAVIN, FALDO, BALLESTEROS ARE HOT, BUT NO MATCH FOR WINNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former champions Corey Pavin, Nick Faldo and Seve Ballesteros shot magnificent 
rounds -- a combined 28 under par -- yet all three were beaten Friday in the 
second round of the World Match Play Championship at Virginia Water, England. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending champion Pavin, who carded two rounds of 67 on the par-72 West 
Course at Wentworth, missed a nine-foot putt for victory at the 36th hole 
before losing to Vijay Singh at the 37th. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballesteros made 14 birdies, but Ernie Els was hotter and won, 2 and 1, in a 
record-setting match that also ended the Spaniard's bid for a record sixth 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 Faldo, a two-time winner, had two eagles in rounds of 68 and 66, but lost to 
Colin Montgomerie by one hole. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that irritates me is that I had the match in my hands and I 
let it go," said Pavin, who blew four leads in his match with Singh. 
</P>
<P>
 Ballesteros, who carded 13 birdies to defeat David Frost, 8 and 7, in the 
first round, brought his two-day birdie total to 27. Ballesteros and Els halved 
five of their 35 holes with 2s, the most ever in a single match in the 
tournament's 31-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I say? I felt that I played very well," said Ballesteros, who 
received huge support from the crowd. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Bob Estes hit his target and in doing so, almost established a PGA record in 
the second round of the $1-million Texas Open at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Estes, who shot a 62 in the first round, shot a 65 at Oak Hills Country Club 
for a 36-hole total of 15-under par 127. That missed Tommy Bolt's record, set 
in the 1954 Virginia Beach Open, by a single stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Estes had set 65 as a target for himself to combat a possible letdown after 
his first round. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Tway was second at 67-130. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Price, winner of the PGA, the British Open and five tour titles this 
year, missed the cut at 72-140.

 Gibby Gilbert birdied four of the first six holes on the back nine to take a 
one-stroke lead after the first round of the $650,000 Senior Gold Rush 
tournament at Rancho Murieta Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert's five-under-par 67 leads Dave Eichelberger and Simon Hobday. Jim 
Albus, Tommy Aycock, Larry Gilbert, Bob Murphy, Terry Dill and Ben Smith are 
another stroke behind at 69.

 Elaine Crosby shot a course record 66 to move into a share of the second-round 
lead with Dottie Mochrie in the World Championship of Women's Golf at Naples,

Neumann, Val Skinner and Sherri Steinhauer are two back.

CLIPPER REPORT; SWINGMAN PIATKOWSKI SIGNS FIVE-YEAR CONTRACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One down, one to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska swingman Eric Piatkowski, the 15th player selected in the NBA draft, 
ended a weeklong holdout Friday, signing a five-year contract with the 
Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although terms weren't disclosed, the Clippers had offered him a multiyear 
deal worth $650,000 in the first season. Piatkowski was seeking a multiyear 
deal worth $1.1 million the first season. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Clippers can concentrate on signing Cal forward Lamond Murray, their 
No. 1 pick. Murray, the seventh player selected, is seeking a multiyear 
contract worth $2.4 million in the first season. However, the Clippers have 
offered him a multiyear deal worth $1.1 million in the first season. The 
Clippers are continuing to negotiate with Fred Slaughter, Murray's agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Piatkowski said he didn't get anxious as negotiations dragged on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a lot tougher on some of my friends and my parents than it was 
on me," Piatkowski said. "I've really been enjoying being here. I worked out 
two times a day and other than that I'd go out to the beach and see lots of new 
stuff out here in California. Sooner or later I knew it was going to come 
along." 
</P>
<P>
 Piatkowski, a 6-foot-7, 215-pounder, can play either small forward or shooting 
guard and probably will compete with Terry Dehere to replace guard Ron Harper, 
who signed with the Chicago Bulls last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Piatkowski missed the first week of camp, he doesn't expect any 
trouble catching up. He'll join the team Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'm in great basketball shape right now, but by the time the 
season starts I can guarantee that I'll be in great basketball shape," 
Piatkowski said. "That's one of the things that has always been easy for me, so 
I'm going to work very hard and I know that Coach (Bill) Fitch is going to work 
me hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Piatkowski has firsthand knowledge since his father, Walt, played for Fitch at 
Bowling Green. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers open the season in Yokohama, Japan, against the Portland Trail 
Blazers on Nov. 4 and also have two exhibition games in Mexico City later this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "They better play well while they're over there because we've been known to 
leave people on the road," Fitch joked. "You tell a guy (if he commits) three 
or four turnovers (that) you can't find (his) passport." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers opened the exhibition season in Orlando with a 105-82 loss to the 
Magic on Friday night. Harold Ellis scored 18 points for the Clippers, who shot 
15% from the field in the first quarter while missing 17 of 20 shots. The 
Clippers play the Atlanta Hawks at the Omni tonight before returning home to 
face the Lakers at The Pond Tuesday night at 7:30. A few remaining 
Clipper-Laker tickets, priced at $14 and $18, go on sale at 10 a.m. today at 
The Pond box office and all Ticketmaster outlets.

UNBEATEN ST. PAUL UPSETS NO. 5 LOYOLA, 10-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK STRODER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The heavyweight champion is still waiting in the wings. But now we know who 
the most dangerous contender might be. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Fe Springs St. Paul High knocked off highly touted Loyola, 10-2, Friday 
night in a Del Rey League football opener at St. Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swordsmen, seventh in The Times' Top 20 poll, can now set their sights on 
a Nov. 11 showdown with No. 1 Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
 Or can they? 
</P>
<P>
 "Bishop Amat? We can't even think about a team like that yet," St. Paul Coach 
Marijon Ancich said after his team improved to 6-0 overall, while dropping 
fifth-ranked Loyola to 4-1. "We'll send Cerritos Junior College over to play 
them on that day. Until then, we'll start by worrying about Crespi next week." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Paul had little to fret about against the Cubs. Using a ball-control 
offense, the Swordsmen had possession for most of the first half in building a 
10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The critical point of the game came early, when St. Paul mounted an 
eight-minute, 17-play drive that covered 80 yards on its first possession. 
Quarterback Gerry Ceballos scrambled in from 11 yards, giving his team a 7-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 What made it worse for Loyola and Coach Steve Grady was knowing that the Cubs 
committed two critical penalties to keep the drive going. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a couple of key mistakes on that first drive," Grady acknowledged. 
"(From that point) their defensive line dominated the game." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Paul boosted its lead to 10-0 in the second quarter after Andy Wilcox's 
32-yard field goal followed a Damon Tomeo recovery of a muffed punt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs scored with 3:21 remaining when Wilcox was tackled in the end zone 
recovering a high snap on a punt attempt.

WINNING MATCHES IS SECONDARY FOR TENNIS SHOWMAN BAHRAMI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRIS WYKES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tennis ball soared high above center court, taking with it the gaze of 
more than 1,000 spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 Below, Mansour Bahrami seemed to pay it only cursory attention as he moved 
into position. 
</P>
<P>
 He casually tugged at the side of his white shorts with one hand, and as the 
ball plummeted downward, caught it in his pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedlam in the bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't practice that at all," Bahrami said to skeptical reporters. "A ball 
boy threw a ball to me once and it went in there, so now I do it on purpose."  
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the Mansour Bahrami Show, now playing in conjunction with the 
Digital PC Champions tournament at the Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Bahrami, who has had a nomadic and often trying tennis career, was a late 
addition to the five-day event. The 38-year-old Iranian defeated Tim Gullikson 
on Thursday before falling to third-seeded Johan Kriek on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 10th stop on the over-35 Champions tour is headlined by 
co-founder Jimmy Connors and Swedish star Bjorn Borg, Bahrami, who played in 
the doubles quarterfinals Friday night, carved out an audience niche with his 
hustle and antics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love playing tennis but not because I'm earning money," said Bahrami, who 
speaks English and French as well as his native Persian. "If I lose in the 
early rounds at (Sherwood), I don't make any. I have tennis that is very 
different from others. Sometimes I see people in the stands who are crying from 
laughing. I love that."  
</P>
<P>
 Against Gullikson, Bahrami wowed the crowd by hitting a between-the-legs shot 
while running away from the net, leaping over Gullikson's errant serves, and 
undercutting several shots so severely that they dropped over the net and spun 
back toward his own side of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Bahrami won a point when he faked an overhead shot and, in the same 
motion, landed a fluttering backhand drop shot in front of Gullikson. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd never see that on the (ATP) tour, but I thought it was quite humorous," 
Gullikson said after Bahrami won the match in a third-set tiebreaker. "He's a 
character and not a bad tennis player either." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, it was Bahrami who didn't know what he was going to do next. As a 
young professional player and a member of Iran's Davis Cup team from 1975-78, 
he had a house, a car and the government's blessing to travel abroad. But the 
1978 revolution and the ascent of the Ayatollah Khomeini interrupted Bahrami's 
career. "Everything stopped, the clubs closed and there was no more tennis," he 
said. "They say it was a capitalist game." 
</P>
<P>
 So in the midst of revolutionary chaos, he played backgammon for more than 10 
hours a day and lived off his dwindling savings. 
</P>
<P>
 He finally was able to get a passport and visas for travel to Switzerland and 
France. Taking $2,000, the maximum allowed, Bahrami departed for Nice, France, 
in August of 1980. He arrived unable to speak French and found no one who would 
speak to him in either English or Persian. 
</P>
<P>
 He figured his money would last 10 days and saw little chance of finding a 
job. Spying a casino, he tried his luck at the blackjack table, but lost it all 
in half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Broke and unable to communicate, Bahrami had confirmed his return flight to 
Iran when he ran into an Iranian tennis acquaintance. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his friend's connections and the efforts of the French Tennis 
Federation, Bahrami was allowed to play in several small tournaments and gain 
part-time employment giving lessons at the Villepinte Tennis Club near Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 His tennis skills were undeniable, but the language barrier sometimes limited 
him to as little as one lesson a week, for which he charged $14. He often went 
without food, and paid $3 a night to sleep in the basement of a bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a bed, but (the basement) was so cold and humid I had to sleep with 
all my track suits on," he said. "But I want to try everything to stay in 
France so I accept not eating." 
</P>
<P>
 The Villepinte club helped Bahrami renew his visa every three weeks until 
March of 1981, but French authorities eventually told him to declare himself a 
political refugee or leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Refusing to label himself politically, Bahrami dodged police daily before 
surprisingly qualifying for the 1981 French Open. The fairy tale continued, as 
Bahrami upset Jean-Louis Haillet, a member of France's Davis Cup team, in his 
first match before losing to current Champions tour player Mel Purcell in the 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Through publicity generated by his appearance at Roland Garros, Bahrami was 
able to get a one-year green card and continue to play in France. He finally 
got a visa to travel abroad in 1986 and joined the ATP tour at 30, reaching the 
doubles final in the 1989 French Open with Eric Winogradsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Bahrami now plays nearly every week in exhibition matches with the likes of 
Boris Becker and Steffi Graf and on the ATP seniors' tour. He married a French 
woman, has two sons, and last year played in Iran's first Davis Cup matches in 
15 years, though he can bring himself to visit his homeland for only a week at 
a time as a result of the harsh political climate. Still, life is good for 
Bahrami, for whom entertaining is as good as winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always play this way, and it is an honor to play with Connors and all these 
guys," he said. "But I'm not always concentrating because I'm thinking about 
making people happy and I give away a lot of free points. If I play it straight 
with no fancy shots and I see people have no fun, it is a loss for me."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's matches, Bjorn Borg advanced to the semifinals by defeating Mel 
Purcell, 7-6 (7-3), 6-4; Johan Kriek defeated Bahrami, 7-5, 6-4, and Jose-Luis 
Clerc defeated Larry Stefanki, 6-2, 6-2. In doubles, Bahrami and Stefanki 
defeated Ross Case and Leif Shiras, 6-2, 6-4.

COMMENTARY; PARCELLS TRYING TO CREATE MORE MAGIC WITH PATRIOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They cheered Bill Parcells the other night, in the middle of Lawrence Taylor's 
night. The New York Giants retired Taylor's No. 56 Monday night, and he gave a 
terrific speech, because at the end he turned it into a conversation with the 
fans. "This is about me and you," he said. "We've always been in this 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 They went crazy for that part at Giants Stadium. But right before that, and 
before he left the stage, Taylor thanked Parcells. It was then that an 
explosion of noise, coming all the way down out of the lights, hit Taylor the 
way he hit quarterbacks. It made him smile. For that brief moment, he and 
Parcells were together at Giants Stadium, their two Super Bowl trophies with 
them, and it was still the best time the place will ever know. 
</P>
<P>
 Parcells will be at Giants Stadium on Sunday when the New England Patriots 
play the Jets, but he is with the visiting team now.  
</P>
<P>
 Parcells has been back one time with the Patriots, a Sunday night game last 
season when the Jets beat his young team, 45-7. He has not had a beating like 
it since. The Patriots always are in the game. It has taken Parcells only 22 
games to get everything going in the right direction. He has the best young 
quarterback in football in Drew Bledsoe. Parcells and Bledsoe will be in a 
Super Bowl before either the Giants or Jets will. 
</P>
<P>
 Parcells will still look all wrong on the visitors' sideline. He is Giants 
Stadium the way Charlie Conerly and Y.A. Tittle and Frank Gifford and Sam Huff 
were Yankee Stadium. Giants Stadium is as much his room as it was Taylor's 
room, or Phil Simms'. He was a Jersey guy himself and seemed to belong there. 
Parcells is the best coach the Giants have had, just as Simms is the best 
quarterback and Taylor the best player. That does not change because he left. 
It does not change because Giant General Manager George Young did not want him 
back two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're always going to have memories," Parcells said. "But those memories 
from the past are separate and distinct from what you feel in the present. The 
only thing that stays the same is coaching your team. In that case, the 
feelings are the same. You just try to get them ready to win the game. What I 
said about Lawrence once goes for me. I just want to know two things: Did we 
win? And when's the next game?" 
</P>
<P>
 He had eight years with the Giants, had an 85-52-1 record, won two Super 
Bowls. He left a few months after the second one, went to television, had two 
heart procedures, the second one a bypass operation in June 1992. He took the 
Patriot job last year and as soon as he did the Patriots were legitimate. They 
were on the board. Jimmy Johnson will do that somewhere when he coaches again. 
Joe Gibbs will do it if he coaches again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still not that good," Parcells said. But he has always said that in 
October, about all his teams, even the ones that ended up playing on the last 
Sunday in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The best coach the Giants have had now tries to take the Patriots to the Super 
Bowl. Parcells will do it before he finishes out his five-year contract with 
them, don't worry about that.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; TIE LEAVES ANAHEIM PLAYERS, FANS IN 
KNOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Allen Carter, Anaheim football coach, felt empty. Reuben Droughns, his 
standout tailback, was doubled over and teary eyed. The Colonists fans could 
only boo. 
</P>
<P>
 It was to be a defining moment for Anaheim Friday. All it got was a 15-15 tie 
against Valencia. They could have had much more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, after all, had won or shared 10 of the last 11 Orange League 
titles and won three Southern Section titles during that time. So Anaheim, once 
one of the top programs in Southern California, had a chance to reaffirm its 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the Colonists' fans were ready. Men wearing old lettermen jackets, 
dating as far back as the 1950s, dotted the crowd of 5,000 at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 And Droughns did his part, with 219 yards rushing and two touchdowns. On his 
strength, the Colonists (6-0-1, 0-0-1), ranked seventh in Orange County, took a 
15-7 lead into the final nine minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it all unraveled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, who fell to 1-4-1, 0-0-1, after forfeiting two victories and a tie 
earlier Friday, have dominated the league since 1983. And they showed why 
Friday night. They never panicked. 
</P>
<P>
 They got within striking range and then quarterback Joe Secoda put everything 
into one throw. The result was a 36-yard touchdown pass to Marc McGinnis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The play wasn't even suppose to go to Marc," Secoda said. "But I saw him 
break open and just heaved it." 
</P>
<P>
 Secoda then hit Jermaine Gray for a two-point conversion and a 15-15 tie with 
5 minutes 46 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams still had chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns was stopped for no gain on a third and one. Valencia was then stopped 
on three downs and punted. Time ran out with Anaheim on its own 35. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got the tie, I guess I'm happy with that," Valencia Coach Mike Marrujo 
said. "But we made too many mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why the Tigers should feel fortunate. The biggest snafu was Rhett 
Shepard's fumble on the second-half kickoff, which set up a 28-yard field goal 
by Tony Vasquez. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the Colonist offense was left to Droughns, running behind his 
bulky offensive line. He had 123 yards by halftime, including a 56-yard 
touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim had 242 total yards, all but 23 by Droughns. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the lack of support didn't hurt the Colonists as much as their kicking 
game. They missed both extra points because of bad snaps. Holder Travis Pena 
had a pass intercepted trying to improvise on one PAT. Vasquez's kick sailed 
wide on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia got most of its offense from Gray, who gained 133 yards rushing, 119 
in the first half. His 54-yard touchdown run and Secoda's conversion gave the 
Tigers a 7-6 halftime lead.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; MATER DEI RECOVERS TO BEAT TRABUCO 
HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mater Dei played a doubleheader Friday night at Trabuco Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the Monarchs, second-ranked in Orange County and No. 3 in the state, 
overcame their incessant fumbling and bumbling. Then, and only then, did they 
manage to defeat Trabuco Hills, 23-10, in the South Coast League opener. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a big victory for Mater Dei (6-0, 1-0 in league play), putting the 
Monarchs in good position to win the league championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills, making its South Coast League debut after moving from the 
Pacific Coast League this season, figured to be Mater Dei's toughest 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Mater Dei's most difficult opposition wore red-and-white uniforms and 
answered to the nickname Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 By halftime, Mater Dei hardly looked like one of the state's top teams and 
found itself tied, 10-10. Any flair the Monarchs might have shown in rolling 
through nonleague play undefeated was clearly absent in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Three fumbles certainly didn't help matters, contributing greatly to the tie 
and lifting Trabuco Hills' spirits. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Mater Dei straightened itself out, wearing down Trabuco Hills with 
a relentless rushing attack in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 After halftime, Mater Dei Coach Bruce Rollinson seemed determined to keep 
things simple. For the most part, he had quarterback John Flynn turn and give 
the ball to tailback Steve Bodnar. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked, and the Monarchs lost only one more fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn completed one crucial pass, a seven-yard toss to tight end Rod Fraser 
for what turned out to be the game-winning touchdown with 8 minutes 5 seconds 
left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodnar finished off Trabuco Hills (4-2, 0-1) with a 14-yard touchdown run with 
3:13 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 After gaining 47 yards in nine carries in the first half, Bodnar finished with 
152 yards in 26 carries. Fullback Joey Trampush added 103 yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills, so strong offensively in the first half, managed little in the 
second half. A 58-yard touchdown pass play from quarterback J.C. Pintsak to 
Laquent Fobbs in the first quarter caught Mater Dei's secondary by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Fobbs slipped into the clear, caught Pintsak's pass on the run, then sprinted 
alone down the sideline for the score. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, the Monarchs made sure that didn't happen again, covering 
Fobbs with two defenders most of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 He still finished with six receptions for 125 yards, but never had much 
running room once he caught his passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Pintsak nor Chad Collins, who relieved at quarterback in the fourth 
quarter, could rally the Mustangs after halftime, and Mater Dei survived the 
upset bid.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; ESPERANZA SWEATS ITS 26-16 VICTORY OVER 
FEISTY EDISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the surface, Esperanza's 26-16 Sunset League victory over third-ranked 
Edison appeared to be a routine one for the Aztecs, ranked fourth in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 But the game was not secure until the Chargers failed to connect on a pass for 
a two-point conversion, which would have cut the deficit to eight, with 40 
seconds remaining, and Esperanza recovered the ensuing onside kick attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for a few kind bounces and a 190-yard, two-touchdown rushing 
performance from running back Dahrin Footman, the Aztecs (4-2, 1-0 in league) 
could have been staring at a .500 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison's defense made Esperanza sweat, and the Chargers trailed, 10-3, at 
halftime. The Charger defense intercepted two passes and forced four fumbles in 
the game. But Edison recovered none of those fumbles and couldn't come up with 
enough big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Edison quarterback Patrick Markovsky completed 23 of 44 passes for 
261 yards and a touchdown and wide receiver Andy Linnen caught 13 passes for 
134 yards, the Chargers couldn't put enough points on the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need a little luck to win these games," Edison Coach Dave White said. "We 
didn't capitalize on offense and left our defense out there too long. The 
defense played a great first half, except for that one play." 
</P>
<P>
 That one play came late in the second quarter after the teams had exchanged 
field goals in the first 22 minutes of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1 minute 35 seconds remaining in the second quarter, Esperanza pulled out 
a trick play and it paid off, big time. Wide receiver Brian Forth took a 
handoff on a reverse from Footman, then pulled up and passed to a wide-open 
Ryan Wilkins for a 55-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Florence's conversion gave Esperanza a 10-3 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Footman and the Esperanza defense took center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman had runs of 38 and 39 yards in the second half, scored touchdowns on 
runs of one and 27 yards, and finished with 26 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't give a guy like Footman that many chances," White said. "He'll 
eventually burn you." 
</P>
<P>
 After shutting down Edison's running attack, Esperanza dared the Chargers to 
pass. The result was two sacks and three interceptions while the Chargers tried 
to stay in the game with a one-dimensional offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza limited Edison to six yards rushing in 19 carries. Bradley Lisotto, 
who averaged 145 yards rushing in the Chargers' first five games, finished with 
13 yards in 13 carries. He did score on a one-yard touchdown run and caught a 
16-yard touchdown pass from Markovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense made the big plays tonight," Esperanza Coach Gary Meek said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Edison couldn't.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; RANCHO ALAMITOS STILL UNDEFEATED IN 
LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos is beginning to make a mockery of the preseason. The Vaqueros 
lost two of their first three games for the second consecutive year, and for 
the second year in a row they are finishing mighty fast. 
</P>
<P>
 They steamrolled fifth-ranked Los Amigos, 28-9, Friday night in front of 2,200 
at Bolsa Grande High, and moved into the driver's seat in the Garden Grove 
League. Rancho Alamitos improved to 4-2, 3-0, while Los Amigos fell to 5-1, 
1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Chris Young did much of the damage, rushing for 212 yards and a 
touchdown in 29 carries. But Young had plenty of help from his offensive line 
and an inspired Rancho Alamitos defense that held Los Amigos running back Greg 
Fausto to 91 yards in 22 carries. Fausto had been averaging more than 10 yards 
per carry. 
</P>
<P>
 "People blame it on the kids, but maybe I'm just a slow-starting coach," 
Rancho Alamitos Coach Doug Case said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros didn't start slow Friday however, as Young burst around left end 
on the game's second play and sprinted 87 yards down the sideline for a 
touchdown. On the run, Young broke three tackles at the line and spun out of 
another at his 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos kept it mostly on the ground, but when it decided to throw, it 
was usually successful. Quarterback John Frank found wide receiver Jeff Turbarg 
wide open on a hitch-and-go pass from 32 yards out to give the Vaqueros a 14-0 
lead after a quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Amigos took the ensuing kickoff 70 yards in six plays for its only 
touchdown drive of the night, helped along by two late-hit penalties on Rancho 
Alamitos that resulted in 24 yards. Fausto capped the drive on a one-yard 
plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Vaqueros, aided by an interception by Turbarg and 35-yard return, 
scored again seven seconds before the half on a one-yard sneak by Frank. The 
Lobos' only serious threat of the second half led to a 24-yard field goal by 
Warren Roberge. 
</P>
<P>
 Young and Rancho Alamitos' offensive line controlled the ball and the clock 
for most of the second half. An dazed and exhausted Young finally came out of 
the game with five minutes left and his team comfortably ahead, 21-9. 
</P>
<P>
 "He left it out there on the field," Case said. "That's the kind of effort 
that wins championships. He's just a super kid. He transferred from Edison, but 
he's fit right in." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, who also played most of the way at safety, was supposed to have some 
help carrying the ball, but starter Kevin Allen's sore right ankle lasted only 
one play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The line was really opening some big holes," Young said. "A lot of people 
were doubting us, but we're really coming together. Everything was working. It 
was great to see."

SOUTHLAND ROUNDUP; FULLER EAGER TO REPEAT PEPPERDINE EXPERIENCE

<P>
 Tony Fuller will find himself in familiar surroundings this morning when he 
conducts his first practice as Pepperdine's basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like deja vu, " said Fuller, a former player and assistant at 
Pepperdine who was hired in April to replace Tom Asbury after Asbury moved to 
Kansas State. "Sometimes, I feel like I've never left." 
</P>
<P>
 Fuller, whose record in two seasons at San Diego State was 20-37, inherits a 
program that has ranked among the most successful on the West Coast during the 
last 16 seasons, making eight NCAA tournament appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my mission to try to keep it going," said Fuller, who has only one 
returning starter from last season's NCAA tournament team. "I'm real excited 
about finally getting started." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cal State Fullerton was scheduled to open practice at 12:01 a.m. today 
under interim Coach Bob Hawking, who replaced Brad Holland only three weeks ago 
when Holland left for the University of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cal State Northridge, preparing for its fifth season in Division I and its 
24th under Coach Pete Cassidy, also scheduled its first practice for 12:01 a.m. 
 
</P>
<P>
 -- Long Beach State Coach Seth Greenberg welcomes back three starters, among 
them guard James Cotton, last season's Big West Conference freshman of the 
year, and forward Mike Atkinson, who averaged 15.4 points last season and led 
the nation with a .695 shooting percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rod Baker, UC Irvine coach, also has three returning starters, including 
guard Chris Brown, who averaged 17.4 points last season and was named co-most 
valuable player in the Big West tournament after leading the 10th-seeded 
Anteaters to the final. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At Loyola Marymount, Coach John Olive's four returning starters include 
All-West Coast Conference forward Wyking Jones, who averaged 19.7 points and 
eight rebounds, and Jim Williamson, last season's WCC freshman of the year.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SCORECARD: COUNTY HIGHLIGHTS FROM WEEK 
6; VALENCIA FORFEITS THREE GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Valencia High's football team forfeited two victories and a tie after school 
officials discovered a fifth-year senior on the Tiger roster. 
</P>
<P>
 The player, transferred to Valencia 2 1/2 years ago, when school officials 
believed him to be a sophomore. He was held out of the Tigers' 18-6 victory 
last week against Sunny Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill McCracken, boys' athletic director, informed the Southern Section and the 
schools involved of the rule infraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park, which played Valencia to a 0-0 tie to open the season, improves 
from 4-1-1 to 5-1. Servite had its 17-13 defeat erased and stood at 3-2 
entering Friday's game against Tustin. El Dorado's 28-24 defeat is now changed 
to a victory, and the Hawks were 2-3 before their game Friday against Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia, which tied Anaheim, 15-15, Friday, is 1-4-1 overall, 0-0-1 in the 
Orange League. ABOUT FACE 
</P>
<P>
 In the first half of Esperanza's 26-16 victory over Edison Friday, Aztec wide 
receiver Brian Forth took a handoff from running back Dahrin Footman on a 
reverse play, but Forth pulled up and passed the ball to Ryan Wilkins for a 
55-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The play made Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes grin. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes and his Griffin football staff, who watched the game from the Esperanza 
side of the stadium at Orange Coast College, pulled the same trickery on Marina 
one night earlier when wide receiver Stan Guyness took a handoff on a reverse 
then passed to Tony Hartley for a 39-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 It must be an old Empire League play. ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy they have a lot of guys. It's tough thinking up 100 different ways to 
say, 'Nice game.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- Matt Thompson, Marina tight end, after congratulating Los Alamitos players 
during the traditional handshake ceremonies Thursday. LOOKING AHEAD 
</P>
<P>
 Getting down to the nitty-gritty in the second week of league play, the Orange 
League offers a couple of classic matchups featuring strong defenses against 
formidable offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 An impressive Brea-Olinda team will get a look at Reuben Droughns and Anaheim 
at Glover Stadium. If that isn't enough, the explosive Savanna offense should 
get a test against a stingy Valencia defense. The game is at Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 But the night's best matchup is at Orange Coast College, where top-ranked Los 
Alamitos should get a decent workout from third-ranked Edison. At stake in the 
Sunset League contest will be the Griffins' 41-game unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Two cross-town rivalries continue Friday night in key Sea View League games. 
Woodbridge and Irvine play at Irvine, and Corona del Mar plays at Newport 
Harbor. FIT TO BE TIED 
</P>
<P>
 How much does Anaheim Coach Allen Carter hate ties in football games? 
</P>
<P>
 "They outmanned us tonight and that's why we lost," Carter said Friday after 
the Colonists' game against Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, Coach, it was a 15-15 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh. That must have been my Freudian showing through." NEXT IN LINE 
</P>
<P>
 Before Adam Roman's 40-yard punt return for a touchdown Friday against Aliso 
Niguel, Laguna Hills had gone the equivalent of two full seasons without one. 
It was Roman, then a Hawk sophomore, who last performed the feat. 
</P>
<P>
 With teammate Brendan McGraw having a spectacular year running the ball, 
opportunities for the 5-foot-7 Roman to get his hands on the ball have been few 
and far between. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brendan is our whole offense but I don't mind taking a back seat as long as I 
can keep doing this," said Roman, who totaled 70 yards on the three returns. 
SOMETHING MISSING 
</P>
<P>
 There was a little bit of everything missing from the kicking game in Friday's 
15-15 tie between Brea-Olinda and Western. A narrowly missed 62-yard field goal 
by Western; two missed extra-point attempts by Brea; a missed on-sides recovery 
by Brea, and finally, a missing tee on a field goal attempt that resulted in a 
timeout taken by the Wildcats. HOW TOP 10 FARED

 Brotherly, ridden by Eddie Garcia, defeated Refrigerator by a half-length to 
win the $100,000 Los Alamitos Championship Invitational on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Charles-Treece trained Brotherly raced 440 yards in 21.57 seconds and paid 
$10.20 as the second choice in the wagering. 
</P>
<P>
 The gelding, owned by the partnership of Barham, Shannon and Loeb, also earned 
a berth in the Champion of Champions, in which he might again face 
Refrigerator, on Dec. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 By finishing second, Refrigerator became quarter horse racing's first 
$2-million winner with earnings of $2,006,867.

<P>
 The 6-year-old world champion, who won the past two runnings of the Los 
Alamitos Championship, bumped with Avison at the start of Friday night's race.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; THESE FOUR SOUTHLAND FIGHTERS REMAIN ONLY THE TALK OF 
TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Among the soap operas making the boxing world churn, the Los Angeles area has 
one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Oscar De La Hoya, Genaro Hernandez and the Ruelas brothers -- four 
junior-lightweight and lightweight champions in their prime -- ever find common 
ground and start fighting one another? 
</P>
<P>
 Or will all the posturing and challenging and tension-filled handshakes fizzle 
into nothing? 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya has twice all but committed to fight Hernandez, but the deals 
collapsed. Now, promoters are talking about putting De La Hoya against 
Hernandez as early as January. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in the big one, De La Hoya and Rafael Ruelas are being guided toward what 
might be the most-anticipated fight between L.A. fighters in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hernandez and Gabriel Ruelas seem like natural opponents, if the 
timing and money are right. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of talk. Will it all pan out? 
</P>
<P>
 "For any of us to make the big money, we're going to have to fight each 
other," said Hernandez's trainer and brother, Rudy Hernandez. "Look in the 
top-10 rankings at lightweight and junior-lightweight, and we're all about the 
best there is." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya, of Montebello, the only one without a major world title, is the 
youngest, most famous, probably the most talented, and definitely the most 
controversial of the four. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, the long-running World Boxing Assn. junior-lightweight champion 
from Mission Viejo by way of South Central L.A., is, at 28, the oldest, the 
only one of the four not promoted by Top Rank, Inc., the least recognized and 
most eager to get himself involved in a round of high-interest grudge matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Ruelas, the International Boxing Federation lightweight champion, and 
his brother, Gabriel, the World Boxing Council junior-lightweight titlist, are 
from Sylmar. They are two of the most exciting fighters in the world and don't 
seem overeager to rush into anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should all be fighting each other," said Bob Arum, who will have a major 
say in the process as the promoter of De La Hoya and the Ruelas brothers. 
"There are too many damn champions." 
</P>
<P>
 The key to everything is De La Hoya. He has the big HBO deal, and he has the 
ability to command big purses. The last time Hernandez and De La Hoya were 
about to fight, Hernandez had agreed to accept $500,000 -- almost five times 
the largest purse he has ever fought for. 
</P>
<P>
 But with two more fights against middling opposition lined up for this year -- 
Carl Griffith on Nov.18 and John Avila on Dec. 10 -- De La Hoya, coming up on 
his 22nd birthday, has acknowledged that he is feeling the pressure to start 
living up to his big-dollar promise and begin fighting world-class opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Arum says he wants De La Hoya to fight either former WBC junior-lightweight 
champion Azumah Nelson or Hernandez in January, then set up for the Ruelas 
bout, possibly near the Cinco de Mayo (May 5) Mexican holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to start fighting huge fights in early 1995," De La Hoya said. "I want 
to keep fighting huge fights, on HBO or CBS. I think I have the talent 
necessary to beat these guys. That's the way I think. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best division out there. This is like a heavyweight division. All 
these fighters want to fight me. If they want to do that, let them wait, right 
now. It's a long line." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be a long line especially as long as De La Hoya looks vulnerable. He 
dominated Jorge Paez last July in his debut at 135 pounds, but some observers 
say that the tough Paez of the past never showed up against De La Hoya, that 
Paez was looking for a soft place to fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm involved, I want to fight De La Hoya, obviously," said promoter Dan 
Duva, who represents John John Molina, IBF junior-lightweight champion and a 
potential opponent for all four. "He's the easiest fight and you'd get the most 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "De La Hoya can't fight. He's a figment of people's imagination. Right now, 
(Rafael) Ruelas would knock him out." 
</P>
<P>
 Right now, Rafael Ruelas is content to think about his title defense in Hong 
Kong next Saturday against Britain's Billy Schwer, then a joint defense with 
his brother, in either Las Vegas or the Grand Olympic Auditorium, on the 
weekend of the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya and the Ruelases have exchanged some tense greetings at the Big 
Bear gym where they train, and lately De La Hoya has been eager to talk about 
and try to line up a bout against Rafael Ruelas. 
</P>
<P>
 "If De La Hoya could put together a number of credible wins, aside from the 
Paez win -- and some dispute that as a credible win -- I think the amount of 
money they both could make would supersede what he and Rafael could make at 
this very moment or within the next two or three months," said Joe Goossen, who 
trains the Ruelas brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Arum suggested that a Hernandez-Gabriel Ruelas 130-pound unification 
title bout might be a perfect undercard fight for De La Hoya-Rafael Ruelas, and 
although he is talking about a possible De La Hoya-Hernandez bout in early 
1995, Hernandez, as always, is a sticky topic. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, at 5 feet 11, is a giant in the 130-pound class, fights a 
difficult, long-armed style, and, because of constant hand problems that have 
sidelined him for long periods, has never been able to demand large purses. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a six-month break to undergo surgery on his right hand and a 
months-long delay waiting for Don King to put the card together, Hernandez is 
to defend his title Nov. 12 on the Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez-Michael 
Carbajal card in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who is promoted locally by the Forum, and his brother have gotten 
so frustrated with his low profile that they recently crashed a De La Hoya news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Genaro Hernandez, he's the guy I'd least like to fight," Duva said. "He's 
experienced and, unfortunately, you could make the least amount of money 
fighting him." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Joe Goossen: "I'd like for Gabriel to take a Hernandez fight when he has 
to, when the time is right. Gabriel just signed a contract with Top Rank, and 
I'm sure they've got certain things in mind for him. And I don't think the 
first fight they have in mind for him is Genaro Hernandez, nor the second, nor 
the third, nor the fourth, Possibly, the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 "But to just announce Genaro and Gabriel tomorrow, I think, would be kind of 
self-defeating for both guys." 
</P>
<P>
 So Genaro Hernandez waits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, Oscar's not even the talk anymore," Rudy Hernandez said. "Everybody we 
meet is talking about Gabe Ruelas. I like the De La Hoya fight more because 
we're in it for the money and there's nobody else out there who can make that 
kind of money, other than De La Hoya. But whichever one comes first, we'll be 
ready." 
</P>
<P>
 If ever it comes. Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Recently deposed World Boxing Council heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis at 
last is taking the advice of everybody around him and is looking for a new 
trainer -- with George Benton, former co-trainer for Evander Holyfield and 
Michael Moorer, the leading contender to get the job. Lewis is apparently 
considering hiring Benton but not Benton's partner, Lou Duva. Lewis fired Pepe 
Correa, widely criticized for failing to alter Lewis' lumbering style, after 
Lewis was knocked out by Oliver McCall. 
</P>
<P>
 There are ominous rumbles coming out of Hong Kong as next Saturday's card 
comes into view. Last week, the manager of Herbie Hide and Stephen Collins, two 
of the featured fighters, complained that checks from lead promoter John Daly 
were bouncing. This week, the check for the hotel in Hong Kong bounced, and 
co-promoter Top Rank, Inc., apparently had to jump in with more money than Bob 
Arum had planned to keep the card from falling apart. The headline bout is 
Hide, the World Boxing Organization heavyweight champion, against Tommy 
Morrison and top undercard fights include Frank Bruno-Ray Mercer and Rafael 
Ruelas-Billy Schwer. 
</P>
<P>
 Would Genaro Hernandez, who is to fight on Don King's card Nov. 12 in Mexico 
City because King won the purse bid for the bout, ever consider becoming one of 
King's fighters? "They asked us about it," said Rudy Hernandez, Genaro's 
brother and trainer. "But, I don't think so. He has so many fighters and 
they're all locked up and they all are sitting around waiting for him to get 
them fights. If anybody, he can make Genaro a superstar, I know, because King 
has the connections. But there's the controversial thing. Plus, he doesn't get 
along with Bob Arum, doesn't do fights with Bob Arum, and Bob Arum has the 
three other fighters in the division we want to fight. So I don't think that's 
to our interest. We want to keep those doors open."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL 1994-95; USC; RAVELING'S ABSENCE IS EARLY HURDLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the last eight years, USC basketball Coach George Raveling could be 
counted on to arrive first at the Trojans' first practice at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 He was always there to greet his team with a basketball and a generous dose of 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't the case today, though, when the Trojans hit the floor of the 
North gym on campus. Raveling wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of injuries he suffered in auto accident on Sept. 25, Raveling 
couldn't be at the start of fall practice for the first time in his 22 years as 
a college coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really an unfortunate situation," said Charlie Parker, who along with 
fellow assistants Jack Fertig and Adrian Walters will direct the team until 
Raveling's return. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we feel that we're well prepared. The one thing Raveling has taught us is 
to always expect the unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpected happened when Raveling suffered nine broken ribs, a broken 
pelvis and collarbone and a collapsed lung in a traffic accident when he was on 
his way to a breakfast meeting with recruits and his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, 57, has been in USC University Hospital since the accident. He was 
released from intensive care on Wednesday but is not expected to be released 
from the hospital for at least another week. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we're concerned, this is still Coach Raveling's team," said Parker, 
who has been an assistant to Raveling for seven seasons. "Raveling is so 
committed to the program that the minute he arrived in the emergency room 
following the accident, he had someone call us to tell us that he wouldn't be 
(at the breakfast). 
</P>
<P>
 "Since he's been in the hospital, while he was in intensive care, he's even 
tried to call recruits. It's just amazing how focused he's been with the team 
since the accident. The thing that we all fear is that he may try to come back 
too early. But he's that type of person." 
</P>
<P>
 With a tough nonconference schedule that includes New Mexico State, Temple and 
Utah -- teams picked to finish first or second in their conferences -- USC 
already had its work cut out after a 16-12 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Four starters return from last season's team, which finished seventh in the 
Pacific 10 with a 9-9 record and lost to Fresno State in the first round of the 
National Invitation Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Lorenzo Orr, an All-Pac-10 forward, averaged 13.4 points and 6.6 
rebounds last season. Senior forward Tremayne Anchrum averaged 6.3 rebounds. 
Junior point guard Burt Harris, a three-year starter who averaged 10 points 
last season, has recovered from a broken foot he suffered during the spring. 
Junior Brandon Martin, who averaged 12.4 points, will be USC's top outside 
scoring threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore forward Jaha Wilson, who started seven games as a freshman, and 
guard Claude Green are expected to battle for playing time. Freshman guard 
Cameron Murray, younger brother of former UCLA standout Tracy, and junior 
college transfer Tyson Reuter will give the Trojans added outside shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news for USC is that Avondre Jones, a 6-foot-11 former prep 
All-American, has transferred to a junior college after hardly playing as a 
freshman last season, and sophomore Stais Boseman, who led the team in steals a 
year ago, will not join the team until late December because of academic 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without (Raveling) being there, the key for the team is to stay strong 
mentally," Martin said. "It will be different, but the team has the same 
respect for the other coaches as we do for Coach Raveling." 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans have one advantage. They were able to play together during a 
15-day trip to Asia in August, playing against experienced teams from Hong 
Kong, Taipei, Taiwan and Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 "That trip really has helped us," Parker said. "We were able to do a great 
deal of coaching on that trip and the kids got a lot of playing in. I don't 
think (starting without Raveling) will affect the team too much because no one 
has lost a game yet, the enthusiasm is still there."

 Delonne Kelly scored two second-half touchdowns to lead El Dorado to a 20-16 
victory over Cypress in a Empire League opener Friday night at Valencia High. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress led 10-0, late in the first half.Quarterback Mike Marzicola completed 
a five-yard touchdown pass to Mike Golebiowski with three seconds remaining in 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly, who rushed for 68 yards in 15 carries put El Dorado (3-3, 1-0) in the 
lead for good on a 13-yard touchdown run with 8 minutes 15 seconds left in the 
third quarter. Kelly added to the Golden Hawk lead with a four-yard scoring run 
with 7:37 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 20-10, Cypress used a 90-yard kickoff return touchdown by Greg Cleave 
to cut the Golden Hawk lead to four points. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress (2-4, 0-1) took a 3-0 lead with eight minutes left in the first half 
on a 32-yard field goal by Bryan Huskey. A fumble by Kelly was recovered by the 
Centurions' Bobby Brito at the El Dorado 34 on the final play of the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Brito broke up a pass attempt by the Golden Hawks on fourth down. Cypress took 
over on its 40-yard line. Brito proceeded to elude two El Dorado pass defenders 
and race into the end zone with a 60-yard pass completion from David Wheeler.

<P>
 Kennedy's rushing offense took complete control and ran over visiting Katella, 
27-7, in an Empire League opener at Western High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fighting Irish running game, led by Charlie Marino's 128 yards in 20 
carries, had 287 rushing yards to Katella's 98. 
</P>
<P>
 The running trio of Marino, fullback Darin Martineau (79 yards, 12 carries) 
and quarterback Jason Myles (71 yards, seven carries) were the only offensive 
weapons Kennedy (5-1, 1-0) needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish jumped to a 6-0 lead on their opening drive. Martineau ran in from 
one yard to complete an 11-play, 64-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 10-play drive stalled for Katella (0-6, 0-1), Kennedy answered with a 
12-play, 84-yard drive that took nearly five minutes. A one-yard touchdown run 
by Marino made it 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy did have some success in the air. Myles completed nine of 11 passes 
for 79 yards, including a five-yard touchdown pass to Martineau. Marino ran in 
for the two-point conversion, making the score 20-0 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless third quarter, Kennedy made it 27-0 with a 28-yard touchdown 
run my Marino, his longest run of the game, on the first play of the fourth 
quarter. Kennedy kept it on the ground for the entire second half, attempting 
no passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Katella managed to get on the board in the fourth, sustaining a long drive of 
its own. Dan Schmidt capped a 14-play, 80-yard drive with a one-yard touchdown 
run, to make it 27-7. 
</P>
<P>
 It was too late for the Knights, who managed only 72 total yards in the first 
half to Kennedy's 252. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy entered the game ranked sixth in the Division V polls and stretched 
its streak of consecutive league victories to 12. TONY ALTOBELLI

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; CANYON HAS LAST-MINUTE MAGIC AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second week in a row, Canyon pulled off a victory on its last 
offensive play of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday night's Century League opener, the Comanches beat Santa Ana Valley, 
21-17, when Adam Hoover scored on a three-yard run with 11 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Hoover guided Canyon on a 51-yard drive in the final minute of 
play, matching the heroics of Clay Kilbarger, whose 46-yard field goal as time 
ran out beat Corona, 6-3, last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my call," Hoover said of the game-winning play. "We had run the 
quarterback sneak before and I knew the linemen could get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
 The situation looked dismal for Canyon when the Falcons blocked Kilbarger's 
16-yard field goal attempt with 3:00 remaining, but the Comanches defense 
stopped the Falcons on their next possession and got the ball back for a final 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover finished the game completing 18 of 26 passes for 232 yards. The 
county's leading receiver, Greg Jacobs, caught ten passes for a game-high 118 
yards for Canyon (5-1, 1-0). Jacobs also had an interception late in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwayne Cherrington, who rushed for 107 yards in 25 carries, scored on the 
Falcons' opening drive with a nine-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome may have been different for the Falcons (2-4, 0-1), but a clipping 
penalty negated a 44-yard interception return for a touchdown by Kyle Marks in 
the second quarter. MATT FARMER

 David Bell's 62-yard field goal attempt with three seconds left in the game 
was long enough, but it sailed three feet wide and Western had to settle for a 
15-15 tie with Brea-Olinda in an Orange League opener Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell, who would have broken Phil Nevin's six-year-old field-goal record of 57 
yards, had tied the game when he caught a pass from Dean Chambers for a 
two-point conversion with 1:04 remaining. The Pioneers then recovered an 
on-sides kick at midfield, setting up the final field-goal attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams will look back at several missed opportunities, particularly Brea, 
which misfired on both its extra-point attempts and also was stopped on three 
consecutive plays inside the Pioneer one-yard line just before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Western (5-0-1, 0-0-1), meanwhile, had a 63-yard touchdown run on the opening 
series of the game called back because of a penalty and later was called for 
roughing the passer after intercepting a fourth-down pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalty gave the Wildcats first and goal at the nine and three plays 
later, Tommy Prenovost kicked a 22-yard field goal, giving Brea a 9-7 lead 
midway through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea (4-1-1, 0-0-1) increased its lead to 15-8 with 1:07 left in the third 
quarter when Prenovost came off the bench and hit Jacob Freeze on a 30-yard 
touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats then tried running out the clock behind Jerome Owens, who 
finished with 107 yards in 23 carries. But Western got a boost when a 13-yard 
punt gave them the ball at Brea's 48 with 2:43 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer quarterback Chambers broke out of the pocket for a 26-yard run to the 
16 and on the next play, he hit Justin Starkey on a 16-yard touchdown pass with 
1:07 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Western then got even when Chambers rolled right and hit Bell for the 
two-point conversion.

FALCONS FALL AFTER SEEING MUIR TRAIL; FOOTBALL: CRESCENTA VALLEY TAKES LEAD ON 
95-YARD RUN BEFORE SUCCUMBING, 17-7. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the long run, Chris Hedrick's 95-yard touchdown dash was about all 
Crescenta Valley High could muster in Friday night's 17-7 Pacific League loss 
to Muir at Pasadena City College. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedrick's burst up the middle gave Crescenta Valley a 7-0 first-quarter lead 
and raised hopes for the Falcons' first victory over Muir in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But Muir (4-2, 1-0), despite five turnovers, pounded away with seven 
ballcarriers and piled up 365 yards while limiting Crescenta Valley to 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more impressive, the Mustangs played the second half without tailback 
Shaun Haslip, the team's leading rusher, who left in the second quarter with a 
sprained left ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 In Haslip's place, junior Charles Dunn rushed for a game-high 130 yards in six 
carries, including a 90-yard touchdown run in the third quarter that snapped a 
7-7 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Crescenta Valley (5-1, 0-1), the inability to capitalize told the 
story. "They played defense," Falcon Coach Alan Eberhart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir sacked quarterback John Watts seven times for minus-48 yards, forcing two 
fumbles. Watts completed only four of 13 for 13 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedrick, who scored his 15th touchdown of the season, finished with 126 yards 
in 14 carries. Hedrick's second-longest run went for eight yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried our best," Hedrick said. "This is the level we want to play at." 
</P>
<P>
 Muir fumbled twice to end first-quarter drives. Haslip coughed up the ball at 
the Crescenta Valley 31-yard line on the Mustangs' opening drive and Mario 
Mendoza recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir's second drive failed at the Falcon five-yard line when linebacker Rocky 
Barbaro stripped the ball from quarterback Jeremy Bonwell. That set the stage 
for Hedrick's 95-yard charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir evened the score early in the second quarter on a one-yard sneak by 
Bonwell.

BORG PASSES PAST PURCELL ON HIS WAY TO SEMIFINALS; TENNIS: LEGENDARY SWEDE 
WINS, 7-6, 6-4, IN DIGITAL PC CHAMPIONS TOURNAMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 It was fast and it was furious, and when it was over Bjorn Borg and Mel 
Purcell sat on a couch sipping beers and discussing the Digital PC Champions 
tournament's best match to date. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone expects the greatest from him and they're getting it," said Purcell 
of Borg, the 7-6, 6-4 winner of their quarterfinal match Friday night at the 
Sherwood Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to chip and come in, but you have to be wary at the net because he 
passes so well." 
</P>
<P>
 The legendary Borg may have been better known than his opponent, an assistant 
tennis coach at Murray State University in Kentucky and the tour's quickest 
player, but Purcell was only a few points away from besting his Swedish foe. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's all over the court," said Borg, who also defeated Purcell in the second 
round of Wimbledon in 1981. "I was hitting on the lines and in the corners, but 
Mel, he was hitting well too." 
</P>
<P>
 The pair played at an almost-frantic pace that featured virtually no down time 
between serves and kept the ball kids scrambling to retrieve errant shots 
before play resumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Borg, who won a 7-3 tiebreaker to clinch the first set, closed out the match 
in telling fashion. As a shivering crowd of 3,000 tensed, Borg answered a 
running volley by Purcell with a perfectly placed forehand down the line and 
into the corner as Purcell collapsed backward onto the court, arms in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 In the afternoon matches, Johan Kriek polished off Mansour Bahrami 7-5, 6-4, 
and Jose-Luis Clerc defeated Larry Stefanki 6-2, 6-2.

SYLMAR WINS WITH 4TH STRAIGHT SHUTOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sylmar High's football team doesn't worry too much about winning these days -- 
victories are no problem for the Spartans, who stayed undefeated and posted 
their 19th consecutive shutout quarter with a 20-0 victory over Reseda on 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 How they do it sometimes is more important. A week earlier, Sylmar decided to 
electrify the crowd by scoring 61 points against Canoga Park. But Friday night 
was an exception. The Spartans had not beaten Reseda in five meetings. They 
would take this victory any way they could get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman) talked about that all week," said running back 
Durell Price, who rushed for 177 yards and one touchdown in 23 carries and 
helped the Spartans improve to 6-0. "This is Reseda. This is a big rivalry. 
That's what pushed us today." 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda's defense kept the Spartans from turning the game into a high-wire act. 
Late in the fourth quarter, Price put the game out of reach with a one-yard 
scoring run that capped a 20-play, 84-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda's offense, however, was manhandled. The Regents (3-3) gained 96 yards, 
61 coming on one pass play. They had only two first downs and only two 
possessions in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a good team, but we're a good team also," said Regent tight end 
Alonso Arreola, who caught three passes for 73 yards. "There were a lot of key 
plays that could have turned the game around." 
</P>
<P>
 After a first-quarter, 19-yard touchdown pass from Greg Marquez (five of 12, 
81 yards) to James Seidler, a squib kick hit Reseda lineman Eddie Rodriguez in 
the rear end. The ball was recovered by Spartan Thomas Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda held, but couldn't move the ball. Sylmar made it 14-0 when Marquez 
scored on a one-yard run. Then came Reseda's best chance: a 61-yard bomb from 
Matt Rutter (four of nine, 80 yards) to Arreola, who had beaten single 
coverage. But Arreola was chased down at the seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "I staggered when I caught the ball, and when I turned around I didn't have an 
angle," Arreola said. "We had opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda moved only two yards in the next three plays, then Arreola missed a 
22-yard field-goal attempt, wide right.

HART PULLS AWAY FROM CANYON FOR 42-19 WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 23-point victory over your archrival? 
</P>
<P>
 Not good enough for Hart High, ranked No. 1 in the region by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 After defeating Canyon, 42-19, Friday night at Canyon before a crowd of 3,000, 
Hart players wore long faces and their coaches harped on their mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 There were two fumbles, penalties, and mental mistakes on defense in the 
Foothill League opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a good effort by pretty much everybody tonight," said Hart's Ted 
Iacenda, who rushed for 129 yards and three touchdowns but fumbled in the 
fourth quarter. "I don't think I played well at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just goes to show how much we should have won by," he said. "I'm not 
saying that Canyon's not a good team, because they are, but I think we're that 
much better than them and we should have come out and dominated them the whole 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart (6-0, 1-0) dominated in the second half, outscoring Canyon 21-6 to pull 
away from the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon (1-4-1, 0-1) stayed with the high-powered Indians for two-plus 
quarters. But after closing to within 28-19 midway through the third quarter on 
Peter Gregory's five-yard scoring run, it was all Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played hard," Canyon Coach Larry Mohr said. "That was the best football 
team we played all year." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart has won seven of the last eight meetings between the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon quarterback Ahjeron Palmer rushed for 134 yards in nine carries in the 
first half, darting through the Hart defense on plays designed for him. He 
finished with 160 yards in 16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer's 29-yard touchdown jaunt with 3 minutes 5 seconds left in the first 
half pulled the Cowboys to within 14-13. Rick Engbrecht missed the extra-point 
attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart scored on the subsequent drive on a six-yard run by quarterback Steve 
McKeon with 35 seconds remaining in the half. McKeon, a junior, completed 16 of 
24 passes for 252 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 He suffered a headache and dizziness after the game and left in an ambulance 
to be checked for a concussion.

MOORPARK KEEPS GETTING DEFENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One player wears multicolored socks to practice. Another is a chatterbox who 
splits playing time with a silent partner. A fourth member of the cast pumps 
his right arm when he makes a good hit, like a bowler would after a strike. 
</P>
<P>
 With other teammates they form the most successful junior college football 
defensive unit in the state this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Which for Moorpark College is pretty much standard. The Raiders are 
traditionally strong on defense. But this group could become one of the best in 
school history. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to mark a stamp on something, but at this point, they are as 
good as any we've had," said Coach Jim Bittner, now in his 16th season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders lead the state with an average of 152.5 yards allowed per game, by 
far the best defensive showing for a Western State Conference team since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, another Moorpark team owns the top defensive effort over 
that span. In 1988, the Raiders limited opponents to 173.8 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Raider defense survived its stiffest test of the season and was 
instrumental in a 23-20 upset victory on the road over previously unbeaten 
Bakersfield, then ranked No. 1 in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Renegades went into the game averaging 44.5 points and 312.7 yards 
rushing. Except for the third quarter, when Bakersfield scored 17 points, 
Moorpark shut out the Renegades and preserved the victory with a key play.  
</P>
<P>
 On second and 10 from the Moorpark 15-yard line with 34 seconds left, Raider 
inside linebacker Robert Webb sacked Danny Henry on a blitz and caused him to 
fumble. Linebacker Jeffery Maxey recovered and the Raiders whooped it up in 
front of 8,000 at Memorial Stadium, where Bakersfield is virtually untouchable. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought they were going to run all over us, and it was the wrong idea," 
said Eddie Flores, an outspoken sophomore nose guard who platoons with 
soft-spoken sophomore Jason Sandel. "They didn't give us much respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe so, but Moorpark's next opponents definitely won't take them lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders (3-1, 3-0 in conference play), ranked No. 13 in the state, will 
face host Valley (5-0, 5-0) tonight at 7. The Monarchs, ranked fifth in the 
state and 13th in the country by USA Today, feature a run-and-shoot offense 
that is the opposite of Bakersfield's run-oriented attack and one that could 
give Moorpark headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 But Valley Coach Jim Fenwick says his team's explosive offense that ranks 
first in the state in passing with 1,711 yards and second overall with 2,176 
yards will be challenged.  
</P>
<P>
 "They (Raiders) have so much team speed they are really scary," Fenwick said. 
"They just pressure you so hard and are so consistent." 
</P>
<P>
 There, folks, lies the secret to their success. Well, most of it. The Moorpark 
defensive players, however, claim they are prosperous on the field because of 
intangibles.  
</P>
<P>
 "We all rely on each other and we know everyone is going to do his job," said 
Jason Jones, a 6-foot-5 sophomore tackle and fashion statesman who wears what 
he calls "Rainbow Power" socks. "I think it's the camaraderie that makes us 
good. We like each other." 
</P>
<P>
 If not naturally, at least by design. Gil Mendoza, Moorpark's defensive 
coordinator, said the players are required to remain cordial with each other on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to enforce that," Mendoza said. "(They) have to leave any differences 
they might have off the field. Fortunately, they don't seem to have them on 
this team." 
</P>
<P>
 If that's the case, then some opponents might want to spread some nasty gossip 
about Moorpark instead of studying game films. Bakersfield, for one, discovered 
how much havoc the Raiders can cause with this harmony of theirs. The Raiders 
forced the Renegades into five turnovers and had six sacks, including two by 
Jones, who leads the team with 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark also intercepted two passes, one by free safety Doyle Holmon and one 
by cornerback John Moss. Holmon, who has two interceptions, anchors the 
secondary that also includes cornerback Walter Thomas and strong safety 
Laurence Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their defense, year in and year out, is the best we play in our conference," 
said Carl Bowser, the Bakersfield coach. "They are coming after you on every 
down." 
</P>
<P>
 From the left side of the line that means David Acosta, a 280-pound tackle who 
has 19 unassisted tackles and seven sacks, and who Jones calls "the voice of 
reason." Maxey says Acosta is the glue binding the unit.  
</P>
<P>
 "Everything has a leader and the leader of this defense is Daddy Acosta," said 
Maxey, a sophomore who has 15 solo tackles and four sacks. Maxey handles the 
outside duties with sophomore Mike Prchal.  
</P>
<P>
 Acosta, one of three Raiders to score a defensive touchdown this season (Jones 
and Maxey are the others), smiles sheepishly at the compliment. Although he 
pumps his right arm after stopping ballcarriers -- "It's just something that 
happens. It's not like I plan it" -- Acosta is otherwise quiet and 
undemonstrative. He also likes to keep things in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our heads don't swell," Acosta said. "We are not satisfied with what we've 
done. . . . The (team) rankings don't matter much. What matters is where we are 
at the end of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no denying that the Raiders would like to finish the season at 
the top of the state defensive charts. Sophomore inside linebacker David 
Hairston, who leads the team with 41 tackles, says the possibilities are too 
obvious to ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders were third in the state last season at 230.5 yards allowed per 
game and Hairston figured the returning players would make the team equally 
strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said at the beginning of the season that we wanted to be No. 1 on 
defense," Hairston said.

 On a night that San Fernando High was penalized 15 times for 138 yards, flags 
weren't the only things raining down on the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, were Cleveland defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask San Fernando quarterback Keijuan Douglas, who lost a fumble, had a 
pass intercepted, failed to complete a pass in five attempts, and was sacked 
five times as Cleveland remained undefeated in the Northwest Valley Conference 
with a 40-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Lopez, the Cavaliers' quarterback, had a much better night. He 
completed eight of 14 for 163 yards and three touchdowns. Jay Jay Padilla paced 
the Cleveland ground attack, rushing for 74 yards and two touchdowns in seven 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland (4-2, 3-0) scored on its first two possessions and didn't trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Tehran Price carried three times for 91 yards and a touchdown for 
San Fernando (3-3, 2-1). AARON MEIER

 Santa Barbara 22, Hueneme 15 -- Santa Barbara spoiled Hueneme's homecoming by 
foiling a Viking drive in the closing moments to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons (4-2, 2-1) were led by running back Khalid Hurst with 209 yards and 
two touchdowns in 24 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Vikings came back on the first play of the next series on a 
flea-flicker play with quarterback George Jones hitting Reyes Romero for a 
60-yard touchdown.

<P>
 After Santa Barbara took a 14-7 lead on Dan Nunez's 20-yard pass to Alvaro De 
La Mora, Jones scored on a nine-yard run. His two-point conversion pass to 
Romero gave Hueneme a 15-14 halftime lead.

 Crespi 14, St. John Bosco 7 -- Defensive back Chris Crawley knocked down a 
pass in the end zone with 1:28 to play to shut down a last-minute St. John 
Bosco comeback threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Dave Lins (16 of 19, 140 yards) of Crespi (3-3, 1-0) had two 
touchdown passes to Wayne Emerson, one for 10 yards and the winning score for 
20. Emerson had eight receptions for 85 yards and threw a 29-yard pass to Jeff 
DeFinney (six receptions, 72 yards). 
</P>
<P>
 The Crespi defense, while giving up 246 yards, was able to give the offense 
good field position -- most notably when defensive lineman David Barrio blocked 
a punt to give the offense the ball in scoring position. DAVID HARRIS

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; OCEAN VIEW CAN'T HOLD SADDLEBACK IN 
FINAL MINUTES

<P>
 What's the difference between a three-year losing streak and a long-awaited 
victory? 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Ocean View, about six minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks had a one-point lead with 6 minutes 1 second left in the game, 
but then host Saddleback marched up field for the winning score and a 14-7 
victory in a Golden West League opener Friday at the Santa Ana Bowl. Ocean View 
has lost 35 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Verino rushed for 162 yards in 23 carries and scored two touchdowns and 
a two-point conversion for the Roadrunners. Verino broke a 46-yard run midway 
through the second quarter, then had runs of 23 and 25 yards on the final 
Roadrunner drive, setting up his one-yard scoring run with 1:17 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View had its best four-quarter effort of the season, perhaps in part 
because of a balanced rushing attack. Calvin Silva (30 yards in 10 carries) had 
been carrying the bulk of the rushing load for the Seahawks, but got help 
Friday from Jason Hoffman, who ran for 44 yards and scored the Seahawk 
touchdown on a one-yard fourth-quarter run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seahawks had a chance to open the scoring in the second quarter, as 
quarterback Ted Norman apparently gave Ocean View a first down at the 
Saddleback 20. However, the play was called back because of a procedure 
penalty. ERIC MADDY

DRAMATIC GOLD, BERTRANDO HEAD GOODWOOD FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The road to the Breeders' Cup Classic seldom includes a stop at Santa Anita 
for the Goodwood Handicap, but at least two of the six horses in today's 
$200,000 race might wind up at Churchill Downs in three weeks if they run well 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic Gold, who won a $1-million race, the Molson Export Stakes, at 
Woodbine in Toronto in his last start, will try to become the first 3-year-old 
to win the Goodwood. Bertrando will try to regain the success of his earlier 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he runs well and the race isn't too tough on him, we'll sit down and talk 
about the Classic," said David Hofmans, who trains Dramatic Gold for John and 
Betty Mabee, the owners and breeders of the gelding. 
</P>
<P>
 Since having surgery to relieve an entrapped epiglottis in April, Dramatic 
Gold has not run a dull race. He won an allowance race at Hollywood Park in 
June and followed that with a second in the Swaps Stakes, a third in the 
Pacific Classic at Del Mar and a 1 1/2-length victory in Canada a month ago. 
The son of Slew O' Gold from the Danzig mare American Dream has increased his 
earnings to more than $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And for a horse who appears to do better in cool weather, the timing is right. 
The sweltering 90-degree heat that hit Santa Anita last weekend has subsided. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his throat problems, Dramatic Gold was debilitated in March by a trip 
to steamy Gulfstream Park for the Florida Derby. But it had seemed like a good 
idea at the time; Holy Bull had finished last in his prep race and wasn't going 
to be favored over his home track. Dramatic Gold was already a winner in 
California at 1 1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trip was long and hot," Hofmans said. "He had to change planes along the 
way. Then the humid weather in Florida was awful." 
</P>
<P>
 There was something the Florida bettors saw in Dramatic Gold, however, and he 
was sent off at 7-1, with several top professional handicappers picking him to 
win the race. Holy Bull was an easy winner, with Dramatic Gold more than 20 
lengths behind. 
</P>
<P>
 What followed was a fourth-place finish, as the 3-2 favorite, in the 
California Derby at Golden Gate Fields and the throat surgery that kept 
Dramatic Gold away from the races for more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Pacific Classic, the options for Dramatic Gold were the $750,000 
Super Derby at Louisiana Downs or Canada, and the Molson victory gave the 
51-year-old Hofmans his richest training victory. His biggest before that was 
in the $200,000 range, and he can recall starting only one other horse in a 
$1-million race, when General Meeting ran second to the Mabees' entrymate, Best 
Pal, in the 1990 Hollywood Futurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Bertrando's biggest accomplishment this year has been to service 70 mares. 
Back at the track, he has been a disappointment, winning once but then running 
last in the Pacific Classic and finishing fifth in the Woodward. Still, he has 
earned $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got to run a big race (today) in order to go (to the Classic)," said 
Eddie Nahem, who bred Bertrando and races him with Marshall Naify. 
</P>
<P>
 Nahem and Naify seem to be serious about paying another $360,000 supplement, 
as they did last year for the Breeders' Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 In that race, at Santa Anita, Arcangues -- the biggest longshot in Cup history 
at 133-1 -- was the only horse to run Bertrando down at 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the French horse doesn't get us, we win horse of the year," Nahem said. 
"We still won (the award for) best older horse, and if we would win the Classic 
this year, the way the other older horses have been beating each other, they 
should give us that award again." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferdinand won the Goodwood and the Classic two weeks apart in 1987. More 
recently, Breeders' Cup pickings from the Goodwood have been considerably 
leaner, although Reign Road, winning the Oak Tree race in 1992, did finish 
fourth in the Classic.

 Marco Garcia of Dos Pueblos High booted a 24-yard field goal with five seconds 
remaining to force Buena to settle for a 27-27 tie in a Channel League game 
Friday night at Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena (5-1-1, 2-0-1 in league play) led the entire game until Garcia's kick 
and had taken a 27-17 lead when Jeff Stetler scored on a 14-yard pass from 
Glenn Dudley late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dos Pueblos (2-3-1, 1-1-1) pulled within three when Ryan Thompson returned 
the ensuing kickoff 96 yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena's Chris Carr led all rushers with 133 yards in 18 carries. Josh Cross 
added 52 yards in 11 carries and scored on a 17-yard run in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Stewart had two of Buena's touchdowns, scoring on a three-yard option 
pass from Carr in the second quarter to give the Bulldogs a 14-3 halftime lead, 
and again on a one-yard run in the third period as the Bulldogs took a 20-9 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudley completed eight of 13 for 83 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Ertman caught four passes for 44 yards and Stetler added two catches for 
26 yards for the Bulldogs. LISA GRALL

STRONG SECOND HALF LIFTS KENNEDY PAST BIRMINGHAM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With its confidence shaken following two consecutive one-point losses, Kennedy 
High placed added significance on its Northwest Valley Conference matchup with 
Birmingham on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 So much in fact, that Golden Cougar Coach Bob Francola was not sure how his 
team would handle another setback. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, Francola did not have to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 Antwane Smith rushed for 196 yards and three touchdowns and Kennedy limited 
the Braves to 52 yards in the second half en route to a 35-21 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really needed a victory from a confidence level," Francola said. "It 
doesn't matter if you lose by one or 100 points. The kids start thinking. And 
until you win, nobody knows." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith scored twice in the first quarter, including a 64-yard run which gave 
the Golden Cougars (3-3, 1-2) a 12-0 lead with four seconds left and finished 
the first half with 153 yards in 10 carries. "The line has done a great job for 
me all year," said Smith, who has 896 yards rushing this season. "They open the 
holes, all I do is run through." 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham (3-3, 0-3) came back behind the running of senior tailback Courtney 
Blunt, who finished with 142 yards and three touchdowns in 22 carries. Blunt 
capped a 65-yard drive with a five-yard run to cut the lead to 12-7. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves moved ahead, 14-12, after a Smith fumble on a 13-yard touchdown run 
by Blunt with 5 minutes 8 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kennedy responded with another score just before halftime on a nine-yard 
run by Damion Thompson to lead, 20-14. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Cougar defense took over in the second half, limiting the Braves to 
one first down in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan McMullen finished with 118 yards passing.

NORTH HOLLYWOOD REBOUNDS TO CLAIM ITS FIRST VICTORY, 26-15 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than 3 1/2 minutes had elapsed in Friday's Valley Pac-8 Conference 
football game at Grant High, yet things looked painfully familiar to North 
Hollywood Coach Gary Gray. 
</P>
<P>
 North Hollywood had lost 21 yards on its first offensive possession -- which 
led to a Grant safety -- and its defense had allowed a touchdown on the 
Lancers' ensuing two-play, 41-yard drive. But the Huskies managed to reverse a 
season-long trend, rallying for a 26-15 victory, their first of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant (1-4-1, 0-3) suffered its fourth consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've started poorly in every game this season," Gray said. "And after those 
first two series, I could see the team was down on itself. But I just told them 
to start taking care of their assignments and we'd be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies (1-5, 1-2) prospered behind the running of Dante Clay and the 
passing of Jesus Acosta. Clay, who gained 117 yards in 24 carries, scored on an 
eight-yard run on the first play of the second quarter to cut North Hollywood's 
deficit to 9-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Acosta (10 of 12 for 132 yards) followed with a 36-yard scoring pass to Daniel 
Curtin to give the Huskies a 12-9 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant countered with a nine-play, 65-yard drive of its own -- capped by 
Di-Onte Smith's six-yard run -- to take a 15-12 lead at halftime. Smith, who 
has gained 1,068 yards this season, rushed for 127 yards and two touchdowns in 
21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 He was held to 34 yards in 10 carries in the second half, however. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies scored touchdowns on their first two possessions of the third 
quarter. The touchdowns came on a two-yard run by fullback Saul Lopez and a 
five-yard run by Clay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was trying to make this out as a battle of the names," Clay said of 
rival tailback Smith. "You know, Dante versus Di-Onte, but I didn't really 
worry about it. I was pleased with the offensive line today. They were really 
opening up a lot of holes for me."

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SOUTH COAST LEAGUE; MACKENZIE LEADS 
CAPISTRANO VALLEY OVER SAN CLEMENTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sophomore running back Malaefou MacKenzie scored three touchdowns to lead 
Capistrano Valley to a 21-9 South Coast League victory over San Clemente Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 MacKenzie carried 29 times for 92 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars' second possession of the game was all MacKenzie. He carried the 
ball on every down, nine times for 42 yards, finishing it with a three-yard 
touchdown run with 3 minutes 4 seconds left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 MacKenzie put Capistrano Valley (4-2, 1-0) up 14-0, on a 12-yard run with 4:16 
left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougar defense stuffed San Clemente (3-3, 0-1) in the first half, holding 
the Tritons to 51 yards total offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Triton quarterback Jeff Carlin was pressured all night by Cougar defenders 
Andrew Klein and Jason Purvis, who sacked him four times. Purvis was in on 
three of those. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlin, who scored the Tritons' only touchdown on a one-yard run in the third 
quarter, had averaged more than 200 yards per game passing before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night the Cougar's secondary, led by defensive back, Jeffrey Brion and 
linebacker Sam Petke held Carlin to 115 yards, completing 13 of 31 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente had an opportunity to get the ball back, down 14-9, with less 
than three minutes remaining, but a roughing-the-kicker call gave Capistrano 
Valley a first down and MacKenzie wrapped up the victory with a nine-yard 
touchdown run with 45 seconds left. MELANIE NEFF

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; SUNNY HILLS MAKES MISTAKES, LOSES TO 
TROY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the differences between winning and losing teams is, winners often 
overcome their mistakes, losers don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning teams also have a player or two who can make up for things that are 
not happening. Such was the case Friday for Troy, which held back a stubborn 
but mistake-prone Sunny Hills team, 23-14, in front of an estimated 500 at 
Fullerton in the Freeway League opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Lifting the Warriors (5-1, 1-0) was running back Larry Montgomery, who totaled 
160 yards in 27 carries and scored two touchdowns. The clincher was a 23-yard 
swirl in the fourth quarter, during which no fewer than four Lancer defenders 
thought they had a tackle lined up but missed. 
</P>
<P>
 A very sore tailbone that had to be iced constantly in the second half limited 
Montgomery to 56 yards in the final 24 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very physical ballgame," said Troy Coach John Turek, who also lost 
kicker/receiver Eric Urban (rotator cuff) and back Chad Elliott (separated 
shoulder) -- but not before Elliott had an interception to set up the Warriors' 
first touchdown. "Defensively, though, we played great. And Larry carried us on 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills (1-5, 0-1) did not get the same kind of support. Quarterback Greg 
Garand completed 11 of 25 passes for 128 yards. He was sacked twice and had two 
passes intercepted, both of which resulted in scores. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lancer Coach Tim Devaney seemed more aggravated at the 127 yards in 
penalties called on Sunny Hills. "Some of the calls were questionable and some 
we deserved," he said. "All in all, it made for a very frustrating night on 
offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Troy took a 7-0 lead in the first quarter. After Elliott's interception was 
returned to the Sunny Hills 32, Troy quarterback Kevin Gray found Jim Wise for 
a 14-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Warriors unintentionally opened things up with their own faux pas. On 
the first play of the second quarter, a poor snap to punter Urban at the Troy 
40 resulted in mad scramble over the next 20 yards. Dereck Cretz scooped up the 
ball at the 17 and ran it in for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Lancers' next possession, Garand found Jeff Renaud all alone at the 
Troy 5, and the two hooked up for a 30-yard touchdown pass, giving the visitors 
a 14-7 lead.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; YOUNG RUSHES FOR 275 YARDS AS FULLERTON 
DEFEATS BUENA PARK

 Christopher Young rushed for 275 yards and two touchdowns to lead Fullerton to 
27-14 victory over Buena Park in a Freeway League opener Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Young, a 165-pound senior running back, spoiled the Coyotes' homecoming with 
touchdown runs of 80 and 40 yards.Young carried the ball 22 times to pace an 
Indian offense that only threw eight passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park (1-5, 0-1) had an opportunity to score three times in the first 
quarter, but failed, enabling Fullerton (4-2, 1-0) to score two quick 
touchdowns. Buena Park's Tim Jones opened the game with a 51-yard kickoff 
return, which put the ball on Fullerton's 47-yard line. However, two botched 
plays and two penalties later, the Coyotes punted, but recovered a fumble at 
Fullerton's 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 An illegal-shift penalty negated quarterback David Barrios' 10-yard touchdown 
run and Buena Park came away empty when it missed on the field-goal attempt. 
After Buena Park failed on another field-goal attempt, Fullerton's Young raced 
80 yards for a touchdown with 4 minutes 7 seconds remaining in the first 
quarter. COREY LYONS

 Sonora ended a 14-year drought by beating La Habra, 24-12, as the teams opened 
Freeway League play Friday at La Habra High. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora fans celebrated the Raiders' first victory over the Highlanders since 
1979 by pouring onto the field as the final seconds ticked away and surrounding 
the team at midfield.Sonora Coach Mark Takkinen was excited, but he seemed more 
relieved at finally breaking the streak. 
</P>
<P>
 "This takes away 14 years of guys busting their butts and not winning," 
Takkinen said. "Maybe this makes up for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior running back Shawn Brass led the Raiders (3-3, 1-0) with 168 yards and 
one touchdown in 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora scored first on Sam Escobar's two-yard touchdown run with 40 seconds 
remaining in the first quarter. Wes Hale's 45-yard field goal put Sonora up, 
10-6, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The third quarter saw three touchdowns scored in a span of 1 minute 44 
seconds. Escobar, who added 92 yards rushing, scored his second touchdown of 
the night on a four-yard run, putting Sonora ahead, 17-6. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Highlanders (2-4, 0-1) scored on their next play from scrimmage, as 
running back Johnny Yoo hooked up with Will McIntosh on a halfback option pass 
for an 80-yard Highlander touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Brass scored a 39-yard touchdown on a reverse, stopping La 
Habra's momentum. GEOFF BILAU

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; HEALTHY FIELDING ROLLS UP 222 YARDS, 
THREE TOUCHDOWNS 
</P>

<P>
 Mission Viejo Coach Bill Denny wanted to establish a running game and a more 
balanced offense Friday night against Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 And Todd Fielding made sure it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Fielding rushed for 222 yards in 29 carries and scored three touchdowns to 
lead Mission Viejo to a 21-6 South Coast League victory over the Dolphins at 
Dana Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 Fielding, who was healthy for the first time in a month since spraining his 
ankle in Mission Viejo's second game of the season, got the running game 
rolling on the Diablos' first drive of the game. He carried the ball five times 
on the five-play, 49-yard drive and scored from 10 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
 Fielding also did most of the work on the Diablos' second drive, carrying the 
ball five times for 38 yards, including a two-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Hills scratched its single-back offense for a power-I formation, which 
features three running backs. The new scheme worked as the Dolphins marched 72 
yards on 17 plays and scored when Randy Hein ran in from two yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo forced Dana Hills into throwing the ball, however, when Fielding 
scored his third touchdown of the night on a four-yard run with 10:16 left in 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were lucky we were able to get that final score because they came out and 
played some good, smash-mouth football," Denny said. "We were able to force 
them out of it with that last score because it takes too long to score using 
that offense." JOE WOJCIECHOWSKI

TRIO SPARK ANTELOPE VALLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 You might think Walker, Shrout and Lewis sounds like a good name for a law 
firm. But for the Antelope Valley High football team, they spelled the 
difference in a 20-6 victory over Burroughs in the Golden League opener for 
both teams Friday at Burroughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore defensive back Tony Walker was the first to make his presence felt. 
After Burroughs (3-3) had driven to the Antelope Valley five-yard line on the 
game's opening series, Walker dropped Burro running back DeMario Brown for 
back-to-back losses. A 28-yard field-goal attempt then failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior kicker Chad Shrout then booted a wind-aided 64-yard punt that pinned 
the Burros at their own six. A few minutes later, Shrout gave Antelope Valley 
(3-2) a 3-0 lead on a 37-yard field goal and added another with three seconds 
left before the half for a 6-0 cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 Jermaine Lewis, who averaged under 70 yards rushing going into the game, had 
121 yards in 23 carries and scored twice. GERRY PRICE

 Quarterback Wes Lagatta threw four touchdown passes and ran for another to 
lead Royal High's 55-10 rout of host Camarillo in a Marmonte League game Friday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagatta completed five of 13 passes for 128 yards with scoring strikes of 14 
and 16 yards to Jerome Lee and 11 and 79 yards to Brendan Gibson.Lagatta's 
scoring run covered 63 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Broussard's 87-yard kickoff return to open the second half ignited a 
35-point explosion for Royal (5-1, 3-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Royal forced fumbles on Camarillo's first two plays of the game, which 
resulted in a quick 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders had a string of 11 scoreless quarters snapped when Shawn 
Nakamura kicked a 21-yard field goal with 3:17 left in the third quarter. Royal 
recorded eight sacks, including 4 1/2 by Ryan Russell, who also had a fumble 
recovery. 
</P>

 Camarillo's Roth Valencia rushed for 119 yards in 17 carries, including an 
88-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. LANCE O'FALLON

<P>
 How anemic did Burroughs High appear in its 28-7 loss to Saugus in a Foothill 
League opener Friday night? 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, the host Indians (2-4) had 59 yards of total offense, while 
losing 75 yards on seven penalties.And quarterback Mike Barrett slipped and 
fell on two occasions while taking the snap from center, although he prevented 
a shutout with a 95-yard kickoff return for a touchdown with 8 minutes 23 
seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Add four interceptions, including a 32-yard return for a touchdown by Brandon 
Alvarado and it made for a dismal Burroughs evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior running back Jeremy Mushinski II provided the highlights for Saugus 
(3-2-1), carrying 26 times for 92 yards, including three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 After marching 66 yards in eight plays on the opening possession, Saugus 
quarterback Kevin Carrasco finished with 162 yards passing, completing 16 of 
26. Colin Butterfield had 10 catches for 97 yards. DARIN ESPER

NOTRE DAME DOESN'T LET DOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
 With their starting right tackle, Peter Forlano, lying in intensive care at a 
Burbank hospital after undergoing brain surgery earlier this week, it would 
have been understandable for the Notre Dame High football team to have had a 
letdown Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Knights, ranked No. 5 by The Times, convincingly defeated Mission 
League newcomer Gardena Serra, 17-6, at Serra in the league opener for both 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was real happy with the way our team performed tonight after all they had 
gone through this week," Knight Coach Kevin Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame (5-1) capitalized on several turnovers by Serra (4-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame scored on its first possession when quarterback Ryan Bowen 
connected with Robbie Brewster on a six-yard pass play for a 7-0 lead late in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights added a one-yard touchdown run by Don Ebenhoch and a 32-yard field 
goal by Chris Sailer. JOE SCHLOSSER

ALEMANY NO MATCH FOR BISHOP AMAT, 49-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One needed only to look at the sparkling-clean uniform of Daylon McCutcheon to 
guess how Alemany High fared in its toughest football test of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The standout tailback for Bishop Amat sprained an ankle in practice this week, 
and would have played only if needed in the Del Rey league opener Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to a stubborn defense and costly turnovers by Alemany, Bishop Amat 
didn't need McCutcheon. The Lancers, ranked No. 1 in the nation by several 
publications, romped, 49-0, at Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany (1-3-2, 0-1 in league play) fumbled the first two times it touched the 
ball. After a fumble, recovered by Alemany, on the opening kickoff, tailback 
Armone Lochard dropped a pitch on the first play from scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Ace Paule recovered for Bishop Amat (6-0, 1-0) at the Alemany 
five-yard line and tailback Randy Guanko scored on the next play to give the 
Lancers the lead with a minute elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wasn't a real good start for us," Alemany Coach Pat Degnan said. "To 
give the No. 1 team in the country the ball on your five-yard line right from 
the start, it's not going to be a good day." 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany was plagued by turnovers the entire first half. Linebacker Ramogi Huma 
returned an interception 18 yards to put Bishop Amat ahead, 21-0, eight minutes 
into the game and defensive back Roger Ollano returned a tipped pass 30 yards 
for a score midway through the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Alemany was held to minus-10 yards of offense in the first half and gained 15 
yards in the game. The Indian's initial first down came with eight minutes to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven different backs carried the ball for Bishop Amat, which did not attempt 
a pass in the second half.

Christian, 53-8, Friday night at Whittier College. 
</P>
<P>
 Juliano rushed for 100 yards and two touchdowns and had one passing touchdown; 
Holloway rushed for 149 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway's first score came on an 11-yard run on the Lancers opening drive. 
Orange Lutheran (5-1, 1-0 in the Olympic League) then recovered an onside kick 
and scored three plays later on a 13-yard touchdown run by Juliano. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittier Christian's Nick Valdez fumbled on the Lancer 16-yard line, and 
Orange Lutheran scored again when Holloway took an option pitch and ran 46 
yards for a touchdown and a 20-0 first-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Heralds' problems continued in the second quarter. Valdez fumbled on the 
Whittier Christian 21-yard line, setting up a five-yard run by Holloway. Soon 
after Juliano scored on a 50-yard run. Holloway's fourth touchdown, a 
three-yard run, gave the Lancers a 40-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the third quarter, Juliano hit Mike Crawford with a 57-yard 
touchdown pass. Orange Lutheran's last touchdown was a 55-yard run by Dan Young 
in the fourth quarter. JASON HILL

Oilers' 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach turned the ball over on downs on its next possession, and 
Ponchak then put the game out of reach. He rolled right and raced down the 
sideline, scoring on a 41-yard run with 1:21 left and Fountain Valley led, 
27-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak also had a good night passing. He was 18 for 29 for 209 yards with no

Rumford with 2:19 left in the half. The play put Fountain Valley up, 10-7.

 Ryan Johansen directed second-half touchdown drives of 77 and 74 yards to lead

</P>
<P>
 Santiago's Jose Palacios booted a 32-yard field goal in the second quarter to

GIANTS' QUINN APOLOGIZES TO GENOVESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Genovese feels vindicated. That doesn't mean he feels better, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after news of his firing after 34 years with the San Francisco Giants 
became public, he was contacted by a prominent member of the team's front 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Genovese said that second-year General Manager Bob Quinn phoned Thursday and 
apologized for the way the dismissal was handled. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he dropped the ball and that he was sorry," Genovese said. "He said 
he blew it." 
</P>
<P>
 Genovese, 72, was one of five scouts whose contracts will not be renewed by 
the Giants in 1995. Genovese, who scouted the Southern California area, served 
as a scout and minor-league coach with the organization since 1960 and signed 
43 players who made the club's 40-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants have made a number of economically driven moves over the past few 
weeks, including the elimination of two low-level minor-league clubs. The five 
scouting positions were permanently eliminated and several office employees 
were temporarily laid off until the strike is resolved. Genovese's contract 
expires Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 As alarmed as Genovese was to be fired, he was just as upset about the way the 
matter was handled. He first received a call from the team's scouting 
coordinator, then a brief letter from a vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the least I deserved after 34 years was a call from somebody who 
wasn't a flunky," Genovese said. "At least now I know that I was right -- they 
handled it badly." 
</P>
<P>
 Genovese said he accepted Quinn's apology, with reservation. "I accepted it," 
he said. "But I don't think I could go back to work for them. Not now."

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; NICKELS LEADS SANTA MARGARITA TO 21-14 
UPSET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Junior defensive back Matt Nickels had three interceptions and caught a 
touchdown pass to lead Santa Margarita to a 21-14 upset of previously 
undefeated Woodbridge Friday night at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita (3-3, 1-0 in the Sea View League) had to hold off a late rally 
by Woodbridge (5-1, 0-1), which came into the game ranked No. 1 in Division V, 
and sixth in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors closed the gap to 21-14 on a 25-yard touchdown pass from Casey 
Harris to Marco Hanlon with 1 minute 6 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge then recovered the on-side kick. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nickels intercepted Harris' pass at the Eagle five-yard line with 15 
seconds left to preserve the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita quarterback Chris Collins, who has been sidelined all season 
because of a knee injury, led the Eagles, rushing for 79 yards in 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Eagles had four interceptions, three by Nickels and one by Matt Lucas. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucas intercepted a pass by Harris and returned the ball 36 yards for a 
touchdown with 28 seconds left in the second quarter to give Santa Margarita a 
12-0 lead. Collins connected with Eric Brown on the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Korinke kicked a 39-yard field goal with 6:59 left in the first quarter 
to put the Eagles ahead, 3-0. Korinke's 45-yard field goal with 4:48 left in 
the second quarter gave Santa Margarita a 6-0 lead.

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; CORONA DEL MAR RALLIES WITH BIG PLAYS 
TO BEAT EL TORO

<P>
 Big plays and huge gains were common at Newport Harbor Friday night, but there 
wasn't anything ordinary about the finish of Corona del Mar's 35-28 Sea View 
League victory over El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Hogan led the Sea Kings, rushing for 271 yards in 23 carries, including 
touchdown runs of 96 (a school record) and 74 yards, as Corona del Mar rallied 
from a 21-7 first-half deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogan's 74-yard scoring run with 2 minutes, 17 seconds left in the game 
touched off a frantic set of events. Corona del Mar (3-3, 1-0) trailed, 28-21, 
before Hogan went off tackle and then cut up the left sideline for the long 
touchdown that made the score 28-27.  
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar then went for two, with quarterback Josh Walz scrambling into 
the end zone for the conversion to give the Sea Kings a 29-28 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After the kickoff, El Toro (3-3, 0-1) quickly moved into Corona del Mar 
territory, but faced a fourth-and-eight situation at the Sea King 44-yard line. 
Corona del Mar defensive back Aaron Perlmutter then appeared to clinch the 
victory by intercepting El Toro's Brian Wilson and returning 73 yards for a 
touchdown and a 35-28 Sea King lead with 35 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing was certain in this game, however, as El Toro's Joe Ader returned the 
kickoff 50 yards to the Corona del Mar 42. Wilson tried to get off a pass as 
time was running out, but a sack by Fred Garcia finished things off. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogan's 96-yard run late in the second quarter broke the previous Sea King 
record of 94 yards set by Brian Lucas in 1989 against La Quinta. MARK SPINN

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; COSTA MESA RECORDS EARLY KNOCKOUT OF 
LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>

<P>
 Costa Mesa's running game proved to be too much for Laguna Beach as the 
Mustangs pounded the Artists, 56-14, in the Pacific Coast League opener Friday 
for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs got 163 yards rushing from Dewayne Crenshaw and Charles Chatman 
added 141 yards and four touchdowns.The Artists tried using no down defensive 
linemen in an effort to get jump on the Mustang offensive line, but it was to 
no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs struck immediately when Brian Reeves returned the opening kickoff 
95 yards. On the Mustangs' first play from scrimmage, Crenshaw broke up the 
middle for a 66-yard run to set his team up at the Artist 16. Two plays later 
Chatman ran 14 yards for the Mustangs' second touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second quarter the Mustangs scored three more touchdowns to take a 
commanding lead. Chatman got his second touchdown with a 3-yard run, and four 
minutes later Ryan Taylor hit John Schroeder for a 30-yard touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1 minute 54 seconds left in the half, Laguna Beach scored with a 74-yard 
drive that ended with a McDonagh 5-yard run. But Chatman later scored on a 
34-yard run to give the Mustangs a 35-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the third quarter, Josh Amezola intercepted a Nate Pivaroff pass and 
returned it 40 yards for a touchdown. Chatman and Schroeder each added 
touchdown runs of 41 and seven yards, respectively. TED APODACA

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; LAGUNA HILLS RELIES ON MCGRAW, AND 
WINS, 28-0 
</P>

<P>
 Some might call Laguna Hills' offense predictable, unimaginative or 
one-dimensional. But Friday night in the Pacific Coast League opener, you 
certainly couldn't argue with Laguna Hills Coach Steve Bresnahan's reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would you want to have anyone else but Brandon McGraw carry the ball?" 
Bresnahan asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills didn't. And Aliso Niguel, playing its first league game, couldn't 
stop him. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw, the powerful 6-foot-1 tailback, accounted for all 300 yards offense in 
the first 28 minutes of the Hawks' 28-0 victory over Aliso Niguel at Mission 
Viejo High. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw took the handoff from quarterback Cory Pardoe 31 consecutive times -- 
once handing off to Adam Roman for a reverse that gained zero yards -- and 
scored on runs of one, 27 and 70 yards, all in the second half, giving him 21 
touchdowns this season. 
</P>
<P>
 His 300 yards rushing also gives him 1,273 this season. Only a Roman's 40-yard 
punt return for a touchdown and 40 yards by the reverse in the final minutes 
were not credited to McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Hills (4-2, 1-0) attempted its only pass with five minutes left in the 
game and its only completion was for a two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we could run the ball from the opening drive," Bresnahan said. 
"When we finally got some good field position in the second half, we began to 
score." 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw had 121 yards by halftime, but his first fumble of the season cost the 
Hawks one drive. A missed field-goal attempt ended another. 
</P>
<P>
 As they did last week against Los Amigos, the Wolverines (2-4, 0-1), played 
well in the first half, with 101 total yards, but faltered in the second with 
only 60. MICHAEL CASEY

PREP EXTRA / SATURDAY FOOTBALL PULLOUT; NEWPORT HARBOR TAKES CONTROL FROM 
IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When it left the South Coast League for the Sea View League in 1991, Irvine 
took it by the throat. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, Newport Harbor took it back. 
</P>
<P>
 The visiting Sailors did something no other Sea View team had done, beating 
Irvine, 9-7, in front of a homecoming crowd of 3,800. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine had not lost any of its 14 Sea View games, and had not lost any of its 
past 17 league games. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that changed with Jeff Pardy's 23-yard field goal with 8 minutes 58 
seconds left in the fourth quarter. The drive started at the Newport eight-yard 
line, and it kept the Sailors (6-0, 1-0) unbeaten. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Irvine's fourth consecutive loss -- all to ranked opponents. The 
Vaqueros are 2-4, 0-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't come in thinking they were below average or anything," Newport 
Harbor quarterback John Giordani said. "This was our biggest game of the year. 
It was a big game for establishing our program in Orange County. If we lost and 
fell on our face, everything we did in the preseason would have been thrown out 
the window." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor Coach Jeff Brinkley agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these guys were sophomores when we were playing Irvine in the 
(Southern Section final in 1992)," he said. "Irvine hasn't lost a game since 
they joined the Sea View League (including three victories over Newport). 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been one of the consistent programs in the county and this stepped us 
up tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors looked every bit like the county's eighth-ranked team. They still 
have not allowed a rushing touchdown, even though Irvine's Russ Diehl did carry 
the ball 28 times for 116 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor took a lead four minutes into the second quarter when Giordani 
connected with Mike Freeman on a 28-yard scoring pass. Pardy's point-after 
attempt was blocked by Jason Miele, and it appeared to be a big play when 
Irvine drove 78 yards in the final 2:21 of the half. Diehl rushed for most of 
it, and Scott Larsen's fade pass to Jeff Walker -- and then Jamie Bertolli's 
extra point -- made it 7-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine could have added to its lead in the third quarter, but linebacker Brian 
Flynn dropped what could have been an interception with 45 yards of open field 
in front of him. On Newport's next series, the Sailors drove for the field 
goal, keyed by a 37-yard pass from Giordani to Jon Benzinger, and Jeremy 
Mason's 19-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine had one final opportunity to get the ball back with about three minutes 
left, but Danny Noisy muffed a punt return and Mason recovered at the 39 with 
2:47 to go; it was the game's only turnover. From there, the Sailors ran out 
the clock on Irvine's dominance of the Sea View League.

JILTED BY GIANTS, NOW HE'S A ROCK FOR RAMS; FOOTBALL: JONES, RARELY USED BACKUP 
WITH NEW YORK, PROVES HIMSELF IN DIFFICULT LEFT TACKLE SPOT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a brief exchange last spring, the New York Giants withdrew their contract 
offer to offensive tackle Clarence Jones, a restricted free agent, and tried to 
re-sign him for less money. 
</P>
<P>
 Translation: You're a stiff, so we're low-balling you on payday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' response: Great, I'll go play for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a fourth-round draft pick by the Giants, backed up Jumbo Elliott and 
Doug Riesenberg for three seasons, playing in only 10 regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
 But five months after leaving the Giants, Jones is earning more money -- and 
respect -- as the Rams' starting left tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last five weeks, he has shut down some of the league's best pass 
rushers -- Atlanta's Chris Doleman, Kansas City's Derrick Thomas, San 
Francisco's Rickey Jackson and Green Bay's Sean Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for somebody expected to be the mop-up guy for Wayne Gandy, the Rams' 
first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed to get out of New York and see what I could do," Jones said. "I had 
to know: Could I play in this league or not?" 
</P>
<P>
 Six games into the season, the Rams are convinced Jones can play left tackle, 
one of the toughest positions to learn. The tackle must protect a right-handed 
quarterback's blind side and regularly face the opponent's top defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering Sunday's game against the Giants, Jones has given up only three sacks 
-- one in the last five weeks -- after Arizona's Clyde Simmons beat him twice 
in the season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 In two games against Doleman, he held the six-time Pro Bowl selection without 
a sack. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a five-time Pro Bowl pick -- no sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, six Pro Bowls -- no sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Jones, who played in his first Pro Bowl last season -- one sack. 
</P>
<P>
 With a new Pro Bowl player in Jones' face each week, who has been the toughest 
to stop? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say because they present so many problems in so many different 
ways," Jones said. "Thomas' quickness, Clyde's strength, Chris Doleman had 
both, and Sean Jones' long arms and leverage -- all are equally difficult, I 
guess." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams signed Jones, 6 feet 6 and 280 pounds, as an afterthought in May. But 
now he stands out on a struggling offensive line that has been plagued by 
injuries and penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive line has committed 23 penalties for 175 yards this season, but 
only one called on Jones -- a 10-yard illegal-use-of-hands call in the second 
half of a 16-0 victory over Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones and right guard Leo Goeas are the only opening-day starters still on the 
offensive line. Guard Keith Loneker is out for the season with a fallen arch. 
Center Bern Brostek is out at least a month with a sprained ankle and broken 
bone in his leg. Right tackle Jackie Slater is out three weeks with a slight 
tear in his triceps muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jones just keeps going and going and going . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "When all is said and done," offensive line coach Jim Erkenbeck said, 
"Clarence and (guard-center) Tom Newberry have been the pleasant surprises in 
my area so far this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clarence is a different kind of athlete, and I didn't expect him to do the 
kind of things that he has done here." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' escape from New York came when the Giants withdrew a $287,000 
qualifying offer, cut him and wanted to re-sign him for less because of salary 
cap problems. Jones turned down the offer and sought work elsewhere as an 
unrestricted free agent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was in my best interest to get out of there (New York) and try to either 
become a player or not become a player," he said. "At the end of the season, I 
didn't have the experience that somebody my age needed to play well and 
perform." 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia, Green Bay, Atlanta, Cleveland and San Francisco showed interest, 
but Jones thought his best chance to play was with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really unproven in New York," said George Mavrikes, Jones' agent. "He 
had the talent, but he never got a chance. He played behind two Pro Bowl 
tackles who hardly ever got hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has great feet, talent, size, intelligence, but a lot of people are going 
to forget about that when he's sitting on the bench. I don't know how many 
people other than his parents and I knew that he could play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams didn't think so after working him out in the off-season, but they 
brought him in as a backup after they drafted Gandy in late April. 
</P>
<P>
 He agreed to a two-year deal for $750,000, including a $100,000 signing bonus, 
pretty decent money for a backup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt like we were getting a guy who could perform at two different 
positions (right and left tackle) and be a superior backup," Erkenbeck said. 
"He was forced into a starting spot . . . he actually won the starting spot, 
and has performed beyond my expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Mavrikes said the Rams took a big chance on Jones, considering the money they 
gave him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to give (Ram director of pro personnel) Jack Faulkner a lot of 
credit," Mavrikes said, "he had some vision there. The past few weeks, the rest 
of the league has been calling me and saying, 'Damn George, Jones can play.' "

WILSON'S RECOVERY COMPLETE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fact that Ernie Wilson of Rancho Santiago was healthy enough to play last 
week was as surprising to Coach Dave Ogas as it was to trainer Gary Kinney. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson wasn't shocked at all when he took the field against Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 The doubt started in the Dons' Sept. 24 game against Palomar at San Marcos 
High School. Wilson, a sophomore running back, took a direct hit on his left 
knee from a helmet. He was hit from behind at the same time, so his knee didn't 
give at all. Kinney and his staff rushed onto the field, but Wilson was able to 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got up and walked to the sideline," Wilson said. "It didn't seem like it 
was hurt that bad." 
</P>
<P>
 But the sideline diagnosis wasn't encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 It was estimated that Wilson would miss at least two, most likely four, and 
possibly six weeks. But two days after the injury, Wilson was able to jog and 
had full flexibility of his knee with no pain. 
</P>
<P>
 He wore a brace for a week and missed the Long Beach game the next week, but 
he returned last Saturday. He gained 112 yards and scored two touchdowns as 
Rancho Santiago won, 47-24. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to contribute," said Wilson, 20. "I know they wouldn't miss me. 
We have some good backs and the line is doing a great job." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons average 237 yards per game rushing, second best in the Mission 
Conference. Wilson leads with 305 yards. Kevin Pola has 244, including 103 
against Riverside. Ace Riggins, who replaced Wilson, has 173 yards rushing, 
including a 74-yard touchdown run on the second play of the game against 
Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best backfield I've ever been part of," said Wilson, a 
three-sport standout at El Modena. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not afraid to take on a defender, Wilson is better known for his 
speed. He gained 815 yards as a freshman last season but also was a standout 
kickoff returner. He returned a kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Wilson was part of the Dons' 400- and 1,600-meter relay teams 
that won Orange Empire Conference titles. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's Mission Conference Central Division games: 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West (1-3-1, 1-0) vs. Rancho Santiago (3-1, 1-0), Santa Ana Stadium, 
1:30 p.m. -- Rancho Santiago, which started the season unranked in any poll, is 
third in Southern California and ranked 18th in the nation by the J.C. 
Grid-Wire. The Dons piled up 610 yards in total offense in a 47-24 loss to 
Riverside last Saturday. Golden West broke out of an early-season tailspin with 
a 7-6 victory over Orange Coast. Mark Crowley of Golden West rushed for a 
career-high 147 yards against OCC. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback (0-3-1, 0-0-1) vs. Fullerton (1-2-1, 0-0), Fullerton District 
Stadium, 7 p.m. -- Fullerton moves back to its former home field for 
homecoming. The Hornets have been playing at Cal State Fullerton for the last 
three seasons. Saddleback leads the all-time series, 5-4, winning the last 
four. Fullerton wide receiver Steve Correa has 25 catches for 480 yards and two 
touchdowns. Saddleback defensive backs Scott Patton and James Ligons each have 
three interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast (0-4) at San Diego Mesa (2-2), 6 p.m. -- OCC running back Jeff 
Clayton needs six yards to become the Pirates' all-time rushing leader. He has 
1,868 yards and has had more than 100 yards in 10 of his 15 games in two 
seasons at OCC. The Pirates have beaten San Diego Mesa four of five times under 
Coach Bill Workman.

PENALTIES EMERGING AS CHAPMAN'S TOUGHEST FOE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Little has gone wrong for Chapman in its first football season in 62 years. 
The Panthers, 3-0-1 entering their game at 7 tonight at Occidental, have rolled 
over their opponents, 137-59, and were only challenged in the tie with 
Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
 So Chapman's main weakness -- getting flagged for too many penalties -- hasn't 
been a major problem, yet. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the potential that has Chapman Coach Ken Visser a bit concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was frustrated," Visser said after the Panthers were penalized 16 times for 
127 yards in their 59-18 victory over Azusa Pacific last week. "I've yelled at 
them. I've rewarded them when they didn't do it. I've punished them when they 
do. I've been positive. I've been negative and we still seem to have too many 
penalties." 
</P>
<P>
 In four games, Chapman has been penalized 39 times and is losing an average of 
91 yards a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Most maddening, Visser said, are the penalties that seem so unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody will push somebody kind of from the side and it's called a clip and 
it's 10 yards behind the play," Visser said. "You just ask, 'Why did you do 
it?' "It's hard to really pinpoint because first it's this guy and then it's 
that guy. It may still be a reflection of a younger program. They haven't 
played together a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Visser is intimately familiar with Occidental, having played linebacker there 
in 1965 and '66 and coached there from 1967-71. As a player, he helped the 
Tigers to the 1966 conference title. When he was defensive coordinator in 1971, 
they won another. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always get a nostalgic feeling when I go back to Occidental," Visser said. 
"I have good memories of that place." 
</P>
<P>
 This Occidental team is 4-0, having defeated Menlo, Whittier, Cal Lutheran and 
Pomona-Pitzer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers run a triple-option offense, which is second in the Southern 
California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference in rushing with 246 yards per 
game. Occidental ranks last in passing (34.5 a game), but Visser said that's 
partly because the Tigers haven't needed to throw the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman has been strong against the run, giving up 87.5 rushing yards a game. 
But opponents have passed for an average of 202.3 yards.

DISCOVERIES: INSIDE & OUT; TANK WITH A TRUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNDI Y. NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to fishbowls, no one does it quite like Tom Wise. 
</P>
<P>
 With a flair for the dramatic, Los Angeles sculptor Wise has crafted a 
functional aquarium out of acrylic, in the shape of an Indian elephant. 
</P>
<P>
 The free-form, 300-gallon elephant, with hand-carved howdah and pedestal, is 
10 feet tall overall. The acrylic pachyderm, which has an aqua tint to it for 
better viewing of the fish, is 6 1/2 feet long by 3 feet wide by 5 feet tall. 
</P>
<P>
 The tusks, trunk and toes are embellished with gold leaf. The tank filter pump 
and electrical hookup are concealed in the pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise, who prefers to create monument-size pieces, chose acrylic because he 
feels it really comes to life. "It has a glow about it all the time. It looks 
just like crystal." 
</P>
<P>
 Why an elephant for a fish tank? "Elephants are in the water constantly," said 
Wise, an animal lover. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise, 49, endured some trying times during the 2 1/2 years it took him to 
perfect his molding techniques. He was inside the belly of the elephant in his 
Valencia studio when the Northridge earthquake hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I thought it was some of the guys playing around with the dolly (on 
which the elephant stood), but then I realized it was an earthquake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaning the tank is a breeze: You drain it and climb inside. "It takes about 
five minutes to swab it down," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paying for it, however, would not be so easy for the average person. 
</P>
<P>
 The aquarium, available through the 1994 Neiman Marcus Christmas Book (800) 
825-8781, costs $120,000. Fish not included. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on the elephant or other designs by Wise, call (805)

</P>
<P>
 Teatime turns downright zany when John Groth of Hillsboro, Ore., puts the 
kettle on. 
</P>
<P>
 His porcelain pots named for everyday phrases and puns bring giggles and 
smiles to any tea party. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his 16 designs are an "alligator purse," a bag with an alligator in the 
middle; a doggie bag, a brown paper sack with a dog in it, and "monkey 
business," which, according to Groth's friends, is a self-portrait. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the teapots are functional, which wasn't an easy task. "After all, each 
one has to have a spout, a handle and a lid." To layer on color, Groth 
sometimes fires one teapot four or five times. 
</P>
<P>
 Groth, 34, a Wisconsin native who majored in art at Portland State, started 
tinkering in ceramics at age 12. Through the years, he has developed his own 
nontoxic glazes, clays and colored underglazes.  
</P>
<P>
 His pieces have a brilliant luster and sparkle because he paints on the 
overglazes by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Groth's teapots ($95 plus shipping and handling) can be purchased from the 
Perennial Tea Room in Seattle. 
</P>

 Limbs and branches of dead trees are fodder for furnishings such as book 
stands, shelves, spoons, room dividers and mirror frames by Richard Evans and 
Sherry Ford.  
</P>
<P>
 For their Reversion collection, Evans and Ford of Laguna Beach gathered elm, 
eucalyptus, willow and orange from around the county. Raw branches and logs are 
gathered, "bugs, termites and all," said Ford. The pieces are then dried, 
cleaned and sliced, before sanding and finishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very careful to look at each piece, so the (grain pattern) is preserved 
when cut," Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each work includes a handwritten "source story" card, which tells about the 
type of wood used, where it came from, and in some cases, the age of the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 No stains are used to enhance the grain. Ford and Evans use a natural Danish 
oil that penetrates the wood and gives it a low-luster finish. It also leaves a 
barrier against moisture, so spills will not soak in. 
</P>
<P>
 The next dead tree destined for Reversion is an avocado tree at the Phoenix 
House in Santa Ana. It has not shown signs of life for three years. "The trees 
we use have to be really dead trees," said Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for book holders start at $125. The Reversion collection is carried at 
the Cook's Garden and Areo in Laguna Beach, and the Laguna Art Museum at South 
Coast Plaza. For custom pieces, call (714) 497-6255.
