METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ANGELES NATIONAL 
FOREST; THREE MISSING BIKERS TURN UP IN RESTAURANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three missing mountain bikers found their own way out of the Angeles National 
Forest on Monday, drove to breakfast at a restaurant and were surprised to 
learn that a rescue team had been searching for them, a Sheriff's Department 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three bikers -- Lawrence Martinez, 25, of Pasadena, Saul Mares, 26, of 
Huntington Park, and Bobby Capps, 22, of Los Angeles, all employees of Century 
Cable in Eagle Rock -- had begun their outing from a trail gate near the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in La Canada Flintridge.Relatives on Monday reported them 
missing when they failed to return Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montrose Search and Rescue team began looking for the men at 9 a.m. 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the three men spent the night in the forest, biked their way out in the 
morning to a parked car at Red Box, a site near Mt. Wilson, and had breakfast. 
They returned to the trail gate to retrieve a second parked car, "unaware that 
we were searching for them," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies did not know whether the men had originally planned to 
spend the night in the forest or whether they had gotten lost.

MORNING BRIEFING: THE RANGERS WOULDN'T TRADE (FIRST) PLACES WITH ANYONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stop telling the Texas Rangers how lucky they are to be leading the American 
League West with a 42-45 record, which would put them in last place in the 
American League Central. 
</P>
<P>
 But they aren't in the AL Central, so there. Even so, the Rangers are the 
first team in major league history to be in first place at the All-Star break 
with a losing record. Obviously, it's all realignment's fault, which matters 
not a bit to the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Said reliever Tom Henke, "If you don't like it, then put it back the way it 
was." 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Kevin Kennedy said his team is in first place and nothing else is 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would we feel that much better if we were playing .700 ball and somebody else 
was playing .750 ball and we were eight games out?" Kennedy said. "I don't 
think so." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the Dodger record for most home runs by a right-handed 
hitter? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Flash: Happy birthday to longtime Times sports editor Paul Zimmerman, 91, who 
lives in Lake Forest in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: The first baseball All-Star game in California was played at the Coliseum 
on Aug. 3, 1959, which the American League won, 5-3, on Yogi Berra's two-run 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight more have been played in California -- two at San Francisco, two at San 
Diego, two at Anaheim Stadium, one at Dodger Stadium and one at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bulletin board: UCLA might be interested in Page 141 of "Rough Magic, Bill 
Walsh's Return to Stanford Football," by Lowell Cohn. 
</P>
<P>
 Said assistant coach Scott Schuhmann of the Bruins, "They are very skilled, 
but they're not tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Tom Williams called them "a bunch of pretty boys who play football 
in Westwood. They wear powder-blue uniforms and they never take anyone apart." 
</P>
<P>
 The book is about the 1992 season, so Schuhmann and Williams are no longer 
around. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Fennis anyone? Remember Fennis Dembo? The former Wyoming basketball player, 
who had seven three-pointers and 41 points against UCLA in the 1987 NCAA 
tournament, is trying to make it this week in the Cleveland Cavaliers' camp for 
rookies and free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyoming fans won't easily forget Dembo. In Laramie, Dembo tended to stand out 
enough, but to make sure, he had an arrow shaved into his hairdo. Jim 
Brandenburg, who was Dembo's coach at the time, told him to get rid of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dembo: "He outlawed any cranial designs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But he earned it: While we're waiting to see if Glenn Robinson gets his 
$100-million contract with the Milwaukee Bucks, it's worth remembering that Bob 
Cousy's top salary was $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rumor mill: For what it's worth, the Boston Globe reported that Georgetown 
Coach John Thompson has discussed the Clippers' vacant coaching job and 
suggested to owner Donald Sterling that a five-year deal worth more than $7.5 
million might be acceptable. 
</P>

 Trivia answer: Gil Hodges, 42 in 1954.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 I give four stars out of a possible four to an All-Star game that was 
dramatic, high-scoring and enhanced by an Ozzie Smith fielding gem. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe now, Fred McGriff will be what it should have been long ago, a household 
name. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The mark of Mike Piazza, the competitor, is that he chokes only in home run 
hitting contests. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 My vote in the balloting for the most memorable L.A. Dodger home run went to 
Kirk Gibson's in the first game of the 1988 World Series against Oakland at 
Dodger Stadium. Second would be Rick Monday's in the fifth game of the 1981 
National League championship series at Montreal. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 After watching the tape of Brett Butler's catch against the New York Mets a 
half-dozen times, I've come to the conclusion that it was underrated. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't long ago that a lot of baseball people said Barry Larkin was the 
player they would pick first to build a franchise around, if they had the 
opportunity. However, Barry Bonds, Frank Thomas, Ken Griffey Jr. and Piazza, 
among others, have zoomed ahead of the Cincinnati shortstop. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I wonder who will be the starter, setup man, and closer Saturday night during 
the three tenors' concert at Dodger Stadium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Tony Danza shows some impressive pitching form in "Angels in the Outfield." 
One of the biggest crowds of the year at Three Rivers Stadium, 35,000, watched 
the premiere of the movie on three screens Sunday night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think ABC might be rooting for a Brazil-Italy World Cup final Sunday 
rather than, say, Bulgaria-Sweden? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 By popular demand, the Forum is moving its last three scheduled Friday night 
boxing shows to Monday night dates. That means the card scheduled July 22 will 
be held July 25, instead. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the Seattle Seahawks are so bullish on quarterback Rick Mirer is 
his durability. He missed only 28 of 1,019 Seahawk plays during his rookie 
season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If I ran the sports section in St. Louis, I would give a lot of space to Ram 
games this season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Cincinnati Bengals are still $6 million under the NFL salary cap and the 
Rams $3.8 million under. The Raiders are only $34,000 under, meaning they would 
have to drop someone to sign Tom Rathman. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' Family Day will be at 11:15 a.m. July 23 at Channel Islands High 
in Oxnard. Art Shell and his coaching staff will conduct a clinic, there will 
be an autograph and photo session with the players, and the Raiderettes will 
perform at the annual event that is open,free of charge, to the public. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Next great college quarterback from Orange County could be Scott Covington 
from Dana Hills High, who will be a freshman at Miami this season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The only thing separating jockey Alex Solis from stardom is a big horse. With 
a boost from agent Harry (the Hat) Hacek, Solis appears a cinch to win the 
Hollywood Park riding title. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Keep an eye on 2-year-old colt Mr. Purple, a son of Deputy Minister. Trainer 
Ron McAnally plans to jump him from a recent maiden victory into the $100,000 
Hollywood Juvenile Championship on July 25. . . .  
</P>

 Cobi Jones and Eric Wynalda will play for the United States and former World 
Cup team members Junior, Edinho and Adao for Brazil in a professional beach 
soccer game at 3 p.m. Friday in a 5,000-seat outdoor stadium near the Hermosa 
Beach Pier. Admission is free. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 After watching Clipper rookie Eric Piatkowski win most-valuable-player honors 
in the Desert Classic, Bill Fitch, who coached Larry Bird for four seasons, 
said, "Piatkowski runs the floor a lot like Bird. His character and the way he 
carries himself out there, I can't help feeling I've seen that before." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the best undrafted NBA prospects, center Kevin Salvadori of North 
Carolina and forward Kendrick Warren of Virginia Commonwealth, are playing for 
the Lakers' pro summer league team at UC Irvine. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Add Earl Strom: NBA coaches loved to have him referee their road games, but 
not so much their home games. He went out of his way to be fair to the visiting 
team. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dick Butkus, Joe Morgan, Bill Sharman, Don Newcombe and Walt Hazzard are among 
those who will participate in the Jackie Robinson Invitational Golf Classic 
Monday at Riviera. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I will be rooting for Kim Williams in the U.S. Women's Open. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The New York Rangers, who had four Russians on their Stanley Cup championship 
team, drafted four more. A few years ago, they would have been known as the 
Broadway Reds.

 At Giants Stadium East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy vs. Bulgaria 
</P>
<P>
 * TIME: 1 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 * TV: ESPN, Univision. 
</P>
<P>
 * KEY MATCHUPS: The Bulgarians need to stop the Baggios. The Italians need to 
stop Stoitchkov. This one is that simple. Roberto and Dino Baggio -- you've 
read 100 times that they are not related -- have combined to bring Italy from 
the brink of elimination to the threshold of their fifth World Cup finale. The 
Baggios have combined on five of Italy's six goals. Dino's have given Italy a 
short-handed victory over Norway and broken a scoreless tie with Spain. 
Roberto's last-minute goals have beaten Nigeria and Spain. The Bulgarian 
defenders, however, think they can end all this. Since losing to Nigeria in 
their opener, 3-0, they have not given up a goal on anything other than a 
penalty kick. Leading the defensive stand will be the trio of Petar Houbtchev, 
Zlatko Iankov and Trifon Ivanov. The task of the Italian defense is just as 
formidable. It must stop Hristo Stoitchkov, who is big, fast and surly. 
Stoitchkov has scored five of his team's nine goals on eight shots inside the 
penalty area. He doesn't miss much. The Italian defense will be handicapped by 
the loss of Mauro Tassotti, who was suspended after breaking Spaniard Luis 
Enrique's nose in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTLOOK: Knowing the controlling nature of the World Cup Organizing 
Committee, there might be a clause that prohibits lightning striking twice at 
the same venue. The truth is, it can't happen here. The Italians won't have to 
go down to the wire this time. Italy has improved every game, to the point that 
it is probably the best team left in the tournament. If the Bulgarians 
concentrate on stopping the Baggios, then who is going to guard Giuseppe 
Signori or Daniele Massaro? They are only two of the best scorers in the world. 
Italy is too deep for the Bulgarians. 
</P>
<P>
 * OUTCOME: We said Bulgaria would not beat Germany in our lifetime. Oh, well. 
Another day, another lifetime. And we will say it again: There is no way 
Bulgaria can defeat Italy. Frankly, the only thing the Bulgarians have going 
for them is that we are picking against them. Italy by two. BILL PLASCHKE

 FOR $25? 
</P>
<P>
 A court in Bangladesh has summoned the head of the international soccer 
federation to reply to a suit filed by a fan of Argentina's Diego Maradona who 
claims to have suffered a breakdown since his idol was expelled from World Cup 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 "The expulsion of Maradona was illegal," plaintiff Khan Mohammad Anwarul 
Wadud, a lawyer, contended in his complaint. "This has caused my mental 
breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
 A lower court on Sunday called on FIFA President Joao Havelange to reply in 
person to Wadud's suit, and a judge, Mahbubul Islam, instructed him to appear 
Aug 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Few countries' fans rival the ardor of Bangladesh's, and Wadud claimed that 
Maradona's expulsion after failing a drug test was preying on his mind 
constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm suffering financial loss because I can't concentrate on my work," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer seeks token damages of 1,000 taka, or about $25, from the FIFA 
president. He told local journalists Monday that he was still trying to figure 
out how to serve Havelange with the summons.

 The last time Italy played an Eastern European country in a World Cup game 
this big, it defeated Hungary for the 1938 championship, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Hungarian goalkeeper Antal Szabo said, "I have never felt so proud 
in my life. We may have lost the match, but we have saved 11 lives. The Italian 
players received a telegram from Rome before the game which read, 'Win or die.' 
Now they can go home heroes." 
</P>
<P>
 That telegram was reportedly sent by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini. BILL

<P>
 In a sport in which being built close to the ground has always been 
preferable, the issue of height is getting much discussion in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, among the criticisms facing Coach Migel Mejia Baron is that, when 
he got down to penalty kicks against Bulgaria in his round-of-16 loss last 
week, his goalkeeper, Jorge Campos, was a tad short.The critics are saying 
Felix Fernandez would have been a better choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos is 5-feet-9, Fernandez 5-11. 
</P>
<P>
 German Coach Berti Vogts pointed to a height mismatch as a major mistake on 
Bulgaria's winning goal by 5-10 Yordan Letchkov. Letchkov headed the ball into 
the goal while being guarded by Germany's Thomas Haessler, who is 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there was 6-4 Kennet Andersson of Sweden, easily leaping over 5-10 
Florin Prunea, Romania's goalie, to head in the tying goal and allow Sweden to 
get into penalty kicks and win Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Roland Nilsson, who passed to Andersson, was quoted in Tuesday's New York 
Times as saying, "I think Prunea thought he had that ball easily, and then all 
of a sudden, he had this 6-4 guy jumping right over him." BILL DWYRE

 He's no bandwagon jumper, honest, but Seamus Malin, analyst for ABC and ESPN 
on World Cup telecasts, says he predicted Romania and Bulgaria would do well in 
the tournament.Perhaps not quite as well as Bulgaria reaching the semifinals, 
but he expected good performances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that the players are free to move to better circumstances -- and make 
money -- it affects their motivation. . . ," he said. "I thought they'd get to 
the quarterfinals, but the semis, that's a surprise. Bulgaria has caught 
lightning in a bottle." HELENE ELLIOTT

 Not surprisingly, the best thing about the World Cup for the Swedes is that is 
has been quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it has been perfect," Coach Tommy Svensson said. "It has been a good 
atmosphere at the games. Many matches have been very spectacular, with a lot of 
scoring. Outside (the stadiums), I don't think it has been that hysterical, as 
it can be in Spain, in Italy." RANDY HARVEY

 "That this Cup is not showing quality football is evident. . . . Italy is not 
even worth discussing, because its game is like an anti-show. But the fact that 
Bulgaria is in the semifinals is enough to believe that this sport is beginning 
to require revision.I'm happy for (Bulgarian forward Hristo) Stoitchkov, who 
now must be wildly happy. But, in fact, neither he nor any of his teammates can 
actually believe they are in the semifinals, because they're the first ones to 
recognize their own limitations as a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bulgaria's style is football-chaos, with two good organizers -- (Krasimir) 
Balakov and (Yordan) Lechkov -- and two forwards -- Stoitchkov and (Emil) 
Kostadinov -- on the front line, but that's it. And as if this weren't bad 
enough, they don't play as a team. It's every man for himself."

 The Daily Telegraph reported that the World Cup has been a huge success in 
Great Britain for the bookmakers, many of whom expect USA '94 to produce the 
biggest volume of any sports event since betting shops were legalized in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham Sharpe, betting expert at bookmaker William Hill, "the man who would 
normally spend the summer offering odds about temperatures on ministry roofs, 
the chance of snow on Christmas Day, 2000, or the sighting of Elvis Presley," 
had no doubt about the success. 
</P>
<P>
 "This World Cup will generate $90 million," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest single bet at William Hill was $160,000, at 11-10, on Mexico over 
Bulgaria. Mexico lost on penalty kicks.

 "Whatever the sting may bring to the tale, this has become the most memorable 
World Cup in a quarter of a century. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gamble of taking the game to America, for reasons of commerce first, 
sport second, has paid off in a way no one could have imagined.For while the 
host nation tries to come to terms with the body blows to the sporting ethic of 
O.J. Simpson, Mike Tyson and Tonya Harding, soccer, which many swore was alien 
to U.S. culture, has scored bonus points for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hundreds of thousands of spectators have attended 48 matches so far without 
sight or sign of violence. . . . Above all, we are enjoying the element of 
surprise that spices up life and is vital to sports. We are seeing the 
reaffirmation that soccer knows no bounds of culture, class or creed, and that 
11 players from just about anywhere can knock 11 supposed sporting gods out of 
the biggest tournament on earth."

 Roberto Baggio, Italy's forward who was voted the best player in the world in 
1993, originally was supposed to wear No. 17 after a random distribution of 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 But the man who missed a crucial penalty kick in the 1990 World Cup in Italy, 
Roberto Donadoni, wore No. 17 at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials quickly grabbed the jersey off Baggio's back and handed him No. 10.

FISHING REPORT: BASS ACTION UNAFFECTED BY THE HEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some things never change . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Trout fisheries might be suffering because of the heat, and catfish fisheries 
might be coming on for the same reason, but the Southland's two primary bass 
fisheries seem unfazed by the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Andrews of Oxnard showed it is as easy to land a trophy-sized bass as it 
was in early spring at Lake Casitas, pulling a 10-pound 3-ounce bass and 
another 7-12 fish out of the Ventura County reservoir. Mike Carpenter of Canyon 
Country made it look even easier at Castaic Lake, landing three fish over the 
10-pound mark, none at 12-5.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: MAMMALS MAKE A WHALE OF A SURPRISE RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're back . . . 
</P>
<P>
 When it seemed the whale-watching season was over, along come the biggest 
whales of them all. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue whales, and the smaller but equally unusual humpback whales, have taken 
up temporary residence in the Santa Barbara Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many on Sunday that people were stopping along (U.S. 101) to 
get a look," said Capt. Fred Benko of the Condor, an 88-foot vessel out of Sea 
Landing in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 The concentration of blues and humpbacks is believed to be the largest in the 
area since 1992, when up to 200 blues and even more humpbacks stuck around for 
most of the summer, feeding on krill, planktonic crustaceans that have ridden 
the currents into the channel. 
</P>
<P>
 Benko said the majestic mammals spent hours around his boat Sunday, and the 
dive boat Truth reported hundreds playing off San Miguel Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Whale experts say the appearance is unusual, but not rare, citing similar 
phenomena off Monterey in 1986 and the Farallon Islands in 1990. Still, they 
are stirring up some late-season whale-watching. 
</P>
<P>
 Benko has changed some of his fishing trips to whale-watch/fishing 
combinations and has scheduled some days solely for the whales. 
</P>
<P>
 CISCO Sportfishing in Oxnard is sending an airplane out today to see if the 
whales are close enough to make the trips worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll make a decision by Friday," said Russ Harmon, owner of the landing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Southlanders, the sight of gray whales as they migrate down the coast each 
winter, then back up in the spring is nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is believed there are only about 5,000 blues left in the world and they 
are, as Benko points out, the largest creatures ever to inhabit the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 They reach lengths of 100 feet and weights of more than 100 tons. 
</P>
<P>
 Benko might also throw in a few little-known facts: That the tongue of one 
blue whale weighs more than a 5 1/2-ton African elephant, that its heart is 
larger than a Volkswagen. On a trip in 1992, he pointed to a spouting whale and 
told his passengers, "That air you see coming out of the blowhole? It comes out 
about 300 m.p.h." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Albacore anyone? Rumor has it that the Millie G, a commercial jig boat from 
Morro Bay, picked up 15 albacore Saturday 30 miles from the landing. Trouble 
is, nobody has been able to reach the boat's owner to verify the rumor. 
</P>
<P>
 Until it is confirmed, a spokeswoman for Virg's Landing in Morro Bay said, its 
sportfishing boats will remain close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 Until any tuna show either off Central California or San Diego, the best bet 
locally for big game fishermen will be anywhere there are squid. The rubbery 
crustaceans, a favorite food of white sea bass, are reportedly abundant at the 
northern Channel Islands. The CISCO Sportfishing fleet found them on Monday, 
and bagged 43 seabass.

 Outside linebacker Roman Phifer suffered another strain of his right hamstring

it was a mild strain, similar to one Phifer suffered in workouts last week.

<P>
 "We're not going to push it this week," Anderson said. "We want him ready for 
the start of training camp next week." 
</P>

 The four-day pre-camp workouts will end Thursday, but the rookies and free 
agents will return next Monday for three more days of workouts. Players will 
report for training camp physicals July 21 at UC Irvine, with workouts 
beginning there the next day. MIKE REILLEY

MUSIC REVIEW; VAN CLIBURN DISCONCERTED; PIANIST ABORTS ERRATIC PROGRAM MIDWAY 
THROUGH 
</P>

<P>
 The Van Cliburn concert at Hollywood Bowl on Monday was supposed to be 
special. And it was, ultimately for the wrong reason. 
</P>
<P>
 It ended up being half a concert. 
</P>
<P>
 After an apparently uneventful San Diego tryout, the world's most celebrated 
keyboard dropout was beginning his long-anticipated comeback tour. It would be 
his first extended tour since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 The marathon agenda should have included two -- count 'em, two -- signature 
showpieces, both arduous, not to mention Copland's "Lincoln Portrait" with the 
sometimes overachieving Cliburn working as narrator. The all-American superhero 
would even perform his own transcription of the "Star-Spangled Banner" as 
patriotic foreplay. 
</P>
<P>
 The festivities were designed to recall the eternally boyish virtuoso's 
breakthrough success in the Soviet Union 36 years ago. A conductor and 
accompanying orchestra were brought in all the way from Moscow, for sentimental 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The local concert would commemorate Cliburn's imminent 60th birthday 
(Tuesday). Not coincidentally, it would also kick off the classical-music 
portion of official World Cup brouhaha in Los Angeles, which ends on Saturday 
with the three-tenor circus at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the first half of the program did not turn out to be an artistic 
triumph, it did proceed without hitch. Then came the hitches, beginning with an 
intermission that almost refused to end. The natives became restless, and 
resorted to rhythmic clapping to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience -- tabulated, generously perhaps, at 14,035 -- knew something was 
wrong at 10:25 when the anonymous but ominous voice of our resident orchestral 
guru, Ernest Fleischmann, announced that Cliburn was "feeling slightly 
indisposed." The crowd groaned en masse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll let you know in a few minutes what happens," Fleischmann added. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon a tuxedoed gentleman appeared with an armful of scores, which he began to 
distribute to the obviously bemused instrumentalists. He retreated backstage, 
however, before completing his task. The orchestra, we later learned, was 
prepared to play Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony in place of Rachmaninoff's Third 
Piano Concerto in case of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleischmann eventually returned to the PA system, asking for the audience's 
continued patience. Finally a stagehand set up a microphone near the piano, 
and, at 10:32, Cliburn reappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 He felt "light-headed," he apologized. He had endured "a dizzy spell." A 
doctor -- his own, we discovered -- had taken his blood pressure. In place of 
the big concerto with orchestra, he would just play "a couple of encores -- 
solo." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it went, sadly. Cliburn aborted the scheduled marathon and reduced the 
second, potentially climactic, half of his comeback concert to four relatively 
easy pieces (which he didn't deem worth identifying). The potentially grandiose 
gesture gave way to a few intimate flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, at 10:53, the protagonist thanked the reasonably indulgent audience, 
and, as he said good night, voiced a benediction: "I can't tell you how much 
you have inspired and thrilled me." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he was ambushed onstage by a couple of guys in Texas mufti: singer Johnny 
Mathis and pop-record producer David Foster. They bore a monstrous birthday 
card in the shape of a piano. It was signed, they proclaimed, by Ron Reagan and 
Neil Simon, among others. Foster manned the piano while Mathis placed his 
cowboy hat on Cliburn's head and led the throng in a slightly premature chorus 
of "Happy Birthday." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Cliburn explained that Mathis and Foster are personal friends 
of the pianist. The spokesman didn't know whether the well-wishing Reagan was 
senior or junior. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one of those nights. The word, I think, is bizarre. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What's that? You want to know about the music-making? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh dear. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliburn's version of the national anthem whispered like a lullaby in the wide 
open spaces. The crowd sang along in a reverential hush. 
</P>
<P>
 Vassily Sinaisky and the Moscow Philharmonic countered with what must be the 
anthem of the new Russia. " 'God Save the Czar'?" quipped an irreverent 
revisionist out front. The performance, in any case, turned out to be the most 
impassioned orchestral effort of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muscovites seemed a bit confused by the stark Americana of Copland's 
"Lincoln Portrait," striving for plush emotion where the composer wanted bleak 
restraint. Cliburn read the text with dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 The Piano Concerto No. 1 in B-flat, a.k.a. Tchaikovsky's Greatest Hit, did not 
go very well. Cliburn's playing was erratic -- a strange compendium of 
compelling insights and smudged evasions. His fabled technique seemed 
prodigious one moment, unreliable the next. The rhetoric moved in odd spurts, 
the expressive impulses vacillating between the urgent and the dutiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliburn was most persuasive in the simple lyricism of the Andantino. 
Unfortunately, a large portion of the audience didn't stick around to hear it. 
Many of the fans apparently thought the concerto ended with the first movement. 
</P>
<P>
 It is impossible to know whether Cliburn fell victim to comeback nerves, 
whether the long sabbatical in his checkered career has taken its toll, or 
whether he was ill. It is possible to speculate, in any case, that he was 
disconcerted, quite literally, by the rough and seemingly unready, strident and 
scrambly accompaniment provided by Sinaisky and what now passes for the Moscow 
Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called encores that comprised the impromptu portion of the event found 
a more relaxed Cliburn playing with greater finesse, at least some of the time. 
The hemidemisemirecital included a portentous Szymanowski Etude and a lovely 
performance of Liszt's transcription of Schumann's "Widmung" followed by rather 
ponderous approximations of Debussy's "La terrasse des audiences du clair de 
lune" and Chopin's Scherzo in C-sharp minor. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Incidental intelligence: 
</P>
<P>
 * The amplification system at the Bowl, newly renovated, introduced some 
grotesque distortions of its own. From the rear section of the lower boxes, the 
piano sounded like a bleary calliope submerged in blurry molasses. The 
orchestra sounded tinny and tubby beyond nature. 
</P>
<P>
 * The skimpy program booklet provided no annotations on the music. It didn't 
even identify the key signature of the missing Rachmaninoff concerto. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fancy lighting effects transformed two of Frank Gehry's acoustical orbs into 
soccer balls. 
</P>
<P>
 * The top ticket cost $250.

IMAGES OF THE HUMAN LANDSCAPE; PHOTOGRAPHY: FROM RWANDA'S CIVIL WAR TO HIS 
EIGHT-YEAR 'WORKERS' PROJECT, SEBASTIAO SALGADO DOCUMENTS LIFE'S HARSH 
REALITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sebastiao Salgado is not as well as he appears. The photographer has just 
returned from the refugee camps of Tanzania, the war-ravaged streets and hills 
of Rwanda, the slowly rebuilding society of Mozambique, only to find himself 
suffering from malaria. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilian-born photographer, whose work can be seen at the Fahey/Klein 
Gallery through Sept. 3, seems relaxed and fit enough this morning in his Paris 
loft, surrounded by black-and-white prints, posters and magazines featuring 
some of his epic, emotionally rich images of beauty and profound suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is an acute seriousness in Salgado's face, the crisp blue eyes, the 
graying red mustache. Still attached to his wristwatch is the compass that 
helped him return after following refugees deep into the bush of Mozambique. 
Beneath his sweater a trio of abscesses fester on his body, a symptom of a 
bacterial infection. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's nothing, that's nothing," Salgado, 49, says in English, one of 
four languages he speaks. He notes that he will travel to Africa several times 
this year. "What's important is that you believe this work is important, that 
this is your life, that you must tell something that is happening." 
</P>
<P>
 That work has in the last decade made Salgado one of the most influential, if 
sometimes controversial, documentary photographers now working. His recent 
pictures of Rwanda's civil war horrors -- of men, women and children turned 
into refugees, or butchered by the tens of thousands -- offer a grim, ravaged 
human landscape, published simultaneously in Paris Match, the New York Times 
Magazine and Germany's Stern magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Salgado's massive eight-year "Workers" project, which documented the final 
days of manual labor, before machines and computers finally took over 
production, is the subject of at least five museum and gallery shows touring 
the world. The recently completed "Workers" photos were published as a 400-page 
book last year by Aperture; several of those works, from the shipyards of 
Europe to the raw tea fields of pre-war Rwanda, are on display at the 
Fahey/Klein Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Salgado's first professional photographs were taken in the early 1970s 
in Rwanda, where he still has friends, now missing. "It was not a good 
sensation," he says of his most recent visit in June. "It was a very, very hard 
time. I tell you, at this moment I was not proud to be part of the human 
specimen. I saw how violent we are, how hard we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Such feelings often are raised in Salgado's work. His tradition is that of the 
"concerned photographer," epitomized by W. Eugene Smith, who helped define the 
expressive power of the photo-essay in the pages of the original Life magazine. 
Salgado's 1986 series on the workers of Serra Pelada, Brazil, for example, 
reveals an ocean of 50,000 grime-covered men laboring like drones in an 
open-pit gold mine, and dramatizes the extreme hardships humans can withstand 
while retaining some measure of dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 Another photograph, of a small, painfully malnourished child being weighed on 
a scale in Ethiopia is agonizing to see, but somehow poetic in its composition. 
</P>
<P>
 This aesthetic commitment to an emotional, romantic, even spiritual view of 
the developing world has earned some criticism. In a notorious 1991 New Yorker 
magazine piece, Ingrid Sischy suggested Salgado's immense reputation was 
exaggerated, and wrote that his "beatification of tragedy results in pictures 
that ultimately reinforce our passivity toward the experience they reveal." 
</P>
<P>
 But Salgado rejects standards often used by some fine arts critics, which tend 
to focus on one single image at a time as an independent art object. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, this is a completely wrong way to look inside of the work. This is a 
project of life, this kind of documentary photography. This is linked to a flow 
of information," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning it hurt me a lot," he says of the criticism. "I thought that 
people didn't understand. In the end, that became a matter you cannot control. 
You must continue to do your work." 
</P>
<P>
 Salgado's discovery of photography came relatively late. He was already 
working as an economist, and just finished work on a doctorate degree, when his 
wife, architect Lelia Wanick Salgado, bought a 35mm camera in 1970 for her 
work.  
</P>
<P>
 "The first day I looked inside this camera, and I said, 'My God, this is a 
fantastic way to approach people, to look inside people, to have another 
communication.' Then I began to take pictures. One month later I had a darkroom 
to do prints myself. I got more lenses. It was a real invasion of my life that 
came over me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Salgado says his expressive visual style is rooted in his childhood, in the 
tiny town of Aimores, Brazil, where he was the son of a cattle rancher and the 
brother of seven sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 His first professional work as a photographer began in 1973 when the World 
Council of Churches sent him to document famine in Ethiopia. He still takes 
special assignments from Save the Children and other aid groups, but he was 
soon hired by the Sygma and Gamma news photography agencies, where he worked 
for six years, traveling from one news hot spot to another. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me it was my school of journalism," he recalls of those years. "I learned 
how to arrive in a place, make an analysis of the situation, shoot, have it on 
a plane and sent back to the newsweekly, go on to the next place. This was very 
interesting, very exciting to do. But it is a school like any school; when you 
finish you must go. And I went. That was not my place." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Salgado is deep into personal projects. His main obsession for the next 
six to eight years will be another documentary work, similar to the scale of 
"Workers." This one will examine the displacement of large numbers of people: 
immigrants, refugees and others. The new pictures from Rwanda, Tanzania and 
elsewhere are part of that. He'll also spend many months photographing Arab and 
African immigrants in Europe and expects to be in Southern California to 
document the continuing migration into North America.

 Stone Not Crying for Argentina: Director Oliver Stone, who recently dropped 
plans to make a film about former Panamanian leader Manual Noriega because of 
rising costs, now has also reportedly decided not to film the Tim Rice/Andrew 
Lloyd Webber musical "Evita." The movie, which was to have starred Michelle 
Pfeiffer as Eva Peron, Antonio Banderas as Che and Raul Julia as Juan Peron, 
had seen its projected budget climb toward $60 million, sources said. The film 
was to have been a joint venture between Cinergi and Disney's Hollywood 
Pictures. Stone's script called for elaborate settings and thousands of extras, 
sources added. The director recently visited Argentina to scout locations, but 
his request to film in historic government buildings was rejected by Argentine 
officials.

 * Douglas Jumps Ship: Michael Douglas has pulled out of Carolco Pictures' 
big-budget pirate film "Cutthroat Island," citing his current production 
schedule for Warner Bros.' "Disclosure" and his reluctance to film both back to 
back. Sources at Carolco Pictures said Tuesday that director Renny Harlin would 
find a new male lead as soon as possible and that filming would begin, as 
scheduled, in September. The studio is counting on the film, which co-stars 
Harlin's wife, Geena Davis, for an early summer '95 release, so filming could 
not be delayed to accommodate Douglas' request for a break between films.

 Celebrating Women: Reporter Mary Alice Williams will host "Picture What Women 
Do," a 90-minute special on cable's Lifetime Television that follows five women 
through a "typical" day and concludes with a live panel discussion about 
women's roles, telecast from Washington's National Museum of Women in the Arts. 
The Sept. 13 special, part of Lifetime's yearlong awareness campaign to 
acknowledge women's everyday responsibilities, coincides with the opening of 
the museum's photography exhibition "Picture What Women Do." The project is 
supported by several "partner organizations," including the Child Care Action 
Campaign, the National Breast Cancer Coalition, 9to5 -- the National Assn. of 
Working Women and the YWCA of the U.S.A.

 Playhouse Gets Reprieve: The Pasadena City Council approved a $200,000 loan to 
the financially troubled Pasadena Playhouse on Monday night on a 6-0 vote, 
allowing the theater to stay in business until subscription renewals begin to 
arrive later this month. Calling the loan an "investment," Councilman Rick Cole 
said rejection of the proposal would deny Playhouse principals "the opportunity 
to return to the success they have enjoyed and shared with our community in the 
past." However, Councilman Bill Crowfoot voiced concerns about the theater 
owners' track record and the chances for repayment. "I don't like the idea of 
theater of this kind so heavily reliant on the public dollar," he said. QUICK

 Feat of feet: Jesse Castaneda dribbled into town Tuesday, completing a 
two-month journey in which he kicked a soccer ball all the way from 
Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Or rather, six balls. "They really wore out in the spots where we hit hot 
weather," explained Castaneda, who also went through three pairs of sneakers on 
his 1,114-mile marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaneda, who was honored by the City Council Tuesday, reported no mishaps on 
his excursion, although "the ball got a way from me a couple of times in 
Arizona because the mountains are very steep there." 
</P>
<P>
 Just for the record, there was some teamwork along the way.  
</P>
<P>
 "Outside of Yuma, a big van pulled up and all the people got out," he said. 
"They were German travelers from Dusseldorf. They helped me kick the ball back 
and forth for half a mile."

 Castaneda, 54, the sports director of a youth program in Albuquerque, said he 
hopes his soccer exhibition showed children "you can reach your dreams and

$156 a year, while a mother of two children receiving AFDC will lose $168 a 
year (July 5). In addition, university students, renters, and Medi-Cal patients 
will all (once again) be sacrificed to the State of California's official 
deity, "the God of No New Taxes." Even then, the state will have to borrow $4 
billion to maintain what is left of itself (i.e., prisons). 
</P>
<P>
 This budget reaches a new low in both its viciousness and in its 
irresponsibility. Gov. Pete Wilson and the state Legislature have in effect 
stolen from the blind and disabled to finance the lifestyle of their rich and 
affluent friends. Of course, they argue (as always) that imposing any new taxes 
on the wealthy would only hurt the economy and hamper the ever-illusive 
economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Am I the only one, or does anyone else in this great penal colony of ours ever 
notice that it is "only" by taxing the affluent that the economy is stifled so? 
Taxing the poor and the working classes, on the other hand, is perfectly 
acceptable. Why does it hurt the economy any more to take $312 a year from a 
wealthy couple than it does when we take that same amount from a poor blind 
couple? Either way $312 is removed from the general economy. The only 
difference is that the poor, the blind and the disabled lack influence in 
Sacramento.

 * It is obvious in the budget battle where our governor's and legislators' 
interests lie: 
</P>
<P>
 Allow renters tax credits to die completely; allow higher income tax brackets 
to expire; cut grants to children and the aged, disabled and blind; increase 
expenditures for prisons; increase fees for community colleges and state 
universities, and ignore tax loopholes that may have long outlasted their 
purpose.

 * Over the past three years, Los Angeles County has faced floods, fires, 
riots, earthquakes, defense downsizing, and a sluggish economy. Now add to this 
litany an unfair state budget process. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, local governments accounted for 35% of the state budget solution. 
Counties accounted for 61% of the net reductions of local governments. And Los 
Angeles County, which accounted for only 36% of county revenue statewide, 
accounted for almost 50% of the reduction to counties. Counties, especially 
L.A. County, contributed more than their fair share to last year's state budget 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the budget solution again targets counties, especially Los Angeles 
County. Out of $715 million in cuts to local governments, $605 million or 85% 
is from counties. And of the cuts to counties, $362 million or 60% comes 
directly from Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to ask where does this path lead us? How is Los Angeles County to 
recover from the quake, the economic downturn, and address the social and 
health problems of our urban population without adequately funded schools, 
libraries, hospitals, and other public facilities and programs? 
</P>
<P>
 The governor, the Legislature and most particularly the Los Angeles County 
delegation need to address this issue fairly and squarely. Los Angeles County 
and other units of local government must, at least, be given the tools they 
need to maintain a sense of control over local revenues and services. Los 
Angeles County has proposed legislation enabling counties to levy a tax on 
liquor by the drink. The Legislature should pass this measure and the governor 
should sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County has also proposed a series of measures to speed up state 
and federal reimbursement of Medi-Cal claims, keep libraries open by granting 
libraries benefit assessment authority, and the phasing of payments to the 
Educational Revenue Augmentation Fund to cover past revenue shortfalls. These 
also deserve review and support by the Legislature and the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 More fundamentally, California's system of state and local finance is in need 
of reform. Under the current structure, the state and units of local government 
are doomed to stumble on from fiscal crisis to fiscal crisis.

 * Your recent article on the budget accord quotes state Sen. Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward) as saying, "How many times can you run into a wall?" (referring to 
the governor's steadfast opposition to tax increases). "The wall wins" (July 
2). Lockyer and his colleagues in the Legislature were wise in realizing that 
Wilson's resolve was as strong as a brick wall. You only have to refer to the 
1991 budget battle, when Wilson tried the compromise route, only to have the 
Legislature renege on promises to reform the budgetary process. Since that 
time, Wilson rightfully has refused to budge on the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a steadfast hand to gain the respect of the Legislature. Clearly, 
Wilson may not be liked by Kathleen Brown, Lockyer and their Democratic 
colleagues, but he has earned their respect. It is refreshing to have a leader 
who understands that respect is far more important than winning a popularity 
contest.

POSTREL ON HEALTH CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Health-Care Truths and Consequences," Column Right, July 1: 
</P>
<P>
 Do I feel like a fool. Virginia I. Postrel tells me my life insurance premiums 
have been going to subsidize the families of old people who die. She exposes 
casualty insurance as a cruel hoax because my house never burned, and I never 
had a car accident. And my elders have duped me into waiting more than 45 years 
to collect Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 I've also learned that the reason for rising health care is because more 
people are going to use the system. It's foolish to deny that those who 
previously couldn't buy or pay for medical services will undoubtedly flood the 
system once we offer the means to pay the cost of doctors and medicine and 
hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 With alarm I hear the government is planning to ration health coverage. 
However, because I have a pre-existing condition, am unemployed, not eligible 
for Medicare, and can't afford my own insurance, I'm relieved to see it doesn't 
threaten my current plan. 
</P>
<P>
 I am grateful that Postrel, who obviously has an ax to grind, is using it to 
cut through the truth to get right to the rhetoric. Partisan politics has 
become the substitute for principle, integrity and commitment and has obscured 
the search for truth. It's there but we can't find it if we're only pretending 
to look for it. It's time to tell our representatives to cut the crap and get 
to work.

 * The article by Virginia Postrel, the editor of Reason magazine, contains so 
many sophistries that it requires refutation. While there are selected points 
in which I would concur, the gist of the argument seems to be "why should 
healthy young people be taxed to contribute to Medicare for which they are as 
yet ineligible?" Many of the Medicare beneficiaries have spent a lifetime in 
productive work and have no income to pay medical bills. Many are not able to 
work and some, such as the undersigned, are able to work at his profession but 
have been victims of age discrimination. Virtually all industrialized countries 
save the U.S. seem able to take care of their elderly but these countries did 
not blow their fortunes on unnecessary armaments. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the argument that medical costs should rise unchecked because this is 
necessary to supply funds for research, just what fraction of costs above the 
inflation level go for research and just how much is just plain greed?

 Re your editorial "It's Time for Their 'Luck' to End," (June 29): It was

dealing in IPOs (initial public stock offerings), only one was a Republican, 
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (N.Y.).

 The remaining seven, ranging from Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (Ohio) to House

LET BOSNIA BE THE STARTING PLACE; WAY IS OPEN FOR NEW GERMAN RESPONSIBILITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Literally the whole world has united to force us to accept what they want," 
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic complained Tuesday. Let's hope he is 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 The "whole world" is, effectively, a coalition whose members are the United 
States, Britain, France, Germany and Russia. The five have called on the 
Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-Croat federation to accept a peace plan assigning 
49% of Bosnia-Herzegovina to the Serbs and 51% to the Muslims and Croats. 
Muslim-Croat acceptance is likely, Serbian acceptance much less so. 
</P>
<P>
 Momcilo Krajisnik, speaker of the secessionist Bosnian Serb parliament, has 
said that the Serbs, who now control 70% of the country, are unwilling to 
accept a peace map that requires them to give up so much. "The strain of 
economic sanctions," Krajisnik said on Tuesday, "cannot be compared to the 
supreme sacrifices we have made in liberating Serbian land." Krajisnik was 
alluding to the apparent willingness of Slobodan Milosevic, president of 
Serbia, to see Serb-held territory within Bosnia sacrificed if, in exchange, 
the economic sanctions still imposed on his country were to be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 With impressive unanimity, the five major powers threaten that if the Bosnian 
Serbs reject the peace plan, the arms embargo against Bosnia may be lifted and 
the U.N. forces may withdraw. The five powers should maintain the economic 
sanctions against Serbia with comparable unanimity, for Milosevic, by making 
the Yugoslav dinar convertible with the German mark in a few months, took a 
great gamble. Now may be the very worst moment to ease the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic is, by any measure, a gifted politician, skilled at making and 
unmaking coalitions and playing on hopes and fears inside and outside his 
country. His public coolness to Karadzic may be no more than a tactical 
maneuver, the prelude to later solidarity and further aggression. Before 
lifting the sanctions, the group of five should demand not just unequivocal 
acceptance of the peace plan but demonstrated compliance with it and with the 
cease-fire that was renewed on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 If and when all that can be achieved, an enlarged U.N. force will still be 
necessary. Happily, Germany's highest court has now freed Germany to contribute 
troops to international peacekeeping missions. Having pressed for the early 
recognition of Slovenia and Croatia, Germany bears some responsibility for the 
collapse of European collective security in the former Yugoslavia. On Monday, 
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said to the visiting President Clinton that 
Germany "cannot simply sit back and let others do the work." Let that work 
begin in Bosnia.

RETHINKING HOME SWEET HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans resist the notion that homelessness is now normal in their country. 
Anyone older than 20 can remember when virtually no one was living on the 
streets of the United States. The hope lingers that something that came with 
such speed will pass with equal speed. Unfortunately, an impressive body of 
research suggests the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 If homelessness is a disease with no quick cure, are there at least 
palliatives for it? There may be some, but perhaps only if we can begin 
thinking of person, place and house in a new way. Hitherto, we have thought of 
the "house" as a thing fixed to a place, and of the house/place unit as owned 
or rented by a person. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if the link of a house to a specific site could be broken and "a roof 
over my head" could be thought of as a portable product? Project X, a course 
taught by Steve Diskin at Pasadena's Art Center College of Design, asks: "Can 
we think of little buildings as big products? Can environmental designers and 
product designers get together and work toward new solutions for small-scale 
habitat?" In other words, can we begin thinking about things to live in rather 
than places to live? 
</P>
<P>
 Portable houses -- tents, recreational vehicles, mobile homes -- are nothing 
new in our society, of course, but even a car needs a parking place. Diskin 
says that whatever design breakthroughs he and his students might achieve must 
be matched by zoning breakthroughs. Los Angeles has in its zoning code a 
little-noticed RU (Residential Urban) category that is "designed to encourage 
the subdivision of small single-family residential lots for development with 
manufactured homes. . . ." RU, by permitting temporary, manufactured housing on 
single-family lots where they are normally forbidden, is different from the 
"quarantine" zoning that accommodates conventional mobile home parks. 
Unsurprisingly, only one tiny parcel of land has actually been zoned RU. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the homeless are not going to disappear as quickly and mysteriously as 
they appeared, then the recognition may finally dawn that unconventional 
shelter and unconventional zoning require each other and that urban America 
requires the combination. The Times applauds Project X and encourages the city 
authorities to consider wider use of RU.

THE CASE OF THE INTERNET MOLE; LIVERMORE FINDS ITSELF THE REPOSITORY OF A MOST 
UNWANTED PHOTO COLLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than five years ago, a hacker broke into computers several times at the 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Apparently the nuclear weapons lab is 
still vulnerable to outlaws riding the information superhighway, although this 
time the suspicion is that an insider opened the gates to half a dozen or so 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Red-faced officials confirm that lab computers were being used to store and 
distribute pornographic images -- 2,000 steamy megabytes. They did not realize 
it until a Times reporter alerted them. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure could not have come at a more awkward time for the Livermore, 
Calif., lab, which is fighting for its life in the post-Cold War era. Its 
budget has shrunk since the demise of Ronald Reagan's fanciful Star Wars 
project, on which billions were wasted, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
Nuclear bomb designers are a glut on the market. Livermore is promoting itself 
as the ideal site for a proposed $1-billion research superlaser known as the 
National Ignition Facility. 
</P>
<P>
 We have supported Livermore's bid to survive because its staff represents a 
special national resource. But the smut disclosure hardly helps our case. 
Officials insist that the breached computer contained only unclassified 
information and that those used for classified work are protected by an "air 
gap," that is, physically separated from non-classified computers and the 
Internet telephone lines through which the cyberpunk pirates maraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Livermore is certainly not their only victim. Last April, a student at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology was arrested on charges of distributing 
more than $1 million worth of pirated software through the Internet. And 
authorities have started a manhunt for Kevin Mitnick, a Southern Californian 
whom some call a veritable one-man keyboard crime wave, allegedly stealing 
valuable software from cellular phone companies, breaking into Department of 
Motor Vehicles records, even harassing the FBI agents investigating him. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers of the new Information Age were inspired by noble dreams of 
free-flowing data as a global liberating force, a true democratizing agent. 
Sadly, the crooks and creeps have also climbed aboard. The time has come for 
much tighter computer security. After all, banks learned some time ago that 
they had to put locks on their vaults.

 Californians who have seen movies being filmed on location know well that 
things often are not what they appear to be. It's all for the sake of 
entertainment.Now there's official word about a pretense that's far from 
entertaining: Many California auto repair shops are faking it, at the expense 
of their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Significant problems of fraud and incompetence in auto body repair were 
documented in a report released Monday by the state Bureau of Automotive 
Repairs. The study was prepared by a committee that included members of the 
insurance and automotive repair industries as well as law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to adding an average of $866 to a vehicle repair bill, the suspect 
practices can pose significant safety risks, the report warned. Investigators 
found, for example, in scrutinizing repairs made on 52 cars that only 29% were 
done properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a fraction of the 1,572 auto body shops surveyed had employees certified 
by industrial associations for metal work, and many lacked the equipment 
essential for good repair, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more disturbing than the evidence that less than a third of repairs were 
adequate was the finding that there was fraud in a whopping 40% of the cases 
studied. That's an argument for tougher state regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, here are some tips for consumers. Make and keep specific 
notes on the damage to your vehicle. Request proof of technicians' 
qualifications from the shop where your vehicle is to be repaired. Ask lots of 
questions. Because as this study shows, looks can be deceiving.

IMMIGRATION REFORM, NOT HYSTERIA; THE SOS INITIATIVE WOULD BRING IMMEDIATE 
COURT CHALLENGES AND WOULD TAKE MONEY FROM STRAPPED PUBLIC SCHOOLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADELA de la TORRE, Adela de la Torre is an economist at Cal State Long 
Beach. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attacks on undocumented immigrants in California have switched from talk shows 
to the November ballot, with a proposed law that hopes to exclude these 
individuals from publicly funded health, education and social-service programs. 
The "Save Our State" Immigration Initiative (SOS) was spearheaded by Alan 
Nelson, head of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in the Reagan 
Administration, and Harold Ezell, former INS western regional commissioner. The 
main mechanism that would be used to ensure exclusion from these services would 
be through legal verification of "suspected" undocumented individuals; 
providers would be required to report these people to the INS.  
</P>
<P>
 This initiative goes beyond limiting entitlements to non-citizens: It violates 
fundamental rights guaranteed under both the U.S. and California constitutions. 
For example, the law would force educators and health professionals to violate 
their legal and ethical standards of confidentiality and their clients' rights 
of privacy. The initiative attempts to shift the immigration discussion away 
from employment and toward entitlements. Yet despite the much-ballyhooed 
studies on the cost of immigrants, there is not a single study that can assert 
that the main cause of undocumented immigration to the United States is access 
to entitlements. Rather, most studies suggest that, political upheavals aside, 
the major pull is higher wages. By ignoring this fundamental influence, the 
initiative will not stop undocumented immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem with SOS is the lack of data on how much implementing it would 
cost. A preliminary report from the Senate Office of Research indicates that 
the state could lose more than $2 billion in federal funds for requiring school 
districts to report undocumented students to the INS. This loss would be 
substantially more than the estimated cost of educating the undocumented 
children. That the proponents of the bill are willing to forgo needed federal 
dollars for financially strapped public schools suggests that their real agenda 
is not meaningful immigration reform, but rather to force reform through the 
courts, using the statute with the specific intent to stimulate further 
litigation. The authors of the SOS initiative apparently hope to force the 
Supreme Court to revisit the landmark Plyer vs. Doe case, which upheld the 
right of public education for undocumented children in Texas. In that case, 
Justice William Brennan spoke to the real dangers in a society that would hold 
children equally culpable for the actions of their parents. The SOS initiative 
directly contradicts this principle, maintaining equal standards of culpability 
for children and adults.  
</P>
<P>
 These moral concerns aside, it makes no sense to propose a law that would 
immediately be challenged on constitutional issues, particularly if the impact 
on undocumented immigration is negligible. In addition, SOS would place school 
districts at financial risk as they attempt to uphold a state mandate that 
requires teachers, nurses, social workers, physicians and other service 
providers to violate their professional codes of ethics to cooperate with the 
INS.  
</P>
<P>
 Californians are more than ready to discuss meaningful immigration reform. 
This does not mean, however, that we should accept a law that rides on the wave 
of anti-immigrant hysteria, with neither a solid legal nor financial base. The 
initiative does not identify where the money for implementation and enforcement 
will come from, and it specifies no agency for enforcement. Nor does it include 
any criminal penalties for noncompliance, thereby providing no incentives for 
compliance. Any thoughtful legislation would have provided these basic pieces 
of information. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, such flawed and costly initiatives will continue unless 
Congress and the Clinton Administration tackle reform. In California, the 
anti-immigrant ideology has become the new litmus test for politicians who hope 
to appeal to the alienated middle class. These folks have become uncomfortable 
with the state's new demographic reality and see little help coming from 
Washington or Sacramento. Their concerns fuel the message of anti-immigrant 
mavericks -- and require our immediate attention if we are to move forward on 
reform.

PLATFORM; AMERICA'S IDEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. YELLIN, outgoing president of the Los Angeles Chapter of the American 
Jewish Committee, talked at the chapter's annual dinner of American values. 
Here are excerpts:

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a time when everyone seems more committed to defining and defending 
themselves as part of a group, rather than as a participant in an evolving but 
common culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Our concern must be that America remains a united people and does not become a 
Balkanized society with all the legacies that flow from that condition. 
</P>
<P>
 What remains unique about America, unique among all nations, is that, however 
imperfectly realized, America's ideal remains an ideal of tolerance, of 
accepting diversity and of reconciliation, rather than separation between 
people -- an ideal still worth fighting for.

AN ALTERNATIVE TO MASSIVE BUDGET CUTS ; L.A. COUNTY: KEEP CLINICS AND LIBRARIES 
OPEN WITH 'PET PROJECT' MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GILBERT CEDILLO, Gilbert Cedillo is general manager of SEIU Local 660. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County is facing its third bad budget in a row. Today, the Board 
of Supervisors will begin grappling with an estimated $524-million budget gap, 
including a $340-million shortfall handed down by Gov. Pete Wilson and the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's newspapers could reprint the headlines from 1993 and '92 about a sea 
of red ink threatening to sink our already flooded facilities. Once again, 
thousands of layoffs threaten the 43,000 county employees represented by Local 
660 of the Service Employees International Union. Once again, 10 million 
residents risk losing public services they have every right to rely on. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, a newcomer is swinging the county budget ax. Chief 
Administrative Officer Sally Reed has said she is a "level-headed technocrat 
willing to make tough choices if that's what it takes to clean up the financial 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Shutting down libraries and museums, hospitals and clinics, parks and pools 
isn't tough. It's mean. There's nothing tough about picking on people who are 
least able to defend themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there is a sane alternative to massive layoffs and service cuts. 
The union has just completed a study of the fragile county economy, and we 
concluded that Reed's Draconian measures are unnecessary. Here are some of the 
budget projections I'll present to the supervisors today.  
</P>
<P>
 * $20 million is already budgeted for the five supervisors to spend on pet 
projects. As in past years, each has been given an "allowance" to allocate at 
his or her discretion. Supervisors traditionally use the reserve to restore 
shortfalls in funding for various services, and we expect them to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 * $80 million was available in the funded-interest account, a little-known 
cash reserve. Last month, the Sheriff's Department closed a shortfall with $45 
million from this account. Wise economic practices dictates using the remaining 
$35 million.  
</P>
<P>
 * County officials have already found $100 million in other accounts besides 
the funded interest reserve. These unallocated reserves may once have served a 
valid purpose but now are little more than slush funds. An independent audit 
would also restore some credibility to a financial system that is widely 
distrusted by residents and a laughingstock in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 * $220 million can be raised by selling or leasing 1% of the county's unused 
or undeveloped real estate. The Citizens Commission on Government Efficiency 
conservatively estimates that the property holdings are worth $22 billion. When 
hospitals and libraries are closing, it is no time to tie up our assets in 
vacant lots. 
</P>
<P>
 * $530 million is available from Washington for outpatient treatment at county 
medical facilities. Wilson complains that Washington fails to pay for alleged 
harm that undocumented immigration causes the state economy, but he refuses to 
allow the county access to more than half a billion dollars in federal 
health-care funds.  
</P>
<P>
 * Local 660 also has identified $30 million in savings set aside for overtime 
payments that workers agreed not to collect. Originally, $96 million was set 
aside for what turned out to be a $66-million expense. Also, the Sheriff's and 
Probation departments have identified $30 million in administrative expenses 
that could be saved.  
</P>
<P>
 If all these measures were adopted, we could have a budget surplus -- just in 
time to restore life to departments that have been hacked to pieces during 
previous cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 For three years, Local 660 has demonstrated its commitment to budget 
alternatives that make the most of our economic, political and human resources. 
It's time to end short-sighted policies. Closing a clinic, library or museum 
may save a few dollars today, but the long-term results always have a hidden 
price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 We believe that the toughest challenge facing county employees and 
administrators is to provide improved services to meet public needs every day, 
even during recessions. The toughest challenge for politicians is to say and do 
the right thing, even when it is unpopular. Don't blame immigrants, the poor or 
the children for this crisis: Proposition 13 sowed the seeds of today's 
devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 Local 660 knows that Southern California continues to feel the results of a 
very real recession. But we believe this county's biggest shortage is 
leadership.

NEWSWIRE: NCAA HITS WASHINGTON WITH SANCTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports

<TEXT>
<P>
 The NCAA on Tuesday put Washington's football program on probation for two 
years and limited the Huskies to four televised regular-season games in one of 
the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The school will opt to have that limit imposed in 1995, said Jim Daves, 
Washington's sports information director. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalties from the NCAA Committee on Infractions are in addition to those 
imposed last year by the Pacific 10 Conference, which imposed a two-year bowl 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no immediate comment from school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue were violations of NCAA rules concerning payments by boosters to 
student athletes for work not actually performed, "as well as a lack of 
institutional controls of a summer jobs program," the NCAA said in a release. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel, noting the Pac-10 conducted its own probe and imposed its own 
penalties before forwarding the case to the NCAA, lauded those efforts but 
noted the potential for problems when a conference imposes penalties before the 
NCAA committee review. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mississippi's Billy Brewer, the dean of Southeastern Conference football 
coaches, was fired, the latest fallout from a second NCAA investigation during 
his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 His firing came a day after Athletic Director Warner Alford resigned and 3 1/2 
weeks after the school announced an NCAA inquiry alleging 15 violations by the 
football program. Mississippi was put on probation for two years after the 1986 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer was 67-56-3 in 11 seasons at Ole Miss, leading the Rebels to three bowl 
games the past five seasons. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 California linebacker Paul Joiner was not wearing a seat belt when the car he 
was driving went out of control and struck a light pole, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joiner, expected to be a key part of the Golden Bears' defense this season, 
remained in critical but stable condition at Highland General Hospital in 
Oakland after Sunday's accident. The 22-year-old suffered multiple head 
injuries in the crash, which also injured two other Cal players. Basketball  
</P>
<P>
 Voshon Lenard, a second-round draft choice of the Milwaukee Bucks, has told 
the team he is returning to Minnesota for his senior year, the Bucks announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a new NCAA rule, underclassmen may enter the draft but retain their 
college eligibility if they decide to return to college within 30 days of the 
draft. Any team drafting an underclassman retains that player's rights for the 
next year's draft. Miscellany 
</P>
<P>
 Jacky Durand, a two-time winner of the French national championship, won the 
10th stage of the Tour de France. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-time winner Miguel Indurain of Spain finished in the pack less than two 
minutes behind and retained the overall lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks acquired defenseman Robert Dirk from the Chicago Blackhawks 
in exchange for a fourth-round draft choice in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Dirk, 27, had two goals and three assists in 71 games with the Blackhawks last 
season.

DUKES ARE FOR SALE; GARRISON JACKSON INJURED; TENNIS: LEAGUE EXECUTIVE SAYS 
LIEBERMAN IS TRYING TO SELL TEAM. NEWPORT BEACH BEATS PATTON'S IDAHO SNEAKERS 
BUT ITS STAR PLAYER IS CARRIED OFF THE COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Newport Beach Dukes ruined the homecoming of former Dukes' Coach Greg 
Patton by defeating Patton's Idaho Sneakers, 27-21, Tuesday before about 2,200 
at the John Wayne Tennis Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the Dukes' fourth in a row, but it was tempered by an ankle 
injury to star player Zina Garrison Jackson, who was carried off the court 
during the second set. Garrison Jackson will be examined today to determine if 
she'll be able to play on Thursday against the New Jersey Stars and Martina 
Navratilova. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory also came amid word that Dukes' owner Fred Lieberman is trying to 
sell the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's indicated that he wants to sell," said Ilana Kloss, executive director 
of World TeamTennis, who was in town to watch the Dukes-Sneakers match. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman did not dispute Kloss' comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking into it," he said. "This is extremely hard work for me 18 hours a 
day. It would be more of a lifestyle decision. I've got one kid and another one 
on the way. I'll know more in August." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Lieberman nor Kloss would say if there was someone interested in 
purchasing the Newport Beach franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Kloss said the WTT office and Lieberman have often had run-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 "He certainly stretches the envelope," Kloss said. "But whether he's good or 
bad, he took the risk with this franchise." 
</P>
<P>
 If Lieberman decides to sell the team, Kloss said she doubts Newport Beach 
would lose the franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am pretty sure we'll have a team in this market," Kloss said. "It's too 
important for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The WTT had two teams in Southern California until the Los Angeles Strings 
folded after last season. The Strings played their matches at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't belong in arenas," she said. "They're too big for us. This is 
perfect for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Kloss also indicated that Lieberman might not sell until he wins a WTT title. 
The Dukes have lost in the finals the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Fred wants to win a championship," she said. "He's got a great team. 
Of all the teams I've seen, this seems like the best. If Zina can stay 
healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 But even if Garrison Jackson's ankle is fine, she is scheduled to miss at 
least two matches next week, one home and one away, while she plays for the 
United States in the Federation Cup tournament in Frankfurt, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Larisa Neiland, the Dukes' other woman player, also will miss at least two 
matches next week as she will play in the Federation Cup for Latvia. Lieberman 
said Ann Grossman, Gigi Fernandez and Duke alternate Tami Whitlinger are 
possible replacements for Garrison Jackson and Neiland. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrison Jackson appeared to sprain her right ankle as she attempted to change 
direction while chasing a ball in a singles match with former Duke Amy Frazier. 
At the time, Garrison Jackson led Frazier, 5-4 and 15-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of Garrison Jackson didn't slow the Dukes' attack as Neiland finished 
off Frazier by winning the game and giving Newport Beach a comfortable 12-7 
lead after two sets. Trevor Kronemann and Kelly Jones extended the lead to 
18-10 with a 6-3 victory over the Rick and Jon Leach of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Leach then lost, 6-5, to Jones in a set that came down to a 4-4 tiebreaker 
in the last game. Rick Leach and Manon Bollegraf defeated Kronemann and 
Neiland, 6-2, to extend the match to a super tie-breaker, but Kronemann and 
Neiland ended it by winning the next game. 
</P>
<P>
 Idaho dropped to 1-4, but Patton isn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago, the Dukes were 0-4 and we went to the championship," he said.

LOS ALAMITOS; TRAINER HONORS THE FAMILY NAME WITH HIS QUARTER HORSE SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Jones, the leading quarter horse trainer at Los Alamitos, has few moments 
to spare. 
</P>
<P>
 He saddles an average of three horses a night, which keeps him busy until 
midnight. The next morning, it's back to work early. Even some afternoons are 
booked when his thoroughbred trainees run at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, when a 104-degree fever forced a reluctant Jones to stay home, 
there was no question who would take over his thriving operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' father, Paul Sr., stepped in gladly. Merely returning the favor, 
really. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior Jones had been training for 15 years when a heart problem slowed 
him. Walking from the racetrack back to his barn one morning in 1988, he had to 
stop three times to catch his breath. He went to the hospital that day and 
stayed for six. Doctors concluded he had not suffered a heart attack, but would 
need open-heart surgery to open several blocked arteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Jr., the assistant trainer at the time, took over the 20-horse barn while 
his father recovered. And now, six years later, Jones Jr. has recorded victory 
No. 147. His father retired in 1988 with 106.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was doing so well, I thought I'd better stay out of the way," the elder 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Jones also refers to the transition and his choice of career as 
almost haphazard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always the type that didn't know what I was going to do and I just 
ended up training," he said. "And it turns out it's something I really like." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Sr. had horses while growing up in Torrance, but he also had hot rods and 
a brother who was five years older. After playing around with the cars and 
racing locally on weekends, his brother, Parnelli, moved onto the national 
stage, racing all over the country and winning the Indianapolis 500 in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Jones Sr. also found success behind the wheel, although he never was as 
famous as his brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice, injuries forced Paul Jones Sr. to take six months off from driving race 
cars. He points to his large hands and still-muscular forearms as he begins the 
list of broken bones: two in his left hand, one in the right, his forearms, 
both collar bones and several ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 When he quit driving race cars after 20 years, Paul Sr. bought a horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a friend who was doing match races, so I bought a horse at Pomona. It 
couldn't outrun me on the ground,' he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he kept trying. The next horse had problems but with care, Jones 
eventually raced it at Los Alamitos but lost it on a claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The track's racing secretary gave him only one stall to start, but Jones stuck 
with the game and mastered the art of claiming. He still is proud to say he won 
with every horse he claimed. And when he retired, he had a public stable of 20 
horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "At one time, Little Paul wanted to go into car racing," the senior Jones said 
of his 28-year-old son. "I think his first words were vroom vroom . But . . . 
he followed me into horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad Paul chose the horses over the cars. I've seen too many (drivers) 
get themselves killed." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Jones Sr. can't leave racing completely, though, not even in retirement.  
</P>
<P>
 His primary racing interest is now in homing pigeons. In the same proud voice 
that he tells about his driving and conditioning feats, he tells about a 
500-mile pigeon race that only four birds finished in one day. Two of them were 
his. 
</P>
<P>
 "Racing's in my blood, I guess," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' brother, Parnelli, is retired from driving, too -- although he did 
drive the pace car last May at Indy -- but his sons keep the name involved in 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
 And Paul Jr. keeps the name alive in horse racing. When he started training on 
his own, the owners his father had trained for left. So Paul Jr. built a 
five-horse family-owned stable into one of the largest and most successful 
public stables. Chances are, there will be a Paul Jones in quarter horse racing 
for some time. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Two former claimers are likely to be among the top picks in Friday's $20,000 
Table Tennis Handicap, an 870-yard race for older horses. And if their trainer 
has his wish, they will run 1-2 again. 
</P>
<P>
 Shopping the $2,500 claiming races for his clients, Charles Treece found Mr. 
Diddy Wa Diddy for owner Gladys DeWolf, and Streakin Dunes for Beatrice and 
Fred Waterworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Diddy Wa Diddy developed first, winning allowance races and then taking on 
stakes challenges. With $115,555 in lifetime earnings, the 6-year-old bay 
gelding won three stakes in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Streakin Dunes came along more slowly. Strictly a claimer until his most 
recent race, Streakin Dunes earned $35,460 in 40 tries. But in his last race, 
he won the Grade III Endurance Handicap, beating out Trucklin Six by a nose and 
Mr. Diddy Wa Diddy by a neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "It surprised the hell out of me that time, but he's that good," Treece said 
of Streakin Dunes. "We're ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Another recent graduate of the claiming ranks, Woodchuck Brown, lost a $12,500 
claiming race by 13 1/2 lengths, then finished 11 1/4 lengths behind against 
$8,000 horses before finally winning for $5,000. Trainer Dwayne Wells entered 
him in the All-Star Jockey Challenge, then watched as the horse beat stakes 
competition by a neck under Kent Desormeaux.

 Four Forty Blast, last year's champion 3-year-old gelding, will make his first 
start of the year in the $20,000 Chicado V Handicap on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Down Dash gelding, who runs for his breeders, Dutch Masters III, ran 
a temperature at the beginning of the meeting, lost three weeks of training and 
hasn't raced since the Champion Classic last Nov. 13. His sixth-place finish in 
that race was a disappointing end to a year in which he raced 11 times and won 
eight, earning $205,528. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in Jaime Gomez's barn, Four Forty Blast has earned $319,894. 
</P>
<P>
 Probable competitors in the Chicado field include Beinbetter and Childish, 
from Paul Jones' barn; the Blane Schvaneveldt-trained trio of Abadasher, 
Hopkins and Make Mine Bud, and Connie Hall's Avison.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; CHANDLER PICKS UP SLACK FOR MILLER IN PASSING 
DRILLS

 With starting quarterback Chris Miller excused from workouts to be with his 
wife and newborn son, much of the Rams' pre-camp passing drills have been in 
the hands of Chris Chandler, who has made a strong impression with new 
offensive coordinator Chick Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler, an off-season free-agent acquisition from Phoenix, is projected as 
the backup to Miller, who's coming off two knee surgeries.Chandler and T.J. 
Rubley, a part-time starter last season, have worked with most of the top wide 
receivers in the first two days of drills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Second-round draft pick Isaac Bruce of Memphis State has agreed to terms on a 
three-year deal and the wide receiver is expected to be in camp today. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Outside linebacker Roman Phifer re-injured his right hamstring during pass 
defense drills Tuesday. Trainer Jim Anderson said it was a mild strain, similar 
to one Phifer suffered in workouts last week. Phifer is listed as day-to-day. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Todd Kinchen, coming off reconstructive knee surgery, isn't 
expected to be in camp until late August. . . . The Rams' four-day pre-camp 
workouts finish Thursday, but the rookies and free agents will return next 
Monday for three more days of workouts. Players will report for training camp 
physicals July 21 at UC Irvine, with workouts beginning the next day. MIKE

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; SWITCHING A MONUMENT FROM ONE PEDESTAL TO ANOTHER; DOLLEY 
/ A NOVEL OF DOLLEY MADISON IN LOVE AND WAR BY RITA MAE BROWN ; BANTAM $22.95, 
400 PAGES 
</P>

<P>
 "Not all the soldiers were in Vietnam," Rita Mae Brown writes of Lady Bird 
Johnson in the intriguing dedication to her latest novel, "Dolley." "This one 
was in the White House." 
</P>
<P>
 So, from the very beginning of Brown's novel, we are alert to the notion that 
Dolley Madison stands for something more than the single enduring anecdote 
about the First Lady who saved a painting of George Washington when the British 
burned the capital in the War of 1812. 
</P>
<P>
 And, indeed, Dolley is presented as a woman of courage and conscience who 
strikes us as not merely saintlike but sometimes seems rather too good to be 
true. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think of those women widowed by this war," Dolley writes in her journal. "I 
pity them and pray for them and ask God why women must suffer so for the deeds 
of men." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dolley" is a user-friendly and politically correct historical novel -- Brown 
provides us with an extended dramatis personae, various chatty entries from 
Dolley Madison's imagined diary, and frequent bursts of dialogue in which 
famous historical personages make small talk that doubles as both exposition 
and commentary, all of it quite contemporary in tone and content. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am fascinated with what we are doing here, whether we speak Spanish, 
Portuguese, English or French," says Dolley Madison to a French diplomat's 
wife, thus making plain what Brown portrays as Dolley's high-minded 
multiculturalism. "That's why the war is so critical. . . . The New World must 
be left alone." 
</P>
<P>
 We meet Dolley as a young woman in a Quaker family in the heat of the American 
Revolution -- Dolley sees her mother stand up to a British patrol, thus 
prefiguring Dolley's own future heroism against the same enemy: "Look what thou 
hast done to the floor!" Dolley's mother scolds the sword-waving officer who 
has ridden his horse into the front hall. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in fact, "Dolley" is offered up as the praise-song of a charming, canny 
and courageous woman who is intended to win our respect and affection. Dolley 
Madison, as Brown imagines her, is a woman who loves to shoot dice in the 
privacy of her bedchamber -- but who is no less adept at "the mechanics of 
democracy" in the convoluted and overheated corridors of power in early 
19th-Century America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little escapes you, Mrs. Madison," Henry Clay is made to say. "You use what 
you learn to protect your husband and because you love your country." 
</P>
<P>
 We can see all the tool marks of Brown's research. She pauses to make her 
characters comment on the public outcry over climbing postal rates, for 
example, and the fashion toward plunging necklines: "The latest fashion in 
Europe is a slightly lower-cut bodice than what we are currently wearing," 
Dolley confides to her journal. "Any lower and we'll be nude!" 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has set herself the task of gently correcting our comfortable 
assumptions about American history. Black men and women, for example, are no 
longer invisible in American history as Brown tells it, and Dolley pointedly 
uses the word servant to refer to someone whom Brown bluntly identifies as a 
slave. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, there's an extended subplot that focuses on a woman named Sukey, "a 
dusky Venus" whose love affair with a Russian diplomat is yet another 
opportunity for Brown to explore the geopolitics of the War of 1812. But Brown 
uses Sukey, a house slave of President Madison, to make quite another point 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't own me," Sukey protests to Dolley Madison. "You can catch me if I 
run away, but my soul is my own!" 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had the power to end slavery, I would," Dolley replies. "Sukey, I can't 
vote any more than you can." 
</P>
<P>
 We cannot fail to get Brown's point, of course. But "Dolley" lacks the bite of 
the revisionist novels of Gore Vidal, for example, who has written with 
considerably more venom about some of the same historical characters. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, we quickly realize that Brown is not an iconoclast at all -- rather, 
she's a maker of new and surprising icons, and "Dolley" is the sanctified 
figure whose image she finds so inspiring that Brown simply cannot conceal or 
even contain her adoration.

 FRONT-ROW SEAT: Chris Bancroft of Anaheim was well aware how many millions 
were watching the O.J. Simpson preliminary hearing last week -- they were 
watching it through his camera. . . . Bancroft, 31, a graduate of Magnolia High 
School and Cal State Fullerton, operated the courtroom camera -- and decided 
the angles -- for Court TV. Says Bancroft: "I covered the Menendez trial, and I 
thought that was a big deal. But this was a big deal. I could feel the 
responsibility. Fortunately, from the responses we got, I guess I did OK."

 NOT A BESTSELLER? Galal Kernahan of Laguna Hills Leisure World recently sent a

manual," Kernahan joked. The Bill Room does have copies now, or you can get one

 MIKE SCHOOL: ESPN's Roy Firestone has had numerous accolades heaped upon him 
as a top TV sports interviewer. So when he agreed to teach a session on 
broadcasting skills in the annual Sportscaster camp run by Roy Englebrecht, 
above, Firestone's topic, of course, was interviewing. The camp -- 
Englebrecht's 10th annual -- opens today at the Radisson Plaza Hotel in Irvine 
and runs through Sunday. One of its 100 participants: former NBA star Walter 
Davis, who's preparing for a broadcast career.

 STILL AT IT: If you've ever taken a tourist bus in Washington, D.C., one of 
the stops is the famous monument "Flag Raising on Iwo Jima," just across the 
Potomac River in Arlington, Va. The 78-foot-high sculpture is the most famous 
of 1,200 commissioned pieces by Felix de Weldon. Close friend Ellen Turnbull of 
Laguna Niguel says of Weldon, now 77, "He's still sculpting!" And reminiscing. 
. . . The artist speaks this morning at the Monarch Beach Sunrise Rotary Club 
at a gathering arranged by Turnbull.

COLOSIO'S KILLER ACTED ALONE, REPORT FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chief investigator in the assassination of Mexican presidential candidate 
Luis Donaldo Colosio said Tuesday the evidence shows that the gunman planned 
the killing alone and there was no conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Miguel Montes Garcia said in a statement that the confessed 
gunman in custody, Mario Aburto Martinez, was "the material and intellectual 
author of the homicide."He said Aburto had a political motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is possible to offer substantial conclusions, given that it has been 
demonstrated that Mario Aburto is the material and intellectual author of the 
homicide . . . and that, in carrying out the homicide, he acted alone," the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 The finding marks a full retreat from the conspiracy theory initially put 
forward by the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Aburto, three men who attended the March 23 rally in Tijuana 
where Colosio was gunned down remain in custody. They were held in connection 
with the murder but are expected to be released shortly. 
</P>
<P>
 Montes' office previously said that new witness testimony and expert analyses 
of the videotapes of the shooting had weakened the case for a conspiracy, but 
human rights activists and others were skeptical of that claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Montes' office said Aburto's writings showed a political motivation for the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In a confession made immediately after the shooting, Aburto insinuated that he 
had co-conspirators. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Mexican official, the accused assassin told interrogators, "If 
you knew who else was involved, you'd be surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 But Aburto said he was not helped by the three men now being held.

 THEY'RE OUT: There's no crying in baseball, but nobody said anything against 
folding. And that's exactly what an American Legion team in Newbury Park has 
done (C8). Two reasons: not enough players and not enough money. . . . 
Meanwhile, American Legion ball is a big deal in the San Fernando Valley. A 
team from Woodland Hills, in fact, won the World Series in 1989, with alum Ryan 
McGuire now playing in the Red Sox organization. 
</P>
<P>
 BANKS ON IT: First, Glendale. Then, the world. Well, PBS, at least. That's the 
home for the new Steven Banks Show, premiering in L. A. on Sunday. Banks, who 
grew up in Glendale, stars in a sitcom about a guy who procrastinates. . . . 
But, in real life, Banks didn't wait to praise his drama studies at Hoover 
High. "The whole attitude was very professional," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 LAST CHANCE: Thor Lee (above) almost booted himself out of the game he loves 
-- soccer. But he gave it another try when the L. A. Salsa joined the American 
Professional Soccer League last season, and thank goodness. . . . Lee, an 
ex-CSUN star, helped his team reach the championship game. The Salsa, he said, 
has "turned my career around" (C8). 
</P>
<P>
 MALL STALL: Other shopping centers hit hard by the Jan. 17 quake got more 
headlines, but the Laurel Plaza Mall in North Hollywood has had its share of 
headaches. Now nobody seems to know when it will reopen (B1). . . . Laurel 
Plaza opened in 1968, but it is not the oldest mall in the Valley. In fact, in 
1964, Topanga Plaza became the first enclosed mall west of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 ARMENIANS: Glendale could be called the city of minorities. Altogether, about 
65% of its population belongs to one ethnic group or another. So it makes sense 
that there's someone assigned to help the different groups get along with the 
cops. . . . His name is Chahe Keuroghelian, and part of his job is also to help 
the image of Glendale (B4). Michael Arkush

 STREET SMARTS: For the first time since 1933, the state has some surprises in 
its driver's test. Prepare to take a spin on the freeway, or properly navigate 
your car into a space in a parking lot. . . . Although the DMV is giving the 
new test across much of Southern California, it'll be another year before it 
pops up in Ventura County. With heavy traffic and more wackos on the road, the 
DMV hopes it'll improve safety. "We are trying to make the test more relative 
to current conditions," says regional manager John Raymond.

 UNITED THEY BUY: To pare costs, United Airlines is being sold to its employees 
(A1). Pilots, ground crews and office workers will give up billions of dollars 
in wages and benefits for a majority share of the company. . . . The purchase 
should not affect United Express, one of the two airlines that service Oxnard 
Airport. United Express is owned by Mesa Airlines, which has a contract to fly 
into Oxnard. "Nothing is going to change," said John Reber, a United Express 
agent. "Seven flights daily to Los Angeles."

 HIT THE TRAIL: Ron Blakemore has a plan to preserve at least a sliver of 
Ventura County's natural splendor: He's developed a latticework of more than 
200 miles of off-road trails that would crisscross the county (B4). . . . Even 
if urban sprawl gobbles up most of the remaining open space, hikers, bikers and 
equestrians could trek from Simi Valley to the Santa Barbara County line. . . . 
Blakemore publicly unveils his plans tonight in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 RISKY BUSINESS: Sheriff Larry Carpenter gets lots of money from the county 
supervisors, including most of the windfall from the Proposition 172 half-cent 
sales tax. . . . But on Tuesday, Carpenter threw his support behind the cities' 
demands for a portion of the tax windfall (B1). "I cannot believe Carpenter is 
doing this," said Supervisor Maggie Kildee. Five of those cities pay the 
sheriff millions to provide police protection. But he has yet to nail down this 
year's budget from the county. He goes before the supervisors today.

LSD SUBJECT'S INJURIES MAY CONTRADICT CIA REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Injuries on the body of a germ warfare biochemist who was given LSD as part of 
a CIA experiment appear to contradict the official explanation of his 1953 
death as a suicide leap through a closed window. 
</P>
<P>
 Skull injuries and the lack of cuts on Frank Olson's body, which was exhumed 
June 2, do not appear consistent with the CIA's description of events 
surrounding his fall from the 13th floor of a hotel, said Patrick Zickler, a 
spokesman for a forensic team analyzing Olson's remains on behalf of his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson, a civilian employee at Ft. Detrick in Frederick, died Nov. 28, 1953. 
The death was listed as a suicide, but family members have long suspected that 
he did not jump through the window. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial autopsy listed a skull fracture above and behind Olson's right 
ear, Zickler said. However, the autopsy did not mention an internal "hinge 
fracture," a horizontal break across the bottom half of the skull, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's significant because it shows that the skull suffered a more powerful 
blow or series of blows than the original medical examination indicated," 
Zickler said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Olson went through that piece of glass, there is a lot of glass that would 
have cut him," Zickler said. "If his body went through it, there would have 
been jagged shards left around the frame and he would have been cut." 
</P>
<P>
 David Christian, a CIA spokesman, said Olson's death was investigated by 
Congress and Administration officials in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have read the press reports on the private forensic investigation that was 
undertaken at the behest of the Olson family," Christian said. "If the 
conclusions of that investigation include any new information on the case, it 
obviously should be brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities." 
</P>
<P>
 Olson, who suffered a negative reaction to the LSD that was given to him in a 
drink during a retreat in western Maryland, was taken to New York to visit an 
expert familiar with tests involving the little-known drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Lashbrook, a former CIA officer, accompanied Olson to New York and was 
in the room when Olson went out the window. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview at his home in Ojai, Calif., last month, Lashbrook 
said he never saw Olson go out the window. Lashbrook, who contends Olson 
committed suicide, said he was awakened by a noise and saw the window shade 
flapping at the top of the window. 
</P>
<P>
 The family's forensic investigators were awaiting results of tests to 
determine whether Olson had been given LSD or other drugs after his initial 
dose, about nine days before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Further investigation of the skull and other remains continued. The 
investigation was expected to take about a month. If the investigation uncovers 
any evidence of homicide, the Olson family will go to law enforcement 
authorities in New York, Zickler said.

CLINTON FIGHTS TO SHORE UP ERODING HEALTH PLAN; REFORM: AS LAWMAKERS NEAR A 
VOTE, THEY WALK A TIGHTROPE, TRYING TO BALANCE ACTION AGAINST INACTION. WHITE 
HOUSE SETS PR BLITZ AGAINST CHANGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As both houses of Congress brace to vote on health care legislation, the chief 
challenge confronting President Clinton and his allies is a growing perception 
that a marginal measure is the easy way out of the most difficult political 
bind that many lawmakers have ever faced. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, members of Congress facing reelection this fall want proof to 
show voters that they are capable of doing something significant. But just as 
great or greater is their fear of taking too big a leap. 
</P>
<P>
 "The political calculus that 'small is safer' is the quick, knee-jerk 
reaction," said one Senate aide. "The evidence (to the contrary) is rolling out 
slowly, and we need to pile it on in the next couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles): "Usually when you have something 
very controversial, if Congress is left to its own devices, it goes for the 
lowest common denominator. Only this time, the lowest common denominator won't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his supporters will be turning up the heat as the health debate 
enters what amounts to its semifinal round. Both the House and Senate are 
expected to vote on legislation before Congress adjourns for its August recess, 
setting the stage for a final battle over a compromise version this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal of a modest, incremental approach is understandable because it 
steers clear of the most politically charged element of the Clinton plan, which 
is a requirement that employers pay as much as 80% of the costs of their 
workers' health benefits. Small and weak businesses say that the additional 
cost of such an "employer mandate" would force them to lay off workers or shut 
down entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans want health care, but they don't want to pay for it with their 
jobs," Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), one of the chief backers of a 
more gradual approach, warned in a speech Tuesday on the Senate floor.  
</P>
<P>
 Without a mandate, however, it is unlikely that the health care system would 
ever reach Clinton's bottom-line goal of universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming days, Clinton's backers will release a torrent of new studies aimed 
at convincing wavering members that fiddling with the health care system around 
the edges will only make the current problems worse. The more incremental 
reform plans would remedy the apparent shortcomings of today's insurance 
system, requiring insurance companies to provide coverage at the same rate 
regardless of age or health, but not requiring everyone to carry insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 But, say Clinton backers, unless everyone has health insurance, marginal 
reforms are merely a recipe for more misery: Fewer and fewer people will have 
health coverage and those who do will pay more for it because the sick will be 
able to buy it, pushing up the premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, with Clinton back in Washington from his European trip, the White 
House is planning to turn up the heat with a busy schedule of public 
appearances for both the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside groups are also gearing up. One coalition of organizations that 
support the Clinton plan will launch bus caravans from four cities. Called the 
"Health Security Express," it is clearly designed to evoke memories of the 
hugely popular bus trips taken during the 1992 presidential campaign by 
Clinton, running mate Al Gore and their wives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But if the outside groups want to convince lawmakers that there is a 
groundswell of demand for a Clinton-like plan, they clearly have their work cut 
out for them. Out of the confused signals that Sen. J. James Exon (D-Neb.) is 
getting from voters, he said, only one is coming through loudly and clearly: 
"The only consensus I see is that most of them are against the Clinton plan."  
</P>
<P>
 John Rother, legislative director for the American Assn. of Retired Persons 
and a supporter of a comprehensive approach, said that he is puzzled by a 
seeming disconnection between public support for universal coverage -- close to 
75% in most polls -- and its antipathy to what is labeled the Clinton plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a June survey of AARP members -- whom the Clinton Administration had 
once hoped would be among its most vocal advocates -- now shows growing support 
for a more modest approach.

NIGERIAN STRIKE SPREADS, CRIPPLING OIL PRODUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Business ground to a halt and strikers threatened Nigeria's oil exports 
Tuesday in the most dramatic show yet of opposition to Gen. Sani Abacha's 
military regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all business stopped in Lagos, nerve center of the economy and home to 
5 million people. Armed police patrolled the city streets. Workers were 
reported staying home in several other cities in southern Nigeria, where 
opposition to the dictatorship is strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 The stay-at-home strikes cut across all sectors in Lagos and were even honored 
by federal employees, despite threats from Abacha. Banks closed, buses and 
ferries stopped running, and people walking to work found their offices empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Nigeria's commercial activity and all of the West African nation's 
petroleum fields, which provide 80% of government revenue, are in the south. 
The growing fuel shortage has caused blackouts and water cuts in Lagos. 
</P>
<P>
 Since seizing power in November, Abacha has dissolved elected governments and 
jailed dozens of journalists, human rights activists and politicians, including 
the apparent winner of the 1993 presidential election, Moshood K.O. Abiola. 
</P>
<P>
 Most oil workers went on strike July 4 to demand Abiola's release and Abacha's 
ouster. Oil company managers at the Warri refinery in southwestern Nigeria 
joined the strike Monday, shutting down production and crippling the nation's 
major source of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Narebor, deputy general secretary for the Petroleum and Natural Gas 
Senior Staff Assn., said pipelines at two of the biggest export terminals, off 
southern Port Harcourt and Warri, would run dry by today or Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Abacha appeared on television late Monday and said, "All apologists of civil 
disobedience will be severely dealt with." Last week, his government said 
anyone who interfered with the military's attempts to keep the oil industry 
going would face the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The strikes, which are in large part economically driven, represent the 
biggest challenge to the military government since similar actions forced out 
Abacha's predecessor, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, last August.

OCC PIONEER JOHN OWENS, 80, DIES IN SAN JOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Stephen Owens, a charter member of the Orange Coast College faculty and 
former vice chancellor of the Coast Community College District, died Friday of 
a heart attack at his San Jose home. He was 80. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens had been resting at home with his wife, Hazel, and recuperating from 
lower-back surgery when the heart attack occurred, said an Orange Coast College 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens, a graduate of St. Mary's College, USC and Stanford University, became 
one of OCC's first faculty members and its first football coach in 1948. He 
taught classes in construction technology and coached the football and 
wrestling teams until 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 Owens was division chairman of technology until 1962, when he became 
coordinator of trade and technical education. The John S. Owens Skill Center, 
home to OCC's aviation technology, welding and avionic programs, was named in 
his honor in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "John was particularly responsible for enabling Orange Coast to broaden its 
whole curriculum in the technical field," said Robert B. Moore, a former OCC 
president and a close friend of Owens. "He made a tremendous effort in 
rebuilding the technical programs at OCC when Golden West College opened its 
doors in 1964 and acquired the college's auto mechanics, police science and 
nursing programs." 
</P>
<P>
 From 1966 until his retirement in 1973, Owens was vice chancellor of the Coast 
Community College District.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, who taught home economics at Newport Harbor High 
School for many years, Owens is survived by his son and daughter-in-law, John 
and Dede Owens of Alabama, and three grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 No memorial service is planned.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; CHECKING OUT THE LAWYER MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William W. Stewart appears to be a busy man. He imports lobsters and fruit 
from Colombia, where he spends a good amount of time. He once hoped to ship 
Marlboro cigarettes to Russia. And he has the Orange County Central Court 
contract to represent some defendants unable to pay for their own attorneys, a 
contract that brought his law firm about $700,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing wrong with any of that. But after 15 years, Stewart's 
contract to represent indigent defendants is getting some overdue scrutiny in 
legal circles and at the Hall of Administration. The question is: Would the 
courts be served better by having a different firm handle the contract for 
cases that cannot be handled by the public defender's office? By his own 
account, Stewart has not appeared much in court here for the past four years. 
He is a businessman as well as a lawyer and takes his cut from the contract, 
farming out most of the work to other lawyers, as he is allowed to do. Some 
judges have said they would like more lawyers from Stewart's firm available, to 
avoid delays in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The Central Court judges plan to meet today to consider putting Stewart's 
contract, which will expire next year, out for bid. They should. It is time to 
see whether some other law firm could provide just as good a defense for less 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart has argued that his firm has been a good defender of the poor, and no 
one has contradicted that. We won't know whether the county could save by using 
another competent firm unless the matter goes out to bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to taxpayers of hiring lawyers for defendants unable to pay their own 
attorneys has been a perennial and valid concern of the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office has a budget of about $18 million a year. When 
that office has a conflict of interest, outside attorneys must represent a 
defendant. That costs Orange County more than $11 million a year. There is no 
way to avoid payments, since all defendants are entitled to a competent lawyer, 
but the judges and supervisors owe it to the county to hold down costs where 
they can.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES: STRESS TAKES TOLL AMONG COLLEGE WOMEN; EDUCATION: EFFORTS 
TO EXCEL LEAD SOME TO ALCOHOL ABUSE, RISKS OF VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE M. MILLER, Suzanne M. Miller is an adviser on alcohol and other 
public policy issues involving drugs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes competing in the fast lane requires paying a devastatingly high 
price. For many college women, this price includes destroyed health, increased 
risk for acts of violence and decreased academic performance. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent survey released by Columbia's Center on Addiction and Substance 
Abuse, 35% of college women reported drinking to get drunk in 1993, more than 
triple the 10% in 1977. At least one in five college students abandon safe sex 
practices when drunk, putting them at greater risk for unplanned pregnancies 
and contracting AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County alone, young adults age 18-29 are more than twice as likely 
to be binge drinkers (five or more drinks per episode) as compared to adults in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, alcohol and violent crime are strongly linked with college students. 
Roughly 95% of violent crime on campus is alcohol-related. Of all reported 
campus rapes, 90% occur when alcohol is being used by the assailant, the victim 
or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Poor grades are also attributed to an increased use of alcohol. Among college 
students, alcohol is implicated in more than 40% of all academic problems and 
28% of all dropouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the self-destructive and often violent effects of alcohol abuse on 
campus, the cost is monumental. Each year, college students spend $5.5 billion 
on alcohol. This far outweighs the cost for their books required for classes. 
</P>
<P>
 To address this increased problem, the center's Commission on Substance Abuse 
at Colleges and Universities recommends a national "Alcohol Awareness Index" to 
provide a ranking on how well alcohol programs are addressed on campus. While 
this index may help parents in selecting a college, it does nothing to help a 
student facing peer pressure and academic stress resist a drinking binge and 
potential rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Reversing the image of the "rite of passage" with young women begins with 
women themselves. Competing with men and with other women causes stress. 
Achieving academic success requires hard work and discipline. Coping with 
change and transition with alcohol numbs the pain and eases the anxiety, but 
destroys bodies, minds and positive peer relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 With the multiple demands on young women to serve as caring mothers, career 
whiz kids and academic superstars, it is no surprise that women are catching up 
by abusing alcohol. Stress takes its toll on young female bodies as much as or 
more than their seasoned male counterparts. She can jump as high, run as fast, 
get higher grades and drink him under the table. 
</P>
<P>
 While most university administrators recognize a problem, few are ready to 
make the commitment to change it. One reason is the powerful role of the 
alcohol industry in providing funding for college-sponsored events. Without the 
"beer industry" money, athletic teams may face serious cutbacks.  
</P>
<P>
 University officials need to assume responsibility and take action in setting 
policy and uniform guidelines on the consequences of alcohol abuse. The primary 
reason schools are confused about how to deal with alcohol abuse is that most 
of their student population are underage. Teaching minors about "responsible 
drinking" is technically illegal. However, the cost of not acting, not 
teaching, not preventing the abuse is much too high. 
</P>
<P>
 Peer-led prevention programs, already successful with California's junior high 
and high school students through Gov. Pete Wilson's Friday Night Live and Club 
Live projects, are a natural resource on college campuses. With the National 
Service Corps program in place, California college students could receive 
academic or tuition credit for alcohol and drug counseling and community 
service work. Options for community service include developing local 
public-private partnerships to support campus activities without alcohol or 
establishing mentor programs with business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Women's roles are changing for the better. Women are getting and making more 
opportunities for success both academically and professionally. Let's not 
jeopardize the great progress and opportunities for success with alcohol abuse 
and the violence that often accompanies it.

AMERICAN LEGION BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; IGOU COMES BACK FROM BREAK TO MAKE 
BEST PITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that he's rested, Van Nuys East left-hander Rich Igou is giving hitters he 
faces a chance to rest. They walk to the plate, swing the bat a few times, then 
walk back to the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 Igou, who pitched 93 1/3 innings during the spring at Notre Dame High, took 
several weeks off from pitching after the high school season. He went to Mexico 
for a week, and to Fresno for a few days, where he pitched three innings in the 
state's North-South All-Star series. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his return to the mound in American Legion play, Igou has 39 strikeouts 
in 20 1/3 innings. He is 3-0 with a 1.03 earned-run average. In his last two 
appearances, he struck out 17 in seven innings against Burbank South and 10 in 
seven innings against Valley North. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess a lot of it is location," Igou said. "The fastball has been working 
pretty good. I've been getting a lot of (strikeouts), but I don't know if I'm 
throwing any better." 
</P>
<P>
 He's pitching well at a better time, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Igou has been pitching lately in front of Kansas City Royals' scouts. The 
Royals drafted Igou almost as an afterthought last month -- in the 63rd round 
-- but they seem more interested in signing him now. 
</P>
<P>
 National cross-checker Guy Hansen, a former major league pitching coach for 
the Royals, watched Igou pitch Sunday against Valley North. 
</P>
<P>
 Igou, who is 6-foot-3, was intent on playing for the University of San 
Francisco a few weeks ago, but now. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure, now that (the Royals) have thrown this at me," Igou said. "They 
said they might come in with third-round money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Slugger: First, Woodland Hills West's John Novak wants everyone to know that 
his shoulder, which bothered him on and off for years, is fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a thing of the past," Novak said. "It feels as strong as it ever did 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Novak was used mostly as a designated hitter last season at Pierce College 
because he couldn't throw. Now he plays the outfield and throws without pain. 
More impressive is what he does at the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Novak had a two-for-eight slump last week and his average dropped to .552. He 
also has 13 doubles, two home runs and 27 runs batted in. He hit a three-run 
home run for the West team Sunday in the District 20 All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1993 graduate of El Camino Real High, Novak credits his offensive exploits 
this summer to facing predominantly high school pitchers after playing junior 
college baseball in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot easier," he said. "I haven't seen the quality of pitching I did at 
the JC level. There are some decent pitchers, but overall the quality isn't as 
high." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add All-Star: Players from the Antelope Valley provided most of the highlights 
for the West in its 11-3 victory against the East in the District 20 All-Star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley South's Eric Cole had two hits and Quartz Hill's Kyle Goss had 
a double. 
</P>
<P>
 The game's best pitcher was Quartz Hill's Will Wallace, who pitched three 
scoreless innings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unearned loss: The District 20 All-Stars gave up three unearned runs and lost, 
3-2, to a team from Union, N.J., on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley South's Chris Tapia went three for three, but was also 
involved in a gaffe in the third inning. Tapia and Jim Landress misplayed a fly 
ball, allowing it to drop and lead to Union's first run. 
</P>
<P>
 The error spoiled an otherwise good performance by Newhall-Santa Clarita's 
Lucas Solomon, who struck out five in two innings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New format: The Southern California Legion champion will be determined at a 
tournament Aug. 4-7 in Upland. No state tournament will be played this year 
because of renovations to the facility in Yountville, where the finals are 
usually held. 
</P>
<P>
 The Area 6 champion, the Area 5 champion and two teams from Area 4 will play a 
double-elimination tournament. Area 4 has two teams because it is the host. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner advances to the Southwest regional tournament in Albuquerque, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Legion lines: The District 20 regular season ends Sunday, with the four 
division winners plus six wild-card teams advancing to a double-elimination 
tournament beginning Tuesday. District 16, which has no postseason tournament, 
will continue its season until July 24. 
</P>
<P>
 The District 20 champion, plus the top two teams from District 16, will 
advance to the six-team Area 6 playoffs July 28-31 at UCLA's Jackie Robinson 
Stadium. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys East's Justin Bunch doubled in the District 20 All-Star game, then 
went three for four with three RBIs later that day in Van Nuys East's 10-3 
victory over Valley North. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys South's Marc Scorza had two hits in the All-Star game, and two more 
in Van Nuys South's 6-4 victory over San Fernando. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 American Legion night at Dodger Stadium, scheduled for last Saturday, was 
canceled because only 23 of 300 tickets the Dodgers provided were sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The 23 ticket-holders attended the game against the New York Mets, but there 
was no recognition of American Legion. The Dodgers made the other 277 tickets 
available to the public.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A long shot wins the granddaddy of national amateur tournaments in storybook 
fashion, and a couple of years later, folks have already forgotten about him. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, Mitch Voges of Simi Valley hasn't been actively seeking the 
champion's podium lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Voges, whose gutsy victory in the 1991 U.S. Amateur Championship at age 41 had 
television broadcasters gushing praise and accolades, practically has dropped 
out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 In the U.S. Amateur final, Voges made a college player half his age disappear. 
Voges' extra-long putter was the magic wand. Three years later, voila , Voges 
himself is a ghost. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks ago, Voges played in an inter-club tournament and his name 
appeared in the newspaper results the following day. Sort of. 
</P>
<P>
 "They spelled it B-O-G-E-S," Voges said, "so I guess I really am out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Out of the loop, to be sure. Lately, he's been Voges the father, Voges the 
entrepreneur, bogus the golfer. In that order. 
</P>
<P>
 "Golf has never been my No. 1 priority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement has never been more true. Voges, who has children aged 12 and 
16, has been busy for months orchestrating a series of golf course development 
deals locally and abroad. For the next few months, he said, ironing out the 
development details is about all he can handle. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to birdies and eagles, Voges has done cold-turkey withdrawal 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Voges' victory in the U.S. Amateur was nothing short of remarkable. Twenty 
years ago, he was a top collegiate amateur at Brigham Young and U.S. 
International, but persistent back problems forced him to quit the game in the 
mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever hear older players complaining about not being as long as they used to 
be? Voges knows the feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Voges, 44, had two discs removed from his spine and had three vertebrae fused 
together. Eventually, after a 10-year layoff, he again forged his game. 
</P>
<P>
 By winning the U.S. Amateur title, he joined an impressive list of Southland 
champions -- Phil Mickelson, Sam Randolph, Mark O'Meara, John Cook, Craig 
Stadler and Gene Littler. Of course, all were considerably younger. Voges was 
winner second, breadwinner first. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Voges' injury also put the game in perspective. He qualified for the 
U.S. Open as a collegian in 1972, but was soon felled by back trouble. Still, 
he was somewhat satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't changed my tune," he said. "Golf's never been first with me. I 
played in the Open in college, and if I didn't play again, I'd have been OK 
with that. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Playing in the Open) was more than most people have a chance to do." 
</P>
<P>
 By winning the U.S. Amateur -- with his son Christian serving as his caddy -- 
Voges earned the right to again play in the Open, not to mention the the 
Masters and British Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, after his season in the spotlight, which included stints as a 
network color commentator during Walker Cup and U.S. Amateur coverage, Voges 
has all but shelved the game. He calls playing three times a month a "major 
effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this is all a set-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with an exemption, Voges has applied to play in the U.S. Amateur next 
month at Sawgrass Tournament Players Course in Ponte Vedra, Fla. But he isn't 
sure he'll have the time to participate, much less to get his game up to speed. 
</P>
<P>
 If he plays, fine. If not, so be it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm totally out of the game," he said. "Once in a while, I feel a sad twinge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'm all done, though. I'll be back. When I have time." 
</P>

 Layoffs, Part II: Andrea Gaston of Canoga Park, who earned a berth in the U.S. 
Women's Open by winning a sectional qualifier Friday in Seal Beach, was sitting 
in her office writing checks the day before the tournament. Predictably, she 
was thinking about golf. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gaston logged Thursday's date, 7/7/94, she realized that it had been 17 
years to the day since she qualified for her only Open by winning a qualifier 
at Del Rio Country Club in Modesto. 
</P>
<P>
 Those 17 years included a 14-year layoff from tournament golf, due in large 
part to a paralyzing case of the putting yips. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaston won the qualifier at Old Ranch Country Club with a one-under 71 and 
left the next morning for . . . Del Rio Country Club, which is hosting the 
Women's Trans-National Championships this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately one year after her 1977 Open appearance at Hazeltine, Minn., she 
quit the game out of frustration. Gaston, 36, has come full circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's probably (attributable) to maturity," she said. "Nothing's taken 
for granted. It's a new round every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have faith in myself now. I'm confronting my fears and meeting them daily, 
head-on." 
</P>

 L.A. Law: Dr. Craig Steinberg, like almost everyone else, closely monitored 
the O.J. Simpson hearing on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most folks, though, Steinberg is picking up a few timely pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg, an optometrist from Van Nuys and one of the Southland's best 
amateurs over the past decade, has completed law school and is taking the state 
bar exam July 26-28. Unfortunately, the exams have blown a hole in his golf 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg, 36, won't be playing in the 95th Southern California Golf Assn. 
Championship next week at Hacienda Golf Club in La Habra Heights. Steinberg won 
the SCGA crown in 1988, 1991 and 1992, and is one of five players to have won 
back-to-back titles. He is the reigning Pasadena City champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said he "hasn't picked up a club" since missing the 36-hole cut at 
the State Amateur Championship at Pebble Beach last month. He wasn't ready to 
play, anyway. At least, not ready to play at his high standard. 
</P>
<P>
 The call was an easy one. Playing in the SCGA wouldn't be juris-prudent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I either play golf and blow the bar exam or study for the bar exam and not 
play," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg will be back in action next month. He has accepted an invitation to 
play in the 28th Pacific Coast Amateur, held Aug. 2-5 at Bear Creek Golf and 
Country Club in Murrieta. 
</P>

 The Bar, Part II: Mark Marino hears complaints all the time. It's kind of an 
occupational hazard. Folks bare their souls, whether he likes it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a bartender. 
</P>
<P>
 Marino, who lives in Newbury Park, has put together an organization he hopes 
can compete with the Golden State Tour, a mini-tour for professionals 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fairway Assn. will stage its first event, which is open to professionals 
and low-handicap amateurs, July 25 at Camarillo Springs Golf Course in 
Camarillo, where Marino is a bartender. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a lot of people who play on the Golden State Tour," he said. "One of 
the constant complaints is that (it) pockets too much of the money. More needs 
to be spent on purses." 
</P>
<P>
 As with the Golden State Tour, players in the Freeway Assn. will pay an entry 
fee. Marino said that through the cooperation of courses in the region, which 
have given him a break on green fees, he hopes to keep his costs low and purses 
high. 
</P>
<P>
 If he can draw a field of 40 for the inaugural event, he plans to offer a 
$3,400 purse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody would agree that promoters should make a buck," he said. 
"But not as much as the guys who are playing." 
</P>

 Trivia time: Everett Seaver (1920) and Charles Seaver (1934) are the only 
father and son to have won the SCGA title, one of the nation's longest 
continually contested amateur championships. Everett's grandson broke the 
chain, but established quite a niche for himself elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Seaver, one of baseball's greatest right-handed pitchers, earned a berth 
in the Hall of Fame. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Shane O'Brien's stunning, seven-under 64 in the final round of the L.A. City 
Men's Golf Championship last month not only gave the Hart High graduate a 
two-stroke victory, but his 72-hole total of 280 was the lowest since 
left-hander Mike Turner of Sherman Oaks shot 279 in 1981. Turner is the Anaheim 
City champion. . . . 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bridesmaid: Darren Angel got tired of being labeled second banana. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior standout from Northridge had seven birdies during a final-round 70 
to win the Las Vegas Founders' Legacy Junior Championship last week at Legacy 
Golf Club in Henderson, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
 He then let out a considerable sigh. "Finally," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel finished second last summer in the Henderson event, sponsored by the 
Georgia-based American Junior Golf Assn. It hardly qualified as front-page 
news. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Angel was second in the AJGA event in Mission Hills, marking his 
seventh top-five finish in an AJGA tournament -- all without a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he finally broke through, Angel, a senior at Granada Hills High, 
finished second four times in AJGA tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got kind of old," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Angel will play in the AJGA Rolex Tournament of Champions at Oak 
Tree Country Club in Edmond, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel is one of six Southern Californians who have qualified for the U.S. 
Junior Amateur, held July 26-30 at Echo Lake Country Club in Westfield, N.J. 
</P>

 Sun strokes: A pair of hardy golfers found a novel way of welcoming the first 
day of summer in Santa Clarita. On June 21, the longest day of the year in 
terms of sunlight, Jeff Zee and Rocky Haserjian played 81 holes at difficult 
Valencia Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The twosome teed off at 6 a.m. and stopped at 8 p.m. They played 18-hole 
rounds from the gold, blue, white and red tees, then played another nine-hole 
round from the blues. Some workout. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Zee's 47th birthday; Haserjian is 32. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have kept going since we still had some light," Zee said. "But I had 
a message from home saying the grand-kids were waiting for me to cut the cake."

COMMENTARY; WILL WOMEN PAY PRICE FOR RESPECT IN BASKETBALL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURLING LOWREY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Burling Lowrey is a free-lance writer 
in Washington, D.C. who specializes in sports culture. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Women's TV Sports Tug at Purse Strings," says a recent headline in the 
Washington Post. The piece that follows attempts to make a case for women's 
college basketball to be marketed to the hilt and put on the map just as is 
happening in the men's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's pause a minute right there. At the same time that a flood of articles 
extolling the idea that women's Division I basketball had finally arrived, "60 
Minutes" presented a devastating expose of the money-grubbing and hypocrisy 
that prevails in the men's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there something wrong here? Should the promoters of the women's game really 
be proud that they are on the road to matching all the vices of the men.  
</P>
<P>
 Just what are those wonderful elements in the men's game that the women seem 
so eager to emulate? They are evasive about the excessive demands placed on the 
student-athlete's time, an over-aggressive approach by coaches to get to the 
Final Four at any cost, a downplaying of academic achievement and an emphasis 
on promotion and hype to bring in revenue, and a blatant conflict-of-interest 
among coaches, many of whose loyalty to shoe companies supersedes that toward 
the universities paying their salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this what the "liberation" of the woman college athlete is all about? Where 
are the naysayers? They don't exist. Their voices have been smothered by the 
Big Sports monolith. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing better illustrates that women's college basketball is headed in the 
wrong direction than a recent "Frontline" documentary on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 Ostensibly, the purpose of this report was to "look at the obstacles facing 
women's athletic programs in universities," but in actuality it was a best-case 
scenario, which followed the Stanford University women's basketball team to two 
recent national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 I was, frankly, horrified at the manner in which "Frontline" unquestioningly 
spelled out what it considered the ingredients that make for a "successful" 
athletic program for women. What actually came across was an unintentional sick 
parody of all the human and institutional negatives of the men's Division I 
basketball factories. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the footage focused on the Stanford coach, Tara VanDerveer, a kind of 
female Vince Lombardi without the charisma. The image that she projected was 
that of a control freak who felt no qualms about telling her team, in no 
uncertain terms, "I want this national championship bad." Her manic drive to 
win, unrelieved by humor, was relentless. 
</P>
<P>
 As this hyped-up Stanford team rolled up the score on lesser opponents and 
marched on to the Final Four, the players, rather than enjoying the experience, 
became increasingly tense. When they got to the championship round, they were 
wound up so tightly that they seemed ready to roll on the floor, kicking and 
screaming.  
</P>
<P>
 After gathering all the marbles, the players had still not wound down. Several 
decided to join women's professional circuits in Europe, thus confirming the 
discredited college-basketball-as-pro-farm-club notion. Only two decided to 
pursue the careers for which their college education had prepared them. If this 
sounds depressingly familiar, it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming from all this that women's college basketball is on a slippery slope, 
what alternative to the men's game is there? Before answering the question, we 
need to examine the illogical reasoning that has marked the women's game as 
"inferior." Consider these arguments: 
</P>
<P>
 * The women's game is too slow. The problem is that the men's game is too 
fast. The run-and-shoot game is not much fun to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 * The women can't dunk. Dunking is irrelevant, so far as good basketball goes. 
It is nothing more than an excuse for exhibitionism. The women are better off 
without it. Basketball was never intended to be played "above the rim." 
</P>
<P>
 * The power element is missing in the women's game. So who needs it. The power 
game of the men is mindless. Without it, skill and intelligence are maximized. 
</P>
<P>
 * Women's basketball does not bring in much revenue. Neither do fencing or 
badminton, but they are both world-class sports with a rich tradition and a 
loyal following.  
</P>
<P>
 The mad pursuit of Division I women to achieve semi-professional athletic 
status while supposedly getting an education strikes me as a horrendous 
mistake. Therefore, one can only wonder why they haven't come up with a viable, 
more humane alternative to what the basketball factories are producing. For 
starters, I would suggest the implementation of the following ideas: 
</P>
<P>
 * Forget about "March Madness" and getting to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduce practice time, travel, and postseason play so athletes can 
concentrate on their studies. 
</P>
<P>
 * Discourage from participation any woman who considers the college team a 
farm club for the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hire coaches who favor the pronoun we rather than I , whose philosophy is, 
"We want to win, but we want to have fun doing so," rather than, "I want this 
win bad." 
</P>
<P>
 * Stop worrying about whether or not you are filling the arenas with 
revenue-producing fans. Just play the game and enjoy the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep in mind the axiom: Our game is not inferior to that of the men. It is 
just different. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the promoters of big-time women's college basketball will have to 
decide where their loyalty lies -- with their respective alma maters or with 
the TV networks, the shoe companies and the marketing CEOs of big corporations. 
College women athletes say what they really want is respect. We shall see what 
path they choose to get it.

RICHARD J. REYNOLDS III; TOBACCO FAMILY GRANDSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Joshua Reynolds III, a grandson and the namesake of the tobacco 
company's founder, is dead at age 60. 
</P>
<P>
 His half-brother, anti-smoking activist Patrick Reynolds, said the namesake 
Reynolds died of emphysema and congestive heart failure caused by smoking. R. 
J. Reynolds III died June 28 in Pinehurst. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., Peggy Carter, said the company 
had no comment. It is the nation's second-largest tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
 No family member has served on the company's board of directors since the 
1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 R. J. Reynolds III founded Full Sky Publishing, a company dedicated to 
publishing work by young writers, and produced the film "Siddhartha," based on 
a Herman Hesse novel. 
</P>
<P>
 He also founded the Sufi Institute in New Mexico. The Sufi Foundation camp is 
located near Torreon, N.M., in the mountains about 40 miles southeast of 
Albuquerque. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation based its beliefs on the Muslim movement of Sufism that emerged 
in the late 10th and early 11th centuries. About 500 of the 5,000 members 
annually attended a two-month summer camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds' wife, Marie, died earlier this year. They had no children.

OPPONENTS RAISE SAFETY ISSUES ON VENTURA AVE. SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER and MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opponents of a plan to build houses on a stretch of Ventura Avenue blasted the 
proposal Tuesday night, charging that the city would be placing homes next to 
toxic waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
 An attorney representing property owners near the site told the Ventura 
Planning Commission that several oil field waste dumps border the area where 
the Neel and Huntsinger families and Kinko's Service Corp. want to build 330 
homes. In addition, a concrete pesticide reservoir still seeping noxious 
chemicals may lie directly below the site where houses are proposed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 77-acre site is bounded by Ventura Avenue on the east, the Ojai Freeway on 
the west, Stanley Avenue on the south and Seneca Street on the north. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given that there has been heavy industrial use throughout this area, I think 
it is shocking that the city staff would propose a residential development 
there at all," said Glen Reiser, a lawyer hired by local industrial business 
owners who want to halt the development. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Perlman, a land-use consultant hired by the property owners, dismissed 
the charges, calling them a last-minute ploy to undermine the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know there are some concerns, but we have taken them into consideration," 
Perlman said. 
</P>
<P>
 When members of the Planning Commission pressed Perlman about the potential 
risks of placing a project on the site, Perlman said his clients had conducted 
several environmental studies, including a soil study. 
</P>
<P>
 "The environmental concerns do not exist in the magnitude being suggested here 
tonight," Perlman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reiser said land just north and west of the proposed residential neighborhood 
was used in the late 1950s and early 1960s to dump waste from oil production. 
Those products may have leaked into the underground water supply and be 
circulating beneath the suggested site of the new houses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An environmental assessment by the city found that a full environmental review 
was not necessary. But Reiser said if the city does not halt progress on the 
development and call for a more extensive environmental review, his clients 
will sue. 
</P>
<P>
 The project calls for constructing commercial and light industrial buildings 
as well as houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The businesses' owners, worried that they will be slowly forced out by new 
neighbors who will find their loud, chemical-smelling plants distasteful, hired 
Reiser to help them oppose the project. 
</P>

 "It's quite clear to all of us that houses do not belong next to our 
businesses," businessman Robert Casey told commissioners.  
</P>
<P>
 "People will start to complain because of the noise or the dust, or because we 
operate all night, or because the trucks are driving through their 
neighborhood," Casey said. "They'll eventually get rid of us and with us will 
go the jobs we provide."

<P>
 Kinko's, the national copy service headquartered in the area, owns land within 
the proposed development site and plans to expand onto that property. 
</P>
<P>
 But company representatives have warned the city that if the neighborhood 
surrounding their future central office is not redeveloped from its present 
industrial use, they may move to another city.

COUNCIL OKS EXPANDED SHELTER PLANS; VENTURA: OVER OBJECTIONS OF BUSINESSES AND 
RESIDENTS, TURNING POINT WILL BE ALLOWED TO PROVIDE SLEEPING QUARTERS FOR THE 
HARD-CORE HOMELESS. 
</P>

<P>
 A Ventura drop-in center for the mentally ill -- already planning to open a 
low-rent dormitory for its clients in September -- has also received permission 
to expand its operations to provide sleeping quarters for some of the hard-core 
homeless who might otherwise end up on the city's streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura City Council, voting 5 to 1, approved a request Monday night for 
the extra sleeping accommodations at the Turning Point Foundation, despite 
protests from some businesses and residents. Turning Point is on Thompson 
Boulevard near California Street. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the proposal, officials will clear out one of the building's two 
downstairs rooms each night to make way for 10 roll-away beds and partitions 
beginning this fall. Guests will not be allowed to stay more than 180 nights in 
a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning Point already won approval from the Planning Commission in late 1992 
for construction of 10 single-occupancy rooms on the center's second floor to 
house long-term residents -- a plan that attracted relatively little 
controversy at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The rent on the dormitory-style rooms -- which will also be available this 
fall -- will be below market rate, and the tenants will share kitchen and 
bathroom facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners and residents who turned out to protest the additional beds 
Monday night said they would also have objected to the 10 upstairs rooms, but 
did not hear about them until the issue of the downstairs housing arose. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning Point's homeless shelter will be one of three in Ventura and the first 
exclusively for the mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Overnight shelters are one of the best ways to reach the homeless mentally ill 
population, said Clyde Reynolds, Turning Point's executive director. "This may 
be our first chance to get to know them and learn how to help them." 
</P>
<P>
 The downstairs program, due in large part to the controversy it generated, 
will have to operate under tight restrictions: 
</P>
<P>
 * At least two employees will remain on duty at all times. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lighting will be added to the back of the building to discourage homeless 
people from sleeping there. 
</P>
<P>
 * Guests who leave after 9 p.m. will be locked out for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission approved the proposal for the downstairs sleeping area 
in June and, ordinarily, that would be all the review needed for the project to 
go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 However, an incensed landowner across the street from the center filed an 
appeal with the council, forcing it to hold a hearing on the expanded sleeping 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Must we, the working, tax-paying people, be forced out of our businesses or 
homes because this area is no longer safe?" asked LaVada L. Orcutt, who with 
her brother-in-law William Orcutt appealed the commission's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents and business people joined the Orcutts at the council meeting, 
filling up long rows of chairs as they waited their turn to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had arson attempts on my building," thundered Ventura Superior Court 
Judge William Peck, owner of an adjacent apartment complex, attributing the 
problem to Turning Point's clients. "People are urinating on my property all 
the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you -- I've had it," he said. "What I want you to do tonight is say 
no to this expansion." 
</P>
<P>
 But after more than two hours of testimony from foes and supporters of the 
shelter, four council members voted down a motion by Councilman Jack Tingstrom 
to grant the appeal and overturn the Planning Commission decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Steve Bennett was absent. Councilman Jim Monahan voted for 
Tingstrom's motion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures, who ran her campaign in the fall 
on a pro-business platform, sided with Councilmen Gary Tuttle and Gregory L. 
Carson, and Mayor Tom Buford in approving the downstairs beds over the 
objections of neighborhood business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an extremely difficult decision," Measures said Tuesday. "But in the 
long run, I believe, this will better accommodate the businesses. (If the city 
did not approve the beds) in the long run, people will not be served and it 
will be more of a problem than if we served them." 
</P>
<P>
 After the vote to kill the proposal failed, the council voted to approve the 
10 extra cots with strict conditions, including a requirement that Turning 
Point officials meet with their neighbors every three months to work through 
problems.

SUPERVISORS AGREE TO PUT DUMP ON THE BALLOT; LANDFILL: BOARD WILL LET VOTERS 
MAKE DECISION ON WELDON CANYON SITE. OJAI AND VENTURA OFFICIALS FILE LEGAL 
CHALLENGE. 
</P>

<P>
 Bound by law, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors reluctantly agreed 
Tuesday to give voters a say on the Weldon Canyon landfill, prompting Ojai and 
Ventura city officials to file suit against the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The board placed the landfill initiative on November's ballot, setting up a 
potentially divisive campaign that could pit east county communities against 
their west county neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to stop the proposed landfill, Ojai and Ventura say they have 
already found more than a dozen ways that the measure violates state law. Chief 
among the legal flaws, they argue, is that the initiative vests rights in a 
single business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very cynical use of the initiative process when a private company has 
used the ballot initiative to convey special privileges to itself," Ojai City 
Atty. Monte Widders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Effectively, the initiative would grant certain zoning and land-use powers 
specifically to Taconic Resources, the San Diego County partnership that drew 
up the ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The county board was unwilling to grant those rights to Waste Management Inc. 
last year, and the national firm withdrew its proposal. Taconic picked up the 
project this spring, launching a petition drive and garnering an estimated 
25,400 signatures supporting the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Many supporters came from the east county communities, who are concerned that 
their western neighbors will soon begin dumping their trash in the Simi Valley 
Landfill. "There are 25,400 people represented in this boardroom," said Steven 
Frank, a conservative political consultant from Simi Valley. "These are the 
people who would like the right to vote for a landfill in Weldon Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not just a few naysayers, the 'No-jai' crowd, have a chance to be heard," 
Frank added, to hisses and boos from the boardroom packed with Ojai residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The landfill opponents filed up to the podium Tuesday morning to denounce the 
project and the "carpetbagger" firm pushing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still corporate greed, profits and lies that drive the deceit behind the 
methods employed by Taconic Resources," said Michael Shapiro of the Coalition 
to Stop the Weldon Canyon Dump. His group filed a companion suit Tuesday, 
ensuring that a legal challenge continues if the cities later back down. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Cohen, a Thousand Oaks lawyer hired last week to represent Taconic, 
urged supervisors to ignore the rhetoric and the emotion of the morning's 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you have before you is, very simply, a petition that has followed the 
rules of the election code . . . ," he said. "This is not a forum for the 
ultimate decision." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the board had little choice but to add the measure to the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We find ourselves, the Board of Supervisors, faced with a legal 
responsibility" to certify the measure for the ballot, said Supervisor Maggie 
Kildee, a foe of the Weldon Canyon plan. "We, at the same time, find ourselves 
with a responsibility for local land-use planning, which this initiative will 
take away from us." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Tuesday's vote, the board is expected to join Ojai and Ventura in the 
lawsuit questioning the measure's legal validity. Three of five county 
supervisors oppose the initiative, and County Counsel James McBride has already 
pointed out potential legal problems in the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Widders, Ojai's city attorney, said he hoped a judge could hear arguments on a 
temporary restraining order within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said he believed the ballot initiative would survive a legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the legal issue lies a deeper dispute over how to dispose of trash in 
the western half of the county. The Bailard Landfill -- which now takes much of 
the trash from Ventura, Ojai, Oxnard and Camarillo -- is set to close in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a replacement in sight, east county communities fear the trash will be 
shipped to Simi Valley, filling up that site more quickly and creating truck 
traffic on local streets. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to these concerns, western cities have begun looking for other 
solutions to the trash problems. Ojai, Ventura and the county government are 
now considering a joint powers agreement, which would develop a 15-year plan 
for dealing with the region's trash, officials said.

SHERIFF BACKS CITIES' BID FOR PROP. 172 FUNDS; FINANCES: CARPENTER SAYS HE 
WANTS TO PROTECT EXTRA SALES TAX MONEY FROM BEING RAIDED BY SUPERVISORS FOR 
NON-LAW ENFORCEMENT USES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sheriff Larry Carpenter has agreed to back the cities' latest campaign to 
claim a share of Proposition 172 sales tax revenues, in an agreement that would 
give the sheriff and cities more money for local law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayors of Ventura County's 10 cities turned to Carpenter for support after 
twice failing to persuade the Board of Supervisors to use Proposition 172 
revenues to pay for jail booking fees and subsidize municipal law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The new proposal includes a request for funds to expand programs to curb 
domestic violence and teach schoolchildren and teen-agers about the dangers of 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders say improving those programs and eliminating the jail booking 
fees would free time and money for improved police protection in the cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping the addition of the sheriff's support and these other programs 
will make a difference," Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton said. "It's not just 
the cities anymore; it's the cities and the sheriff." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter said he decided to support the proposal after city leaders agreed to 
ask that the funds be funneled through the Sheriff's Department before being 
distributed to city-run programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carpenter added that he is more concerned now with protecting Proposition 
172 funds from being raided by the board as it seeks to salvage the county's 
budget from state cuts and a sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I support the effort of the cities because I certainly think it is an 
appropriate expenditure of funds," Carpenter said. "The caveat I throw in is 
that the way things are going, there may not be any Proposition 172 funds for 
any of us." 
</P>
<P>
 The cities are asking for up to 10% of the more than $29 million in sales tax 
revenue the county expects to collect in the 1994-95 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee said she was not swayed by the cities' proposal and 
was surprised that Carpenter had agreed to support it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot believe Carpenter is doing this," she said. "Why does he want to 
give away money we don't have to the cities that do have the money?" 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the board voted to spend $24 million of the special sales taxes to 
increase the number of sheriff's deputies, prosecutors and public defenders. A 
portion of the funds will also be spent on the county jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Wittenberg, the county's chief administrative officer, recommends that 
the rest of the money be used to offset a $17-million deficit in the county 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff's support of the cities' plan was announced at a Tuesday meeting 
of the Assn. of Ventura County Cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayors of each of the 10 cities agreed to send a letter to the board 
informing them of Carpenter's support and once again requesting those funds and 
outlining the new terms of the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to asking for a repeal of a $120 processing fee charged for each 
inmate booked into county jails, the letter calls for additional funds for 
anti-drug DARE education programs and countywide Mental Health Emergency teams 
to help with domestic violence disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor John K. Flynn said that although in theory he supports repeal of 
the booking fees and expansion of the programs cited by the mayors, he would be 
reluctant to use Proposition 172 funds to cover the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Expanding these programs would be a great benefit to the cities and the 
community at large," Flynn said. "But we've got some serious budget problems, 
and I just don't know if we can do it with Proposition 172 money." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Mayor Tom Buford refused to be discouraged by the board's lukewarm 
reception to the cities' proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of us came into this with the idea that this is going to be 
easily accepted by the county," Buford said. "If this idea doesn't work, we'll 
work twice as hard on the next one."

OXNARD GUNMAN SOUGHT AS HIS VICTIM IS MOURNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While friends and family of Roberto Calderon Leyva streamed past his open 
casket at an emotional memorial service Tuesday, Oxnard police sought to close 
in on the young gunman suspected in the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators combed the Lemonwood area of Oxnard on Monday night and again 
Tuesday, interviewing residents and seeking information that might lead them to 
the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect -- described by Oxnard police as a gang member with a criminal 
record -- shot Leyva, 35, in front of his wife and two small children in a 
restaurant parking lot after the suspect accused the victim of staring at his 
female companion, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, detectives huddled with Ventura County prosecutors throughout 
Tuesday, compiling witness accounts and other evidence to secure a warrant for 
the arrest of the suspect, who authorities say is widely known in the Lemonwood 
area of south Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our officers have the information as to who he is," police spokesman 
David Keith said. "They have his photo and we have 160 officers who have been 
briefed on his identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we come across him, we'll pick him up," Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is not yet a signed arrest warrant, the suspect's identity 
cannot be released, police said. A news conference announcing the warrant and 
updating the manhunt is set for this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Roger Inman said the decision to withhold the suspect's 
name was made by Oxnard police. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not in control of anything at this point in time," said Inman, who is 
assigned to the case. "We haven't seen any paperwork." 
</P>
<P>
 Leyva was shot Sunday night in the parking lot of an Oxnard pizza parlor after 
encountering the suspect and a group of friends, who were also eating at the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses and police said the suspect accused Leyva of making improper eye 
contact with a woman at the suspect's table.  
</P>
<P>
 After a verbal exchange prompted the manager to ask them both to leave the 
restaurant, the gunman approached Leyva and shot him in the stomach as his wife 
and two young children looked on, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 A railroad worker who played professional soccer for years, Leyva died about 
10 hours later at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect and his sister fled the scene in a charcoal-gray pickup truck, 
which they abandoned about four miles away in Lemonwood before running off on 
foot, police said. Police arrested the sister for aiding a fugitive, but have 
not released her name. 
</P>
<P>
 Flower arrangements arrived throughout much of the morning Tuesday, as scores 
of Leyva's friends and family dealt with the tragedy at a daylong visitation 
service at Garcia Mortuary in downtown Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Leyva's soccer team jacket was draped across his casket, as his wife, Susana, 
and the couple's two children grieved and lingered at the front of the viewing 
room. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wish this had never happened," said Amelia Rangel, Leyva's sister 
from Porterville. "He was such a nice man." 
</P>
<P>
 Donations to the family are being accepted at Garcia Mortuary. A rosary 
service is scheduled for 8 o'clock tonight at Our Lady of Guadalupe church in 
Oxnard, with a Mass at 8 a.m. Thursday at the same church. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, friends and family members remembered Leyva as a gentle man who 
loved his family. Witnesses to the shooting said Leyva pushed his family to 
safety seconds before the gunman fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was trying to protect his family, like he knew something was going to 
happen," said Esperanza Gonzalez, another of Leyva's sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Rangel said her brother, who was to begin training Monday in San Diego for his 
new position with Amtrak, was once the best goalie in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "His dream was to play in one of the World Cups, but he never made it," she 
said. "His next dream was to see his son play in the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew him well said they could not understand what provoked the 
gunman to shoot Leyva. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want the worst for him," Rangel said of the suspect. "But I hope he 
knows the pain we're going through."

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; SCHOOL PROGRAM STEERS STUDENTS ONTO 
RIGHT PATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 At the tender age of 12, Alana Romero started getting in trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 As a sixth-grader, the Simi Valley girl started drinking and running with the 
wrong crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wanted to turn around and go down the right path," she said Tuesday, 
explaining how a new summer school program at Hillside Junior High School has 
helped her with that journey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we talk and share our feelings," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's what makes it neat -- (the teachers) care." 
</P>
<P>
 Alana is one of about 30 youngsters enrolled in a two-week program called 
Project SAFE -- Safe Alternatives For Empowerment -- being offered by the Simi 
Valley Police Department and the Simi Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The fledgling program is designed to teach junior high school-age youths how 
to avoid drugs, campus violence, sexual harassment and gangs while building the 
students' self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to teach them that they have choices and that those choices have 
consequences," said Jane Troy, one of two teachers running the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the youths enrolled in Project SAFE are like Alana: good students who 
are struggling against preteen pressures such as drugs, gangs and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the time when the pressure and the choices are the most difficult," 
said Shirley Blough, the other instructor for Project SAFE. 
</P>
<P>
 And the students agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I graduated from sixth grade I felt really nervous about seventh 
grade," said 12-year-old Jennifer Vermilyea.  
</P>
<P>
 But after spending a week talking with other anxious 12-year-olds about their 
worries, Jennifer said: "I feel better."  
</P>
<P>
 The new program offers three two-week sessions in June and July at no cost to 
students.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to daily four-hour classes, the youngsters take two field trips: 
one to the California Youth Authority and one to the Simi Valley Courthouse, 
which the group visited Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Project SAFE was formed, in part, because of a growing concern in Simi Valley 
about campus violence after the fatal stabbing of a junior high school student 
earlier this year.  
</P>
<P>
 But Troy said the incident has not entered into classroom discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're here for is not to dwell," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think what we are doing here is saying, 'Let's prevent it from happening.'

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: 4-DAY WORKWEEK SAVINGS REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The four-day workweek instituted last year for Ventura County's government 
workers has saved the county more than $1 million, as electric bills dropped 
and employees took fewer sick days, a county report shows. 
</P>
<P>
 With about one-third of its employees working four, 10-hour shifts each week, 
the county has saved an estimated $451,000 on utilities, $270,000 on sick leave 
and $355,000 in car-pooling incentives, according to the report presented 
Tuesday to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, new work schedules have helped the county meet its state and 
federal smog reduction requirements by keeping more cars off the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pleased to see that it does seem be achieving the goals we set," 
Supervisor Maggie Kildee said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor John K. Flynn said any report would be incomplete without 
measuring the impact on the taxpayers who depend on county government for 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The employees, they're satisfied, I submit," Flynn said. "But we need to know 
what the customers think. I suspect the customers are not satisfied." 
</P>
<P>
 Other board members said the community seems to have adjusted to the 
inconvenience of shutting down many county offices on Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally don't like it," Supervisor Vicky Howard said. But, she added: "I 
haven't received any complaints for a very long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors initiated the four-day workweek in June, 1993, as a means of 
cutting costs and reducing the number of cars traveling the county's roads. 
County officials projected $1 million in savings, but later scaled that 
estimate back to $125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the county secured its federal highway dollars by meeting its 
goals for air pollution reduction. The federal government could have withheld 
as much as $6 million a year had the county failed to meet requirements set for 
average vehicle ridership. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CONEJO VALLEY; SCHOOL LUNCH PRICE INCREASE 
CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley school board will decide Thursday whether to increase school 
lunch prices to offset a shortfall in the food service budget for the 1994-95 
school year. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved, elementary school lunch prices would increase 5 cents to $1.65, 
and junior high and high school lunch prices would increase 25 cents to $2.25. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed increase would not affect free and reduced meals that are 
government funded. 
</P>
<P>
 The larger price increase at the junior highs and high schools is attributed 
to larger meal portions and students' requests for lunches from Taco Bell and 
other eateries, district officials explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Unified School District officials, who have not raised meal 
prices in three years, said they tried to avoid asking for an increase but 
ongoing budget constraints forced the request. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been running in the red and our expenses have gone up in the last few 
years," Food Services Director Connie Noggle said Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have tried to hold off, we know the area has been in a recession." 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing food and operational costs combined with a decrease in federal 
reimbursement have contributed to the budget shortfall, district officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To help offset the price hike for parents, the district intends to offer meal 
ticket packages at a discount.  
</P>
<P>
 A block of 20 meal tickets for elementary school lunches would cost $30, or 
$1.50 per meal, while 20 tickets for junior high and high school lunches would 
cost $40, or $2 per meal. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials hope the discount will encourage parents to buy prepaid 
meals, which would ideally result in more children buying school lunches. TRACY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; COMMISSION OKS DEVELOPMENT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A revision of the blueprint for future development in Thousand Oaks has been 
approved by the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission after a lengthy debate 
focused mostly on semantics. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners wrangled over a few passages in the proposed revision of the 
city's general plan, but approved the new version largely intact. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have spent three years formulating the plan, which will guide 
all future development in the city.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee formed to study the general plan held five public meetings on 
the issue and has submitted the plan in segments for approval by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night, the commission took up elements of the plan dealing with goals 
for open space and roadway changes to handle continued growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners praised the document, which emphasizes the city's interest in 
preserving open space and protecting the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the outcome of a fantastic effort," Commissioner Marilyn Carpenter 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is something we can be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Mervyn Kopp said he supported most of the plan, but criticized 
wording that he said suggests that Thousand Oaks is better than neighboring 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when you say we're going to try to be 'visually distinct from 
surrounding communities' it comes across as elitist," Kopp said. "Why can't we 
just say we want to look good." 
</P>
<P>
 But commissioners Carpenter, Irving Wasserman and Linda Parks said they 
approved of the wording. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal passed 4-0, with Commissioner Forrest Frields absent, and will be 
forwarded to the City Council at the end of the summer. MATTHEW MOSK

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; CABLE TV FIRM TOLD TO REDUCE RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ojai City Council ordered its local cable company Tuesday to lower its 
basic monthly rates by 18 cents and refund money to customers who the city says 
have been overcharged since September. 
</P>
<P>
 But the parent company of Ventura County Cablevision, Western Communications, 
said it will appeal the council's ruling with the Federal Communications 
Commission, which can reverse the council's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai officials and Cablevision representatives disagree over the amount that 
cable rates should have been lowered to comply with new FCC regulations 
implemented last September. Ojai officials say the current monthly rate of 
$10.62 for basic cable service should have been lowered to $10.44, but 
Cablevision officials say the rate is correct. 
</P>
<P>
 The refund would amount to about $7,000 divided among about 3,000 subscribers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai City Manager Andrew Belknap said FCC regulations change frequently, 
leading to differing interpretations of how the regulations affect billing. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie DeVarney, a consultant hired by Ojai and principal of Laurel 
Communications Group, said her firm and Western Communications disagree on the 
method for calculating one part of the overall equation for arriving at the 
cable rate. 
</P>
<P>
 DeVarney said her firm concluded that the portion of the rate formula in 
question is correct. But Johnnie Giles, director of government affairs for 
Western Communications, said his company believes that part of the formula is 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that it was a basic flaw in the form," Giles said. "Many operators 
filed clarifications on this very item."  
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, the council voted to raise the franchise fee on cable bills for 
Ojai residents from 3% to 5%, amounting to a monthly increase that would amount 
to no more than 40 cents. Belknap said DeVarney suggested the hike because the 
city was not recouping costs it incurred implementing FCC regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, a new round of cable rates will take effect, further lowering the 
monthly rate to $10.05. JASON GRANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: POINT MUGU; EX-NAVY MAN HELD IN THEFT OF COMPUTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 22-year-old Hollywood man, suspected of stealing thousands of dollars of 
Navy computer equipment, was arrested over the weekend at the Point Mugu Naval 
Air Weapons Station, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonel Claude Jr. was taken into custody Saturday by investigators with the 
Naval Criminal Investigative Service and FBI agents following a brief foot 
pursuit and search of the sprawling base. 
</P>
<P>
 About 5:30 a.m., Navy security officers apprehended a man lifting an estimated 
$20,000 worth of computer equipment out of offices at the base headquarters 
building, said Alan Alpers, a Navy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to finding the former Navy enlisted man, the two security agents 
discovered a small moving van parked outside of the rear entrance to the 
building and some broken windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpers said the suspect was caught in a hallway with seven computers sitting 
on rolling office chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stopped him, asked for his identity and began walking him to the front 
desk," Alpers said. "They nearly got him to the desk when he bolted -- ran 
right out the front doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Claude eluded base security officials for six hours, apparently by hiding in a 
bathroom stall in an adjacent building. He was discovered and arrested about 
11:30 a.m., Alpers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpers said the arrest ended an eight-month investigation of Claude, who was 
discharged from the Navy in October, 1993. While in the service he was assigned 
to the Naval Support Force Antarctica, which is based at the Naval Construction 
Battalion Center in Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal agents are investigating possible links between Claude and other Navy 
computer thefts, Alpers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alpers said that Claude was on the base with permission Saturday as someone's 
guest. Federal officials are looking for the person who invited him onto the 
base. J.E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; LANDFILL, NUNS REACH PRELIMINARY ACCORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA LIMA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Operators of the Bailard Landfill near Oxnard, and Catholic nuns from a nearby 
convent have agreed on a preliminary settlement aimed at ending their 
four-month dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Guided by a mediator, the nuns and district officials spent 14 hours Friday 
working on the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We reached a tentative agreement and now we have to refine the agreement," 
said David Worley, attorney for the Ventura Regional Sanitation District, which 
operates the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute between the nuns and the district began after the Ventura County 
Board of Supervisors voted in March to extend the life of the landfill until 
May, 1997. The dump had been scheduled to close in December, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The nuns, who run a convent about 500 feet from the landfill, complained that 
dust, noise and odor from the dump were unhealthy and at times unbearable. They 
asked the district to buy their property and find them someplace else to live.  
</P>
<P>
 Last May the district filed a lawsuit to force the nuns to accept $96,500 as 
compensation for their inconvenience. If both parties agree on the settlement, 
the lawsuit will be dismissed, Worley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both parties agreed not to disclose terms of the agreement until July 21 when 
the district's board will decide whether to approve it, Worley said. CHRISTINA

ARCHITECTS OF 200-MILE TRAIL SYSTEM PUT A DREAM ON THE MAP; ENVIRONMENT: 
OFFICIALS ENVISION PATHWAYS FOR MANY TYPES OF USERS. THE DRAFT PLAN WILL BE 
UNVEILED TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His hands spread out on a five-foot-wide map, Ron Blakemore explains how he 
envisions getting Ventura County residents out of their cars and onto a 
proposed 200-mile-long system of trails. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like that old movie thing," Blakemore said. "If we build it they 
will come. If people have the facilities, they will use them." 
</P>
<P>
 Blakemore is the administrator of the Regional Trails and Pathways Program, an 
ambitious system of interlinking trails for bikers, hikers and horseback riders 
introduced by Supervisors Vicky Howard and Maggie Kildee. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of a 38-member advisory committee, Blakemore has spent the last 
year developing a trail system so extensive that it promises to allow residents 
to step out of their cars and roam Ventura County from one end to another, not 
just for pleasure, but also for commuting. 
</P>
<P>
 His giant maps of the county are crisscrossed with double blue and fuchsia 
lines racing from city to city, following riverbeds, coastline and ridgelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost like a child's game of navigating a room without ever touching the 
floor, the new Regional Trails and Pathways plan would establish a system of 
trails separate from roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft plan will be unveiled tonight at a 7 o'clock meeting in the Rancho 
Santa Susana Community Center in Simi Valley. Six more meetings are scheduled 
to gather public comment on the plans throughout the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakemore will incorporate suggestions from the public and then present a 
revised plan to city governments and agencies throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If he can persuade the more than 50 government entities to sign off on the 
proposal, it will go to the County Board of Supervisors for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakemore acknowledges that the plan is still 15 to 20 years away from 
completion. But he thinks Ventura County is on the cutting edge of a new 
concept -- combining transportation with recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be the model for all other counties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One study estimated that 50,000 county commuters could use part of the trail 
system each day, and Blakemore believes that number will probably be closer to 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 While many cities, such as Seattle and Berkeley, have made it easier for 
commuters to travel by bicycle, Blakemore said Ventura County would be the 
first place he knows of to establish multipurpose trails that meet the needs of 
equestrians, hikers and bike commuters simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, he says, lies in establishing a trail etiquette to be followed by 
all users. A horse gets the right of way, followed by foot traffic, with bikers 
moving aside for both. Though hikers and mountain bikers fight over trails in 
some parts of the nation, Blakemore said Ventura County cyclists and walkers 
have friendlier relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail system has received considerable support from business leaders at 
advisory committee meetings. Supervisor Kildee said businesses want to 
encourage two-wheeled commuting, but fear that roadways are not safe enough for 
bikers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fatality of the Amgen employee has raised our awareness," Kildee said, 
referring to the death of Amgen researcher Walter Tupper, 26, who died in May 
after being hit by a car while commuting on his bicycle. "Making commuting by 
bike safer is a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the proposed pathways lie along flood-control channels, while others 
pass through farmlands. Before the first trail is cut, lengthy negotiations 
have to be carried out with private owners and public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Advisory committee member Bob Smith has concentrated his efforts on figuring 
out a way to get hikers and bikers from Camarillo, over the Conejo Grade and 
into Newbury Park. He has come up with several routes without particularly 
steep grades. All that remains, he said, is persuading landowners to let 
commuters on bikes whiz past their property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're getting close," Smith said. "Nothing is impossible, you just 
have to be patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Kildee nor Howard could put a price tag on the trail system, saying it 
was too early to estimate costs. 
</P>
<P>
 No one denies the price will be steep. But Blakemore said plans call for 
establishing a nonprofit foundation to support the trails and demanding that 
developers set aside land for the trail system. The county would also seek 
volunteers to patrol the trails and solicit corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point the plan is hardly more than lines on a map. The county, along 
with Fillmore, Ventura and Santa Paula, is negotiating to buy an easement along 
the 32-mile stretch of the Santa Paula Railway for an estimated $9 million. If 
that sale goes through, a major component of the trail system's backbone would 
be established along the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the only established parts of the system are the nearly 10-mile Ojai 
Trail and the six-mile stretch along the Arroyo Simi in Simi Valley. Sixteen 
miles down and at least 184 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have enough imagination to carry it forward," said Blakemore. "All 
I've got to do is pull it off." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Regional Trails and Pathways Program representatives will discuss the trails 
system at various public meetings, beginning today at the Rancho Santa Susana 
Community Center, Micom Recreation Room, 5005 Los Angeles Ave., Simi Valley, 
from 7 to 9 p.m. Other public meetings are planned for the Oxnard Public 
Library on Monday; the Oakview Community Center on July 20; Ventura City Hall 
on July 21; Santa Paula Community Center on July 25 and the Camarillo Community 
Center on July 27. Call Ron Blakemore at 654-3962 for more information and 
specific times. Meetings in Oak Park, Moorpark and Thousand Oaks will be 
announced later.

CITY'S HELP SOUGHT IN SAVING CREEK HABITAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 East Camarillo residents have asked the City Council to use its influence to 
assure that a Ventura County flood control project proposed for Calleguas Creek 
is constructed in an environmentally sensitive manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the county Flood Control District say the project is needed to 
help guard against flooding and soil erosion along the creek. The proposal 
calls for realigning the creek and constructing a new channel to the west about 
twice the width of the current creek bed. 
</P>
<P>
 The realignment, planned for a one-mile section between Upland and Adolfo 
roads, calls for parts of the creek banks to be lined with rocks and concrete, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 If completed as proposed, the project would also make available for 
development land owned by Pardee Construction Co. and the Baldwin Co., who 
together are proposing to build nearly 500 new homes on sites north and south 
of the creek. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 east Camarillo residents and area environmental activists attended a 
study session at Camarillo City Hall on Monday, where many asked the council to 
use its authority to make sure that a wooded bank of the creek, located roughly 
in the middle of the proposed project, be preserved as a plant and wildlife 
habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must leave this as an area for wildlife," said Michael Creadick, a Mission 
Oaks-area resident. "I am asking you to do what you can to make sure this place 
doesn't get damaged. We have to make sure (construction crews) tread lightly 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing Creadick was Cynthia Leake, vice president of the Ventura County 
Environmental Coalition and an east Camarillo resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is outrageous," Leake said. "It's the last little place of its kind in 
Camarillo that developers haven't wrecked." 
</P>
<P>
 County flood control officials said the modification, still awaiting final 
approval from the Board of Supervisors, will be done carefully to preserve the 
creek's native habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this as a very good compromise," said Dolores Taylor, a county flood 
control engineer. "We have come a long way from putting in a concrete-lined, 
U-shaped channel with two service roads." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said once completed, the new channel will be able to withstand the 
force of a 100-year storm, or as much as 28,000 cubic feet of water per second. 
A construction start date has not yet been determined. The proposal is part of 
a larger, five-year project to control erosion along Calleguas Creek at a total 
estimated cost of between $4 million and $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ken Gose cautioned residents that because the area is not under 
Camarillo's authority, the city is limited in what it can do. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Gose said the council and the city's planning department hope to work 
with the county's flood control department to ensure the area is not destroyed 
by the construction efforts.

CLUB SAYS MISMANAGEMENT LEADS TO DEBTS OF $55,000; MOORPARK: YOUTH GROUP ASKS 
CITY TO DELAY REPAYMENT OF A LOAN AS IT RECOVERS FROM DEFICIT AND DIRECTIVE TO 
PAY BACK TAXES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Financial mismanagement by the previous administration of the Moorpark Boys & 
Girls Club has resulted in debts of $55,000 -- about half of the club's annual 
budget -- administrators told a Moorpark City Council committee Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Club officials projected a $25,000 deficit this fiscal year because of past 
management problems. The club must also pay the Internal Revenue Service 
$30,000 in back taxes this year, President Tony Linton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linton told the Finance Committee, which will report to the full City Council 
on the club's requests for financial breaks, that the organization is still 
suffering problems that were created years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 audit showed that state and federal taxes were unpaid for a three-year 
period beginning in 1989 and that thousands of dollars in bills were long past 
due, Linton said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came on board (in 1992), there were a myriad of problems," said 
Antoinette Carbone-Sarcinella, executive director. "If it had been any other 
board, they would have said, 'Let's close the doors and declare bankruptcy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The problems, which included non-payment of insurance premiums to protect the 
club from legal liability, were detected after former Executive Director 
Dominik Lee voluntarily resigned two years ago, Linton said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, who left the organization to attend law school in San Diego, could not be 
reached for comment. Club officials said they have lost track of him. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60% of the club's budget goes to pay its staff of three full-time and 
two part-time employees. Officials estimated that the club spends about $31,000 
on sports leagues and youth activities for an estimated 1,300 youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the $25,000 budget deficit and $30,000 in back taxes, the club 
is carrying a $300,000 debt on an old high school gym that it bought from the 
Moorpark Unified School District two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A $50,000 payment on the gym debt is due the city this fall and another 
$100,000 must be paid to the school district in 1996, Linton said. The club 
borrowed the $50,000 from the city to make the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday evening, Linton asked the Finance Committee to help the club resolve 
its problems by backing a one- or two-year delay in the $50,000 repayment. He 
also asked the city to forgive the $2,400 annual interest payment on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee members said they might consider putting off the repayment but would 
probably not defer interest. They said they wanted to take a closer look at the 
club's financial records before making any recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Scott Montgomery, a committee member, said in an interview that he 
did not think that the city can afford to give the club any money. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city is determined that they stay afloat," he said. "Apparently they're 
carrying a large ball and chain from a previous administration. . . . Perhaps 
we can offer some suggestions on how to manage their budget. Perhaps we can act 
as an intermediary with the IRS. I don't know what else we could do right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Linton said he hopes that the club will regain financial health through 
intensive fund-raising and by applying for new grants. The organization also 
hopes that the IRS, which has been encouraging in its response, will agree to a 
long-term payment plan.

VALLEY BRIEFING: THE ZONING GAME ; PLAYING WITH A CITY'S BUILDING BLOCKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Say a developer proposes a three-story office building on Ventura Boulevard in 
Encino. But nearby residents howl in protest when he gets the permit to build 
with only perfunctory review. How did it happen? Most likely, the land was 
zoned for just such a use and the developer had what is called a "by-right 
entitlement" to build. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoning land is one of the most fundamental powers a local government has. It 
essentially establishes areas within a city or county where certain types of 
uses -- such as residential, commercial or industrial -- are permitted and how 
intense those uses should be. 
</P>
<P>
 As simple as that sounds, the practice and history of zoning are often messy 
affairs. Most disputes between neighborhood groups and City Hall have zoning at 
their root -- from allowing a day-care center into a residential neighborhood 
to permitting apartments on a commercial strip. 
</P>
<P>
 But deciphering the alphabet soup of zoning designations -- such as RZ2.5, CR 
and MR2 -- can be mind-numbing. And the friction between zones can create 
flare-ups, like the one between the owner of a Sherman Oaks coffeehouse and the 
homeowners in an adjacent single-family neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoning was supposed to make city life easier. Early History 
</P>
<P>
 Modern zoning has its roots in English common law and nuisance abatement laws, 
which gave government the right to regulate obnoxious uses on private property. 
But during the Industrial Revolution, the need for government regulation became 
more pressing. Cities were crowded, unhealthy places and local governments 
tried to bring order to the urban jumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoning differs from planning. Planning imagines the future in broad terms. 
Zoning is intended to implement that vision block by block and consequently 
prescribes specific designations for specific properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles passed its first zoning ordinance in 1907. New York passed one in 
1916. But property rights advocates argued at the time that the practice of 
zoning was unconstitutional because it deprived them of full use of their land. 
Euclid vs. Ambler  
</P>
<P>
 The showdown over zoning came in 1926, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on a 
case against the Village of Euclid, Ohio, by the Ambler Realty Co. In the 
1920s, Euclid officials enacted a zoning ordinance to stave off the approach of 
factories and apartment buildings from nearby Cleveland. In the process, some 
property owned by Ambler was zoned to allow only one- and two-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambler sued, but the court ruled that "the complex conditions of our day" 
justified Euclid's regulations. The court added that zones of the same use must 
be treated the same. For example, the owner of property in a light industrial 
zone must have the same development rights as all other owners of property in 
such a zone. In addition, the court ruled that every parcel in a jurisdiction 
must have some sort of zoning designation. 
</P>
<P>
 This became known as Euclidean zoning. The Emergence of Zoning 
</P>
<P>
 Grumbling property owners soon found that zoning could help them sell their 
product. People liked to live in well-ordered neighborhoods. A pyramid model -- 
with single-family homes at the top and industries at the bottom -- emerged, 
with uses at the top permitted in zones below, but not vice versa. That soon 
changed so that zones were restricted only to their specified use. The 
automobile encouraged this trend toward sprawl and it is largely how the San 
Fernando Valley developed. Invisible Walls  
</P>
<P>
 The idea of zoning has always appealed to those with upper-crust 
sensibilities. In fact, zoning became a tool to keep certain people out of 
neighborhoods, requiring, for example, large houses that would be beyond the 
reach of many income groups. While not explicitly discriminatory, such zoning 
effectively walled off many neighborhoods across the country.  
</P>
<P>
 But in 1975, the New Jersey Supreme Court said local governments had a 
"presumptive obligation" to zone and plan housing for all income groups. 
Although the U.S. Supreme Court did not take the case, many states have 
embraced the principles of the New Jersey decision. 
</P>
<P>
 C1: Local retail shops and offices 
</P>
<P>
 C1.5: Department stores and theaters 
</P>
<P>
 C2: Service stations and garages 
</P>
<P>
 R1: Single-family homes 
</P>
<P>
 R3: Apartment buildings and day-care centers 
</P>
<P>
 M3: Heavy industrial Zones in Action 
</P>
<P>
 Reading zoning designations can be confusing, especially in such a big city as 
Los Angeles. In general, designations are made up of one or two letters 
followed by a number. The first letter of a designation indicates the use. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Agriculture 
</P>
<P>
 P: Parking 
</P>
<P>
 C: Commercial 
</P>
<P>
 M: Industrial/Manufacturing 
</P>
<P>
 R: Residential 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, a second letter follows the first, which indicates an even more 
specific use. For example, an R followed by an E, means Residential Estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The number after letters indicates the intensity. For example, an R1 zone 
permits single-family homes while an R3 zone allows apartment houses.

ALL-STAR GAME; EXPOS' ALOU LETS NL END SIX-YEAR SKID; BASEBALL: HIS DOUBLE IN 
THE 10TH INNING PROVIDES AN 8-7 VICTORY OVER THE AL. MCGRIFF HITS A CRUCIAL 
HOME RUN. 
</P>

<P>
 The story of the 65th All-Star game Tuesday night is the story of the season: 
</P>
<P>
 Not even baseball's best pitchers could extinguish the hit parade that has 
distinguished the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 The American League outhit the National, 15-12, but saw its six-game winning 
streak end, 8-7, in 10 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-run, pinch-hit homer by Fred McGriff against major league save leader 
Lee Smith wiped out a 7-5 American lead with one out in the ninth, and the 
National won it against Jason Bere of the Chicago White Sox in the 10th on a 
leadoff single by Tony Gwynn and a double by Moises Alou of the Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome wasn't a surprise once the game entered extra innings for the 
first time since 1987. The National has won all nine All-Star games to go past 
nine. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff, the Atlanta Braves' first baseman, got only one at-bat but won the 
most valuable player trophy, absolving manager Jim Fregosi of the criticism he 
received for selecting McGriff over the right-handed-hitting Andres Galarraga 
as a backup first baseman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to win and I was thinking about a left-handed hitter coming off the 
bench," Fregosi, the Philadelphia Phillies' manager, said of the McGriff 
selection. "The problem was, I kept waiting for a spot to use him and almost 
ran out of time." 
</P>
<P>
 Marquis Grissom walked to open the ninth. Craig Biggio grounded into a force 
play, but McGriff, batting for Randy Myers, connected to left center on a 
1-and-2 fastball as a partisan National League crowd of 59,568 at Three Rivers 
Stadium, the largest baseball crowd in Pittsburgh history, thundered approval. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff, who enters the second half with 23 homers, said this one ranked with 
a playoff homer against the Phillies last year as a career highlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm building a new home in Tampa, and the trophy will go in a prominent 
spot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smith had thrown two fastballs by me and I told myself that I had to be a 
little quicker. I expected him to throw me another, and he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Fregosi used 26 of his 28 players, saving pitcher Bret Saberhagen and 
outfielder Jeff Conine. McGriff was thinking he might not get a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew Jimmy was trying to save me just in case, but I was starting to sweat. 
We were behind, it was tough to make changes, and it was getting late. I feel 
good that I was able to come through for him because he took some heat for 
picking me." 
</P>
<P>
 In a game of 27 hits, the National produced the only homers, with Grissom, 
selected by Fregosi to replace sidelined center fielder Lenny Dykstra, 
connecting for a solo shot against Randy Johnson in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has been talking about the power in the American League lineup, and 
guys like (Ken) Griffey and (Frank) Thomas are definitely putting up awesome 
numbers, but we can hold our own," McGriff said of the National League. "We 
don't have to take a back seat to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 On another tough night for the pitchers, each side used eight; only Wilson 
Alvarez of the AL and Ken Hill of the NL worked hitless innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Ricky Bones remained in the American bullpen when Bere, the 23-year-old 
White Sox sophomore, yielded the leadoff single to Gwynn, who had earlier 
doubled in two runs against David Cone, in the 10th. Alou then hit his double 
to left center. 
</P>
<P>
 A flawless relay from Albert Belle to Cal Ripken Jr. to Ivan Rodriguez arrived 
at the plate ahead of Gwynn, but Rodriguez, a Gold Glove catcher who some in 
baseball consider overrated, made little attempt to block the plate and was 
slow in applying the tag as Gwynn slid in. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Gwynn: "If that had been (former Dodger) Mike Scioscia doing the 
catching, I'd have been dead meat." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who became the first catcher since Johnny Bench in 1975 to catch an 
entire All-Star game, said he believed he made the tag in time and was 
prevented from blocking the plate "because the throw short-hopped me and kind 
of (momentarily) knocked me back from the plate." 
</P>
<P>
 The AL, which got a double and single from Griffey and two singles from 
Thomas, scored three runs against Doug Drabek in the sixth -- a throwing error 
by Matt Williams was critical -- and three against Danny Jackson in the 
seventh. Fregosi had brought in his Phillie left-hander to face left-handed 
hitting Scott Cooper, Ken Lofton and Will Clark, only to see all hit safely. 
</P>
<P>
 A Gregg Jefferies double led to an NL run against Jimmy Key in the first and 
Cone yielded three more in the third, including an RBI single by Mike Piazza. 
But Grissom's homer in the sixth was the only other National run until McGriff 
homered. Among the NL All-Stars, only Gwynn and Ozzie Smith, who at 39 made the 
defensive play of the game in the seventh, were on the team that last defeated 
the AL.

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; SWEDEN, BULGARIA WILL TACKLE THE PAST; GIANTS 
STADIUM: FORMERLY TENTATIVE ITALIANS SENSE THEIR GAME IS IN GEAR AFTER 
LAST-MINUTE VICTORIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Italians realize it is no longer luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Forget the indications of a short-handed victory over Norway, of last-minute 
escapes against Nigeria and Spain.  
</P>
<P>
 When Roberto Baggio performed his goal-celebrating somersault Saturday and 
landed on his feet, they knew. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now feel we have a duty to take this thing all the way to the end," 
goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca said. 
</P>
<P>
 But look what just wandered into their path for today's World Cup semifinal at 
1 p.m. at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 What did they say their name was? Oh, yeah, Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 Those guys with shirts untucked, bad hair or no hair, shaggy beards, and 
plenty of postgame whiskey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer to play Bulgaria," Italian forward Giuseppe Signori said. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh-huh. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's matchup features one team on a mission and the other on a field trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians are silk suits, serious stares and an abiding sense of history. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulgarians are bowling shirts and belly laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians, like the Brazilians in the other bracket, are trying to become 
the first country to win four World Cup championships. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulgarians will be satisfied with a qualified interpreter so somebody can 
finally understand them. 
</P>
<P>
 After Bulgaria's stunning upset of defending champion Germany in the 
quarterfinals Sunday, an alleged linguist claimed one player said he was "on 
narcotics" during the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach, meanwhile, supposedly said the entire team played while "loaded." 
</P>
<P>
 "Such a small country, such a big success, this is a surprise to everybody," 
said midfielder Yordan Letchkov, dubbed "Air Yordan" after his flying header 
had given Bulgaria the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only a surprise when you consider Bulgaria had never won a World Cup game 
until two weeks ago. It since has defeated former world champions Argentina and 
Germany, sandwiching those victories around one over Mexico on penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Italians, the surprise is not that they reached this level but that 
they did so with their coach still employed. 
</P>
<P>
 Under great criticism for using 20 of his 22 players in a variety of lineups 
that have confused his own team, Arrigo Sacchi has nonetheless saved his job 
after an opening loss to Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, OK, his job was saved by the likes of offensive stars Roberto Baggio and 
Dino Baggio, and defenders Alessandro Costacurta and Paolo Maldini. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should change the name of the penalty zone to the Baggio zone," Sacchi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy also has two other scorers considered among the best in the world, 
Daniele Massaro and Giuseppe Signori. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sacchi has benched them today, apparently hoping they can provide 
second-half spark if the physical Bulgarians beat his team down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sacchi can still be a hero," said Giorgio Chinaglia, former Italian star. 
"But he can also still be in big, big trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 That will only happen if the Italians blow this chance to advance to the final 
for the first time since they were world champions in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 After their dramatic victory over Spain in the quarterfinals, they finally 
don't believe such a thing is possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning of this tournament, this team knew it was lucky," Chinaglia 
said. "But what happened against Spain, that was the Italian team that 
everybody was waiting to see on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team is ready now. There is no chance they will let down. Not with just 
one game keeping them from the finals." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulgarians, despite just two victories and four draws in 11 previous 
meetings with the Italians, are hoping otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 They have a defense that has not given up a goal, other than on a penalty 
kick, since the first game of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 They have a soccer icon in Hristo Stoitchkov, who proves it by yelling at 
teammates and grabbing his jersey when they don't pass him the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, they have "Air Yordan," who has become a World Cup cult figure 
with his bald pate and quick wit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always known I was superstar," Letchkov said. "Now, you learn too." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the chuckles, the Bulgarians hope they are subtly lathering the Italians 
in the same fear of embarrassment that paralyzed the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the big pressure is on the Italian team just as it was with the 
German team," forward Boncho Guentchev said. "If we win, it will be very good 
for Bulgaria. However, a loss at this moment may just be because this is the 
maximum this team could achieve." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Bulgarians admit they require luck. 
</P>
<P>
 Their biggest obstacle will be in overcoming a team that finally believes it 
doesn't.

MIKE DOWNEY: RUMOR OF THE DAY: ROMARIO REALLY LIKES BEBETO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brazilians have come to Nutwood. Hundreds of them. It is the name of the 
street in Fullerton where the fun-loving soccer players of Brazil are being 
lodged, directly across the street from Texas Loosey's chili parlor, where the 
women employees wear cowboy hats and bathing suits. 
</P>
<P>
 Just past lunchtime, as the salt-and-pepper sidekicks Bebeto and Romario 
stroll together through the lobby of the hotel, there is such a crush of 
Brazilian fanhood that the superstars must weave their way to a small salon as 
they would through Sweden's defense. Because of the mob, the hotel restaurant 
already has cut off service to anyone not registered as a guest, sending the 
hungry scurrying across the highway for chilly women con carne. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bebeto!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Romario!" 
</P>
<P>
 Sao duas horas (it's 2 o'clock) on a windy Terca-feira (Tuesday) afternoon 
here in Fullerton, where the hills are alive with the sound of Portuguese. The 
whole town is turning into Brazilville. The nearby university has become Cal 
State Rio. And nobody much minds anymore that Brazil is the team that 
eliminated Team USA. Forgive, forget. After all, Brazil could be the team that 
eliminates everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto. Romario. They are the go-to guys. They are the lucky strikers, the men 
who get to score the goals, the most potent 1-2 punch in World Cup soccer, men 
who hear their names called with passion wherever they go -- even Fullerton. 
And a common goal that consumes them is to end the "24 years of suffering," as 
Romario calls it, since parched Brazilians have drunk from the Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario: "We have heard it said that the yellow jersey was a pretty jersey, 
but it did not have a heart beating inside of it. We hope following this World 
Cup, it will still be a pretty jersey, but it has 11 hearts beating beneath 
it."  
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto: "Yes. Eleven hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 They think alike, these two. But are they alike? 
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario: "We are different people. Bebeto is the type that stays at home. I am 
a street cat." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind closed doors they relax, away from the hubbub outside. Romario, 28, two 
years younger and four inches shorter, wears a heavy cinco horas shadow of 
whiskers and a "Just Do It" baseball cap. Once a poor boy from Jacarezinho 
whose family had little to eat, he is now Super Romario, indebted to his 
parents for "everything I am today," a rich and famous football giant of 5 feet 
6. 
</P>
<P>
 What else is Romario? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the face of Rio. I'm a cheerful person, the sort of person who likes the 
samba and the Carnaval. I love life. I want to enjoy it. I love the sun and the 
beach. That's what the Carioca (Rio de Janeiro resident) is like, he knows how 
to enjoy life and be happy. I'm happy. After all, I'm a Carioca." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet he and Bebeto, the samba kings, share more than games and fame. 
</P>
<P>
 They are men who know pain as well as pleasure, men whose common bond includes 
family crises. Both have seen their happy home lives invaded by kidnapers. One 
man a month ago put a submachine gun to the head of Bebeto's 25-year-old 
pregnant wife. The crooks settled for a Rolex and her car. A month before that, 
it was Romario's father who was kidnaped while leaving a bar. Six days later he 
was found, unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Family ties. 
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto: "On the seventh of July, my wife gave birth to our baby, Mattheus, so 
named for (Germany's) Lothar Matthaeus, a great player. When I scored the goal 
(against the United States), I pretended to rock the baby as an homage to our 
new son." 
</P>
<P>
 Romario: "I hope his wife comes up with another baby next week." 
</P>
<P>
 They are, indeed, friends. It still amuses or annoys Bebeto and Romario when 
others try to drive a wedge between them. Some remember when Romario reportedly 
used the word chorao (crybaby) with regard to his teammate, but what Romario 
meant was that Bebeto has been known to complain to officials about calls, 
that's all. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario: "A lot of the news that arrived to us about that (not being friends) 
was simply out-and-out lies. I respect Bebeto a lot. He knows how much I like 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto: "Romario says it all." 
</P>
<P>
 It takes two to tangle. The relationship on the field between Romario de Souza 
Faria and Jose Roberto (Bebeto) Gama de Oliveira is a dance in which each knows 
the other's steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course we make a great pair," admits Bebeto, but he agrees that to truly 
be the best, first Brazil must win twice more. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario: "The only thing we have in common on the field is that we both score 
goals. Bebeto is more of a free-flowing, moving, all-around player than I am. 
He practically plays for all 90 minutes, concentrating on what is happening all 
the time. And I, my strength? My strength is sometimes people think I'm just 
sleeping." 
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto: "What can I say about Romario? He finishes like nobody. He has great 
ability, great velocity in short spaces. He's a born finisher. A lot of people 
think he is just hanging around doing nothing and suddenly, bang, it's a goal." 
</P>
<P>
 And? 
</P>
<P>
 Bebeto: "And, he's really my friend."

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; SWEDEN, BULGARIA WILL TACKLE THE PAST; ROSE 
BOWL: IN SIX WORLD CUP MEETINGS, INCLUDING A FIRST-ROUND GAME, BRAZIL HAS NEVER 
LOST TO SWEDES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If it were possible to shove aside history, or to ignore its lurking 
existence, Sweden's World Cup team would do so. But it is all there, always: 
Brazil and its beautiful game; Brazil, with Pele, the greatest player ever; 
Brazil, three-time winner of the World Cup; Brazil, whose style is often 
mimicked but never copied; Brazil, the permanent holder of the first World Cup 
trophy, the Jules Rimet Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brazil's international dominance of the sport were something to be viewed 
from afar, it might not be so threatening. But tiny Sweden already knows much 
about the soccer colossus, both historically and firsthand. Today's World Cup 
semifinal game at the Rose Bowl is not an introduction, but a continuation of 
their World Cup relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 The inevitability of playing Brazil in the World Cup grows as the tournament 
wears on -- Brazil is a team that sticks around. But for Sweden, today's game 
amounts to double jeopardy, the teams having played to a meaningless 1-1 tie at 
the end of the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 So for Sweden, Brazil looms. But then, Brazil always looms. Even as his team 
was preparing to play Romania last Sunday in what would be one of the closest 
games yet in the World Cup, Swedish Coach Tommy Svensson used the chance to 
play Brazil in the next round as motivation in his pregame speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said before the game, 'What we are playing about today is to play Brazil on 
Wednesday, semifinal in the World Cup, Rose Bowl, Pasadena, Los Angeles,' " 
Svensson said. "And that is a great thing for Sweden." 
</P>
<P>
 The chance to play soccer's icon might be viewed as a moment to be seized. How 
better for athletes to measure themselves than against their betters? Yet, some 
teams shrink from the task, fearing unfavorable comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden has taken the former stance. The team relishes the chance to play 
Brazil again. Their first meeting, two weeks ago, carried no psychic weight. It 
merely ushered the teams forward to the second round without changing anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a friendly," said Brazilian Coach Carlos Albert Parreira. "This 
is going to be a totally different game, because nothing less than the World 
Cup final is at stake. There is an advantage -- we know this team. It's better 
to play a team that you know than a team you have never played in competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Thoughts fly back to the World Cup championship game of 1958, in Stockholm. 
Brazil vs. Sweden. For the first time, Sweden was fielding a team of 
professional soccer players, and the nation shucked its usual benign 
indifference to things emotional and fell in, wildly, behind the home team. 
</P>
<P>
 Decades of restraint might have caused the Swedes to go overboard. They 
allowed cheerleaders to take the field before the semifinal against Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final against Brazil, Sweden scored in the first four minutes and the 
world expected the South Americans to collapse in despair. Sweden even scored 
another goal, but Brazil scored five and "the world" got another lesson in 
judging soccer games by geographic stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1938 World Cup in France, Sweden was dubbed "the team of steel" and 
Brazil was, as usual, considered a team capable of winning the whole thing, if 
it felt like it. Sweden roared through the second round. During an 8-0 rout of 
Cuba, French journalist Emmanuel Gambardella stopped writing at 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up to five goals is journalism," he said. "After that, it becomes 
statistics." 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil advanced with unusual efficiency, too, but then both teams lost in the 
semifinals. In the third-place game, Brazil won, 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Sweden is aware of the statistics. No one needs reminding that in the 
six times the teams have met in the World Cup, Brazil has never lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil knows, too. It is familiar with the situation, familiar with the 
pressure and the almost surreal expectations of its fans. It knows not to take 
any opponent lightly, because each opponent would like nothing more than to 
beat mighty Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Swedish team is the best possible," Parreira said. "I followed them since 
the European (Championships) competition, two years back. I think they are very 
consistent, very competitive technically. Good players. And they never give up, 
always try to come from behind. It is not by chance they are in the semifinal 
against Brazil."

NEWSWIRE: WASHINGTON PUT ON PROBATION BY NCAA

<P>
 The NCAA on Tuesday put Washington's football program on probation for two 
years and limited the Huskies to four televised regular-season games in one of 
the next two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The school will choose to have that limit imposed in 1995, said Jim Daves, 
Washington's sports information director. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalties from the NCAA Committee on Infractions are in addition to those 
imposed last year by the Pacific 10 Conference, which imposed a two-year bowl 
ban. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue were violations of NCAA rules concerning payments by boosters to 
student athletes for work not actually performed, "as well as a lack of 
institutional controls of a summer jobs program," the NCAA said in a release.

 Mississippi's Billy Brewer, the dean of Southeastern Conference football 
coaches, was fired, the latest fallout from a second NCAA investigation during 
his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 His firing came a day after Athletic Director Warner Alford resigned and 3 1/2 
weeks after the school announced an NCAA inquiry alleging 15 violations by the 
football program. Mississippi was put on probation for two years after the 1986 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer was 67-56-3 in 11 seasons at Ole Miss, leading the Rebels to three bowl 
games the past five seasons.

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; STARS AT THEIR ZENITH; BRILLIANCE OF BAGGIO, 
STOITCHKOV AND ROMARIO GROWS IN PROPORTION TO STAKES OF WORLD CUP

<P>
 Watch them when they score. Watch their faces. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone else stares in wonderment at the sky or into the stands, the better 
to understand his achievement and remember his glory. 
</P>
<P>
 Not these guys. 
</P>
<P>
 They close their eyes.  
</P>
<P>
 They need look at nothing, because they have seen it all before. 
</P>
<P>
 They require no understanding, as if they have known their task since birth. 
</P>
<P>
 They are heroes. This is their time. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Baggio of Italy. Hristo Stoitchkov of Bulgaria. Romario of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 As two years' worth of soccer has whittled the world to four teams, it also 
has unveiled three genuine stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup semifinals today will feature these three men, special in that 
their level of play has risen along with the stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 They will carry not only their teams, but the remaining days of this 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of their names, America is still interested. Because of what they can 
show us, America might still watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great ones have the ability to lift themselves on the world stage," said 
Clive Toye, soccer entrepreneur who brought Pele to America. "The great ones 
use the World Cup to say, 'Here I am!' " 
</P>
<P>
 And here they are, just what America loves, athletes with the stuff to hit the 
winning home run in the ninth, or winning three-pointer at the buzzer, or the 
last triple axel on a Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup organizers bemoaning the elimination of such glamour teams as Mexico 
and Argentina have forgotten our passion for glamour players. 
</P>
<P>
 We admire not only the athlete who performs under pressure but the one who 
pines for that pressure, who yells for the ball, who appears from nowhere when 
his team needs him most. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan. Bird. Magic. 
</P>
<P>
 These men are those men in other lifetimes. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Roberto Baggio, a man no taller than a stalk of wheat, and with the 
gall to wear a braided ponytail, but a man with a heart as big as Montana and 
legs like anvils. 
</P>
<P>
 What will he do this time? 
</P>
<P>
 Will he take a pass and juke past the goalkeeper before making a game-winning 
shot from a nearly impossible angle, as he did in the quarterfinals against 
Spain? 
</P>
<P>
 When asked to describe that goal in detail, he refused. The great soccer 
players always do, as if there is nothing they can say that will make anyone 
understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the determination and conviction to show the world I am a great 
player," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Hristo Stoitchkov, unshaven, swaggering, rude, compared by one 
writer to baseball star Kirk Gibson, and properly so. 
</P>
<P>
 What will he do this time? 
</P>
<P>
 Will he outrace one defender and run over another en route to scoring a 
stunning first goal, as he did in the second round against Mexico? 
</P>
<P>
 "I am used to games like these," he said calmly after a dramatic, 
once-in-a-lifetime shootout victory over the Mexicans. "I prepare for matches 
like these." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally there is Romario, known to his parents as Romario de Souza Farias, 
known to opponents for his speed and timing. 
</P>
<P>
 What will he do this time? 
</P>
<P>
 Will he take the ball from near midfield, race toward the net around two 
defenders and score a game-saving goal as he did in a first round tie against 
today's opponent, Sweden? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my cup," Romario says. "I will give my blood for this cup." 
</P>
<P>
 All three will. And so they are here, whereas Valderrama and Klinsmann and 
Maradona and Bergkamp are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything, the survivors relish the timing. They know the late rounds 
of the World Cup were written for soloists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody has to worry anymore about tactics that will help a team in the 
standings, because there are no more standings," former Italian star Giorgio 
Chinaglia said. "Right now, this is all about winning. These guys are freed to 
do whatever that takes. They know they can become the heroes. And they do." 
</P>
<P>
 They also do not concern themselves with pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "If anything, the World Cup is a vacation for the great players," said Paul 
Gardner, noted soccer author. "These are some of the highest-paid athletes in 
the world who play for European pro teams where every move is scrutinized. They 
feel more pressure every day in Europe than they do during an entire World 
Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the three stars began this World Cup slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio didn't score until the fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoitchkov took five shots in the opener and blew every one. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario took only four shots in the first two games. He scored twice, but he 
was barely noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the knockout rounds, when the burden of their countries has fallen 
to their shoulders, they act as if their load has been lightened. 
</P>
<P>
 In their last two games, those three have scored six goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "When everything is on the table, that is when these guy want it the most," 
Chinaglia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Their differences extend well beyond the field too, into lifestyles and 
eccentricities. It is as if the most difficult thing is to be special in one 
arena and normal everywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country that is 98% Catholic, Baggio is a Buddhist who speaks by phone 
every day to his Zen master. His mother openly cries for his return to her 
faith. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country where 100% of the people speak Bulgarian, Stoitchkov refuses to 
speak Bulgarian to reporters. Proud of his accomplishments in Spain's 
professional league, he says he will speak Spanish or nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a country that has delighted us in the apparent unity of its fans and 
players, prima donna Romario holds a most unusual news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 In it, he announces he will not sit next to teammate Bebeto on the flight to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 We hear some of these stories and shake our heads, not in judgment, but in 
wonder. Then quickly we straighten up, eyes forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The three stars each have, at most, two games left in this country, and we do 
not want to miss a thing.

 The first encounter was kind of like a slow dance on a first date. On June 28, 
at the Pontiac Silverdome, neither Brazil nor Sweden was inclined to press the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 It all made for soccer to sleep by. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was a desultory 1-1 tie and a dissatisfied crowd of 77,217. 
Brazilian fans, in fact, booed their team off the field. Then, in the 
mixed-zone area afterward, Brazilian journalists booed Coach Carlos Alberto 
Parreira off the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes, those Cheshire cats, disappeared into the night half-smirking, 
acting as though they had carried out their plan to perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, one can only hope today's rematch in the World Cup semifinals 
at the Rose Bowl will be a rip-roaring bar dance. This time, there are no cards 
to hide, no players to protect and, presumably, nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Because that was not the case when the teams met in Group B play two weeks 
ago, it is hard to imagine what vital information might have been gleaned from 
that encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil began the game having already clinched a second-round berth, also 
knowing a tie was good enough to clinch the Group B title. Sweden had more to 
gain with a victory but also more to lose with a defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes were all but assured of advancing and appeared preoccupied with 
damage -- as opposed to ball -- control. They obviously did not want to get 
caught up in a shootout with the high-powered Brazilians and possibly lose 
ground in total goal differential, the first tiebreaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden also was without its best player, forward Martin Dahlin, who was 
serving a one-game suspension after having been given a second yellow card 
against Russia a few nights earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 In sum, the first Sweden-Brazil game had as much emotional buildup as a game 
of patty-cake. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilians spent most of the first half showing off their considerable 
dribbling skills, playing foot-catch among themselves, often in their own 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedes rarely pressed the issue, attacking only when receiving open 
invitations. Happily for them, their letter arrived in the 24th minute when 
forward Tomas Brolin took control of the ball on the right flank and sent a 
crossing pass toward Kennet Andersson, who delivered one of the game's two 
exciting moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Andersson, left of goal, chested the pass, let it bounce once, then fired a 
right-footed shot past Claudio Taffarel, the Brazilian goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a newborn, Sweden coddled its precious lead into halftime, during which 
it received news that gave it less incentive to win: The Russians were beating 
up on Cameroon in a Group B game at Stanford Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians' ultimate 6-1 victory clinched a second-round berth for Sweden 
regardless of its outcome against Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the Swedes were fired up in the second half? 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, no. 
</P>
<P>
 The game now entirely devoid of drama, Sweden sauntered back to the field and 
seemed unaware that the second half had actually begun. Less than two minutes 
into play, Brazil tied the game when Romario dribbled past three defenders and 
pushed a shot past goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli, who went on to better things in 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the game was as thrilling as watching Alexi Lalas' goatee grow. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Sweden managed a whopping eight shots on goal. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Brazil, the derisive whistles began piercing eardrums around the 83rd 
minute, after Parreira had removed midfielder and captain Rai with the outcome 
still in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Parreira tried to convince Brazil's media jackals that the game was no 
more significant than an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazilians swore it wasn't their fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was ugly for the players to play because there was no game to be played, 
because of Sweden," Dunga, the Brazilian midfielder, said. 
</P>
<P>
 What could have been culled from the match? Most obvious was the considerable 
size advantage the Swedes held over the Brazilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Swedes' 4-4-2 formation appeared to have effectively contained the 
Brazilian forwards. Sweden chose not to pressure either Romario or Bebeto 
individually, opting to play zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure is on Brazil, because they're the favorite," Dahlin said after 
his team's quarterfinal victory over Romania. "And Latin American countries are 
not used to the 4-4-2, which is what Sweden plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday will mark the first time teams have met twice in the same World Cup 
since 1982, when Italy and Poland played to a scoreless tie in group play and 
met again in the semifinals, Italy winning, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup can only hope the sequel to Sweden-Brazil will be better than 
the original.

WORLD CUP USA '94: SEMIFINALS; ITALY APPEALING TASSOTTI'S SUSPENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Italians are appealing the eight-game suspension of defender Mauro 
Tassotti, who used his elbow to break the nose of Spaniard Luis Enrique in the 
quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian officials and players figured Tassotti would have to miss the rest of 
the World Cup, but they are furious he also will have to miss games in the 
coming European championships. 
</P>
<P>
 They angrily point to the four-game suspension of Brazil's Leonardo for 
elbowing U.S. midfielder Tab Ramos and fracturing Ramos' skull. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great injustice," defender Alessandro Costacurta said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added defender Paolo Maldini: "It's too excessive . . . an absolute injustice. 
The fact that (Enrique's) nose broke probably influenced their decision. 
Sometimes there are worse fouls that aren't even called." 
</P>
<P>
 Midfielder Gianfranco Zola also will sit out today's semifinal game against 
Bulgaria while serving the second game of a two-game suspension for drawing a 
red card in the second round against Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 Zola is worth noting because he picked up that card during only 11 minutes of 
action in this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the first round, Bulgaria will be at full strength. 
That everyone is eligible is amazing, considering the Bulgarians have been 
given a tournament-high 19 yellow cards and two red cards. BILL PLASCHKESOCCER

THURMAN TAKES HIS VACATION SERIOUSLY; BASKETBALL: SUMMER LEAGUE PREPARATIONS 
FOR GOODWILL GAMES FORCE RAZORBACK TO STOP CELEBRATING NCAA TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE McKIBBEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been three months since Scotty Thurman's rainbow three-point jumper 
nestled into the basket and gave Arkansas the breathing room it needed to win 
an NCAA championship. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't until Thurman and Arkansas teammate Corey Beck arrived at UC 
Irvine last week as members of the U.S. Goodwill Games basketball team that the 
shouting began to die down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We basically celebrated it all the way up until this point," said Thurman, 
who turns 20 in November. "When we got here, we realized it was time to put a 
lot of that aside. Our championship was with another team. Now we have to put 
our egos aside and do whatever it takes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've enjoyed our national championship long enough. Now it's time to 
get back to business." 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman's business at hand is showing Team USA basketball coaches George 
Raveling and Kelvin Sampson and NBA scouts that he can adjust his game to fit 
any system. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the system and the limited playing have slowed that adjustment. In 
three games and 35 minutes of play, Thurman has scored 20 points and made seven 
of 16 shots with three rebounds and one assist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough going from being one of the team's main options to where 
everybody's the main option," Thurman said. "But it's all fun, because if the 
NBA is in my future, I would have to adjust to it anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been kind of hard on Corey and me because neither one of us has ever 
really played with a team of this caliber." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampson, Raveling's assistant on Team USA, said Thurman isn't doing as poorly 
as he thinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Scotty's a good basketball player," Sampson said. "I don't know that 
he's great at any one thing. I think he's pretty good at so many things. 
There's nothing he can't do real good." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling said that in itself is Thurman's strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can use him as a 'two' or a 'three,' " Raveling said. "That's one of the 
things that makes him so valuable to this team, his versatility." 
</P>
<P>
 Sampson said Thurman's self-confidence is one of his more valuable assets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see a little cockiness in Scotty that's good," Sampson said. "Not a bad 
cockiness. A cockiness that says, 'I know I'm a good player. I belong here. I'm 
one of the better players.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That positive attitude has kept Thurman from getting down on himself after a 
few bad games. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we're playing, they're making sure everybody is getting some 
minutes," he said. "I'm not concerned about my stats, just what's best for the 
team. I know myself what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he has essentially played small forward at Arkansas, Thurman is trying 
to show NBA people that he can handle the ball well enough to be an off guard. 
At 6 feet 6 and 210 pounds, Thurman wonders how long he could survive at small 
forward in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm an off guard," he said. "Nowadays the three guys are so much 
bigger. A guy like Charles Barkley could end up playing a 'three' spot. It's 
kind of hard to match up with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman is expecting the eight-team Goodwill Games competition, which runs 
from July 23-28 in St. Petersburg, Russia, to be a preview of the NBA's rough 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 "Magic and Isiah were telling us how physical it's going to be," Thurman said. 
"They said there's going to be a lot of animosity toward us and that we're 
going to be five fouls down before we start the game. But if you expect the 
worst, only good things can happen. You can't let anything get you down." 
</P>
<P>
 As is usually the case in international basketball competition, the U.S. team 
will probably be favored to win the Goodwill Games gold medal. But the role of 
a favorite was one that Thurman became accustomed to and relished last year 
with Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was under pressure all season, but we did what we were supposed to do," 
said Thurman, who averaged 17.4 points as a sophomore last year. "So this is no 
different. I feed off of pressure. A lot of people don't like pressure. The 
ones that like it are the ones that go on to be great. Hopefully, I can go on 
to be great." 
</P>
<P>
 If he handles pressure anything like he did in the final moments of Arkansas' 
final-game victory over Duke, Thurman should do fine. However as much as he 
enjoyed the moment and the spotlight, Thurman is not thrilled about replaying 
his now-famous shot to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who don't know me ask about it, but I really don't think about it that 
much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What he thinks about is how much better his team could have played against 
Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, I'm happy we won a championship and all," he said, "But the way 
we won it, I wasn't really proud of that. I thought we were better than what we 
displayed that game." 
</P>
<P>
 All the more reason to prove last year wasn't a fluke by going out and winning 
another national championship. That way he can spend another three months 
celebrating his back-to-back titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll admit," Thurman said, "We talk about it a lot."

DUCKS GET DIRK FOR '95 CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks gained some muscle Tuesday, acquiring defenseman Robert Dirk 
from the Chicago Blackhawks for a fourth-round draft choice in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Dirk, 27, strong in front of the net and in the corners, was plus-18 in 71 
games last season.Plus-minus ratings reflect the difference between goals 
scored and allowed while the player was on the ice at full-strength. "Dirk is a 
real defensive-minded defenseman who will give our club a large, physical 
presence on defense," said Duck Coach Ron Wilson, who worked with Dirk in 
Vancouver. "He also likes to play an aggressive 'stay at home' style of hockey 
and should be a good asset to our team." 
</P>
<P>
 A 6-foot-4, 210-pounder from White Rock, British Columbia, Dirk has played in 
317 NHL games in eight seasons with Chicago, Vancouver and St. Louis, where he 
was the 53rd player taken in the 1984 entry draft. He has scored 35 career 
points (11 goals). Last season he had five points and 131 penalty minutes.

FULLERTON OUTFIELDER POWELL AGREES TO TERMS WITH GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton outfielder Dante Powell said Tuesday he has agreed to 
terms with the San Francisco Giants, who selected him with the 22nd pick in the 
June free-agent draft. He said he is planning to sign a contract today. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell indicated that the signing bonus was more than the $425,000 he turned 
down when he was drafted out of high school three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, a graduate of Long Beach Millikan, was a supplemental selection by 
Toronto between the first and second round in the 1991 draft but decided to 
play college baseball.  
</P>
<P>
 Powell hit .307 as a freshman at Fullerton, .335 as a sophomore and .305 with 
52 runs batted in and a team-high 48 stolen bases last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans advanced to the College World Series, but Powell's performance was 
hampered by a pulled hamstring muscle suffered in the regional championship 
victory over Oklahoma State. LON EUBANKS

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; FIFTH-ROUND PICK PATTERSON SIGNED; TO 
BECOME A GUARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The second of six Raider draft choices signed a contract Tuesday at Oxnard and 
took part in workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt Patterson, a 6-foot-3, 310-pounder from Alabama, joined previously 
signed Rob Holmberg on the second day of Raider camp.Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, a fifth-round pick, has been an offensive tackle, but the Raiders 
plan to move him to guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like our tackles a little taller, 6-5 and above," Coach Art Shell said. 
"But we feel (Patterson) has enough athletic ability to play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The big fish has yet to be landed. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 draft choice Rob Fredrickson, a linebacker from Michigan State, sat out 
for the second day, but both sides say contract agreement is close. 
</P>
<P>
 With a league limit on rookie salaries, the Raiders can spend a total of $1.7 
million on their first-year players. 
</P>
<P>
 The top choice usually gets 40-60% of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fredrickson and his agent, Bruce Allen, are trying to expand that limit 
through a multiyear deal with a signing bonus and contract guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 Fredrickson has been an outside linebacker, but the Raiders plan to try him on 
the inside at middle linebacker. He will compete with second-year man Greg 
Biekert for the job previously held by Joe Kelly, who was cut in the 
off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A day after signing, defensive lineman Warren Powers suffered a dislocated a 
finger on his left hand. He might be sidelined for several weeks. . . . The 
Raiders signed R.J. Kors, a safety from Long Beach State. A 12th-round pick by 
the Seattle Seahawks in 1989, Kors also played with the Rams, the New York Jets 
and the Cincinnati Bengals. STEVE SPRINGER

BASEBALL ALL-STAR REPORT; BONDS IS STRUGGLING A BIT THIS SEASON, BUT VOWS TO 
RECLAIM HIS PLACE AT TOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a guy, that Barry Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Francisco Giants' left fielder returned to Pittsburgh for the 65th 
All-Star game in such a magnanimous mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Let these other guys -- Ken Griffey Jr., Frank Thomas, for example -- dominate 
1994, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Bonds will be back to claim his rightful place as baseball's best in 
1995 and '96 and . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like Michael Bolton at the Grammys," Bonds said. "Do you want to see him 
win every year? How much fun would that be? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just letting these other guys have their year, but I'll be back next year 
and the year after that and the year after that. I'm not done yet. Have those 
other guys won three MVPs? I don't want to hear about all that other stuff, all 
their statistics, until they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm one of only eight players who have won three. No one can ever take that 
from me. I'm going for the record. I want to win my fourth. No one has ever 
done that. I want to be that person." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds, of course, isn't just letting those other guys have their year. He's 
always part put-on and larger parts ego and arrogance, but he's also one of 
baseball's premier talents. This year, however, a dislocated shoulder and elbow 
spurs that prevent him from extending consistently on pitches he should drive 
-- evident on two strikeouts Tuesday night -- and which will require surgery 
when the season ends, have inhibited his ability to re-establish his MVP form. 
</P>
<P>
 He was elected a National League All-Star starter in a season that would 
satisfy most players -- .280 average, 23 homers and 54 runs batted in -- but 
it's only a mild echo compared to his .336, 46 and 123 of last year, his first 
in San Francisco after six with the Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look," he said. "I'm playing and not making excuses. I'd have to be in the 
hospital not to play. If I believe I'm better at 80% than my backup, I'm going 
to play. I love to play and I'm still a threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries, however, have made him less a threat, and the departure of Will 
Clark from the Giants' lineup has further handicapped Bonds and the entire San 
Francisco lineup. The Pacific Sock Exchange of Bonds, Clark and Matt Williams 
isn't what it was, and Bonds said: 
</P>
<P>
 "You could pitch around two of us, but not all three of us. It all changed 
without Will. There's not a lot you can do if they don't want to pitch to you. 
Junior (Griffey) and Thomas will find out. They should enjoy their home runs 
while they can because they're not going to get the same pitches in the second 
half or next year." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Bonds conceded that Griffey and Thomas are rolling up numbers 
that "make me look as if I'm standing still. I mean, Griffey is the best player 
I've ever seen. Most of us have to work on our strength. But he's just a 
naturally strong kid. He's an awesome, raw talent." 
</P>
<P>
 No question, but it will be awhile, Bonds suggests, before Junior graduates to 
his three-MVP level. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Chili Davis, the Angels' only All-Star representative, returns to Anaheim 
today to resume talks through agent Tom Reich on a contract extension. It's 
going to be costly for a team often accused of putting payroll ahead of team. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as it's worked to my benefit, the Angels have to be regretting that 
they didn't take care of this situation last winter," said Davis, who is 
receiving a base salary of $2.4 million this year and needs 137 more plate 
appearances to take it to $3.05 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said he has filled the two roles the Angels were looking for from him: 
leadership and productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to be the guy they were counting on in that way, you'd think 
they'd want to secure you right now," Davis said. "It didn't happen when it 
should have, but I'm hopeful it still will. I grew up in Southern California. I 
like playing there. We've talked to (General Manager Bill Bavasi) and they're 
concerned about the strike issue. I understand that, but I've got my own future 
to think about too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the players' opposition to a salary cap is their belief that it 
will destroy free agency, with several clubs over the cap and out of the 
market, several others too close to the cap to bid and the rest uninterested. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Philadelphia pitcher Danny Jackson, a free agent next winter, "If they 
have a cap, there's only about eight teams I can go to. I'd have to go to 
someplace like Seattle. I want to go somewhere I can win." 
</P>
<P>
 There was more labor rhetoric from interim commissioner Bud Selig and union 
leader Don Fehr on Tuesday. Both were on the field during batting practice and 
both will speak to the National Press Club today, with the union set to present 
its own status quo proposals -- "nothing earth shattering," Fehr said -- to 
owners' negotiator Richard Ravitch on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 In another pitch for a salary cap and a change in the compensation system, 
Selig said it was ironic that this All-Star game was being played in a city 
whose baseball franchise is "fighting for its life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates, he said, represent a microcosm of baseball's economic problems, 
and they won't go away, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one thing this industry has done over the years is suppress the problems, 
not dealt with them," Selig said. "For two decades or more, we've said we'll 
talk about it tomorrow. Tomorrow is here." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps, but it remains a mystery as to where the common ground is, where a 
compromise between the owners' apparent insistence on a salary cap and the 
players' opposition to it, will spring from. If, of course, there is to be a 
compromise. ROSS NEWHAN

THEATER REVIEWS; STYLE AND SPICE: THAT'S WHAT 'ME AND MY GIRL' ARE MADE OF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A period musical gem like Noel Gay's "Me and My Girl" can look deceptively 
simple to actors and directors. But there's style to consider, the right 
musical feel, and a leading role that requires a knack for high comedy, plus a 
good knowledge of British music-hall shtick. 
</P>
<P>
 In this production at Saddleback College's McKinney Theatre, despite some 
sizable flaws, those needs are mostly met. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has absorbed the style, particularly in the chorus. There is 
little or no overplaying -- trying to be oh-so-British, doncha know. And 
musical director Lee Kreter has an ear for the tricky, bouncy sound and tempos 
of the late '30s in London. It sounded different than the Broadway of that era, 
and Kreter knows that. His guidance shows in the sparkling musical segments. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Rogel, who also directed the production, plays Bill Snibson with 
panache, juggles the music-hall bits effortlessly, and has a winning way with 
both a gag line and the bright melodies. 
</P>
<P>
 If Rogel the actor had had another director, he might look even better. 
Perhaps he was involved in some directorial diversions and didn't notice that 
the book sections move much too slowly. They're well-formed but don't always 
have the spark, the lighter-than-air brashness they need. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogel's supporting cast is just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathi Gillmore couldn't be more right as Sally, the Lambeth slum girl Bill 
can't leave behind when he learns he's really the heir to the title of Lord 
Hareford. She has an entrancing comic edge and a strong musical-comedy vocal 
sound that's as right for her touching "Once You Lose Your Heart" as it is for 
both her Lambeth drawl and her Mayfair honey after she's been polished up. 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Geller's Maria, Duchess of Dene, Snibson's aunt, is at once imperious 
and warm, aggressive and loving of her new project of making Bill worthy of the 
title. Stan Throneberry's Colonel Blimp of a Sir John, from pompous to gruff to 
accommodating, perfectly balances Geller's feisty dowager. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Comeau tries very hard as attorney Parchester but doesn't make nearly 
as much as he could out of the giddy "Family Solicitor." But both Meredith 
Woodson and Bart McHenry are delightful, funny and sing up a storm in "Thinking 
of No One but Me" as Bill's cousins, both with varying designs on the estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The big number in the show, outside of the '30s hit "Love Makes the World Go 
'Round," is, of course, the gaudy, infectious "Lambeth Walk" that ends Act I. 
</P>
<P>
 The leads, supports and the chorus have a ball with it, but the number has 
less of the effect it could have because of the muddled, unorganized-looking 
and tepid choreography of Susan Errickson. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEWS; AIRY 'SLEUTH' EXPOSED TO THE ELEMENTAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Playwright Anthony Shaffer has openly wished that his hit mystery play, 
"Sleuth," would be appreciated as a critique of the British fetishes for class 
warfare and games-playing rather than as the entertaining variation on Agatha 
Christie and revenge plays that everyone took it for when it appeared more than 
20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fullerton Civic Light Opera's Theatre on the Green production at the 
Muckenthaler Cultural Center, it's clear that Shaffer is not going to get his 
wish. 
</P>
<P>
 With a broad, gallivanting Robert Mandan as aristocratic mystery writer Andrew 
Wyke and a gradually impressive Randy Gianetti as Wyke's opponent in love and 
war, Milo Tindle, this edition of "Sleuth" (complete with a preperformance 
dinner) isn't going for anything more than a dinner-theater crowd can digest. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Shaffer's deeper purpose is there if you want to listen. Milo wants a 
gentleman's agreement with Andrew that he, Milo, may have Tindle's estranged 
wife for his own. They're deeply in love, and, besides, Andrew has his own 
mistress. 
</P>
<P>
 But Andrew knows that Milo isn't an aristocrat with the money to satisfy his 
wife's expensive tastes. In fact, he considers Milo "a Wop . . . not one of 
us," and an easy dupe in a game of mock-robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaffer cleverly attaches Andrew's class interest to his love of games; he's a 
true, Wiltshire country eccentric who, Milo accurately observes, has replaced 
people and real life with ruses, hatched plots and dress-up routines. 
Naturally, it's the working-class Milo, of poor Italian parents, who stands for 
today's real England. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Sleuth" becomes a doubly disingenuous spectacle. Shaffer may nobly share 
Milo's disgust of Andrew's misanthropy-through-games, but Shaffer is the first 
to play games with his audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the actors have to play a very keen game of distracting us from 
noticing the play's own hypocrisy. It's awfully hard to judge Andrew when we're 
enjoying watching him put Milo through the ringer -- and later, when Milo works 
his own sleuthing games. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandan sounds as if he looks upon this date as his chance to strut his stuff 
playing the overgrown boy Andrew has become. His resemblance to Lawrence 
Olivier (who worked wonders in the 1972 film version) is sometimes startling: 
the graying, suave chap in love with the cadence of his own voice. 
</P>
<P>
 As larger-than-life as he is, though, Mandan isn't as broad as Olivier, who 
had gotten very showoffish at that late phase in his career. This Andrew is a 
tad more vulnerable in the hands of someone who isn't an icon. 
</P>
<P>
 Milo's ups and downs make him a hard nut to crack for an actor, and, at first, 
Gianetti just seems to be trying to get his Cockney accent right. He eventually 
goes much deeper, only momentarily sabotaged by Heather Stafford's sloppy 
makeup. 
</P>
<P>
 You also have to wonder if the play itself isn't being sabotaged by the 
Muckenthaler's outdoor amphitheater setting for director James Luisi's staging. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Craig's set has the right all-male mansion look, but "Sleuth" works 
best the more closed-in we feel -- a very hard thing with miked actors in the 
starry Fullerton evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, there's the Muckenthaler mansion next to the theater, and the 
perfect site for an environmental "Sleuth." Andrew would cringe at the lost 
opportunity. 
</P>

TENANTS SAY MALL PLAYS WAITING GAME; QUAKE: REOPENING HAS BEEN DELAYED. LAUREL 
PLAZA MANAGERS SAY THEY MAY CONSIDER BUILDING A NEW SITE FIRST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six months after Laurel Plaza was damaged by the Northridge earthquake, 
merchants are complaining that the mall's managers are using costly repairs as 
an excuse to stay closed while they wait for approval to raze the structure and 
replace it with a $150-million shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Many merchants say they are fearful that delays in reopening will put them out 
of business. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with Forest City Enterprises Inc. say a combination of delays in 
cleaning up earthquake damage and faster-than-expected clearance of plans for a 
new mall have prompted the company to consider keeping the mall closed until a 
new facility is built, even though the Los Angeles City Council has yet to 
approve final plans for the 26-year-old mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Forest City officials have wanted to raze the one-level mall since 1986 and 
replace it with a three-story, 1-million-square-foot shopping complex with 
three new department stores and 5,400 parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that spending a lot of money on (repairing) a mall that may not be 
around so long is not economical," said one Forest City official who asked not 
to be identified. The mall is owned by F.C. Laurel Inc. of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joel Greenberg, owner of Real Faces Photography and a five-year mall 
tenant, accused the mall's owners of delaying tactics that could result in some 
merchants losing their livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our businesses have been held hostage," Greenberg said. "All the time they've 
told us that they are going to reopen. The idea that they would not reopen is a 
surprise to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg took out a $100,000 SBA loan on the understanding that he would be 
able to enter the mall and repair his shattered business. But aside from 
entering the store for 15 minutes a day after the earthquake, he has not spent 
any time there. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Tapanes, owner of Hot Dog Heaven, is concerned that he will lose the 
business if the old mall never reopens. "I feel terrible," said Tapanes, who 
has been in the mall 23 years. "It's the only business I have." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 300 employees of the mall are also awaiting news of reopening. As of 
Tuesday, only three merchants have reopened since the quake -- all of whom are 
outside the inner mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinsons May, which is structurally separated from the building, was reopened 
within two weeks of the temblor. A travel agency and comic book shop were also 
reopened in March, but Sandy Orton of Wide World Tours says business is down 
40% without mall traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very damaging to business," Orton said. "We've been left out in the 
cold." 
</P>
<P>
 Everett Shine, vice president of development for Forest City, said the fate of 
the 33-store mall is by no means sealed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may not reopen in its current format," Shine said. "There are so many 
indefinites here. Hopefully, the final decision will be made within the next 60 
days." 
</P>
<P>
 Some merchants are charging that those 60 days are just enough time for the 
developer to learn if the City Council approves its plans for the $150-million 
mall. City officials say the City Council is expected to vote on the project by 
the end of the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The new facility, which would preserve the Robinsons May Department store, 
would create an estimated 2,400 new jobs, according to Shine. 
</P>
<P>
 To make room for the new mall, the developer had agreed to purchase the 
private Laurel Hall School on Radford Avenue for $8 million and relocate it 
across the street.  
</P>
<P>
 The project has been dogged by controversy from surrounding residential 
groups. Such groups opposed the original Environmental Impact Report and 
complained at public hearings that the new mall and relocated school would 
increase noise, crime and traffic problems on adjoining streets. The mall sits 
at the corner of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and Oxnard Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the opposition, Forest City's plan has rapidly headed toward final 
approval in the days since the Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the city Board of Zoning Appeals approved the move of Laurel Hall 
School, with the condition that the entire mall plan be approved. Two months 
later, the city Planning Commission gave a go-ahead for a revised plan that 
whittled a proposed 10-level office building down to six stories, closed one of 
the mall exits after 9 p.m. and added security cameras and increased patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the proposal will appear before the City Council's Planning 
and Land Use Management Committee within the next few weeks, and if approved, 
will move on to the City Council by the end of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the light at the end of the tunnel," the unnamed Forest City official 
said of the six-year battle to gain city approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Many tenants, however, feel left in the dark about their future with the mall. 
 
</P>
<P>
 According to memos from mall General Manager Brian Pearson to tenants, the 
mall sustained "substantial structural damage" as a result of the Jan. 17 
temblor and was red-tagged. In a letter dated Feb. 10, Pearson assured tenants 
that they would be able to reopen to the public on April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 But on March 24, Pearson sent out another letter that said the building also 
received asbestos contamination. The April 15 date passed without reopening, 
and some tenants were told that the structure received additional damage from 
aftershocks. But as early as April 26, tenants were told they could begin 
repairs in mid-June. A subsequent memo projected a grand opening in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Mid-June passed without any word from mall management, according to tenants. 
Then on June 24, the building was green-tagged by the city Department of 
Building and Safety. Certain areas were restricted to hard-hat use, but the 
general public could gain access to some other areas, said principal inspector 
Bob Kline. Four days later, Pearson sent another memo to mall tenants stating 
that the future of the mall should be decided in the next 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenants, including Greenberg, wonder where they would go for the two years it 
is expected to take to build the new mall. And they believe that repairs have 
proceeded too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get these long periods when nothing is done, and then a little bit, and 
then nothing," said one tenant, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the key criticisms has been delays in asbestos cleanup. Greenberg 
charges that the cleanup has only affected four stores. But officials with CST 
Environmental, the company subcontracted to clean out the mall's commons and 
several stores, said the cleanup has proceeded normally. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no procrastination that we have felt," said Sage Khara, president of 
CST. "The commons has been cleaned, but I don't know how safe it is to enter 
each store." 
</P>
<P>
 Shine said the temblor "disturbed" asbestos in the structure, leading to a 
"hazard" that officials are still contending with. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Shine said merchants have had to sign liability waivers to enter 
their stores. Many, like Greenberg, have refused to sign the waivers, feeling 
it would jeopardize their legal position. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still some hazards in there," Shine said. "There is some 
merchandise that has been contaminated. We just don't want merchants coming and 
getting some health risk. The asbestos has to be contained. Or removed." 
</P>
<P>
 Shine also said that the company is "sympathetic" to the feelings of the 
tenants, but that "we don't want to make a decision to reopen or not reopen 
that we may regret six months or a year later." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Levy owns two shoe stores that were damaged in quake-wracked Laurel 
Plaza and the Northridge Fashion Center. But he says the attitudes toward 
tenants are very different between managers at both centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "My store in Northridge was much more damaged than the store in Laurel Plaza," 
he said. But "the management in Northridge makes you feel like part of a team. 
They've been very open and honest about what's going on. In Laurel Plaza, 
there's no team effort that I can see." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Many mall patrons feel the same. Patricia Kobashigawa of North Hollywood sent 
a petition with nearly 100 signatures to Forest City officials to seek 
information on the reopening of the mall and its skating rink, which her 
11-year-old daughter used regularly before the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Ice Capades Chalet say they are willing to open and have even 
done their own asbestos cleanup, but that the mall has not given them 
permission. The ice rink is not in the plans for the revamped mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've heard five different times for when it will be reopening," Kobashigawa 
said. "It's very discouraging. There's a lot of people who miss the rink. A lot 
of us parents practically live in the mall." 
</P>
<P>
 But some tenants are tired of waiting for an answer and are seeking an 
attorney to handle matters. According to one, the attorney may investigate 
whether Forest City violated its lease by not informing tenants of their 
decision to not reopen within 90 days.  
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs does not plan to take sides. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to check with the city attorney's office to see if we have any 
jurisdiction to resolve this problem," said Tom Henry, Wachs' planing deputy. 
"But it seems like a tenant-landlord issue. We hope that neither side is doing 
anything to try to influence the pending approval of the new mall." 
</P>
<P>
 As far as one tenant is concerned, Forest City has already taken advantage of 
the earthquake to advance its plans for the new mall. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the merchants, skaters and community around the mall, the earthquake was 
a tragedy," the tenant said. "Forest City is trying to turn the quake into an 
opportunity."

CITY URGED TO PAY $556,000 IN POLICE BEATING AT PARTY; JUDGMENT: AWARD WOULD GO 
TO 26 PEOPLE ALLEGEDLY HIT DURING A BAPTISMAL GATHERING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles City Council panel recommended Tuesday that the city pay 
$556,000 to 26 party-goers who were allegedly beaten by police during a 1989 
baptismal party in Arleta that turned into a bloody melee. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's Budget and Finance Committee recommended paying the judgment, 
which was handed down in March by a Superior Court judge who ruled that police 
violated the party-goers' civil rights by using excessive force to close down a 
loud celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office also recommended making the payment, saying in a 
report to the committee that "there is sufficient evidence to support the 
verdict" and that an appeal to a higher court would probably fail. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire council will consider the panel's recommendation next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon P. Gilbert, a Woodland Hills lawyer who represented the party-goers, said 
the police attack on his clients was "a terrible situation" and he hopes the 
judgment will send a message to police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason for police to go in and overreact and assault people," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The injuries, according to testimony at the trial, were inflicted by about 30 
police officers who made the guests run a gantlet of blows as they filed out of 
the house where the party was held. 
</P>
<P>
 Six people, including two brothers who owned the house, were arrested on 
misdemeanor charges of battering police officers, but the charges were later 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began when police officers showed up at a house in the 9800 block 
of Mercedes Street in response to a complaint about loud music at the baptismal 
party of Agustine Chavez's 20-month-old daughter, Crystal, according to court 
testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Police entered the back yard of the home and asked Chavez to turn down the 
music. According to the testimony of one witness, one party-goer was struck by 
a police officer when he asked why police were called and whether they had a 
search warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is your warrant," the officer allegedly said before striking the guest 
in the head and chest with a baton. 
</P>
<P>
 Police called for backup when several officers were punched by party-goers, 
according to a city attorney's report. About 30 officers showed up and directed 
party guests out of the house, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 But witnesses testified that when they filed out of the house, police formed a 
line and struck men, women and children with flashlights and batons as they 
walked past. 
</P>
<P>
 After the incident, Los Angeles Police Department Capt. Valentino Paniccia, 
who was then in charge of Foothill patrol officers, said in an interview that 
there was no police misconduct and that the "arrests were handled without 
incident and without battery . . . except in self-defense." 
</P>
<P>
 After the judge ruled in favor of the party-goers, Paniccia said the verdict 
shows it is fashionable to make false accusations of brutality against police 
officers in lawsuits, and for judges and juries to award the plaintiffs 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, committee chairman, said officers involved were 
not punished because the Police Department was not notified of the claim until 
a one-year statute of limitations had expired. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that time limit has been extended under new guidelines proposed by the 
Christopher Commission, which investigated the department after the Rodney G. 
King beating. For more recent cases, the deadline is now one year after police 
supervisors learn of a claim of police misconduct. LOS ANGELES

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: PACOIMA MAN DIES WHEN CAR IS HIT, EXPLODES

 A 25-year-old Pacoima man died after the car he was driving exploded when it 
was hit from behind by a pickup truck on the northbound Hollywood Freeway in 
North Hollywood, the California Highway Patrol reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Garcia was killed about midnight Monday after his 1981 Chevrolet Chevette 
was struck by a 1991 pickup driven by Mitchell Edward Roberts, 35, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts of Lake View Terrace was arrested on suspicion of vehicular 
manslaughter, the CHP said. Roberts had only minor injuries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Garcia's car caught fire, it hit a 1993 Toyota Corolla driven by 
Elizabeth Fuenzalida, 24, of Sylmar. Fuenzalida's car became interlocked with 
the Chevette and began to burn as well. But she and her passenger escaped 
safely as construction workers doused the flames, said CHP Sgt. Kent Kilgore. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Roberts was speeding and tried to pass Garcia's car. When he came 
upon a Caltrans lane closure, he swerved back into Garcia's lane and hit his 
car. Roberts' truck then overturned and skidded for several hundred yards.  
</P>
<P>
 "The car didn't stop," Kilgore said. "The slide marks on the car's roof 
indicated an incredible rate of speed." 
</P>
<P>
 The accident caused the Hollywood Freeway near the Ventura Freeway interchange 
to be closed from midnight to about 9:30 a.m. Tuesday, the CHP said. JEANNETTE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; BOARD BACKS PLAN FOR GOLF RANGE AT COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving to pitch Pierce College out of the financial rough, the Los Angeles 
Community College District has approved preliminary plans to build a golf 
driving range on the northeast side of campus within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a plan unanimously approved by the district's board Monday night, the 
college would allow a driving range of up to 10 acres near Victory Boulevard 
and Winnetka Avenue, in exchange for about $160,000 a year or improvements to 
the college. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Pierce President Mary Lee said the range would probably be much 
smaller than the maximum size. She said more than a dozen firms have expressed 
interest in bidding on the project, which would cost about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 More detailed plans, including a study of the impact of the driving range on 
the surrounding neighborhood, will be reviewed by the board later. Lee said she 
hopes that a developer's plans are in place so that construction can begin in 
the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would be the largest commercial venture at Pierce, which is 
reeling from budget cuts and falling enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of the proposal comes as Lee, who took over as president in 
mid-April, has developed a blueprint to help make the college more financially 
stable and popular with its neighbors, including plans for a high-tech movie 
theater and planetarium, museums and exhibits. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, every project has to serve the students and the 
community," Lee said. "For instance, the students who take golf classes will be 
able to use the golf driving range." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills Homeowners Organization President Robert Gross, who said nearly 
a year ago that he would oppose any commercial venture on the northeast side of 
campus, adopted a more conciliatory tone. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have to wait and see what proposals come out of this" Gross said, "what 
the impact of this project is going to be, as well as whether it will truly 
benefit the students. Our biggest concerns are traffic, parking and lighting." 
</P>
<P>
 At its meeting Monday night, the board also approved more than $1 million in 
repairs to the Pierce library and the men's and women's gymnasiums, which were 
damaged in the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee said the library is scheduled for repair before the beginning of the fall 
semester, with reopening of the gyms during the semester. KURT PITZER

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; BRIDGING THE 
CULTURAL GAPS IN GLENDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHIP JOHNSON, TIME STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Glendale Police Department has one man assigned to reverse yesterday's 
image while bridging today's cultural gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Chahe Keuroghelian, whose title is intercultural coordinator, floats easily 
among the city's estimated 40,000 Armenians and Armenian-Americans, and other 
ethnic groups, department officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 In a population that is now about 65% members of various minorities, including 
25% of Armenian descent, part of his task is to counteract memories of racist 
groups years ago, said Police Sgt. Lief Nicolaisen, a department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chahe is helping to make our community work for all of us, but we still carry 
this image as a racist city" from the past, Nicolaisen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember seeing a guy from the American Nazi Party standing on Brand 
Boulevard selling newspapers when I was a kid," Nicolaisen said. The Orange 
County affiliate of the White Aryan Resistance keeps its phone bank here 
because there are those who still associate the Glendale telephone prefix with 
racial hatred, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 These days the city has appointed a committee to study hate crimes, which 
average about eight a year since the city started recording them in 1986 -- a 
rate substantially less than that of other local communities its size. 
</P>
<P>
 Keuroghelian's $40,000-a-year job is connecting the department with all of the 
communities it serves. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think that because I'm Armenian I represent the Armenian community, 
but I represent all cultures," said Keuroghelian. "I educate the officers and 
the public about different cultures because if the only time that people come 
in contact with police it is a negative experience, that educates no one." 
</P>
<P>
 The differences are stark at times, he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "In most Middle-Eastern cultures, when an officer stops you, as a courtesy, 
you get out of your car with your driver's license and money and try to explain 
what happened and negotiate your way out," Keuroghelian said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it is a no-no in this country to get out of your car before an officer 
does and people get nervous when they're told to get back in the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees from Eastern European countries controlled by the former Soviet 
Union, for example, are extremely suspicious of government in general because 
of past experiences, said Keuroghelian, who immigrated to the United States in 
1980 from Beirut, where he was a newspaper reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolaisen described Keuroghelian's function as the opposite of the 
community-policing efforts being tried in other local police departments -- "a 
direct link between the chief's office and indigenous community leaders" 
instead of relying on street-level police contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 He participates in ESL (English as a Second Language) workshops sponsored by 
the Armenian Relief Society and also makes himself available to organizations 
in the Korean, Vietnamese, Russian-speaking and Latino communities, said Sona 
Zinzalian, director of the society's social services department. 
</P>
<P>
 Tark Nazarian, a social worker who deals mainly with Armenian refugees from 
all over the world, said Keuroghelian helps immigrants understand the rules of 
the game in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 While some newcomers struggle to understand the language and customs of their 
new country, the Armenian community has been making inroads into new areas -- 
like law enforcement. The Police Department's Explorer Scout training program 
is now about 95% Armenian Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city still suffers from ethnic-based crimes. A Boy Scout headquarters 
in an Armenian social center was vandalized in May, and last January a 
70-year-old Armenian man was beaten by a man enraged that the victim was 
speaking Armenian. 
</P>
<P>
 And when a local newspaper asked readers if the city should establish a 
national holiday to honor the Armenian massacre in Turkey, many callers 
responded with anti-Armenian slurs, Keuroghelian said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way to deal with that is education, education, education," 
Keuroghelian said. "The more people know about where other people are coming 
from psychologically, the more it will help them deal with each other."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; EXEMPTIONS OFFERED FOR NEW UTILITY TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elderly and low-income Agoura Hills residents may apply for exemptions from 
the city's newly adopted utility tax beginning this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The tax, approved last month by the City Council, places a 4% tax on the use 
of electricity, gas and telephone service. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of the exemption, is to assist people who may have difficulty 
paying the tax," City Manager Terry Matz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eligible for the exemption are Agoura Hills heads of household who are at 
least 62 years old and receive supplemental security income, and households 
with income ranging from $17,650 for one person to $33,250 total for eight 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 According to 1990 census figures, 451 households in Agoura Hills have an 
income of less than $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who feel they may be eligible should contact Agoura Hills City Hall 
between 7 a.m. and 6 p.m., Monday through Thursday. KURT PITZER

 Los Angeles Police Department Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker will be honored 
tonight at a benefit marking the fifth anniversary of the World Children's 
Transplant Fund, which he founded. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization will have its annual "Veronica Celebration for Life" dinner 
-- named for a 12-year-old Argentine girl whose fight with liver disease 
prompted Kroeker to organize the fund -- at 7 p.m. at the Biltmore Hotel, 506 
S. Grand Ave., Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys) will present Kroeker, who formerly 
headed the LAPD's Valley Bureau, with a special award from the Senate for his 
work with the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine Ambassador Luis Maria Riccheri will present an award to the fund in 
honor of Veronica, who died during her third liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Proceeds from the $150-a-plate dinner will benefit the fund, whose mission is 
facilitating transplants for children in underdeveloped nations and raising 
local awareness of the need for donations, said Executive Director Dana Tkac.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: GRANADA HILLS; JUDGE EXTENDS DELAY OF DUMP EXPANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court judge extended an order Tuesday halting expansion 
of Sunshine Canyon Landfill pending a hearing next month on a lawsuit brought 
by dump opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Diane Wayne ordered Browning Ferris Industries Inc., which operates the 
Granada Hills dump, to stop work on the controversial project June 27, just 
four days after the company was granted permission to start the first phase of 
a 17-million-ton expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge set Aug. 5 for a hearing on a lawsuit filed by the North Valley 
Coalition of Concerned Citizens, which opposes the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys from both parties were also ordered to meet before the hearing and 
determine which issues in the lawsuit have not been previously litigated. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see absolutely nothing new," said Arnie Berghoff, a spokesman for BFI. 
</P>
<P>
 "We disagree," said Rosemary Woodlock, an attorney for the North Valley 
Coalition. "That's what makes lawsuits." 
</P>
<P>
 The recent skirmishes over the landfill are part of a decade-long fight 
between Los Angeles city and county officials, as well as between 
environmentalists and BFI, one of the nation's largest waste-management 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 During Tuesday's hearing, the judge also granted a request by the city of Los 
Angeles to intervene in the case and join the North Valley Coalition in its 
lawsuit, Deputy City Atty. Keith Pritsker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're downwind and downstream from the proposed project," Pritsker said. 
"It's a nuisance." 
</P>
<P>
 BFI earlier was granted permission to remove an estimated 1,800 oak trees from 
the expansion site. The trees were cut down before the order to halt the 
project was issued last month. JULIE TAMAKI

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CARETAKER DROWNS IN SWIMMING POOL

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 28-year-old Russian immigrant who was drinking with two friends Monday night 
drowned at a house where the trio worked as caretakers, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to his friends, Alexander Ivanov started drinking beer and later 
vodka with his friends about 7:30 p.m. as they sat by the pool at a 
quake-damaged house in the 19800 block of Lassen Avenue, said Detective Tony 
Foti of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometime before 9:30 p.m. at least one of the men went inside the house to 
sleep, but investigators, who spoke to the friends through a Russian 
interpreter, are unsure about what happened next. 
</P>
<P>
 About 9:30 p.m., the second friend spotted Ivanov's body floating in the 
swimming pool, Foti said. The two men tried unsuccessfully to pull his body out 
of the pool and then summoned police to the home, Foti said. 
</P>
<P>
 The official cause of death is still undetermined pending a coroner's autopsy, 
but investigators believe the drowning was accidental and may have been the 
result of the drinking binge, Foti said. CHIP JOHNSON

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; INTEREST GROWS OVER PLANS FOR GOLF COURSE SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prospective buyers are buzzing around a parcel of land currently occupied by 
the Studio City Golf Course, according to the realtor representing the property 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Studio City realtor Mort Allen said that since a June 26 newspaper report 
appeared about potential development of the site, 18 interested parties have 
contacted him about the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 18, Allen said, the property owner -- Weddington Investment Partnership 
-- is focusing on four. Two are "major home-building corporations" that want to 
build homes in the $200,000 range and two are golf course operators who want to 
expand the existing course across land occupied by tennis courts, the realtor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My fear is that, because it is such a commercial venture now, it could 
(operate) on a major commercial basis," Allen said. "The best option for this 
community is to put in single-family homes to sell in the middle range. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could get maybe 80 homes, then the residents could be shopping in the 
community and working in the community," Allen added. 
</P>
<P>
 Studio City residents have expressed concern about development of the 
17.2-acre site, which they consider an urban oasis. It was recently suggested 
that a buyer could develop the property if it was determined that the lease 
agreement between Weddington and the golf course operator is not valid.  
</P>
<P>
 Co-owner Guy Weddington McCreary maintains the lease ran out when the golf 
course failed to renew its conditional-use permit, while golf course general 
manager George McCallister insists the lease is good.  
</P>
<P>
 The owners are in the process of liquidating their properties, Allen said. One 
interested party that has made an offer is the Los Angeles Fire Department, 
which wants to relocate a fire station on an acre of the golf course.  
</P>
<P>
 Allen and Vivian Rescalvo, an aide to Los Angeles City Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, were scheduled to speak to the Studio City Residents Assn. about 
the golf course's future at its general meeting Tuesday night.  
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't developed a specific position on (future uses of the property) at 
this point," Rescalvo said, "but we think that recreational use is a valuable 
resource to the community and to the city as a whole, and we wouldn't want to 
see it go away."  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the initial feedback from our membership indicates that they would be 
strongly opposed to any change of use," said Tony Lucente, president of the 
residents association. "(The golf course) is one of the crown jewels of Studio 
City." KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; NEW LAW WOULD BAN FEEDING OF PIGEONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Glendale City Council introduced an ordinance Tuesday that bans the 
feeding of pigeons on public property, streets and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance, which will appear for a final council vote next week, is a 
broader version of a measure that came before council members last week banning 
pigeon feeding only in the city's central business district. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance will go into effect 90 days after council approval of the 
measure. The plan makes pigeon feeding a misdemeanor punishable by a $50 fine 
for the first offense, $100 for the second offense and $250 for the third 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members expressed concern with the narrower ordinance banning pigeon 
feeding in the downtown area only, saying it would only transfer the pigeon 
problem from the business district to other parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, council members voiced doubts that the ordinance can be enforced 
effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a bad philosophical approach to create a law that we're only 
going to enforce if we have to," said Councilman Rick Reyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other council members disagreed with Reyes, who stated the law would place the 
burden on senior citizens who make up the majority of persons who go to public 
parks to feed the fowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we are going to see swarms of pigeon control officers 
stampeding through the city to arrest people," said Councilman Larry Zarian, 
who added the measure is meant to educate -- not punish -- residents.  
</P>
<P>
 The revised ordinance is designed to help the city cope with a burgeoning 
downtown pigeon population -- estimated at some 10,000 birds -- that messes 
awnings, sidewalks and ledges. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials resorted to the ordinance and an education campaign aimed at 
discouraging residents from feeding the birds after backing away from a 
controversial plan to contract with the county to trap and kill the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The council back-pedaled from its April decision after animal rights activists 
and residents called City Hall to protest the county's plan to kill the birds 
by putting them in a cloth sack and tying it to the tailpipe of a car with its 
engine running. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted last week to begin its education campaign -- featuring signs 
in business windows and along public sidewalks asking residents not to feed the 
pigeons. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members also gave city staff members the go-ahead to advertise for 
bids from companies that eradicate birds to find a long-term solution to reduce 
the city's pigeon population. JENNIFER OLDHAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; LYE-ATTACK WITNESS REFUSES TO TESTIFY

<P>
 Former pimp Bobby Ray Savage, serving a life prison sentence in connection 
with a 1980 lye attack that killed a popular law student, refused to testify 
for the prosecution Tuesday in the retrial of a co-defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 Savage's refusal stunned prosecutors, who will ask Superior Court Judge 
Michael Harwin today to allow the jury to hear a tape-recorded statement Savage 
gave before the trial began. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing briefly before the jury, Savage seemed nervous and stuttered as he 
invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, court observers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert L. Cohen said that because Savage already has been 
convicted in the case, he couldn't incriminate himself. But Savage stepped down 
from the witness stand without saying another word. 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement to the judge, Savage said he couldn't testify "without 
placing the lives of my family and myself in danger." He added that "further 
threats from the district attorney's office and mistreatment from the Los 
Angeles Sheriff's Department will not intimidate or pressure me" into 
testifying. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said Savage had not been threatened or mistreated. He added that 
Wednesday he will seek to play for the jury a statement in which Savage 
implicates himself and defendant Ricardo Robinson in the lye attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous witnesses have testified that Savage and Robinson knocked on the door 
of Sylmar law student Patricia Worrell and threw lye in her face in August, 
1980. The attack allegedly was orchestrated by Worrell's jilted fiance, a 
fellow law student named Richard Morton Gilman. Blinded and disfigured, Worrell 
died 10 days after the attack when lye she accidentally ingested during the 
attack burned through her esophagus and an artery. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony, the plot to disfigure Worrell unfolded after Gilman 
met prostitute Kim Bricker in a Las Vegas motel bar. She testified she 
introduced him to Savage, her pimp, when Gilman asked if she knew anyone who 
could beat up his former girlfriend.  
</P>
<P>
 Gilman paid Savage $750 in advance and promised more if the attack was carried 
out, Cohen said. Gilman, who also is serving a life sentence, is scheduled as a 
defense witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, whose murder conviction was overturned two years ago when an appeals 
court ruled his confession had been obtained illegally, is acting as his own 
lawyer. ANN W. O'NEILL

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; CABLE BIDS SOUGHT TO TELEVISE MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After opposing the idea for years, the Glendale City Council voted Tuesday to 
advertise for bids to design and install a system that would allow the city to 
televise council meetings on a local cable station. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members disapproved of cablecasting council meetings in the past 
because of costs associated with purchasing and operating the equipment.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Eileen Givens, Councilman Larry Zarian and Councilwoman Mary Ann Plumley 
voted for the measure, while Councilman Rick Reyes was opposed and Councilman 
Sheldon Baker was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved $100,000 of its 1994-95 fiscal year budget for a 
cablecasting effort after Assistant City Manager Robert McFall estimated a 
cablecasting system's cost at $35,000 to $85,000 for equipment and $19,000 for 
staff.  
</P>
<P>
 Previous estimates to install and operate a cable system had run as high as 
$250,000, Zarian said. He asked the council to reconsider cablecasting its 
meetings in January after the issue had been dormant for three years.  
</P>
<P>
 The city has asked companies to submit bids for the project that will include 
two to four robotically controlled cameras installed in the council chambers 
and operated from a small room beneath chambers.  
</P>
<P>
 The budget also allows for the purchase of some mobile equipment as part of 
the plan, McFall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline to submit proposals is Aug. 4. They must include recommendations 
for hiring and training staff to operate the equipment and advice on how to 
efficiently cablecast other city meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members are compiling a list of possible vendors who will receive 
proposal applications, including the cities of Pasadena and Burbank, both of 
which have televised their council meetings, McFall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expect it to take about two months to design and install the system 
after the contract is awarded. 
</P>
<P>
 After the cameras are installed, council meetings will be televised and taped 
for rebroadcast on Sammons Communications' Channel 21. JENNIFER OLDHAM

PLANNERS SEEK TO PUT 200-MILE TRAIL SYSTEM ON THE MAP; ENVIRONMENT: OFFICIALS 
ENVISION PATHWAYS FOR MANY TYPES OF USERS. THE VENTURA COUNTY PROPOSAL WILL BE 
UNVEILED TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His hands spread out on a five-foot-wide map, Ron Blakemore explains how he 
envisions getting people out of their cars and onto a proposed 200-mile-long 
system of trails. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like that old movie thing," Blakemore said. "If we build it they 
will come. If people have the facilities, they will use them." 
</P>
<P>
 Blakemore is the administrator of the Regional Trails and Pathways Program, an 
ambitious system of interlinking trails for bikers, hikers and horseback riders 
introduced by Ventura County Supervisors Vicky Howard and Maggie Kildee. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of a 38-member advisory committee, Blakemore has spent the last 
year developing a trail system so extensive that it promises to allow residents 
to step out of their cars and roam Ventura County from one end to another, not 
just for pleasure, but also for commuting. 
</P>
<P>
 His giant maps of the county are crisscrossed with double blue and fuchsia 
lines racing from city to city, following riverbeds, coastline and ridgelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost like a child's game of navigating a room without ever touching the 
floor, the new Regional Trails and Pathways plan would establish a system of 
trails separate from roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft plan will be unveiled tonight at a 7 o'clock meeting in the Rancho 
Santa Susana Community Center in Simi Valley. Six more meetings are scheduled 
to gather public comment on the plans throughout the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakemore will incorporate suggestions from the public and then present a 
revised plan to city governments and agencies throughout Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 If he can persuade the more than 50 government entities to sign off on the 
proposal, it will go to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors for final 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Blakemore acknowledges that the plan is still 15 to 20 years away from 
completion. But he thinks Ventura County is on the cutting edge of a new 
concept -- combining transportation with recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be the model for all other counties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One study estimated that 50,000 county commuters could use part of the trail 
system each day, and Blakemore believes that number will probably be closer to 
10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 While many cities, such as Seattle and Berkeley, have made it easier for 
commuters to travel by bicycle, Blakemore said Ventura County would be the 
first place he knows of to establish multipurpose trails that meet the needs of 
equestrians, hikers and bike commuters simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, he says, lies in establishing a trail etiquette to be followed by 
all users. A horse gets the right of way, followed by foot traffic, with bikers 
moving aside for both. Though hikers and mountain bikers fight over trails in 
some parts of the nation, Blakemore said Ventura County cyclists and walkers 
have friendlier relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The trail system has received considerable support from business leaders at 
advisory committee meetings. Supervisor Kildee said businesses want to 
encourage two-wheeled commuting, but fear that roadways are not safe enough for 
bikers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fatality of the Amgen employee has raised our awareness," Kildee said, 
referring to the death of Amgen researcher Walter Tupper, 26, who died in May 
after being hit by a car while commuting on his bicycle. "Making commuting by 
bike safer is a priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the proposed pathways lie along flood-control channels, while others 
pass through farmlands. Before the first trail is cut, lengthy negotiations 
have to be carried out with private owners and public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Advisory committee member Bob Smith has concentrated his efforts on figuring 
out a way to get hikers and bikers from Camarillo, over the Conejo Grade and 
into Newbury Park. He has come up with several routes without particularly 
steep grades. All that remains, he said, is persuading landowners to let 
commuters on bikes whiz past their property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're getting close," Smith said. "Nothing is impossible, you just 
have to be patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Kildee nor Howard could put a price tag on the trail system, saying it 
was too early to estimate costs. 
</P>
<P>
 No one denies the price will be steep. But Blakemore said plans call for 
establishing a nonprofit foundation to support the trails and demanding that 
developers set aside land for the trail system. The county would also seek 
volunteers to patrol the trails and solicit corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point the plan is hardly more than lines on a map. The county, along 
with Fillmore, Ventura and Santa Paula, is negotiating to buy an easement along 
the 32-mile stretch of the Santa Paula Railway for an estimated $9 million. If 
that sale goes through, a major component of the trail system's backbone would 
be established along the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the only established parts of the system are the nearly 10-mile Ojai 
Trail and the six-mile stretch along the Arroyo Simi in Simi Valley. Sixteen 
miles down and at least 184 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I have enough imagination to carry it forward," said Blakemore. "All 
I've got to do is pull it off."

'NEW FAMILY FEUD' TV HOST INJURED IN CRASH; ACCIDENT: RAY COMBS IS PARTIALLY 
PARALYZED FOLLOWING COLLISION ON VENTURA FREEWAY, HIS AGENT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Ray Combs, who hosts the popular syndicated TV game show "The New Family 
Feud," was hospitalized in serious to critical condition Tuesday, partially 
paralyzed by injuries suffered in a freeway crash, according to his agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Combs, 38, who has hosted the show for six years, was injured Monday, said his 
agent, Irv Schwartz. 
</P>
<P>
 Combs, who is under treatment at St. Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, 
regained some feeling in his arms Tuesday but still had no feeling or movement 
in his legs, Schwartz said. Doctors believe that a spinal disk injury suffered 
in the collision may be causing temporary paralysis, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has some swelling in a disk, I don't know which one, and that is causing 
some problems in his back and with his movement," Schwartz said. "Doctors are 
telling me that the paralysis may correct itself or they will be able to 
correct it with surgery." 
</P>
<P>
 Combs was driving west on the Ventura Freeway near the Burbank-Glendale border 
just after 1 p.m. Monday when he was involved in a "minor" collision with 
another vehicle, said California Highway Patrol Officer Cal Jackman.  
</P>
<P>
 An off-duty Los Angeles police officer stopped when he saw the accident scene 
and administered mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to Combs, who Jackman reported 
had experienced some sort of seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials would not provide information about Combs' injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said Combs told him that a speeding vehicle swerved from the fast 
lane and collided with Combs' car, which was then rear-ended by another car. 
The crash caused Combs to lose consciousness momentarily, which prompted the 
Los Angeles police officer to try to revive him, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Combs' wife, Debbie, flew from the couple's Cincinnati home to be 
with him, Schwartz said. Combs and his wife have six children, and the comedian 
divides his time between homes in Glendale and Cincinnati, where he owns a 
comedy club and has other business interests, Schwartz said.

ARMENIAN PUPILS LEARNING ENGLISH QUADRUPLE; EDUCATION: THE BURBANK DISTRICT 
STATISTICS REFLECT A DRAMATIC GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF MINORITY STUDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The number of immigrant Armenian American students who speak only limited 
English has grown nearly four times since 1989, reflecting a dramatic growth in 
the number of minority students at area public schools over the past six years. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Although Armenian Americans remain a small minority among the 13,000 students 
enrolled in the school system, they are the fastest-growing immigrant group 
learning English and are rapidly gaining on Hispanics. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the Burbank Unified School District, a quarter of the students are 
classified as having limited English skills, according to a recently released 
district study. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Armenian American students with limited English skills grew 
382.7%, from 110 in 1989 to the current tally of 531. 
</P>
<P>
 Of those, 137 attend Joaquin Miller Elementary School, which is near the 
city's border with Glendale and has a total enrollment of 790. Another 59 
Armenian American students at the school are fluent in English. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials attribute the growth in the number of Armenian American students to 
the district's proximity to Glendale, where a large concentration of Armenians 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're reflecting what's happened in Glendale," Miller Elementary Principal 
Gail Copeland said Monday. "The Glendale Unified School District has had an 
increase in the Armenian-speaking population, as we are beginning to see in our 
own district." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers at Miller Elementary work in teams of two to four and divide students 
into groups of limited English speakers and fluent English speakers during 
language arts lessons, Copeland said. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, one teacher and three instructional aides who speak Armenian 
were hired by the district, the principal said. The teacher has since left the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Among all immigrant students in the district, 3,352 have limited English 
skills, up nearly 84% from 1989. Another 2,589 have become fluent in English 
since enrolling in district schools.

GAS COMPANY PLANS $5 MILLION IN QUAKE REPAIR GRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southern California Gas Co. is planning to give earthquake victims a 
little CPR -- that's Community Partnership for earthquake Repair. 
</P>
<P>
 About $5 million will be made available to Southland residents who suffered 
earthquake damage and need to make minor home repairs.The money is being made 
available through the gas company, in conjunction with several public agencies, 
including the California Department of Economic Opportunities and the 
California Conservation Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time the gas company has teamed up with public entities," 
said Southern California Gas spokesman George McQuade. 
</P>
<P>
 The gas company has long helped low-income, disabled and elderly homeowners 
weatherize their homes, and this program is aimed at helping those same people 
take care of minor problems caused specifically by the quake, McQuade said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grants, which will average between $500 and $1,500, will go to help 
residents replace broken windows and damaged water heaters, repair water damage 
and fix cracked sidewalks and electrical, plumbing and gas systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of homes out there with damage," said McQuade. While the fund 
now contains $5 million, that figure could rise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, timed to mark six months since the Jan. 17 quake, will be 
launched at 10 a.m. Saturday at 13537 Wiedner St., the address of a Pacoima 
home that qualified for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The CPR project is designed to give assistance to those at or below the 
poverty level and disabled or elderly persons who have been turned down by 
other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information or to apply, call Southern California Gas at (800) 
427-2200.

17 INJURED AFTER FIGHTS ERUPT AMONG INMATES AT PITCHESS JAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seventeen inmates were injured in three separate fights among 400 prisoners at 
the Pitchess jail Monday and Tuesday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fights erupted between black and Latino inmates in a 14-hour period 
between 7:30 p.m. Monday and 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday inside minimum and 
medium-security barracks at the Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho, said Deputy 
George DuCoulombier of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies quelled the first disturbance of about 40 to 50 prisoners "very 
quickly" by using pepper spray and verbal commands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Six inmates were treated for minor injuries at the jail's clinic, authorities 
said. One was taken to County-USC Medical Center for stitches, although he was 
not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The second brawl began at 7:20 a.m. Tuesday among 150 inmates in three 
barracks, DuCoulombier said. Deputies controlled that fight within 15 minutes. 
Four men were treated for minor injuries at the jail clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 A third brawl erupted about two hours later when 200 inmates attacked each 
other with broomstick handles and soap and rock-filled socks, DuCoulombier 
said. The inmates fought for 20 minutes before deputies fired pepper spray to 
stop the fighting, DuCoulombier said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the latest in a series of brawls that have broken out at the jail in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 The causes of all fights remain under investigation, DuCoulombier said.

CIVILIAN STAFF URGED FOR PREVENTION PROGRAMS; BUDGET: SOME OFFICIALS SAY CITY 
COULD CUT COSTS BY REPLACING DEPUTIES IN NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH AND EDUCATION 
PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to cut costs by using civilians instead of sheriff's deputies in 
Neighborhood Watch and drug education programs triggered a lengthy debate 
Tuesday at a City Council meeting on Palmdale's proposed 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and sheriff's representatives argued that deputies should continue to 
staff these programs because of their experience with crime and the respect 
they usually command from elementary school children. 
</P>
<P>
 But some city officials maintained that civilians, including retired officers, 
could handle these programs adequately at half the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of these recommendations are based on the quality of service" provided 
by deputies, said City Administrator Robert W. Toone Jr., whose staff urged 
that the programs be turned over to civilians. "It really comes down to choices 
and limited revenues." 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members, who heard the arguments at Tuesday's budget workshop, 
are expected to decide the fate of these programs at a meeting that begins at 7 
p.m. tonight at City Hall, 708 E. Palmdale Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to crime concerns raised by residents during the City Council 
campaign last spring, the council's staff proposed boosting the city's law 
enforcement budget to $8 million -- an increase of $1.2 million from the 
previous fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 The city contracts with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for police 
protection, and the staff recommendation envisions that a large portion of the 
extra money would pay for three more one-deputy patrol cars operating 56 hours 
a week and 16 more hours of patrol coverage from a deputy in a fourth car. 
</P>
<P>
 To offset some of these expenses, the city staff proposed to withdraw deputies 
from neighborhood and business crime prevention programs and a program aimed at 
discouraging elementary school students from using illegal drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Using deputies for these programs cost the city about $319,000 last year, 
Terry Stubbings, the city's civilian community relations officer, told the 
council. Using civilians would cost $164,000 -- about half as much, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Tuesday's meeting, several deputies and parents told the council that 
civilians would not be familiar with current crime trends and would not make as 
strong an impression on students. "I do not support your staff's 
recommendation," said Capt. Tony Welch, commander of the Sheriff's Antelope 
Valley station. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Jim Ledford argued, however, that the cost of using deputies appeared to 
be too high. "People demand services, yet the affordability is an issue," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to make a decision on the law enforcement expenses 
tonight, prior to adopting a $28.7-million general fund budget for the new 
fiscal year.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: TELEPHONES AND TENDER VOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One month ago today, the grisly discovery of two brutalized bodies on a 
Brentwood sidewalk planted the seeds of a long overdue national discussion 
about domestic violence that has yet to reach full flower. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday night, a group of women who are more than mindful of this gather in 
a second-floor, windowless room in Hollywood at the Los Angeles Commission on 
Assaults Against Women. The women, volunteers for LACAAW's Rape and Battering 
24-Hour Hotline, are the ones who give up their mornings, their afternoons, 
their middle-of-the-nights to listen. 
</P>
<P>
 They listen to women whose husbands bust down the bathroom door as their wives 
cower next to the toilet with portable phones, women who wonder if getting 
beaten up three times and raped once by their husbands means they are battered, 
women who announce they have taken a handful of pills and just want a friendly 
voice on the line as they slip into a coma because it's easier to die than to 
face another closed fist. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, under the harsh fluorescent lights, the "counselor-advocates" share 
their stories. They talk of triumphs, frustrations and pain. They talk about 
the extraordinary increase in calls following the deaths of Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ronald Goldman, the release of the 911 tapes and the barrage of 
stories about O.J. Simpson's history of domestic turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 They talk about feeling burned out. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been through hell and back in the last few weeks," says Patti 
Giggans, LACAAW executive director. Calls to the hot line ((310) 392-8381, 
(213) 626-3393) more than doubled during some shifts in the weeks following 
Simpson's arrest -- from about six or seven in a four-hour period to as many as 
16. 
</P>
<P>
 Where callers also used to want help and information in dealing with rape, 
incest, child abuse or suicide, now all they want to talk about is abuse and 
battering. Many talk of not wanting to "end up like Nicole." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to a guide as fat as some telephone books, the volunteers make 
referrals to the 18 shelters in L.A. County. They direct callers to therapists, 
clinics and legal services. Mostly, they listen. 
</P>
<P>
 It is tempting to say that these women are on the front lines of the battle 
against domestic violence. After all, they jokingly refer to their 65 hours of 
training as "boot camp." And they are often contacted long before a woman 
considers notifying the police. But the military metaphor tarnishes what they 
are all about. 
</P>
<P>
 What they are is a vast electronic safety net strung together with telephone 
wires, top-notch training and tender voices.

 Amber is describing a typical hot-line call from a battered woman who has 
decided to leave: "I have no friends, no family, no neighbors, no job, no 
money. Can you help me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Gail: "I can't believe how many women have no friends or support. It just 
blows me away. Lots of my calls are from phone booths: 'I have my life with my, 
my kids, my van and no money.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel so much frustration," says Marta. "I get so many calls and there is no 
place to send them. I had a woman with six children, the youngest still in 
diapers, calling from a church basement. They were trying desperately to find a 
shelter for her. She was trying so hard. And there was nothing. As a last 
resort, I told her to go to a bus depot or an airport." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly received a call from a honey-voiced woman on behalf of a friend whose 
wife was in a shelter for battered women. "She wanted to make sure the wife had 
the husband's phone number, so when she 'got out' of the shelter, they would be 
able to get back together." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most chilling calls end abruptly. A hot-line volunteer hears a 
door slam and her caller's voice run cold with fear, then a click. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest call I ever got was last week," says Sonia. "It was a 16-year-old 
girl who, two weeks before, had watched her father shoot her mother. He 
threatened to kill her if she called the police. At 13, her father raped her 
and she became pregnant. It was really hard. She said she was going to call 
back, that she had to go. And she never called back. Her name was Monique." 
</P>
<P>
 "I just got a call from Monique!" says another volunteer. "She sounded very 
young, and she stuttered and sobbed for five minutes. Then she said, 'There's 
someone coming, I have to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Monique's is the kind of story that haunts, the kind of story that makes the 
women remind each other that they are doing their best, the kind of story that 
reinforces the importance of letting go at the end of their shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, not all the tales are so dreary. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jan says four groups of office workers called last week asking where they 
could send money they had collected for battered women from colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 She also took a call from a woman who wanted to talk about God. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her I didn't have enough experience on the subject," said Jan. "And 
she said, 'You people on that hot line are always saying that!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, sharing information about the cranks, the "chronics" and the nuts 
elicits a few rounds of much-needed laughter. And no one apologizes for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Several volunteers have spoken with the transvestite who dresses up as Nancy 
Kerrigan and wants to know if "you think I'm weird." 
</P>
<P>
 There is the woman who is always incensed because the hot-line staffers cannot 
give her advice about "financial abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 There is the man who claimed to be suicidal when he began calling the hot 
line, says he is now in counseling and has proposed marriage to the horrified 
counselor who takes his calls. 
</P>
<P>
 She will change shifts, and his calls may be traced and reported to police if 
he continues to harass her. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety net that comprises her warm voice, after all, should be there for 
her too.

 In the news: Jay Leno wonders about the special kind of fish that must be on 
the space shuttle: "They launch them into outer space. How many G-forces is 
that? They have to deal with no gravity and all the experiments done on them. 
Then they have re-entry. When I was a kid, I would buy fish and they would die 
in the car on the way home."

 Speaking of creature tests: 170,000 laboratory rats, mice and guinea pigs

 Comedy writer Tony Peyser says the sign in front of the Hard Rock Cafe at the

MEDIA MONITOR: 90'S FAMILY; LOVE OF A LIFETIME PUT ASIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARROLL LACHNIT, Media Monitor examines the family issues raised in current 
films, books and television shows. It appears on the '90s Family page. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Print: "The Bridges of Madison County" by Robert James Waller (Warner 
Books, 1992). The book has been on the Publishers Weekly bestseller list for 
nearly two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Peopling the Pages: Francesca Johnson, 45, lives with her husband and two 
teen-age children on a farm in Iowa's Madison County. Robert Kincaid, 52, is a 
solitary, world-traveling photographer with a poet's soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Back Story: After years of marriage to Richard, who is kind but dull, 
Francesca has submerged her romanticism, sexuality and passion. Kincaid, once 
married, easily attracts women, but he has yet to find the one who can tame his 
wandering spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuse Time: On an August day in 1965, Kincaid arrives at Francesca's farm and 
asks for directions. The attraction is immediate. The two are swept into a 
four-day affair. Kincaid wants her to leave with him, but Francesca decides to 
stay with her family. 
</P>
<P>
 Telling Quote: "In four days, he gave me a lifetime, a universe, and made the 
separate parts of me into a whole," Francesca writes to her grown children in a 
letter they open after her death. "I have never stopped thinking of him, not 
for a moment. . . . But it never took away from anything I felt for the two of 
you or your father. Thinking only of myself for a moment, I'm not sure I made 
the right decision (to stay). But taking the family into account, I'm pretty 
sure I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Prescription Pad: The story of Francesca Johnson and Robert Kincaid 
"articulates that deep-seated longing we have for bliss and ecstasy," said Dr. 
Edna Hermann, a clinical psychologist who practices in Los Angeles. But in 
"Bridges," passionate love doesn't conquer all. Family ties can be stronger 
than ecstasy, Hermann said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are beginning to challenge the beliefs of the '60s and '80s, when it was 
'Me, me, me -- I'm entitled, and to hell with the rest of the world,' "she 
said. "The heroine is struggling with whether, as a morally responsible person, 
she can travel joyously on a road built on the ruins of her family." 
</P>
<P>
 Francesca refuses to make that journey. "It's a different love she has for her 
family, but it is love, nevertheless." CARROLL LACHNIT

DANA PARSONS: GIMME THAT OLD-TIME RELIGION WITHOUT POLITICAL GOSPEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "A nd He said unto them, go ye into all the world and preach the Gospel to 
every creature."  
</P>
<P>
 "And if you can win a few precincts along the way, so much the better."  
</P>
<P>
 St. Mark the Apostle gets credit for the first line. 
</P>
<P>
 Blasphemous ol' me made up the second one, although I'm sure many conservative 
Christians believe Jesus would have said just that, had He pondered 
20th-Century politics during His time on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Long, long ago someone told me that a sure way to start an argument was to 
talk about religion or politics. So who was the genius who thought it would be 
a good idea to combine the two? 
</P>
<P>
 Sad to say, but the national religion-in-politics battle is officially joined, 
what with President Clinton taking on Jerry Falwell and with a leading 
Democratic House member warning about the rising power of Christian 
conservatives in the Republican Party and with Republican heavyweight Bob Dole 
embracing Republican candidate Oliver North after first giving him the cold 
shoulder. Most recently, the Republican governor of New Jersey said this week 
that the party must shun "extremists," a code word these days for the religious 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 For those of us who get squeamish when politics gets fought on religious 
grounds, this is one fight we could do without. I, for one, find the prospect 
of Jerry Falwell, Ollie North and Pat Robertson being part of the political 
debate about as appetizing as a plate of squid. 
</P>
<P>
 Our own modified version of the national drama is being played out locally. 
The county Republican Party and most of its ruling hierarchy and elected 
officeholders are staunchly conservative, but more moderate voices want to be 
heard. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Ishimatsu, who calls himself a moderate Republican, thinks the ruling 
elite in Orange County is more conservative than rank-and-file Republicans. He 
helped form a political action committee called the Orange County Republican 
Majority Committee to challenge party leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The new group ran 22 people for spots on the county Central Committee in the 
June primary and came away with only three wins, but Ishimatsu remains 
undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking generally both about the local scene and the national party, 
Ishimatsu credits the religious-conservative wing of the party with being well 
organized and active. "I have no problem with their participation in the 
party," he said Tuesday. "The question becomes: Are the positions they're 
pushing really reflective of what the Republican Party should be standing for, 
and a slightly different question, are they reflecting what people who call 
themselves Republicans believe in?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ishimatsu believes the answer to both his questions is no. Citing abortion and 
gay rights, Ishimatsu said opposition to those issues shouldn't be defining 
positions for Republicans. Insisting on opposition to them, as the party's most 
conservative members do, he said, risks alienating larger numbers of voters who 
see the conservative religious movement in politics as intolerant. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Cunningham, one of the founding members of the Conservative Round 
Table of Orange County, couldn't disagree more. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the moderate element in the party, he said, who are close-minded about 
their conservative religious brethren. "It's ironic that the advocates of the 
big tent always want to draw the curtain when anyone of religious conviction 
wants to get in," he said. Moderates expect conservatives to back moderate 
candidates but aren't willing to return the favor when it comes to conservative 
candidates, Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of Christian conservatives in the party doesn't concern him, 
Cunningham said, because they aren't pushing for state-imposed religion. Short 
of that, he said, political views formed by a person's values or religion 
shouldn't be called into question any more than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more to the point, Cunningham says, is the numbers game. Religious 
conservatives, he says, are "the fastest-growing, most dynamic" component of 
the electorate and the way to win future elections. Rather than being 
extremists, he says, they're simply people with pent-up resentment over the 
secular emphasis in government and public schools. To hear Cunningham tell it, 
they're loaded for bear. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Ishimatsu if he thought moderating the Orange County Republican 
leadership is a hopeless task. "Not really," he said, without laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 But then he did start chuckling. "They're very entrenched and very combative. 
We'll be a thorn in their sides. They don't see us as a serious threat and 
understandably so, and I hope it stays that way. They can bring a lot of 
hassles to bear." 
</P>
<P>
 Waiter, I'll take that squid now, please.

BOARD TORPEDOES FREEWAY OVERPASS; SCHOOLS: PEDESTRIAN BRIDGE UNDER CONSTRUCTION 
WOULD HAVE SERVED CHILDREN IN SANTA ANA DISTRICT. BUT OPPONENTS SAW IT AS A 
POSSIBLE CONDUIT FOR CRIMINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To hoots and applause from a packed audience, the Santa Ana Unified District 
school board agreed Tuesday to ask Caltrans to tear down a half-finished bridge 
it has spent $600,000 to build. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous vote means the California Department of Transportation will 
probably spend another $60,000 to tear down the controversial footbridge that 
children would have used to cross the Santa Ana Freeway to get to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Issues remain unresolved as to how the school district will pay to bus the 
children to school instead. 
</P>
<P>
 The pedestrian bridge at 20th and Spurgeon would have connected the sedate 
residential streets of the Northeast Neighborhood with a lower-income 
neighborhood on the west side, dotted with apartment buildings and home to a 
growing number of new immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 700 residents on the wealthier side of the freeway have signed 
petitions opposing the bridge over the last six weeks, saying they fear it will 
grant criminals access to their streets. 
</P>
<P>
 They argued that the school district should simply bus the children who would 
have used the bridge, particularly since a new elementary school is slated for 
construction closer to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My action tonight would be to let Caltrans know that we do not need the 
overcrossing," board member Robert W. Balen said to thunderous applause from 
more than 200 bridge opponents at the meeting, which was moved to Hoover 
Elementary School in the Northeast neighborhood to accommodate them. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans was building the $1.3-million bridge to replace a tunnel that about 
133 schoolchildren had used to trek to school on the eastern side until a 
freeway widening project closed it last year.  
</P>
<P>
 The agency has been paying the school district to bus the children to school 
during construction of the overpass. But neighborhood opposition to the project 
has become so fierce in recent weeks that Caltrans officials told the school 
district that if the children didn't need the bridge, Caltrans would consider 
halting construction and tearing it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry A. Rabbit, Caltrans deputy district director of construction, said he 
ordered construction halted about a week ago when he was informed that the 
school district might not need the crossing after all. Now Caltrans will await 
final word from city officials -- who have vowed to support the school board's 
decision -- to proceed with demolition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members and residents on both sides of the bridge, however, have warned 
that the movement by neighborhoods to seal off their borders in a bid for 
safety fails to deal with the city's increasingly diverse population. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the board urged opponents of the bridge to put that same energy 
into helping build "bridges of the heart," as board member Rosemarie Avila 
said, among Santa Ana's diverse communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I've always believed is that communities must work together, 
especially in Santa Ana. We can't isolate ourselves," board President Sal 
Mendoza told the audience, urging them to pressure city officials to build 
playgrounds or greenbelt space on the western side of the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not support the bridge, but what I would like to see is a win-win 
situation for the community as a whole," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board heard testimony from more than a dozen bridge opponents at 
its meeting last month but declined to vote on the matter. On Balen's 
recommendation, the district polled residents on the western side of the 
bridge, whose children would use the crossing to walk to school.CALIFORNIA

POLICE RELEASE ACCOUNT OF JULY 4 MELEE ARRESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVAN MAHARAJ and DEBRA CANO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a week after a Fourth of July melee, police officials Tuesday 
released their first accounting of the 100 people arrested when officers swept 
through downtown in riot gear, touching off complaints of excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
 Booking reports show that many of the people arrested after 10 p.m. July 4 
were taken into custody on suspicion of discharging fireworks, drinking in 
public, public intoxication and failure to disperse. Others were accused of 
arson, vandalism and assaulting police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most were young men in their late teens and 20s. A few were women, including a 
56-year-old arrested for public intoxication. Many live in Huntington Beach, 
but others came from across the Southland for the city's annual celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews Tuesday, 12 of those arrested described a chaotic scene where 
rowdy youths and bystanders alike bore the brunt of police batons and a water 
tank used for crowd control on Main Street. "The police were more out of 
control than the crowd," said Michael Brian Fitzgerald, a 40-year-old software 
engineer who was cited for failing to disperse. "They seemed to be the people 
looking for trouble. There was no warning to disperse." 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg was in a budget meeting Tuesday and did not 
return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg has previously defended his officers' actions, saying they were 
merely trying to control revelers who were burning furniture in the streets and 
throwing firecrackers, bottles and rocks at officers and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors in the Orange County district attorney's office in Westminster 
said Tuesday that the arrests have led to the filing of at least 30 misdemeanor 
cases and an undetermined number of felonies. Many arrests are still under 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Administrator Richard Barnard acknowledged that some bystanders 
mighty have been "innocently caught up" in the Police Department's tactical 
move to clear revelers from downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will review it to see what our approach was . . . and areas where we can 
improve," Barnard said. "If there were strategies that we employed and didn't 
work, we'll change them and revise them and do something different." 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of July 4, Fitzgerald said he was sitting in front of a Main 
Street cafe savoring tiramisu and sipping a cup of gourmet coffee when throngs 
of rowdy youths began tossing clusters of fireworks and smoke bombs in the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Without warning, he said, a water truck manned by police officers cruised by, 
spraying everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald said he was running down an alley to escape the mayhem when he was 
cornered by five police officers with batons who he said threw him to the 
ground and struck him several times. He said Tuesday that he could not identify 
the officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in a state of disbelief at the time," Fitzgerald said. "I thought this 
couldn't be happening in Huntington Beach and not to me. It makes me think less 
of the city I live in and the Police Department." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald said he spent 12 hours in city jail. He said Tuesday that he does 
not plan to file a complaint against police because hiring a lawyer would "be 
expensive and I don't see much to gain from it otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Anisman, 22, of Los Alamitos said he and a group of friends were lighting 
fireworks in the streets when a group of police officers approached them, 
followed him into someone's house and then arrested him. He was cited for 
possession of illegal fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 David Long, a 23-year-old Huntington Beach resident, said he was struck while 
holding several unopened beers in a neighborhood near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Long said he was caught in a crowd of people who were igniting fireworks in 
the streets and that an unidentified officer, who was trying to break up the 
crowd, struck him on his legs twice with a billy club.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people were letting off illegal fireworks" he said. "I can 
understand the police being there for that. I guess some bad seeds got into the 
group. Someone had lighted some fireworks and garbage dumpsters." 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Long on suspicion of marijuana possession and failing to 
disperse. "They just went a little overboard," he said. "They took advantage of 
the situation. They were basically hitting everybody who got in their way. They 
were hitting innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
 Police spokesman Michael Corcoran said Monday that department officials had 
delayed releasing booking information sooner because they did not have the 
manpower to compile an estimated 100 arrest reports.

<P>
 Barnard said city officials have no plans to cancel the annual Fourth of July 
event even though the celebration has been a constant source of trouble for 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could cancel the parade and shut down the town, but that's going way 
extreme," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzgerald and others blamed the police for the melee. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Farris of Covina, who was arrested on suspicion of public drunkenness 
outside a friend's home in another part of Huntington Beach that night, said 
when he got to the Huntington Beach jail he saw "people who were beat to hell. 
One guy came in with billy club marks on his legs and torso and another must 
have been pressed against the pavement because the whole half of his face was 
all scratched up." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, at least two council members said they supported the police efforts 
to quell the disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Grace Winchell said the police's crowd-control tactics were 
necessary to protect residents and their property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the message was loud and clear that we're not going to have it," 
Winchell said. "You don't have to be destructive to have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman David Sullivan also said it was unlikely that the city would cancel 
its annual independence event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any way we'll let a bunch of hoodlums stop the Fourth 
of July parade," Sullivan said. "It was a great weekend until 10 o'clock Monday 
night."

IT'S NO JOY RIDE ANYMORE; NEW, TOUGHER DMV DRIVING TEST BEING FLUNKED BY 75% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 It only took a minute or two after he pulled out of the examination area 
Tuesday for Frank Belmont to join the majority of people who take a new and 
much more difficult version of the driver's exam and fail their first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old Anaheim High School student ran a stop sign in the Department 
of Motor Vehicles parking lot. Automatic failure, his examiner told him, 
handing him his score sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said to call and make another appointment," Belmont said as he got out of 
the driver's seat so his mother could drive home. "Sure, I'm disappointed. I 
thought I was ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, DMV officials selected 30 offices in Orange, Los Angeles and San 
Diego counties to test the new exam, which features freeway driving and a 
lengthy pop quiz on equipment. Would-be drivers who miss more than three 
questions during the pop quiz immediately fail -- even before getting on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 The new exam relies more than the previous one on a driver's alertness and 
ability to adapt to changing road conditions. In order to pass, a driver must 
not be docked more than 15 points out of 226. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the new exam took effect, the failure rate has grown from 10% to 75% or 
more of those taking the test for the first time, DMV examiner Belia Martinez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only about five people a day pass this test" out of the estimated 15 who take 
it at the DMV office where Martinez works, she said. "But those who don't 
(pass) seem to take it well. Most shrug it off." 
</P>
<P>
 Because DMV officials are concerned that people will avoid taking their 
driving exams at those DMV offices offering the new, experimental test, The 
Times agreed not to publish their locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Time needed for taking the test, which used to be a maximum of 15 minutes, is 
now about 24 minutes. The examiner has the test-taker drive through business 
and residential areas, on quiet streets and on a freeway. The examiner watches 
the driver's reaction to each situation, checking to make sure the driver is 
constantly aware of the changing surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 People who fail the test generally flunk the freeway driving and parking 
portions of the exam, Martinez said. When it comes to freeway driving, she 
said, test-takers either go too fast or too slow, which results in an automatic 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been times when I needed to grab the emergency brake," she said. 
"Sometimes (her job) can be scary." 
</P>
<P>
 DMV officials said that, while the written test is updated every five years, 
this is the first driving exam revision in 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main reason for the change was driver safety," said Evan Nossoff, a DMV 
spokesman in Sacramento. "It wasn't that the (previous) test was too easy but 
that the test needed to be more clearly parallel with current driving 
conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 4,163 people were killed and 315,184 were injured in traffic 
accidents across the state, according to the DMV. The new test was designed to 
reduce the accident rate by weeding out bad drivers, Nossoff said. It also 
addresses the problem of inexperienced drivers on the road, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the exam "has become more in depth, fairer and it will result in 
increased driver capability," Nossoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 After some fine-tuning and finishing touches, the test is expected to make its 
statewide debut by next June, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Private driving instructor Amir Asgarnejad, 34, who was waiting at an Orange 
County DMV office for the return of the first of his students to attempt the 
test, said he was glad to see the tougher standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some students are just not ready, but they have been able to pass the test," 
he said. "I am glad to see it has gotten harder. A lot of people have their 
license who don't know how to drive." 
</P>
<P>
 When Asgarnejad walked up to his 17-year-old student, Hector Lopez, he was 
greeted with a high five. 
</P>
<P>
 "I passed," Lopez said with a huge smile on his face. "But the freeway 
surprised me." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said he became nervous after watching television news reports about the 
new test and seeing a TV reporter fail it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last night it was on every channel," he said. "I stayed up to watch it so I 
could get a preview. I couldn't sleep, it made me so nervous. It is a relief to 
finally have it over with."

IT'S A MARINE LANDING OF SORTS -- AND THE NEIGHBORS DON'T LIKE IT; HOUSING: 
RESIDENTS OF AN EXCLUSIVE COMMUNITY SIGN A PETITION OPPOSING THE CONSTRUCTION 
OF DUPLEXES FOR 128 MILITARY FAMILIES. CAMP PENDLETON CITES A SEVERE SHORTAGE 
OF LIVING QUARTERS.

<P>
 Michael Koehn moved into an exclusive gated community at the south end of town 
seven years ago and has found peace and quiet ever since. Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States Marine Corps wants to build badly needed duplexes for 128 
Marine officer families on San Mateo Point, a scenic bluff top about 400 feet 
across the San Diego County line from some of this city's most attractive and 
expensive homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea has riled Koehn and more than 200 other nearby homeowners who have 
signed a petition against the project. They fear the value of their homes will 
plummet, traffic will increase, and the project will siphon off water and sewer 
service from city residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a terrible idea," said Koehn, 47. "It's one of the last pristine places 
in San Clemente and all of a sudden these guys want to cover it up." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand why they had to choose that spot right next to the best 
housing in San Clemente," added Laura Gleason, who lives elsewhere in San 
Clemente but hopes one day to relocate near the proposed project. "We get along 
with the Marines on the base, but moving so close is stepping on a few toes." 
</P>
<P>
 But supporters of the project, clearly in the minority, contend the residents 
are prejudiced against military families. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in south Orange County are provincial," said Charles Gullett, a 
retired Marine who lives in San Clemente, although not in the affected area, 
and looks forward to college-educated Marine officers moving close to town. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are comfortable with their lifestyle here and are not used to people 
from other reaches of the country," Gullett said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Mateo Point is a 40-acre triangle of land on sprawling Camp Pendleton, 
which has been a Marine base since 1942. The site was once part of the late 
Richard Nixon's Western White House compound when he was president. 
</P>
<P>
 As federal property, the city of San Clemente has no jurisdiction over what 
happens there. 
</P>
<P>
 And what's happening, according to the Marines, is an effort to ease a serious 
and chronic housing shortage on base, where more than 30,000 Marines are 
stationed.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is a severe housing shortage on base," said Marine Lt. David Steele, a 
base spokesman. "Thousands of families are on the waiting list." 
</P>
<P>
 Although not required to consult civilian neighbors on the project, the Marine 
Corps a month ago asked the city and the adjacent homeowners associations for 
comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the Corps says it's taking special measures to make sure the project 
fits the community's upscale look.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, the city Planning Commission has panned the project, endorsing a staff 
letter to the corps that says housing roughly 450 people there would not 
"constitute the highest and best use for the property." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On July 20, the City Council will vote whether to send the letter to the 
Pendleton brass. The letter says the military housing would cause the property 
values of adjacent homes to drop and that the new San Mateo residents may 
affect the city's already limited recreation services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines have said the three- and four-bedroom units will blend in with the 
tony surrounding communities of Cyprus Cove, the Breakers, Cotton Point, and 
Cyprus Shore. They have also said that they plan to spend between $6 million 
and $10 million on the project, which is 7% more than is usually spent on 
military housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plans were developed to have housing in the best interests of all 
involved," said Steele, noting the Corps has sought San Clemente's opinion to 
help develop a project that neighbors can live with. 
</P>
<P>
 "The style of homes will be compatible with the upscale homes," Steele said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for two-story buildings with stucco walls and tile roofs to 
mesh with San Clemente's Spanish architecture, and the project would have open 
spaces, a jogging path and tot lots. Each unit also would have a two-car 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid a cramped look, the military's plan calls for a housing density of 
four units per acre, while the nearby communities have seven units per acre. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight of the 40 acres would be left in their natural state, and large canopy 
trees would be planted throughout the project to partially obscure the homes 
from the view of homeowners whose back windows overlook the land. 
</P>
<P>
 But those design elements have not assuaged upset neighbors, who accuse the 
Marine Corps of trying to ram the project through without taking their concerns 
into account. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Marines seem to have a fixed-bayonet attitude about it," said attorney 
Paul Hegness, who represents the Cotton Point Homeowners' Assn. "They feel, 
'It's our property. We'll do what we want.' That doesn't surprise me." 
</P>
<P>
 Many San Clemente residents have questioned the decision to use the land for 
housing. Building the homes somewhere else on base, they argue, would save 
taxpayers' money because the units wouldn't have to be upgraded to complement 
the communities on San Clemente's southern edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing proposal must still receive funding from the federal government 
before building can begin. The Marine Corps estimates the project would take 
from 12 to 18 months to complete.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; JAIL CELL RENOVATION FOR TB ISOLATION OKD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County supervisors approved plans Tuesday to renovate six cells in the Orange 
County jail system as medical isolation units for inmates with tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous approval by the Board of Supervisors provides an initial $30,800 
for design work for a project that could cost more than $200,000, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under terms of the renovation plan, four cells in the medical department of 
the Intake/Release Center and two in the Women's Jail in Santa Ana would be 
modified in an attempt to contain the highly contagious disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Design plans call for the construction of separate ventilation systems that 
would circulate potentially contaminated air directly outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis is a bacterial disease that is spread by airborne droplets from 
coughing or sneezing. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have said that crowded jail populations are considered among those 
most at risk for the spread of such a disease, which is generally transmitted 
by prolonged contact with an infected person. 
</P>
<P>
 The precautions are a reflection of the disease's dramatic growth in Orange 
County during the past three years as TB cases have increased by 41%. 
</P>
<P>
 At least three cases have been identified at the jail this year and there were 
six reported last year, according to medical officials. Currently, jail 
authorities transport infected inmates to Western Medical Center in Anaheim, 
where they are quarantined and treated. 
</P>
<P>
 The new jail units would allow inmates to be isolated more quickly and cut 
down on transportation costs to the hospital. KEVIN JOHNSON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; BOGUS MEMORABILIA SELLER SENTENCED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man who says he turned to crime to support his methamphetamine addiction was 
sentenced Tuesday to six months in jail for trying to sell bogus baseball 
memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Berg (Hal) Gardner, 37, was arrested during a sting operation when 
Orange County sheriff's deputies met Gardner under the guise of buying 
documents carrying the signatures of Hall of Fame greats such as Babe Ruth, Ty 
Cobb and Mickey Mantle. 
</P>
<P>
 While the price of sports memorabilia has skyrocketed over the years, so has 
the number of cases involving fraudulent items, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Orange County Superior Court Judge Anthony J. Rackauckas Jr. also 
placed Gardner on three years' probation and ordered him to receive drug 
counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner pleaded guilty in June to three counts of forgery and one count of 
grand theft, according to court records. He is also suspected of trying to bilk 
memorabilia buyers throughout the Southland, including Los Angeles and San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner told officials he began selling the phony documents in exchange for 
drugs, according to a sentencing report prepared by the county probation 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner has four prior convictions, for crimes ranging from a 1976 burglary in 
Colorado to grand larceny and theft in Kansas in 1977 and misdemeanor burglary 
in Orange County in 1993. RENE LYNCH

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; DISTRICT PLANNING TO BUILD NEW SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The main roads through the Northwood Pointe village haven't even been built 
yet, but school district officials already are planning for the day when the 
acres of rolling farmland will be an upscale community with hundreds of homes 
and school-age children. 
</P>
<P>
 Projections suggest that the Irvine Unified School District will have to 
accommodate more than 800 new students by 1997, many of them from the growing 
northern side of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 So the district is moving forward with plans to build a new high school at 
what will be the intersection of Yale Avenue and Portola Parkway. Neither road 
has yet been extended into the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of a new Northwood campus could begin as early as next year. 
Preliminary site plans and drawings were presented to the school board earlier 
this month. More detailed plans are now being completed. 
</P>
<P>
 If work on the high school begins in 1995, it could be ready for students by 
1997, Supt. David E. Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a timetable for the project will remain preliminary until the Irvine Co. 
finalizes its development plans for Northwood Pointe, Brown said. Completion of 
the still-unnamed high school might be pushed back to 1998 if construction 
slows at nearby residential developments, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. intends to build a maximum of 2,085 homes on 416 acres just 
outside the city's northern border. The first homes should be built by next 
summer and the full project is scheduled to be completed by the end of the 
decade, said Ken Coulter, the company's vice president for land development. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwood Pointe, also known as Northwood 5, will include a mix of both 
starter homes and larger homes as well as a retail complex, Coulter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school would be built in two phases. The first phase would include 
construction of a main classroom area slated for a 1997 or 1998 opening. It 
would serve about 1,200 students. A second phase could be built later to 
accommodate a total of about 2,200 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The school would be situated in a small valley between Portola Parkway and the 
new Foothill toll road. Plans call for the construction of athletic fields, 
basketball courts and a parking lot, as well as a main classroom and 
administration complex. A stadium, gymnasium and fine arts building might be 
added in a second phase of construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the school would be designed to handle the latest in computer 
technology, including the use of CD-ROM information systems in the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Brown and other district officials met with Tustin school 
officials about the possibility of developing the high school together. The 
school is not far from a portion of Tustin that also is growing rapidly. But 
after several meetings, both school districts decided against a partnership 
right now. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown said it is still possible that Tustin might get involved with the 
project later, perhaps when it comes time to build the second phase of the 
campus. The state Legislature would have to approve a special bill allowing the 
districts to develop the high school jointly, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine school officials have yet to come up with a final price for the campus. 
Money for the high school will come from a tax assessment district that covers 
several new developments. SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; TRUSTEES WEIGH BAN ON PASS/FAIL OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Brea Olinda Unified School District Board of Education is drafting a 
policy prohibiting students from taking a course for "pass/fail" grade in 
academic courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy is being written by a committee made up of teachers, administrators 
and school board members in an attempt to prevent inappropriate grade 
changing.District officials revealed last month that former Brea Olinda High 
School guidance counselors switched hundreds of students' letter grades to 
simple "pass" notations to boost grade-point averages. 
</P>
<P>
 According to school board members, the problem began years ago when the high 
school's math department decided to give students incentive to take challenging 
math courses without fear of getting a letter grade that could lower their 
grade-point averages and class ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 But the practice ballooned and expanded to other courses, district officials 
said. Then this fall, administrators found that former guidance counselors 
changed more than 360 grades from the previous year without teachers' 
permission, violating the state's education code. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid further violations, trustees formed a committee to work on a policy, 
spelling out grading practices. 
</P>
<P>
 At Monday's meeting, Trustee Lynn Doucher said the committee was considering 
recommending that the pass/fail option be eliminated from grading in academic 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the committee will consider abolishing the ranking of students 
except for the valedictorian and salutatorian to ease some competition among 
students, Doucher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to correct something that obviously has gone astray over the 
years," Trustee Frank Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board is expected to make a final decision on a grading policy 
before school starts in the fall. MIMI KO

 The City Council on Tuesday approved a plan to designate Anaheim Stadium and 
its parking lot a redevelopment project, setting the stage for a possible 
renovation of the facility and construction of a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, however, said the designation primarily is intended to help 
finance repairs to the stadium that were caused during the Jan. 17 Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 No commitment has been made to either refurbish or build a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 A new stadium or renovation of the existing one is believed to be a key 
element in any effort to prevent the Los Angeles Rams from moving out of the 
stadium, some city officials contend.  
</P>
<P>
 Ram officials have said Anaheim Stadium is obsolete and they are looking to 
move to another city with a better facility and greater financial 
opportunities. The team exercised a 15-month escape clause in its stadium lease 
in May. 
</P>
<P>
 During the earthquake, the stadium's 17-ton scoreboard toppled and caused up 
to $10 million in damage. Because of that damage, the city is allowed to create 
a redevelopment project without making the required findings in the area of 
blight, crime and other community deficiencies. 
</P>
<P>
 With the declaration, the city will be able to use any increase in tax revenue 
for future development on the 150-acre stadium land. City officials say the 
project may eventually help finance a stadium remodeling or even a new 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's action Tuesday started the redevelopment process, which still 
requires several public hearings before it can go forward.MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; PACT TO HELP FINANCE A NEW CITY LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A conceptual agreement on a real estate deal that would help finance a new 
city library has been announced by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said Monday only the final details remain to be ironed out on 
a land swap that would exchange a vacant parcel owned by the city for a smaller 
piece of land owned by the Mission Viejo Co. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope to net between $2 million and $2.5 million from the trade. 
The money would pay part of the $5 million estimated cost of building the 
proposed 25,000-square-foot library. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have made substantial progress," Mayor Susan Withrow said Tuesday. "All 
parties agree essentially to the important terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Withrow hopes to finalize the land trade by next month, then move immediately 
onto planning and building the library. 
</P>
<P>
 "If nothing goes wrong," she said, "we'd start designing the library in 
September, construction in May (1995) and hopefully finish the library by 
August, 1996." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, a seven-acre parcel of city land on Los Altos would be 
swapped for a four-acre lot on Marguerite Parkway and La Paz Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marguerite Parkway property is next to 3.5 acres purchased by the city and 
pegged as the library site. City officials say the two parcels will form a 
civic center complex that will include a City Hall building. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the trade takes place, the Mission Viejo Co. will sell the four-acre 
lot to an Irvine-based land developer, the Staubach Co., city officials said. 
Officially, the city will exchange properties with the Staubach Co., and give 
the developer the right to design and construct the library. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is also progressing on an agreement with the county to turn over 
operations of the current branch library to City Hall. The county would 
continue staffing the facility. FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: CYPRESS; YOUTH CLUB HIRED FOR GRAFFITI REMOVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has hired a youth club to remove graffiti throughout the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Monday night put a new wrinkle into graffiti removal, 
which is a longstanding and expensive problem for many Orange County cities. 
Instead of paying a city worker, the council voted 5 to 0 to contract with the 
Boys and Girls Club of San Gabriel to remove graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The council members acted after city Public Works Director Mark Christoffels 
told them that hiring the club would be cheaper than hiring a city maintenance 
worker for the job. He said that by not filling a vacant city maintenance 
position for six months, the city would save $14,814. For that amount, 
Christoffels said, Cypress could have a yearlong contract with the Boys and 
Girls Club for graffiti-removal services. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very innovative," Councilwoman Joyce C. Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christoffels said he had been unable to find any club in Cypress or elsewhere 
in Orange County that could take the job. He said the Boys and Girls Club of 
San Gabriel, which is based in El Monte, has been doing graffiti removal for 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "In searching around, I found that a lot of private companies that do this 
charge a considerable cost in order to ensure a profit," Christoffels said. The 
youth club offers its services cheaper "because it is provided with 
court-ordered labor." The club supervises young people whom the Los Angeles 
County courts have ordered to do public service, such as graffiti removal. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition, the club is subsidized with community-development (federal) 
block grants," Christoffels said. 
</P>
<P>
 The public works director said he was familiar with the work done by club 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are all supervised," he said. "They are quite professional. They work 
seven days a week."  
</P>
<P>
 The agreement extends from Aug. 1 to July 30, 1995, and calls for the amount 
not to exceed $14,814. BILL BILLITER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; EX-RESIDENT BRINGS SISTER CITY'S THANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steven M. Rosenbery had no idea what he wanted to do when he was growing up in 
Orange, sneaking smokes behind Villa Park High School with his buddies. Of all 
his fantasies of the future, one thing he did not dream was what he eventually 
became -- the mayor of Piedra Parada, a small city in Guatemala so poor he 
cannot find words to describe it. 
</P>
<P>
 He certainly never thought he would be in city hall handing out plaques from 
Guatemala's president to thank Orange and its Sister City Assn. for sending 
medical supplies down to Piedra Parada. But there he was Thursday night at a 
Sister City board meeting, passing around snapshots of the Piedra Parada 
medical center staff and the examining tables, gurneys and hospital beds 
recently arrived from Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbery, 35, is a nearly native son (he moved to Orange when he was 4) and 
he credits his father's sense of civic duty for getting him where he is today 
-- and getting his city the donations it needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father said everything you receive you have to give back," Rosenbery said. 
"It wasn't his religion or anything, it was just his philosophy." His father 
fulfilled that duty, as many fathers do, by volunteering to help with Bobby 
Soxers and Little League. His son showed that the same civic ethic can 
accomplish more. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbery began going down to Guatemala for work in the early 1980s. "The 
climate, the warmness and the openness of the people" convinced him to make it 
his home in 1985, he said. Eventually, he started a medical disposal business 
in Guatemala City. Two years laterhe married Karla, an American-educated 
Guatemalan, and gained dual citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of his employees persuaded him to visit the small town of Piedra Parada. 
"I had never seen anything more pitiful in my life," he said of the poverty he 
saw. "I was just appalled." 
</P>
<P>
 He noticed that the children played basketball on a dirt court using mangled 
coat hangers for rims. He made a call to a friend in Orange to send some decent 
backboards and rims, and before he knew it, others were asking him to help with 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Through his connections as a prominent businessman, he helped put lights in 
the school, improve the roads and finish a half-built medical clinic that had 
been sitting useless since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 He learned about things he had taken for granted as a kid. "Growing up in 
Orange, I was so used to opening up the faucet and having water come out," he 
said. In Piedra Parada, they needed wells and those wells needed pumps and 
tanks and filtering systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, children there are as eager as adults to learn to read and write, 
he said. "I used to take public education for granted," he told the Sister City 
officials. "We were always trying to get out of school -- and I was pretty good 
at it. These people are trying to get into school." 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, residents organized a petition to have him named mayor, 
something of a mixed blessing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbery's term will end next year, but he will continue to mine his hometown 
for material goods and strategic advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just astounded at the different groups that did want to help," he said. 
"We will ensure that the donations get into needy hands," he said. "And there 
are a lot of needy there." LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; VOTERS LIKELY TO GET TERM LIMIT INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An initiative to gauge support for City Council term limits appears to be 
headed for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative tentatively adopted by the City Council in a study session 
Monday will ask residents if they support the concept of term limits. It will 
not ask if they want to enact a term limit ordinance, because that is is 
illegal in a city bound by general California law. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Donald L. Bone had raised the idea last month after several residents 
called him about it. Councilman Don R. Griffin had suggested the council pursue 
state legislation that would allow cities to adopt term limit laws and council 
members asked the city attorney to draft some ballot measures for them to 
consider. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. James L. Markman came to the study session with five options for 
wording the initiative. Three of them asked voters if they wanted the council 
to seek state legislation to change the law and then adopt term limits, but 
that was judged to be too complicated. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option asked if the city should adopt a term limit ordinance, but that 
made the city attorney "uncomfortable" because it did not mention that the 
ordinance would be legally unenforceable. 
</P>
<P>
 The final wording simply asks, "Do you support term limits for Buena Park City 
Council members?" 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rhonda J. McCune, who has already stated she will impose her own 
term limit and not seek reelection, said the council should make sure residents 
want term limits before they launch a campaign to change the law. This advisory 
vote would "take the pulse of the community," she said. "I think it's wrong for 
the City Council to pursue something the community doesn't want."  
</P>
<P>
 Griffin said he would not support the initiative because it would not be 
legally binding. The council can seek new state legislation without going to 
the voters first, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's not constitutional, it would be a moot point," he said of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 A final decision on the ballot initiative -- termed an "advisory vote" -- will 
be made at the July 18 City Council meeting.LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; POOL-FENCE WARNING SPURRED BY TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials Tuesday urged parents to fence in swimming pools, after a year-old 
Huntington Beach girl drowned in a back-yard pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Cashmere Jo Hale was found face down in the pool Monday after her mother 
answered a call at the front door.The child apparently made her way out of the 
living room through a sliding door, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the fifth child to drown in Orange County swimming pools so far this 
year, and the third younger than 5 years old.  
</P>
<P>
 Police, who said the pool was not fenced off from the home, called the 
drowning an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl's mother, Trishia Hale, 33, answered the door about 5 p.m. and talked 
with an acquaintance about a car repair for "less than five minutes," Police 
Sgt. Bill Peterson said. When Hale did not find her daughter in the living 
room, she noticed a sliding door ajar and she dashed outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts by neighbors and paramedics to resuscitate the child failed, and she 
was pronounced dead at Huntington Beach Medical Center, Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most cities require fences around new homes with swimming pools, but county 
health officials prodded homeowners to also install separate fences and 
self-closing gates around the pools themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 'We're just sort of at the beginning of what we call our drowning season, so 
people need to take precautions," said Amy Dale, program manager of the injury 
prevention division in the county's health care agency. "It's time to get those 
barriers up." KEN ELLINGWOOD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; CLUB OWNER ALLEGES RACISM, SEEKS PROBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of a Santa Ana jazz club that draws a predominantly African 
American clientele submitted sworn affidavits to the U.S. Department of Justice 
on Tuesday, alleging that the Japan-based landlord has waged a racist campaign 
to put the club out of business. 
</P>
<P>
 The building, at Three Hutton Centre, is owned by Tokyo-based Orix Corp. It 
was managed by Nansay U.S.A. Inc. until last year, and is now managed by New 
York-based Cushman & Wakefield, said Randell Young, co-owner of Randell's jazz 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said he hoped the hundreds of pages of sworn statements, photographs and 
letters will persuade the federal government to open a civil rights 
investigation into what he described as two years of racially motivated 
harassment. He filed a lawsuit against the companies in Los Angeles Superior 
Court last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at both Nansay and Cushman and Wakefield declined to comment 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Department of Justice in Washington said the agency 
received the packet Tuesday and will review the allegations to determine 
whether there was a violation of the Public Accommodations Act. That act, part 
of 1964 civil rights law that says you cannot discriminate against one group of 
people, covers places of entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one affidavit submitted Tuesday by a construction contractor, 
Nansay President Kazuo Yokeno allegedly told the contractor to hold off on a 
job temporarily because there were too many black customers going to the club. 
The statement alleges that Yokeno used a derogatory term to describe customers 
and said he didn't want black people to "take over the building." 
</P>
<P>
 Young also submitted a sworn statement from a former vice president of Nansay 
who alleged that Yokeno made it clear he considered black tenants a liability. 
</P>
<P>
 Young's partner, Michael S. Cramer, submitted a statement saying Yokeno told 
him he was worried that "a lot of blacks" were going into Randell's. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, Nansay U.S.A. stopped managing the building and Orix hired Cushman 
and Wakefield, said Young, who is running for mayor of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Young alleges that harassment has continued with the new property manager. He 
outlined 89 incidents of alleged harassment in the sworn statements, contending 
that the new property manager tried to block the club's access to cable, 
scheduled loud maintenance work during prime business hours, coated the floors 
with strong chemicals before the Saturday business rush, and billed them for 
inappropriate expenses. LEE ROMNEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; CITY TO STUDY USING OUTSIDE LAW FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council wants to know if it is cheaper to employ an in-house city 
attorney or to use an outside law firm. 
</P>
<P>
 The council asked for a study that should be completed by its Sept. 19 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager William A. Huston said city officials will find out how cities 
comparable in size obtain legal services. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Tustin will continue to be represented by acting City Atty. 
Lois E. Jeffrey of the Orange-based firm of Rourke, Woodruff & Spradlin. 
Jeffrey is a partner of James G. Rourke, who resigned in June after serving as 
Tustin's city attorney for 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any reason to switch firms at this point," Councilwoman Tracy 
Worley said at the council meeting this week. ALAN EYERLY

WHERE THERE WAS SMOKER, THERE'S FIRE IN DANGER ZONE; BLAZE: MOTORIST REPORTS 
BURNING BRUSH JUST HALF A MILE FROM WHERE DEVASTATING LAGUNA FIRESTORM BEGAN. 
ANGRY INVESTIGATORS BLAME CARELESSLY DISCARDED CIGARETTE BUTT. 
</P>

<P>
 A smoldering cigarette tossed from a passing car Tuesday afternoon ignited a 
one-acre fire near where last October's devastating Laguna Beach fire began, 
the Orange County Fire Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire began burning about 2 p.m. in a grassy area between the southbound 
and northbound lanes of Laguna Freeway near the San Diego Freeway junction. The 
blaze was reported via cellular telephone by a passing motorist, fire Capt. Dan 
Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was just half a mile from the location of the Oct. 27 fire that 
roared over more than 16,000 acres and damaged or destroyed more than 400 homes 
in Laguna Beach, Canyon Acres, Emerald Bay and the El Moro Beach Mobile Home 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that someone can drive down a road and toss out a cigarette in an 
area where we just lost 400 homes leaves me speechless," Young said. "This kind 
of behavior can burn communities and it is irresponsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire investigators also were astonished and angry to find hundreds of other 
cigarette butts in the immediate area, apparently tossed by passing motorists, 
Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is Southern California and it's fire season," he said. "People need to 
get a grasp on where they live and what they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was last year's Laguna fire that made Tuesday's blaze less 
threatening. Much of the thick brush in the area that had served as a source of 
fuel was burned in the October fire, which was also quickly spread by gusty 
winds, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a limit as to how far this fire could have burned because we don't 
have Santa Ana winds, and there's not a lot of vegetation anymore," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Young warned, between 15,000 and 20,000 acres of thick vegetation 
between the San Diego Freeway and the south side of the city remain intact and 
continue to pose a threat. 
</P>
<P>
 It took 40 firefighters about 35 minutes to control the fire. No injuries or 
damage was reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire forced officials to close several surrounding roadways for more than 
two hours, including portions of roads leading to the Laguna Freeway.

TOLL ROAD OPPONENTS CONCEDE COURT ORDER NOT VIOLATED; CONSTRUCTION: WORKERS 
CAREFULLY AVOID A SEGMENT OF SAN JOAQUIN HILLS TOLLWAY DECLARED OFF-LIMITS BY 
JUDGE. ENVIRONMENTALISTS REMAIN ON ALERT WITH CAMERAS.

 Environmental activists who had considered taking legal action instead 
conceded Tuesday that the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Agency is not 
violating a judge's order by resuming work here on a segment of a controversial 
toll road project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got people with cameras out there photographing the site and running to 
the nearest Fotomat," said Robert King, a spokesman for the environmental group 
Save Our San Juan, also known as SOS. "We brought the pictures to our attorney 
who advised us not to take any action in court." 
</P>
<P>
 Tollway officials said they have been grading the site since Friday, but 
maintain that off-limit areas established by Orange County Superior Court Judge 
Leonard Goldstein last month have been carefully avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are two small parcels, a total of maybe one acre" covered by 
Goldstein's court order, said TCA spokesman Michael Stockstill. "We are not 
conducting any grading activities on those sites." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's prohibition affects an area near Rancho Viejo Road, which the 
transportation agency is clearing to help make way for the 17-mile toll road 
that will stretch from the Corona del Mar Freeway in Newport Beach and pass 
through Laguna Niguel before intersecting with the Interstate 5 in San Juan 
Capistrano near Avery Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, SOS successfully petitioned the court to temporarily halt 
construction in San Juan Capistrano, saying environmental studies of the area 
were not complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein ordered work stopped temporarily and told the transportation agency 
to come up with a study showing whether new, previously unknown environmental 
impacts were being caused by tollway construction in north San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge's decision was the first of two victories for tollway opponents in 
June, preceding a U.S. appeals court injunction that halted construction along 
a 4.4-mile section of planned tollway running through the environmentally 
sensitive Laguna Greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 King said that SOS will discuss whether to hire a surveyor to determine 
whether the toll road agency is encroaching on restricted land in San Juan 
Capistrano. The disputed area is also the site of many expensive hillside homes 
that border large expanses of open wilderness near the 40,000-acre Rancho 
Mission Viejo in northeast San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activists claim that the current route brushes too close to their 
neighborhoods, creating noise and destroying the natural beauty of the terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Juan Capistrano City Council recently voted not to challenge the 
planned tollway in exchange for $2.5 million in road improvements.

ARRESTEE IN CRASH THAT HURT BOY HAS LONG RECORD; COURTS: DANA POINT PAROLEE HAS 
BEEN CITED SIX TIMES FOR DRIVING WITH A SUSPENDED LICENSE, HAS A STRING OF 
TRAFFIC OFFENSES AND WAS IMPRISONED ON A DRUG CONVICTION.

 John Eric Phelps, who is accused of crashing a stolen Mercedes into another 
car Monday and critically injuring a 7-year-old boy, has been cited at least 
six times for driving with a suspended license and has been in at least two 
other crashes, according to court and Department of Motor Vehicle records.  
</P>
<P>
 Phelps, 31, of Dana Point also has an eight-year court record that includes a 
drug felony conviction in Hawaii, a vandalism conviction in Laguna Beach, a 
string of minor traffic convictions and two civil suits resulting from 
accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps' father, John D. Phelps of south Orange County, said he and his wife 
were devastated by the news of Monday's accident and the injury to the 
7-year-old.  
</P>
<P>
 "I prayed all night for him," he said. "I hurt for that little boy." 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps said he has not had contact with his son for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drugs have totally screwed his life up," Phelps said. "This kid came from a 
good family. . . . It's a sad situation," he said. "But don't you ever think 
this couldn't happen to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps said he made no excuses for his son's role in the collision: "Whatever 
Johnny gets, he deserves." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's collision took place after an off-duty Laguna Beach police officer 
spotted a stolen Mercedes 450 going about 100 m.p.h. northbound on the Santa 
Ana Freeway at Laguna Canyon Road, police said. The motorcycle office said he 
pursued the Mercedes with his lights flashing and siren sounding until the car 
exited the freeway at Jeffrey Road. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, the Mercedes collided with a Peugot station wagon driven by 
Cheryl McGee, as her car crossed Jeffrey on Irvine Center Road. Witnesses told 
police the Mercedes ran a red light. Cheryl McGee and her daughter were 
uninjured, but 7-year-old Trent suffered serious head injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps was captured six hours later after a door-to-door search of a nearby 
residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 Trent remained in critical condition Tuesday night. Phelps is held without 
bail at the Orange County Jail on suspicion of felony hit-and-run, evading 
arrest, grand theft auto, reckless driving and other charges, Irvine Police Lt. 
Sam Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of Monday's collision, Phelps was wanted by state officials for 
avoiding parole officials after failing a drug test earlier this spring, 
according to Art Lucero, a Department of Corrections spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps served two years in prison in Hawaii for cocaine possession in 1990-92, 
after being arrested at an airport, Lucero said. When his prison term was 
completed, he asked to be paroled to Orange County, where he was reared. 
</P>
<P>
 Before this spring, Lucero said "we had a couple of incidents" regarding 
Phelps' parole, but nothing serious. Then, in April, Phelps failed a mandatory 
drug test. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a dirty test from this guy, and he knew it, and he split on us," 
avoiding his parole agent, Lucero said. "So we informed Hawaii officials that 
we lost track of this guy. We were in the process of requesting a warrant." 
</P>
<P>
 In the days before the collision, Phelps was scheduled for two separate, 
traffic-related court appearances, which he did not make. Bench warrants were 
issued for him in two separate Orange County Municipal courts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, Phelps was the defendant in two lawsuits filed in Orange 
County Superior Court involving traffic accidents that resulted in injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The first occurred on Dec. 31, 1987, in Dana Point, when two people were 
injured when they were hit by a borrowed Mercedes driven by Phelps, according 
to the suit. That case was settled with the owners of the car and dismissed. 
The attorney for the Mercedes' owners said that Phelps could not be found to be 
served with court papers and was not included in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second suit, it was alleged in court documents that Phelps was driving 
a Porsche that struck a diaper truck on Oct. 12, 1988, in Laguna Beach. The 
second case was also dismissed, according to court documents, when Phelps could 
not be located. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Burgess, 48, of Orange, driver of the truck, said the collision 
occurred on a blind curve on Canyon View Drive.  
</P>
<P>
 "I flew up in the air, and was tossed like a BB and came down on a piece of 
wood and injured my back." 
</P>
<P>
 After both vehicles came to rest, Burgess shouted at Phelps to make sure 
Phelps wasn't dead, because the Porsche "was just totaled," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hollered out the window, 'Are you alive?' And, this guy kicks the door open 
of his car and shakes his head like the $6-million man," Burgess said. "He 
said, 'I gotta make a phone call.' And he ran down the street." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess said he wanted to file a lawsuit against Phelps, but he couldn't be 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just went underground," Burgess said. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps was charged with failing to stop at the scene of an accident. He 
pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of driving with a suspended or revoked 
license and was sentenced to 10 days in jail and three years' probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days after the collision with Burgess, Phelps was cited for driving with a 
suspended license. According to cases on file at the Municipal Court in Laguna 
Niguel, Phelps has been cited repeatedly since the late 1980s for driving while 
his license was suspended or revoked. 
</P>
<P>
 That happened most recently on May 27 on Marina Hills Drive in Laguna Niguel. 
He was also charged with failing to stop for a sheriff's deputy who had turned 
on his siren. 
</P>
<P>
 Phelps missed a July 8 appearance on those charges, and a $25,000 bench 
warrant was issued for his arrest on Friday.

COUNTY TO HANDLE MEDI-CAL MENTAL-HEALTH CARE SERVICE; MANAGEMENT: IT WILL 
CREATE AND ADMINISTER A PROGRAM FOR LOW-INCOME PATIENTS. IF IT HADN'T ACTED, 
THE STATE WOULD HAVE PICKED A PRIVATE CONTRACTOR FOR THE JOB. 
</P>

<P>
 In an effort to help the state get a handle on rapidly rising Medi-Cal costs, 
the Board of Supervisors decided Tuesday to create and administer a managed 
care program for the county's low-income mental health patients. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors agreed to notify the state Department of Mental 
Health that it wants to manage mental health care for the county's 
approximately 285,000 Medi-Cal recipients, including care now provided by the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new system, low-income people can still choose to obtain treatment 
from either private physicians or county clinics. But the county will receive a 
fixed amount of federal and state money per patient to pay for those services. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Uram, director of the Orange County Health Care Agency, said ultimately 
the county may choose to drop from the program those physicians or hospitals 
whose services are deemed most expensive and least cost effective. Also, he 
said, the county will provide "case managers" who are expected to direct more 
poor mental health patients to receive care in physician offices rather than in 
more expensive psychiatric hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 This move to more tightly manage mental health costs parallels the development 
of HMOs, or health maintenance organizations, for privately insured patients. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county had not agreed to revamp the mental health program for the 
county's Medi-Cal patients, Uram said, the state would have found a private 
contractor to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Uram said the county will phase in the new mental health program for Medi-Cal 
mental health patients over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first step, he said, the county in October will begin administering 
inpatient mental health services for Medi-Cal recipients at a projected cost of 
$17 million for the first year. "It is not without financial risks, but as long 
as the state is going to dictate managed care, we would as soon be in charge of 
our destiny," Uram said.  
</P>
<P>
 Uram said the county's administration of the mental health component of 
Medi-Cal will dovetail with OPTIMA, a county-administered HMO that will begin 
providing and funding other Medi-Cal services next year.

LAKE FOREST WOMAN DIES A DAY AFTER HER CAR CRASHES INTO TREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 63-year-old woman died Tuesday afternoon, 24 hours after she was involved in 
a single-car crash on Marguerite Parkway. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherri Harmon, a resident of Lake Forest, was southbound on Marguerite Parkway 
south of Estanciero Drive at 3:48 p.m. Monday when her car jumped the center 
divider and struck a tree, said Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Jay Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently a witness talked to (Harmon) shortly after the collision," Mendez 
said. "Shortly afterward, she went into full cardiac arrest. We're not sure if 
she had a heart attack before or after the accident."

FATHER ACCIDENTALLY RUNS OVER TODDLER IN DRIVEWAY; TRAGEDY: THE MAN, WHO WAS 
MOVING THE VEHICLE IN ORDER TO DO SOME WORK ON IT, DID NOT SEE HIS 23-MONTH-OLD 
BOY WANDER FROM THE HOUSE INTO HIS PATH.

 A man moving his pickup truck to a different spot on his driveway accidentally 
ran over and killed his 23-month-old son Tuesday afternoon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident, which occurred at 3:49 p.m. in the 1660 block of Katella Avenue, 
marked the fourth time since Saturday that a child has been killed or injured 
by a moving vehicle in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "The father was going to do some work (on the brakes) and wanted to move the 
truck about 25 feet," Anaheim Police Lt. Ray Welch said. "The child wandered 
out of the house unbeknownst to the father, who ran over the child." 
</P>
<P>
 As the father moved the truck forward, a female friend ran from his house, 
shouting at him in warning. He looked down and saw his child lying on the 
ground, police said. The child's death was ruled an accident and his father, 
25-year-old Anthony Miller, will not face charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a tragic human event, and we are not looking at it from a criminal 
standpoint," Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors gathered around the house as frantic family members, including the 
mother, attempted to attend to Anthony Miller Jr., who would have been 2 next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the father pulled wooden planks out of his truck and began to beat 
his vehicle, neighbors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really pounding the truck," said Norma Martinson, 61, who lives two 
houses away from the accident site. "He was just going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 The child suffered massive head and internal injuries and was taken to UCI 
Medical Center in Orange, where he was pronounced dead, Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to remember that small children are very mobile and we have to be 
very mindful of them," Welch said. "This all happened in such a short period of 
time, and now this tragedy is going to be with this family for the rest of 
their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The death was the latest in a series of recent automobile accidents that left 
young children injured or dead. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, a 2-year-old girl was killed by a hit-and-run driver in front of 
her apartment complex in Westminster. Earlier that day, a 6-year-old boy 
received minor injuries when he darted from an apartment in Stanton and was hit 
by a hit-and-run driver.  
</P>
<P>
 And on Monday, a 7-year-old Irvine boy was left in critical condition when the 
car he was riding in was struck by a hit-and-run motorist. A suspect in that 
case has been arrested.

RESEARCHER FILLS KEY POST AT UCI; APPOINTMENT: A KEY PART OF FREDERIC YUI-MING 
WAN'S DUTIES WILL BE TO KEEP GRANT FUNDS FLOWING TO THE UNIVERSITY. 
</P>

 Frederic Yui-Ming Wan, a professor of mathematics and applied mathematics at 
the University of Washington, has been named vice chancellor of research and 
dean of graduate studies at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening praised Wan's background in research, 
saying his help will be critical to the university's efforts to advance its 
academic stature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fred Wan is a fine administrator and scholar well-known for his applied 
mathematical research," Wilkening said in a prepared statement. "His role is to 
help faculty direct research toward new funding sources and help move UCI into 
the top 50 research universities in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Wan's appointment, still subject to approval by the UC Board of Regents, is 
scheduled to take effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCI, Wan will be responsible for research policy, allocation of campus 
research and graduate fellowship funds and contracts. He will also be 
responsible for grant development. The university receives more than $100 
million annually in outside research support. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the challenge of his new job will be to keep the research funds 
flowing to UCI in an increasingly competitive market, Wan said in a prepared 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of increasing demands and more targeted approaches, today's research 
funding is more complex than in the past," he said. "Unless we position 
ourselves to tap new funding sources, we will not be able to increase our 
research activities." 
</P>
<P>
 Wan, 58, is a native of Shanghai, China, and grew up in Saigon, Los Angeles 
and Seattle. He is a graduate of MIT and is a former faculty member there as 
well as the University of British Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 The author of more than 100 research papers and two graduate textbooks, Wan is 
an internationally known expert in the theory of plates and shells, a field of 
structural mechanics. Wan is also director for the Division of Mathematical 
Sciences at the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Va.

16-YEAR-OLD SETS RECORD FOR CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHT; AVIATION: BALTIMORE HIGH 
SCHOOL JUNIOR TOUCHES DOWN IN LONG BEACH AFTER 12-DAY SOLO TRIP. HE RETURNS HIS 
FATHER'S CREDIT CARD TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As soon as 16-year-old Jimmy Mathis set foot on solid ground at Long Beach 
Airport on Tuesday after becoming the youngest person ever to fly solo coast to 
coast, his Dad gave him a bear hug and made a down-to-earth request. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give me my credit card back, son," Jim Mathis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can have it," the 6-foot, 3-inch younger Mathis replied. "But I'm afraid 
it's no good anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Mathis said he hasn't yet totaled up the gas, food, motel and 
airplane repair bills from the 12-day, 2,500-mile flight in a rented, 
single-engine Cessna that earned him a place in aviation history. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever the cost, he said he's proud. "I wanted to prove I could fly 
cross-country solo and I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Two 9-year-olds claim to have piloted planes coast to coast, but they were 
accompanied by instructors because Federal Aviation Administration rules 
prohibit anyone under 16 from flying solo. Mathis, who has been flying since he 
was 10 and has a student pilot's license, said he wanted to better that record 
by flying on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference between winging it solo and having an instructor along is that 
the high school junior from Baltimore had no one to ask for advice over Kansas 
when the plane's luggage door somehow worked its way open at the same time that 
one of his navigational devices gave out. 
</P>
<P>
 What he did was consult his map for the location of a local airport and, by 
locating landmarks, find his way there. Next, he had to figure out how to land 
while making only right turns because banking left might have sent his clothes 
and other belongings fluttering across the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Another device, which sends out a radio signal that helps airport flight 
control towers track nearby planes, failed on the first leg between Ocean City, 
Md., and Cincinnati. But Jim Mathis said his son didn't panic. He made radio 
contact with the Baltimore tower and advised them he was going to fly at a 
lower altitude to avoid other aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Mathis said the final leg of the journey from Arizona to Long 
Beach was probably one of the most nerve-racking. While flying through a pass 
near Banning, three military helicopters startled him when they suddenly 
appeared nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when he had Long Beach Airport in view, air traffic control told him to 
fly out to the Queen Mary before landing so that a television news helicopter 
could rendezvous with him to photograph the final few minutes before touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point that I saw the airport, that's when the relief came," he said. "I 
knew then I couldn't get lost." 
</P>
<P>
 When Mathis landed, he was greeted by his parents, Jim and Marylou, his two 
flying instructors from Baltimore, representatives of the airport and the city 
of Long Beach. Also on hand were executives from Toyota and one of its 
subsidiaries, both of which paid some of the flight's costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Mathis, creative director for an advertising firm in Baltimore, said he 
was "very proud" of his son, "not just for the flying thing" but also for the 
maturity and the coolheadedness he exhibited. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he said he would become anxious each day to hear the beep sound of 
his pager that would signal him that Jimmy had landed safely, he said he never 
doubted his son's flying skills. Still, he said, "This is the longest he's ever 
been away." 
</P>
<P>
 The younger Mathis said he learned a valuable lesson along the way, in 
addition to racking up 25 additional solo flight hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I got into a situation where I was on my own, I learned that I could 
handle that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mathises said they will spend the rest of the week in Southern California 
and make a trip to San Francisco before Jimmy flies back, this time with one of 
his instructors at his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Jimmy Mathis wants to become a commercial pilot. But he has a more 
immediate goal for the rest of the summer: getting his driver's license.

D.A. HAS HIGH RATE OF SUCCESS, AUDIT SAYS; COURTS: INDEPENDENT STUDY CHALLENGES 
PUBLIC PERCEPTION OF FAILURE, BUT NOTES BUDGET WOES. 
</P>

<P>
 Despite public perceptions to the contrary, the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office has a high success rate in prosecuting crime but is hampered 
by inadequate financing, according to an independent audit released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit, conducted by a Santa Monica firm at the request of the 1993-94 
grand jury, also found little basis for criticism that county prosecutors 
cannot win high-profile cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing that view as "far short of accurate," the audit noted that while 
prosecutors failed to get convictions in the state trial of police officers 
accused of beating Rodney G. King, the murder case against the Menendez 
brothers and on some charges in the Reginald O. Denny case, they sent 
defendants to prison in the Night Stalker and Cotton Club killings and in the 
Charles Keating securities fraud case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because expectations are absolute, it appears anything short of total success 
. . . gives rise to a perception of inadequacy," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 It blamed high expectations on a pervasive public fear of crime, adding that 
such fear is not entirely justified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the fact that the overall crime rate is down across the country, and 
that no city in Los Angeles County was ranked among the nation's 15 most 
dangerous cities in a recent survey," the audit said, "that is not the 
perception of the average person who is constantly exposed to a media litany of 
violent crime reports." 
</P>
<P>
 The audit, conducted by Leonard Fuller & Co., was part of a full report of the 
grand jury whose term ended last month. The report included the results of 
surveys of former trial jurors and sitting judges conducted separately from the 
audit by a committee of grand jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the surveys, individual prosecutors' performances were rated from excellent 
to such low levels that, according to the committee, some of them should not 
have been allowed to try cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, commenting on the report, said he was not troubled 
by the surveys because they were "unscientific" compared to a professional 
review by trained auditors of management systems. He said he felt vindicated by 
the audit's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The report should give the community some confidence in the professionalism . 
. . of the lawyers who represent the people every day in court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The audit found that, despite a limited staff, high caseloads, low staff 
morale, weaknesses in some management systems and an inadequate budget, the 
district attorney's office in 1992 (the most recent year studied) had a 93.6% 
conviction rate for the 52,905 felony cases it tried and a 99.4% rate for 
173,835 misdemeanor cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the shortcomings that auditors did find, the audit said, are traceable 
to "increasing demand for services with decreasing resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "The single most pervasive and debilitating problem affecting (the office) and 
the effectiveness and efficiency of its operations is its financial condition," 
the audit said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1991-92 fiscal year, it noted, the budget for the office has 
decreased 2.4%, from $122.6 million to $119.6 million, resulting in the loss of 
51 positions for criminal attorneys. Current staffing, the audit said, has left 
the office with 7.8 prosecutors per 100,000 residents, compared to New York 
County, which includes Manhattan, which has 33.7 prosecutors per 100,000 
residents.

A TOUGH ROLL; L.A. SUMMER SCHOOL ATTENDANCE-KEEPING RULES TAX TEACHERS' TIME 
AND PATIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Taking classroom attendance during these dog days of summer school is a 
doggone mess, say teachers and clerks in Los Angeles schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Local and state education rules that are as confounding as a puzzle have 
turned the simple ritual of taking roll into a befuddling exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "My roll book looks like a jigsaw puzzle!" complained Stephanie Schwartz, an 
English teacher at Granada Hills High School. "The first week it took 30 
minutes of instruction time to do it. This is outta sight!" 
</P>
<P>
 Many frustrated teachers such as Schwartz say that the regulations force them 
to take roll four times in a single class period. As a result, they are 
spending an inordinate amount of time drawing and shading in tiny boxes in 
their roll books. 
</P>
<P>
 In school offices all over the Los Angeles Unified School District, spectacled 
clerks have been bent over their desks, trying to become hieroglyphics experts 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy has, however, managed to showcase the best in geometry teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The graphics don't bother me," quipped geometry and algebra teacher Ruth 
Hokinson, who proudly displayed her precision-scored book to the clerk at Eagle 
Rock High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Many say, however, that the new roll call practice is an example of 
"rules-driven" education policies that do little more than churn the wheels of 
bureaucracy at the expense of valuable classroom teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to sit at your desk all day and book-keep, this is fine" said an 
exasperated Barbara Goodwin, an Eagle Rock High School computer technology 
instructor, who loathes this manual operation. "It's not good if you want to 
get up and teach." 
</P>
<P>
 The record-keeping frenzy reached a peak Tuesday, which was designated as 
"norm day," the equivalent of an official district student census. Accurate 
student counts are tabulated on this day so that teacher slots and classes can 
be added or eliminated.  
</P>
<P>
 At Eagle Rock High School, Principal Beverley Clarkson, Assistant Principal 
Katharine Dustin and two office managers pored over the roll books, attempting 
to decipher the maze of marks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looks like this was a substitute teacher who couldn't figure it out," said 
Dustin, surveying the scrawls in one book. The marks were just as confusing 
when the regular teacher returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "And this teacher is a competent woman, extremely competent under normal 
circumstances," Dustin remarked. 
</P>
<P>
 The complexities of the policy are rooted in California's two largest 
education bureaucracies: the State Department of Education and the Los Angeles 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 The education department funds summer school based on hourly, not daily, 
attendance rates. Each hour and fraction of an hour must be accounted for. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school records have to be configured in a way to show that each kid has 
been in attendance for each hour," said John Gilroy, the state's attendance 
accounting specialist. "What we are talking about is creating a simple audit 
trail to substantiate their claims for money." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles school district decided to make summer school periods two 
hours and five minutes long this year to end the summer session a day earlier. 
School officials realized a bookkeeping nightmare loomed and sought a state 
waiver to relieve teachers from accounting for the final five minutes. No 
exceptions, the state said. 
</P>
<P>
 So the district devised a new roll call procedure, all of which must be 
recorded for each student each day within the confines of a quarter-inch box. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of the period the teacher takes roll. If a student is absent, a 
cross is made dividing the box into four eighth-inch square sections. 
</P>
<P>
 Roll is then taken three more times -- at the end of the first and second hour 
of class, and at the end of the five-minute fraction of the third hour. If a 
student is absent or leaves class at any point during those three time units, 
the teacher shades in a corresponding box. The fourth box is not to be touched. 
</P>
<P>
 "What?" said teacher union President Helen Bernstein. "This is dumb, dumb, 
dumb. . . . Couldn't anyone think of a way to make this easier? I know, why 
don't we just put a bar code strip on every kid and we can just scan their 
forehead four times a day."

CARJACKING SUSPECT FACES MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDMUND NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After hearing two women testify about an evening that began with Raymond Oscar 
Butler consuming two bottles of wine and Kool-Aid and ended in the 
execution-style murders of two college students in March, a Municipal Court 
magistrate Tuesday bound Butler over to Superior Court for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge James L. Wright, ruling that there was sufficient cause to find Butler, 
19, guilty of the double murders, scheduled arraignment for July 27 in Long 
Beach Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The two witnesses, one of them Butler's sister-in-law, testified in a 
preliminary hearing that they had spent the evening of March 25 with Butler, 
cruising the streets of San Pedro in a van. Both said he was in the supermarket 
parking lot where Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura were killed that evening. 
</P>
<P>
 A third witness testified that, while sitting in the back seat of her 
husband's car, she had seen Butler confront one of the victims, saying, "Don't 
make me hurt you. I have a gun." 
</P>
<P>
 Kristen Kielniarz said she then heard gunshots, though she could not see the 
shooting. She said she was "100% certain" that Butler was the assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler is charged with two counts of murder with the special circumstance of 
murder committed during robbery. He could face the death penalty if convicted. 
He also faces robbery and carjacking charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The murders have created shock waves in Japan, the home of the two victims, 
who were students at Marymount College. Japanese newspapers and television 
networks covered Tuesday's proceedings, as they had on Monday, and two 
representatives of the Japanese Consulate were present in the courtroom to 
monitor the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelli Waquan, married to Butler's half-brother, Tony Waquan, said that a group 
of four, including Butler and two other women, had stopped several times to buy 
Thunderbird wine and packs of Kool-Aid that evening as they drove around. 
Butler mixed the Kool-Aid with the wine and drank it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waquan, 27, said that, late in the evening, she had pulled her van into the 
parking lot of a Ralphs supermarket in San Pedro to buy more liquor, when 
Butler got out and began a conversation with Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura, who 
had parked nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler, holding a bottle of wine, inquired about Ito's Honda Civic, asking 
whether it had a stick shift. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing I knew, the Thunderbird (wine) was on top of the car and he 
had him (Ito) down on the ground," Waquan said. 
</P>
<P>
 As Butler got into the rear seat and forced Ito into the driver's seat, Waquan 
said, she drove the van out of the parking lot. "I said, 'I don't want any part 
of this, we're out of here,' " Waquan said. 
</P>
<P>
 As she left the parking lot, she said, she heard gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 Matsuura and Ito, both 19, were each killed with a single gunshot to the back 
of the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Irene Ruiz, 15, said that she had been lying in the rear of the van, having 
consumed a 40-ounce bottle of beer and a codeine pill earlier in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard commotion and talking (outside the van)," she said. "A couple of 
moments later, I heard gunshots, and Kelli said, 'My God, I can't believe he 
did that.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Janet Moore would not comment on a report that Butler had 
confessed after being arrested in March. She said only that he had made a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "To comment on the contents (of the statement) would be inappropriate at this 
time," she said.

WORLD CUP USA 1994; BOOST FOR BULGARIA; SOCCER UPSET PUTS OBSCURE EUROPEAN 
NATION ON THE MAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The phone has been ringing constantly at the Bulgarian American Cultural 
Society's makeshift office in the Los Feliz district since the Eastern European 
nation became the darling of the World Cup by beating the odds and reaching the 
tournament's Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can I get Bulgarian stamps?" one caller asked. "Do you have any extra 
Bulgarian coins?" asked another. "Just where is Bulgaria, anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
 Club President Nikola Tschamoff has stepped in as a local expert of sorts, 
providing tidbits about his homeland in the wake of its team's stunning win 
Sunday over defending soccer champion Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bulgaria has had a great history, but a very difficult history," he said in 
broken English, alluding to the country's struggle under Soviet domination. 
"This is definitely a boost for the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgarians in Los Angeles will gather in small, hopeful clusters today when 
the team -- which until this year had never won a World Cup match -- plays 
Italy in New Jersey for a chance to miraculously advance to Sunday's 
championship match in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Win or lose, Tschamoff said he's just happy the team has made it this far. The 
country of 9 million people, located between Romania and Turkey along the Black 
Sea, has finally stepped out of obscurity. It's been a long time coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the end of Moscow's 50-year domination in 1989, Bulgaria remains poor, 
with some families living on less than $10 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the team's strong showing will help the tourism and the trade," said 
Tschamoff, who runs the 150-member Bulgarian club out of his house. "Bulgaria 
doesn't have a great deal to be happy about. But this has made them very, very 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 And it has given Los Angeles' Bulgarian community, including many expatriates 
who fled as the Soviet Union took over in the late 1940s, a chance to finally 
cheer for their home team. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Nick Baikoushev, 64, a retired Hollywood painter, spent the 
afternoon in search of T-shirts and other World Cup paraphernalia. He and his 
friend George Tutundjiev, 70, nearly cleared out the Bulgarian section of a 
Hollywood Boulevard sporting goods store . 
</P>
<P>
 "We should be proud," said Baikoushev, who fled the country in 1948. "Nobody 
ever thought we would get this far. . . . I've waited a long, long time to 
cheer." 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, the Bulgarian Consulate in Los Angeles is planning a party for 
today's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, this is raising the awareness that Bulgaria is not some backwater 
country with nothing to bring to the world," said honorary Bulgarian Consul 
Latchezar Christov. "It shows we have good athletes and nice people who enjoy 
winning." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 1990 Census found that there were only 6,759 Bulgarian-born 
people living in the United States, Christov said he believes there are many 
others who trace their roots to Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Kantardjieff, 65 a retired Bank of America executive and Bulgaria 
native, said the game has provided a good excuse to see old friends from his 
early days in the United States. He's planning a party for about a dozen 
friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "This does bring everyone together," said Kantardjieff, who left Bulgaria in 
1949. "Everyone gets to feel the joy and the pride that this has finally 
happened."

CULTURE SHOCK; FOREIGN EXCHANGE STUDENTS FIND LIFE A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN SMALL 
TOWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a small world after all, Kin Sau Kwok discovered when she came to 
America. A small town, at least. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder the 18-year-old suffered a case of culture shock when she traveled 
from Hong Kong (population 7 million) to spend a year studying in Myrtle Point, 
Ore. (population 2,300). 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking I would end up in New York or Los Angeles when I first heard I 
was coming," she said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
 Kwok was among 800 teen-agers gathered Tuesday at El Segundo High School to 
end a year as AFS exchange students in communities across the western United 
States. As they waited for planes at nearby Los Angeles International Airport 
to take them home, there was time to exchange stories. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it small talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Downtown where I stayed was only a quarter-mile long," said Atthaphon 
Chantharasopha, who traded Uthai Thani, Thailand (population 200,000) for 
Globe, Ariz. (population 6,500). "They have a JCPenney store, one movie theater 
and a Woolworth's. I got sick of the cowboy music they listened to all the 
time. I wasn't sure I could make it a year there." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen-year-old Gregoire Strozzi swapped the French Riviera for 
Milton-Freewater, Ore. "My family there was lost in the country -- really 
isolated. After two weeks, I asked to change," he said of the community of 
2,006. 
</P>
<P>
 Danish student Dan Jakobsen, 17, lived in Willow Creek, Calif. (population 
1,000). "It was in the middle of nowhere," he said. "Everybody in town knew 
everybody. If you did anything wrong, like mispronounce words, everybody in 
town knew about it the next day." 
</P>
<P>
 Finnish student Anne Peravainio, 18, stayed in Round Mountain, Nev., an 
open-pit gold-mining town of 3,000 that is a five-hour drive from either Las 
Vegas or Reno.  
</P>
<P>
 Indonesian teen-ager Reny Soeroyo left her hometown of 1.5 million people to 
spend a year in compact Billings, Mont. "There weren't many places for 
teen-agers to hang out," said the 17-year-old. "I'd thought that cities in 
America were big. I guess that's the stereotypical view." 
</P>
<P>
 But it turns out that small towns are a big deal to those who welcome exchange 
students to the United States these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to find hosts in large cities where there's lots of apartment 
living and two-career couples," said Scott Ramey, a New York-based 
administrator for AFS, the nonprofit group that found U.S. homes for 2,800 
foreign students during the past school year. It also sent 2,600 American 
teen-agers abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tend to have bigger homes and extra beds in small towns. It's also 
more novel and exotic to have a foreign guest when you live there. There's more 
of a hospitality factor in small-town America." 
</P>
<P>
 Most students admitted that they ended up having a big time in their tiny 
towns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Myrtle Point was very peaceful. Oregon was very beautiful. I liked it," Kwok 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chantharasopha was voted Prom King at his 700-student high school and bought 
Western music CDs and a cowboy hat to take home with him Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Strozzi grew to like seeing cows and apple trees everywhere and has vowed to 
return to the Pacific Northwest someday. "I grew up a lot living there," he 
acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Jakobsen became a sports hero at his 280-pupil campus, winning varsity letters 
in football, basketball and track that he proudly wore home on his red Hoopa 
High letterman's jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 And 19-year-old Belgian student An Van Geem -- who says she came "expecting 
Beverly Hills 90210" but ended up living on a farm outside Gilroy, Calif. -- 
nodded knowingly when she encountered Gyula Knizse, 17, of Hungary. He spent 
the year living in Beverly Hills with a film studio vice president's family. 
</P>
<P>
 The family was great, Knizse said. "But Beverly Hills wasn't like a real 
American community. Money ruled Beverly Hills High -- students were snobby and 
arrogant. I really didn't make many friends there." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Geem said she had so much fun in Gilroy that she's returning there this 
winter to spend Christmas with her host family and friends.

SUPERVISORS OPPOSE INITIATIVE TARGETING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Weighing in on the volatile issue of illegal immigration, the Los Angeles 
County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to oppose a statewide ballot 
initiative that would deny many public services to undocumented residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's 3-2 vote, with Supervisors Mike Antonovich and Deane Dana 
dissenting, was an advisory motion that carries no force but sends an important 
political message. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotional topic attracted about two dozen supporters and opponents who 
sought to sway the board in a lively two-hour public debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial measure -- called "save our state" by its backers -- will 
appear on the Nov. 8 ballot as Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative would deny public education and emergency health care to 
illegal immigrants and their children. School and health officials would be 
required to report children and parents they suspect of being here illegally 
and law enforcement agencies would have to cooperate with the Immigration and 
Naturalization Service in finding illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters argued that the measure would force illegal immigrants to return to 
their homelands by cutting off social benefits they say act as a magnet. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no other country in the world that provides a free credit card for 
cradle-to-grave services as we do," said Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents called the measure mean-spirited and pointless. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't support illegal entry into the U.S., but the county of Los Angeles 
has a responsibility under federal law to provide services to those who present 
themselves for care," said Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke.

BILL BOYARSKY: CHOOSING THE JUDGE FOR THE SIMPSON TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With all of us waiting to see who's going to be the judge in the O.J. Simpson 
trial, I've been wondering what sort of person would be best suited for such a 
high-pressure job. 
</P>
<P>
 Gavel-to-gavel television coverage may make it sound like a great assignment. 
</P>
<P>
 It was for Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell, who presided over 
Simpson's preliminary hearing. She moved the proceedings along briskly and 
decisively. It was the judge -- not the contesting attorneys -- who found an 
important precedent to support the actions of police detectives who initially 
entered the Simpson estate without a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 But history shows that judging a hot case such as Simpson's, with the chance 
of making unpopular or incorrect calls, can hurt or even wreck a judicial 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles jurists still remember the story of late Superior Court Judge 
Alfred Gitelson, who, in 1970, ordered the Los Angeles schools to integrate. 
The same year, he was defeated in an election campaign where he was labeled the 
busing judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Gitelson's defeat changed the ground rules. Before, judicial reelection was 
just about automatic. Suddenly, frightened judges began mounting reelection 
campaigns, having to solicit contributions from attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Another judge involved in school integration, Paul Egly, resigned from the 
bench rather than subject himself to the degrading process. Recall attempts, 
hate mail and death threats had persuaded him he would have faced a tough and 
miserable fight. 
</P>
<P>
 And if anyone had forgotten Gitelson and Egly, there was the case of Judge 
Joyce A. Karlin to remind them. She was the judge who granted probation to a 
Korean American grocer who shot and killed a black teen-ager. After that 
decision she had to mount an expensive reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The shock of the Gitelson defeat lingers, 24 years later. That was evident 
when I talked to Robert M. Mallano, the Superior Court's presiding judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're aware of that," he said. "If you're in some case where the public has a 
strong feeling as to how it will come out and people will be angry if it 
doesn't come out the way they want, then it's kind of hard to ignore that 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, "You have to make the call you think is appropriate. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 To do that, Mallano said, a judge can't be overly sensitive. "You don't want 
someone with rabbit ears. You see on TV how you've got a bunch of lawyers 
commenting, law professors. They second-guess every ruling." 
</P>
<P>
 And the judge will have to be decisive. "Lawyers were asked (in a recent 
study) what attribute they thought was most important in a judge. The majority 
said decisiveness. That's the nature of our role. . . . You can't stop the 
trial and do an hour's research every time there is an objection. You'd never 
get done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even when a judge makes the popular decision, he can lose. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Hastings Law School Professor Joseph R. Grodin found that out when he was 
an associate justice on the same state Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice 
Rose Elizabeth Bird. Bird, Grodin and Reynosa were recalled by voters after a 
campaign based on the court's overturning of most death penalty cases that came 
before it. 
</P>
<P>
 Grodin told me Tuesday he had intended to affirm the death penalty in some 
upcoming cases but was reluctant to do so because "people would say I am doing 
that in order to retain my seat." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, he voted to uphold it in a case. "The opposition group held a 
press conference and said: 'We told you he was an unprincipled guy.' It 
wouldn't have mattered how I voted. . . . It takes a lot of stability and 
self-awareness for a judge to stay on even keel." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Mallano has given the job of choosing the Simpson trial judge to 
Supervising Judge Cecil Mills. Mills turned down a request for an interview. 
Instead, he referred me to an interview he'd given in May to Jean Guccione for 
California Lawyer magazine. When choosing a high-profile trial judge, he said, 
"you want to make sure they are not going to get rattled. And they have to 
remember little things, like not picking their noses. . . . The system is 
characterized by the one of us on the 6 o'clock news." 
</P>
<P>
 But as the stories of Gitelson, Egly, Karlin and Grodin show, deeper qualities 
will be needed. A court spokesperson said the trial judge is expected to be 
picked from an elite panel of nine judges who handle long, high-profile 
criminal trials. They've all felt the heat. I bet they won't all volunteer for 
this job.

CITY AGREES TO IMPROVE 911 SERVICE FOR THE DEAF; COMMUNICATIONS: SETTLEMENT 
WITH JUSTICE DEPARTMENT RESOLVES COMPLAINT FILED AFTER WOMAN USING TDD 
EQUIPMENT WAS UNABLE TO CALL FOR HELP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials reached a settlement Tuesday with the Justice Department 
requiring the city to improve its 911 emergency services for the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement resolves a formal complaint filed against the city for violating 
the Americans With Disabilities Act, which requires cities to ensure that their 
telephone emergency services provide access to individuals using 
telecommunication devices for the deaf, or TDDs. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint was filed after a 2-year-old child suffered a serious head 
injury. His mother, who is deaf, tried three times to reach the city's 911 
center by TDD before finally taking the boy to the hospital herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Access to 911 services has been a major problem for millions of Americans who 
are deaf, hard of hearing or who have speech impairments," said Deval L. 
Patrick, assistant attorney general for civil rights. "When a 911 call goes 
unanswered, it may mean the difference between life and death." TDD callers use 
regular phone lines to transmit typed messages to other TDD devices. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the settlement, the city pledged to upgrade its services to ensure that 
911 access for TDD users is as good as that for telephone users. The city will 
upgrade TDD-compatible equipment in its central dispatch office and install new 
equipment in its 27 other answering stations. A Justice Department official 
estimated that the equipment will cost the city $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The city agreed to train emergency dispatchers to operate TDDs and to require 
dispatchers to record TDD calls electronically in the same manner as voice 
telephone calls. City officials also must develop a public education program 
for TDD users seeking 911 service. 
</P>
<P>
 David Novak, a spokesman for Mayor Richard Riordan, said Tuesday evening that 
the improvements to 911 service were "important in a city as diverse as Los 
Angeles. It's 1994, and people are much more aware now of the need to be 
accessible to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 By signing the agreement, Los Angeles becomes the second city to be forced to 
comply with the disabilities act. Berkeley entered into a similar settlement in 
May. A Justice Department official said investigators believe most cities have 
not bought TDD answering equipment, and those that have do not train their 
dispatchers to use the devices. 
</P>
<P>
 "This agreement should serve as guidance for other large cities that are 
working to comply" with the act, Patrick said. "Individuals with disabilities 
have been paying for access to these services for many years, and it is time 
that this access is now provided." 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent to the mayors of 300 cities nationwide, Patrick notified 
municipal officials that "your telephone emergency services, including 911 
services, also must provide direct access to individuals who use TDDs," and he 
urged them to review their 911 answering technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about time," said Marcella M. Meyer, chief executive officer of the 
Greater Los Angeles Council for Deafness, speaking through a sign language 
interpreter. "I hope this will have a rippling effect on 911 services across 
the country. Someday, someone's going to really need it." 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer said a 911 dispatcher hung up last weekend on a TDD call from a deaf Los 
Angeles woman injured by a massive stroke.

TORRANCE TRUCK DRIVER HELD IN COCAINE CASE; CRIME: KHALED ALSAWAS, 43, WAS 
STOPPED IN TEXAS, ALLEGEDLY HAULING 8,000 POUNDS OF THE DRUG. FOUR OTHERS ARE 
ARRESTED AND TWO TRUCKING FIRM OWNERS ARE SOUGHT.

<P>
 A Torrance truck driver is in custody and the former owners of an Ontario 
trucking firm are on the run after federal agents and a drug-sniffing springer 
spaniel named Fred uncovered 8,000 pounds of cocaine in the back of a 
tractor-trailer truck west of Pecos, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug seizure culminated an eight-month undercover investigation by federal 
Drug Enforcement Administration agents into what DEA officials described as 
"one of the most significant drug trafficking organizations" in the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Khaled Alsawas, 43, a Torrance-based independent trucker, could face a life 
sentence without possibility of parole after his arrest Thursday. But a family 
member said Alsawas, the father of two young children, is "a hard-working 
family man" who "never messes with drugs" and did not know what he was carrying 
in the back of his truck. 
</P>
<P>
 But DEA agents say he did. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, federal arrest warrants have been issued for owners of a trucking 
company in El Paso -- Raul Orozco Sr. and his son Raul Orozco Jr. -- who 
federal agents say previously operated a trucking company in Ontario. Law 
enforcement officials believe the Orozcos masterminded the planned distribution 
of 12,000 pounds of cocaine smuggled into the United States at El Paso from 
Mexico, including the 8,000 pounds allegedly found in Alsawas' truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Four others were also arrested in the case, including Alberto Ochoa-Soto of 
Colombia, said by federal agents to be a primary connection between Colombian 
and Mexican drug cartels. 
</P>
<P>
 El Paso DEA Special Agent in Charge Travis B. Kuykendall said Alsawas drove 
his truck from Los Angeles to El Paso at the Orozcos' direction to pick up a 
shipment of drugs coming in from Mexico and transport it to New York. The drug 
shipment was under surveillance by federal agents even before it was taken 
across the border and then put into two trucks, including Alsawas'. 
</P>
<P>
 The second truck, bound for Chicago with about 4,000 pounds of cocaine, was 
seized in that city, Kuykendall said. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover DEA agents and Texas state troopers followed Alsawas' 18-wheel 
truck east on Interstate 20 until they were sure they were not being observed 
by counter-surveillance teams who would warn other members of the drug 
trafficking ring if the truck was stopped, Kuykendall said. Agents finally 
stopped the truck about 200 miles east of El Paso, near Pecos, and requested a 
canine unit from the 17-officer Pecos Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred, a 5-year-old springer spaniel, and his handler, Officer Chuck Sutlive, 
arrived shortly thereafter and found a 55-gallon drum containing cocaine in the 
back of the truck. Additional barrels of cocaine also were found among empty 
barrels in the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Alsawas was arrested and held in the county jail in Midland, Tex., on 
suspicion of possession of cocaine with the intent to distribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Beery said that because of the amount of drugs involved, Alsawas and the other 
defendants in the case could face life sentences without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Alsawas "is a victim of circumstances," said a man who answered the phone at 
Alsawas' home in Torrance and identified himself as Alsawas' brother-in-law. "I 
don't believe he knew what he was hauling."

REDEVELOPMENT ROLE IN QUAKE RECOVERY EXPLORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents and business owners hit hard by the Northridge quake could find 
themselves part of a redevelopment project by year's end, based on a Los 
Angeles City Council decision Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted unanimously to instruct the Community Redevelopment Agency 
to study the possibility of establishing emergency redevelopment areas where 
property taxes could be used to help rebuild neighborhoods and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities of Santa Monica, San Fernando and Santa Clarita have already turned 
to the redevelopment process for help in quake recovery. Redevelopment areas 
also were established in San Francisco after its 1989 Loma Prieta quake and in 
Coalinga after its 1983 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The size and location of the redevelopment areas in Los Angeles have yet to be 
decided, but nine council districts in the San Fernando Valley, Hollywood and 
South-Central Los Angeles will be studied. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members have already broached the idea to constituents during 
community hearings, but the city is moving cautiously, aware that redevelopment 
projects have long generated controversy and in some cases litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after Santa Clarita set up an earthquake redevelopment area, it was stung 
by two lawsuits from a local water agency that said the plan would siphon off 
tax dollars needed to repay water agency bonds and other debts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you talk about redevelopment, there are people who are vehemently 
opposed," said Erin Rodewald, press deputy for Los Angeles City Councilman John 
Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency provisions of the state's redevelopment law allow city 
redevelopment agencies to establish areas in disaster zones without the 
time-consuming environmental studies required to establish traditional project 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, local redevelopment agencies can keep all the additional 
property tax generated by new construction in a project area, then use that 
money for improvements such as new streets and sewers, and even loans for quake 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the proposal falls under state emergency provisions, such areas must 
be established quickly -- in this case by October or November. 
</P>
<P>
 But some people have already blasted the proposal, saying the emergency 
redevelopment areas will only lead to added bureaucracy and overspending on 
improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bureaucracy of the CRA makes whatever they do cost three times as much," 
said Mildred Weller, a longtime CRA critic and head of a North Hollywood 
marketing company. She also is vice chairwoman of the citizens advisory panel 
for the North Hollywood redevelopment project. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest fear among CRA critics is the agency's power to condemn and 
take over private property. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have stressed that under the quake proposal, those powers of 
eminent domain would be available only for seizing abandoned property or land 
that has become a nuisance, where the owner will not or cannot rebuild.

PASADENA VENDORS WANT CITY TO COVER LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pasadena city officials will begin settlement talks today with angry vendors 
at a Pasadena-backed soccer festival who are demanding that the city cover 
their losses from the monthlong event that has drawn small crowds and produced 
few sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Called Soccer Carnaval, the festival in Brookside Park near the Rose Bowl was 
supposed to combine soccer activities, crafts, entertainment, food and carnival 
rides. It was launched as a joint venture of the city and Pasadena Productions, 
a private company.  
</P>
<P>
 David Jacobs, interim general manager of the Rose Bowl, told vendors Tuesday 
that they would be able to individually discuss with city attorneys any 
settlements they think they are due.

QURESHEY NAMES HIS SUCCESSOR AT AST RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 AST Research Inc. announced Tuesday that co-founder Safi Qureshey has stepped 
down as president and will be succeeded by James T. Schraith. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the change will allow Qureshey, who has served as president 
since co-founding the computer company in 1980, to concentrate on strategic 
rather than day-to-day concerns. The 43-year-old Pakistani immigrant will 
remain as chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Schraith, who will also be chief operating officer, has held several positions 
with AST, most recently senior vice president for sales and service operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew J. Neff, an analyst for the brokerage Bear Stearns & Co. in New York, 
said Schraith will serve AST well as the company continues to grow. "They need 
more management, and they recognize the guy is doing a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 At 36, Schraith continues the company's custom of choosing youthful managers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited. I think the company has a great future," Schraith said in an 
interview Tuesday. He said he will focus on profitability and market share for 
Irvine-based AST, which is the nation's fifth-largest computer maker. In the 
short term, he said, there will be no major changes in operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Schraith, who was trained as an electronics technician, came to California 
from Milwaukee at age 20 to work as a field service engineer for Schlumberger 
Ltd., an oil field services company. He joined AST in 1987 as director of 
customer service and rose through the ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1993 he was the 92nd highest-paid executive among publicly held companies 
in Orange County, earning $595,067, according to corporate disclosure filings. 
The company would not say Tuesday what his new job will pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Qureshey credits Schraith with improving AST's sales in Japan and fostering 
teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim becomes my partner in moving the company forward," Qureshey said. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Tuesday's management changes, Chief Financial Officer Bruce C. 
Edwards becomes executive vice president. All of the changes are effective 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 AST was founded by Qureshey and two friends, Thomas Yuen and Albert Wong, to 
develop enhancements to IBM personal computers. The company subsequently 
developed its own line of PCs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite intense competition in recent years, AST has thrived by selling 
overseas, notably in China and other Asian nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The company reported earnings of $13.2 million for its latest fiscal quarter. 
Qureshey told analysts recently that he expects sales for 1994 to reach $2.4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's Nasdaq trading, AST's stock closed at $14.37.

TACO BELL SAYS DECISION TO STAY IN O.C. DOESN'T RULE OUT A MOVE LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI and GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taco Bell Corp.'s decision to keep its headquarters and 1,000 jobs in 
California is only a temporary arrangement that gives the company more time to 
evaluate its expansion needs and assess whether California is truly becoming 
friendlier to business, its chairman said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 John E. Martin, chief executive of the Mexican-style fast-food chain, did not 
rule out moving later to Texas or another state, declaring that the company 
will do whatever is "best or most practical." 
</P>
<P>
 "My hope would be that we'll be able to keep our core business here," he said. 
"But if the climate in California were to go south from a business perspective, 
then we'd look at our other options." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's comments came in his first interview since Taco Bell concluded a 
yearlong, nationwide search for a new headquarters site by declaring in June 
that it would stay in Irvine. The remarks signal that any prolonged celebration 
over the company's decision may be premature. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergency "red team" of government and business leaders who worked to 
persuade Taco Bell to stay has acknowledged that the fight isn't over. In a 
recent letter to Martin, team leader H. Fred Mickelson, a Southern California 
Edison executive, said that the team does not consider the company's decision 
to be a "done deal." Additional meetings with Taco Bell executives already have 
been scheduled, Mickelson said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain ended its nationwide search by signing a $41-million, 15-year lease 
at its current location that gives it options at each five-year interval to 
cancel the contract. That option, Martin said, gives the company the 
flexibility it wanted for its wait-and-see approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell has become a symbol for business owners who believe California 
public officials have driven companies out of state by their hostile attitude. 
The company's widely publicized search for a new home tested California's will 
to change that perception. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been a certain degree of arrogance in this state toward business," 
Martin said. The attitude for 20 years has been that "business needed the state 
a heck of a lot more than the other way around, that business was lucky to have 
the state." 
</P>
<P>
 But now legislators are recognizing that business carries an unfair burden, he 
said, and proposals such as a 6% tax credit for corporations building or 
expanding in California would help the state compete against aggressive, 
pro-business states such as Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Martin said, many still oppose providing any help to business. "Old 
habits die hard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What impressed Martin about Texas, Georgia and North Carolina -- states that a 
group of executives visited during the search -- was that their public 
officials appeared eager to work with companies to solve any problems that 
surface between government and industry. California, he said, is just getting 
to the point where officials are acknowledging that "maybe you aren't just a 
nuisance." 
</P>
<P>
 He credited Gov. Pete Wilson, Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, state Sen. Bill 
Lockyer (D-Hayward) and state Controller Gray Davis for leading efforts to make 
business more welcome in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Brown's 6% tax-credit bill that helped to turn Taco Bell, which had 
been offered a $10-million package of incentives from Texas, back toward 
California. The bill was defeated in committee but Lockyer expanded it and will 
try to get a version adopted soon. Martin said  
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a victory or a defeat for anyone," Martin said. "This has been a 
business trying to make a business decision. We tried to balance all the 
factors. In the end, there still were pluses and minuses." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, he said, the state Legislature has to pass some meaningful tax 
relief and top public officials have to commit themselves working "on the same 
side of the fence" with business to solve their mutual problems and halt the 
flight of business to other states. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also had not decided what kind of headquarters structure it 
wanted. It had started the process of thinking about its space needs three 
years ago when it simply had Taco Bell outlets. But last year, as it secretly 
began its relocation search, it acquired Chevys, a Mexican-style, casual 
restaurant chain based in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chevys purchase, top executives realized, threw their headquarters plans 
into a quandary. The company already had five other lines of business, most of 
it centered on Taco Bell, but knew the company would develop other kinds of 
restaurants in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives weren't sure whether they wanted to consolidate operations under 
one roof or in nearby offices, or leave each division and subsidiary at its own 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where our corporate headquarters is located is part of how we do business, 
but it's our business that drives what we do," Martin said. So in the next few 
years, he said, the company will evaluate its needs and determine whether to 
consolidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Real estate developers in Orange County and in the Dallas-Fort Worth area 
certainly sensed that the company didn't know what it wanted. Some griped that 
Taco Bell used the entire search process to help it figure out what it wanted, 
reviewing sites, rejecting them and reconsidering them again. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin would not talk about specific sites, negotiations or the lease, but he 
understood the frustrations of the developers because he and his executives 
were frustrated with the deals that kept coming their way. The deals didn't 
meet their needs, but the company kept refining its needs. Still, he said, the 
company evaluated each proposal, as well as deals that builders resubmitted, 
but couldn't wait much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't hold the company hostage," he said. Walking through the corporate 
offices or using the elevator, Martin said, he often ran into employees who 
would ask him whether the headquarters would be relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that probably touched me the most were the people who described how 
much they loved working for Taco Bell and were afraid that if we moved they 
couldn't move," he said. "We needed to take the amount of time that was 
required to do the right thing, but on the other hand, putting our people 
through this was not something we enjoyed."

FINANCIAL MARKETS; BOND YIELDS EASE ON INFLATION NEWS

<P>
 Treasury bond yields fell back Tuesday after the government reported no change 
in wholesale prices in June. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stock market remained stymied by the falling dollar, which set another 
50-year low against the Japanese yen. Key stock indexes were mixed for the day, 
with the Dow Jones industrials off 0.33 point to 3,702.66. 
</P>
<P>
 In positive news, the Labor Department said wholesale prices held steady in 
June and even fell 0.1% when the volatile food and energy sectors are excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists had predicted a rise in the overall producer price index of 0.3% 
and a gain in the core rate of 0.2%. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta also 
reported minimal pricing pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields, which have been surging in recent weeks, dropped modestly on the 
inflation reports. The 30-year Treasury bond closed at 7.68%, down from 7.73% 
on Monday, and shorter-term yields were also lower. 
</P>
<P>
 But the sinking dollar continued to raise the specter of another Fed hike in 
short-term rates. Higher rates would tend to support the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar fell as low as 96.55 yen Tuesday in New York, before recovering to 
97.50, off from 97.75 on Monday. It also fell against the German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 For the stock market, the dollar's weakness dampened the impact of the 
inflation report and some solid second-quarter corporate earnings reports. 
During the day, the Dow industrials slid more than 30 points before recovering 
in late trading. 
</P>
<P>
 A surprisingly good earnings report from Motorola sent that stock sharply 
higher and helped technology issues in general, but the improved mood there 
failed to spread to the rest of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the dollar, "we could have had a bang-up day," said Bill Allyn, an 
analyst at Jefferies & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's sitting on their hands, waiting to see what the Fed does," said 
Tony Dwyer, chief strategist at Sherwood Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Motorola leaped 5 1/4 to 50 on its earnings report. The semiconductor and 
cellular phone giant said late Monday that its second-quarter profit jumped 64% 
to 63 cents a share, from 40 cents a year earlier, on sharply higher sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other technology stocks also rallied. Apple rose 1 3/8 to 28 3/8, Adobe 
Systems leaped 2 to 30 1/4, Cabletron Systems rose 3 3/8 to 106, Lotus 
Development gained 2 to 39 7/8 and Powersoft was up 2 1/2 to 54 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite Motorola's gains, other semiconductor stocks came under pressure 
after the June book-to-bill report on industry demand fell to 1.08 from 1.13 in 
May. Advanced Micro Devices slipped 1/4 to 26 3/4 and Cirrus Logic shed 3/4 to 
32 1/4. Intel rose 1/64 to 60 1/8, recovering from a session low of 59. 
</P>
<P>
 * Other earnings reports weren't received as well as Motorola's. Philip Morris 
fell 3/4 to 53 1/8 after the company reported net income of $1.42 per share in 
the second quarter, compared to $1.19 a year ago. The earnings were about on 
target with analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodyear declined 1 3/4 to 35 after the tire maker said its second-quarter 
earnings would be below analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott Labs declined 2 1/8 to 26 7/8 after saying Monday that its 
second-quarter profit totaled 46 cents a share, up from 42 cents in the 
year-ago quarter and 1 cent below analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham Steel fell 1 5/8 to 26 3/4 after the company lowered its 
fourth-quarter earnings estimate to about 30 cents a share after saying just 
last week that it could earn 40 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, London's FTS-100 index closed down 19.9 points at 2,963.9. Dollar 
worries were blamed. The Frankfurt DAX index lost 17.61 points to 2,048.05. 
</P>
<P>
 Other European markets were also lower, especially Zurich, which was affected 
by a Roche Holdings drop of 5.6% after the Swiss drug company reported a small 
increase in first-half sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo stocks ended slightly down after another day of directionless trade. The 
Nikkei-225 average ended off 72.61 points at 20,400.48. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index eased 3.72 points to 2,288.28. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong shares closed sharply higher on a technical rebound following a 
recent selloff. The blue chip Hang Seng Index was up 196.51 points to close at 
8,591.45. 
</P>
<P>
 In U.S. commodity trading, coffee prices soared again on estimates that up to 
60% of Brazil's 1995-96 coffee crop may have been ruined by two bouts of 
freezing temperatures over the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two of the world's largest coffee roasters, Philip Morris' Kraft 
General Foods and Nestle, were rumored to have bought a large quantity of 
Colombian coffee to cover their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 September coffee futures advanced 11.45 cents to $2.47 a pound at the Coffee, 
Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 In energy trading, August crude oil futures, extending Monday's 70-cent rise, 
jumped another 25 cents to $20.43 a barrel amid continued concerns about a 
Nigerian oil workers strike.

PEOPLE: JUDY MCGRATH WILL SOLO AS MTV'S PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Judy McGrath has been named sole president of the Music Television cable 
channel with the departure of Sara Levinson. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath and Levinson have shared the title of president, with McGrath 
overseeing creative matters and Levinson in charge of the business end. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath, formerly president and creative director, will be in charge of all of 
MTV's business and creative affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Levinson is leaving MTV to become president of NFL Properties, the National 
Football League's licensing and merchandising operation. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath will continue to report to MTV Networks Chairman and Chief Executive 
Tom Freston. She has been a key developer of MTV programming, which has 
expanded the network's licensed products, television syndication, home video, 
music retailing, video game and film production businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Freston said MTV executives were surprised to learn that Levinson was leaving. 
He credited her with projects such as the development of Nickelodeon Studios in 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 "She did a great job for three years. (McGrath and Levinson) both made it work 
to their credit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Freston also credited McGrath with furthering the network's "pro-social 
agenda" through efforts such as its 1992 "Choose or Lose" political awareness 
campaign. "She sets the tone and environment around here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among McGrath's current projects is an animated program, "The Brothers Grunt." 
She will also help introduce two music channels in Asia, one broadcast in 
English and the other in Mandarin Chinese. JAMES BATES

IN DEVELOPMENT: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; DIGITAL 
BACK-SEAT DRIVER WILL TALK YOU THERE

 Auto navigation systems that display maps and directions have been showing up 
in high-priced cars for several years. Aside from cost, the main drawback of 
these digital maps is that they require drivers to take their eyes off the road 
to continually glance at the map. 
</P>
<P>
 But AudioNav, developed by Burbank-based Amerigon Inc. and scheduled for 
release later this year, allows you to literally tell the system where you want 
to go and receive voice directions on how to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 AudioNav, about the size of a VHS videotape, connects to a car's compact disc 
player and carries on its dialogue with the driver using a microphone on the 
visor and the car's stereo speakers. The dialogue, map and programs are 
recorded on CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver spells street names or the names of landmarks related to his 
current location and ultimate destination. Using voice-recognition software, 
AudioNav identifies the place names on a map and plots the fastest route. It 
then reads back directions. Car audio system manufacturers Eclipse/Fujitsu Ten 
and Clarion plan to offer the AudioNav systems, which are expected to retail 
for $500 to $600.

 Virtual Science Center: Despite its name, the Weizmann Institute of Science's 
new BioMOO biology center has nothing to do with genetically engineered cows. 
MOO stands for Multiple-user dimension, Object Oriented and was coined to 
describe a multiple-user computer game. 
</P>
<P>
 But scientists who visit BioMOO aren't playing games. They are participating 
in the first major effort to use a virtual environment for day-to-day science 
and science communications established by the Weizmann Institute in Rehovot, 
Israel. When you log into BioMOO, which can be accessed via the Internet, you 
can type "who" to find out who else is on the premises and where. 
</P>
<P>
 Want to find a fellow biologist working on glycosphingolipids? Leave a note on 
the bulletin board. To share the results of a research project, invite others 
to visit your lab. To discuss a key scientific paper, post a date, time and 
place and see who shows up at your seminar. BioMOO has more than 700 registered 
members.

 Foiling Aphids: It might one day be a common sight for motorists along 
Interstate 5 to see painted silver farmland stretching into the distance. In a 
study to find new methods of preventing aphid attacks on crops, University of 
California entomologists have found that reflection works where insecticides 
don't.  
</P>
<P>
 For plants that are highly susceptible to aphid-carried viruses that stunt 
growth, the discovery could lead to the first effective deterrent to aphids. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that when an aphid is flying along looking for a landing spot, it 
cues off the reflection coming from plant surfaces. If an aphid sees a 
reflection of the sky, say in silver paint or a strip of aluminum foil, it 
won't land. 
</P>
<P>
 Foil is an effective solution for back-yard gardeners. But it would be 
prohibitively expensive for commercial growers, and researchers are doing a 
three-year study of the effectiveness of spraying water-based silver paint on 
planting beds. When the crop is finished, the paint can be plowed under with no 
harmful effects.

 Making Star Light, Star Bright: The technology available to scan the heavens 
has advanced to such a degree that astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology are 
said to be in a golden age of discovery. But advances in visual power are also 
bringing new technical challenges. One of the most formidable is the distortion 
caused by the Earth's atmosphere on the captured image. 
</P>
<P>
 To correct distortions, astronomers are working with adaptive optics to 
restore light to its original condition. Adaptive optics use a bright object 
above the distorting layers of atmosphere, along with sensors that detect and 
measure the distortion. By utilizing a small, computer-controlled corrective 
mirror, the image can be repeatedly adjusted to cancel out atmospheric 
blurring. 
</P>
<P>
 The corrected imaging not only provides greater detail, it also enables 
telescopes to detect faint objects by compressing the light. To produce a 
bright source near the object under study, one proposal is to create an 
artificial "star" made with lasers. Scientists at Hawaii's Keck Observatory say 
the technology may be ready by late 1997. KATHLEEN WIEGNER

COMPUTER FILE / RICHARD O'REILLY: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; EASIER 'ACCESS' TO YOUR DATABASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD O'REILLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many years, Microsoft Corp. lacked any database program to go with its 
strong offerings in other software categories such as word processing, 
spreadsheets, programming languages and, of course, operating systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it has two of the leading relational database programs: newly released 
Access 2.0 and Foxpro 2.6 versions for DOS and Windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Microsoft bought Foxpro, then a DOS-only program, a couple of years ago, while 
it continued developing Access in-house as its premier Windows database. The 
first version of Access didn't reach that goal, but with version 2.0, Access 
achieves a level of excellence comparable to Microsoft's Word for Windows 6.0 
word processor and Excel 5.0 spreadsheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Access 2.0 surpasses Foxpro for Windows in many ways, including speed, ease of 
use, flexibility, screen and report formatting and overall compatibility with 
other Windows applications. 
</P>
<P>
 I was amazed at how much faster Access 2.0 could select or summarize data than 
Foxpro for Windows -- nearly three times faster on a complex query and as much 
as 10 times faster when selecting a simple subset of data. Neither database, 
containing identical data, was indexed, and these were by no means exhaustive 
tests. But repeated tests yielded the same results. 
</P>
<P>
 Any of the major relational database programs sold these days can be used to 
run a business. But with most of the programs, that is true only after an 
expert user has designed and developed the various databases required, such as 
one to track customers, one for inventory, one for entering orders, one for 
shipping, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage of Microsoft Access 2.0 is the way it simplifies tasks that are 
difficult to conceptualize. One example is the creation of multiple tables to 
store related information and then linking the tables so they can work 
together. That is the essence of a relational database, and it is much easier 
to understand when you can actually see it happen in the diagrams that Access 
produces on its screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Another example is retrieving data from multiple linked tables, which is also 
accomplished graphically in a diagram-like fashion that makes it easy to 
visualize what is happening. Not only can you physically retrieve the 
information you seek from your databases, you can also understand how it's 
done. Armed with that knowledge, you can begin to think of other ways to use 
the data you already have.  
</P>
<P>
 An important ease-of-use feature of Microsoft Access is the way it stores all 
of the objects of a database -- the data tables, data entry forms, report 
forms, query definitions, etc. -- in a single file. Nothing gets lost because 
you inadvertently put it in some other directory. It also means that all of 
those objects can have descriptive names because they aren't separate files 
limited to eight-character names. 
</P>
<P>
 You can store any kind of data in an Access database, including pictures, 
graphs, sounds and any other object that can be created in a Windows program 
equipped for what Microsoft calls OLE, which stands for object linking and 
embedding. Of course, you can also store more traditional data -- numbers, 
dates, times and documents up to 64,000 characters long, each in special memo 
fields.  
</P>
<P>
 The program gives you a high degree of control over how numbers are stored, 
including a special currency data type that eliminates rounding errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, you have control over how numbers and other data are displayed, 
both as they are entered -- telephone numbers can have parentheses and dashes 
added automatically -- and as they are displayed later in screen forms and 
printed reports. 
</P>
<P>
 As in other Microsoft programs, Access 2.0 is loaded with "wizards," which are 
pre-programmed methods of doing complex tasks such as setting up tables or 
designing queries, forms and reports. These are excellent and often allow you 
to quickly achieve a much better result than if you tried to do it using menus 
and dialogue boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, once you get brave enough to tackle the manual ways of designing 
queries, forms and reports, you'll find that Access 2.0 provides virtually 
unlimited control over what you can accomplish. It really is a tinkerer's 
delight. 
</P>
<P>
 Access makes heavy use of tool bars that display a series of graphic icons 
representing the various tasks that can be performed. One of the most difficult 
parts of learning the program is learning how to navigate these tool icons. 
They change depending on where you are in the program. However, pointing at 
them with the cursor will display an identifying label near the icon and a 
longer description at the bottom of the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 An Access database is a collection of "objects" whose properties you can 
define, from the size and font of its type to the way it behaves in relation to 
other objects. Some of the lists of possible properties are astonishingly long. 
Fortunately, you can often leave properties the way the program automatically 
sets them, or change just one or two to get the customization you are seeking. 
</P>
<P>
 The task of retrieving information from an Access database is done with 
"queries," and Access makes them easier to design than in many other programs. 
Once you understand the way the query design grid works, you can easily specify 
complex data selections, including calculation of new data such as totals, 
averages and counts, based on the data being selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Foxpro remains a good choice for someone with a legacy of dBASE or compatible 
application programs, because its data structure and programming language are 
similar. But if you're just getting started in databases, Access 2.0 will give 
you much more sophisticated-looking results with much less effort. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you want to tackle all the work of converting from another database 
program, Access 2.0 has excellent import capabilities for Foxpro, dBASE, 
Paradox, Btrieve and SQL databases.

PACIFIC MUTUAL OKS MERGER FOR GIANT BROKERAGE; INVESTMENTS: FIVE SUBSIDIARIES 
OF THE NEWPORT BEACH INSURER AND A CONNECTICUT GROUP WILL MANAGE $70 BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Thomson Advisory Group L.P. said Tuesday 
that they have signed a final agreement to merge Thomson and five of Pacific 
Mutual's investment management subsidiaries into one of the world's largest 
investment companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined businesses, to be named Pimco Advisors L.P., will manage assets 
of nearly $70 billion. The companies said they expect a Sept. 30 completion of 
the merger, which was originally announced in March. 
</P>
<P>
 A new partnership between Newport Beach-based Pacific Mutual and its Pacific 
Investment Management Co. subsidiary is scheduled to become general partner of 
Pimco Advisors after obtaining a controlling interest in the present general 
partner, Thomson Advisory Group Inc. in Stamford, Conn., for $125 million. 
</P>
<P>
 William D. Cvengros, now vice chairman of Pacific Mutual, would leave that 
post to become the chief executive officer of Pimco Advisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomson officials said Tuesday that as part of the deal they would issue 
300,000 new shares to Thomson investors, or unit holders, as a special 3% 
dividend. The dividend will be worth about $5 million a year through 1997 to 
the company's public investors because their cash dividend payments will rise 
to $3.75 per unit each year from $2.60 paid in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Mutual and its investment managers will control about 81% of the 
combined business, which would have a market value of about $1.24 billion based 
on the price of Thomson's existing units, which closed up $2 on the New York 
stock exchange Tuesday at $38.785. Pacific Mutual Life is not publicly traded. 
</P>
<P>
 The merger will give Pacific Mutual's investment divisions a network of 
brokers to sell investments to the public. Those divisions have typically 
handled investments for large, outside investors, such as pension funds and 
corporations. The combination of the Pacific Mutual and Thomson divisions will 
create the nation's sixth-largest financial management company. 
</P>
<P>
 The consolidation will place three Thomson Advisory Group L.P. businesses -- 
Columbus Circle Investors, Thomson Fund Group and Thomson Investor Services -- 
with the Pacific Mutual investment management businesses in the new Pimco 
Advisors L.P. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Mutual subsidiaries involved are Pacific Investment Management 
Co., Newport Beach; Cadence Capital Management Corp., Boston; NFJ Investment 
Group, Dallas; Parametric Portfolio Associates, Seattle; and Blairlogie Capital 
Management Ltd., Edinburgh, Scotland.

COUNTY HOME SALES UP 26% IN 2ND QUARTER; REAL ESTATE: HOUSING DEVELOPERS 
ATTRIBUTE PROMISING FIGURES TO 'TYPICAL JUNE SWOON.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 In another sign of new vigor in the Orange County real estate market, 
second-quarter sales of new and existing homes jumped more than 26% from the 
same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW REDI Property Data reported Tuesday that 10,205 homes were sold from April 
through June, compared to 8,099 homes sold during the second quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The significance of these numbers is a continuation of a healthier market 
we've seen so far this year," said Nima Nattagh, an analyst with the 
Riverside-based real estate data firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Local housing developers, however, were not especially enthusiastic about the 
second-quarter figures, noting that home sales are typically strongest during 
the summer months and predicting that higher interest rates will depress 
housing sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "These numbers show your typical June swoon," said Tom Martin, vice president 
of sales and marketing for Coto de Caza, a large master-planned community in 
south Orange County. "Higher interest rates are making everyone skittish. I 
think housing sales will stay about the same for the rest of the year, and then 
we will have an strong first quarter of 1995." 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 3,588 single-family homes and condominiums closed escrow, the highest 
number of sales since June, 1991, when 3,771 homes sold, according to TRW 
figures. "It's going well, but we're still well below the market activity we 
had in 1988 and 1989," Nattagh said. "I don't think we will get back to that 
for the near future." 
</P>
<P>
 So, though sales are up, housing prices will remain soft, Nattagh predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Agid, president of the Marketing Department, a real estate firm in 
Irvine, agreed that rising interest rates will likely keep home sales fairly 
level for the rest of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This market is not coming to a boil," Agid said. "It's just been put on 
simmer. But the heat will gradually increase, and before we know it, it will be 
better."

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: NEWPORT SYSTEMS BOUGHT BY SAN JOSE FIRM IN $95-MILLION 
DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Jose company that makes software to connect computer systems has bought 
Newport Systems Solutions, a 55-employee firm involved in the same kind of 
business, in a deal valued at $95 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisco Systems Inc. agreed to acquire all of the Newport Beach company's 
outstanding stock and assume all outstanding employee stock options and 
warrants in exchange for 4.2 million shares.The transaction value is based on a 
closing price of Tuesday of $22.75, down $1, in trading on the Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 A Cisco spokesman said that all of Newport System's employees are expected to 
be retained. He said the company, which specializes in computer linkages at 
small- and medium-sized companies, has a lean staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport President Larry Stephenson would become a Cisco vice president and 
general manager of Newport under the sale, which is subject to approval by 
boards of directors of both companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Newport was the obvious choice for us to acquire," said John Chambers, Cisco 
executive vice president. "In our opinion, they are the clear market and 
technology leader for access products in small- to medium-sized networks, and 
are the type of company that can substantially enhance our market position."

NEWBURY OAKS PULLS PLUG ON SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Newbury Oaks, which won the American Legion baseball World Series in 1992, has 
folded because of lack of players and financial support, Coach Joel Silverstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Oaks, which includes players from Thousand Oaks and Newbury Park high 
schools, played its final games Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The team began a doubleheader against Santa Barbara with 10 players and 
finished with nine because one left for work, Silverstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the games, Silverstein tried to get commitments from players for games 
this week. Realizing that only eight players might have been available for some 
games, he decided to call it quits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real disappointing for me and three or four of the kids," Silverstein 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "They made a big commitment and they gave up a lot of stuff. But to the 
others, it's just something to do in the summer with all the other stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem was money, Silverstein said. Because Newbury Oaks is not 
sponsored by an American Legion post, all funds come from the players and 
coaches. Silverstein said the cost of uniforms, equipment, umpires and 
insurance for a season is about $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he asked for $150 from each of the 15 players who originally comprised 
the team, but only nine paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put several hundred dollars of my own money in," Silverstein said, "but 
with the lack of commitment we had, I wasn't going to put any more of my money 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 District 16 Commissioner Joe Grodell said Newbury Oaks (10-5) will forfeit its 
remaining nine games. Newbury Oaks was formed in 1991 from graduated players at 
Newbury Park and Thousand Oaks highs. The Newbury Park and Conejo Valley Legion 
teams use only players returning to high school. Newbury Oaks won the 1992 
American Legion World Series in Fargo, N.D.

OLYMPIC FESTIVAL MARKED START OF COMPETITIONS; GAMES: TOP NATIONAL AND 
INTERNATIONAL EVENTS ARE JUST AROUND THE CORNER FOR MANY LOCAL ATHLETES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The Olympic Festival slogan was "Gateway to the Gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Gateway to the Games might have been more appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Olympic Games in Atlanta still are two years away, top national and 
international competition is just around the corner for many Festival athletes, 
including several from the Valley and Ventura County regions. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's biggest games: The Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Already set for the Goodwill Games, which begin July 23 in St. Petersburg, 
Russia, are canoe paddlers Joe Harper and David Spaulding of Ventura, boxer 
Lance Whitaker of San Fernando and team handball utility man Denny Fercho of 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper and Spaulding, who learned how to paddle in Ventura Harbor, are among a 
contingent of nine Americans that will compete when flat-water spring canoe 
racing makes its Goodwill Games debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, a 1984 St. Bonaventure High graduate, won three silver medals at last 
year's sprint national championships. Spaulding, a 1984 Buena High graduate, 
was a 1992 Olympian. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker, a former San Fernando High basketball player, is U.S. champion in 
the super-heavyweight classification. 
</P>
<P>
 Fercho, a Rio Mesa High graduate, is in his second stint on the U.S. handball 
squad. James Hop, another Camarillo resident, would be making the trip had he 
not sustained a serious knee injury on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 When they return from the Goodwill Games, Harper and Spaulding will 
participate in the sprint national championships, Aug. 9-13 in Indianapolis, 
along with Jim Werland, another paddler from Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper and Spaulding will compete in the World Championships, Sept. 21-25, in 
Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker, who is in only his second full year of training, would be joined at 
the Goodwill Games by Fernando Vargas of Oxnard, but Vargas isn't old enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, the U.S. amateur champion at 132 pounds, is 16. Boxers must be 17 to 
compete internationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas earned a gold medal at the Olympic Festival by handily winning both of 
his bouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, by sport, is a look at the plans of other local Festival athletes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Baseball: Randy Wolf, a left-handed pitcher from El Camino Real High, has 
been selected to the 18-player U.S. junior national team. 
</P>
<P>
 The squad, which has been practicing in Joplin, Mo., since the conclusion of 
the Olympic Festival, leaves today for Tyler, Tex., where it will play games 
against teams from Australia, Mexico and East Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will take part in the Junior World Baseball Championships at Brandon, 
Manitoba, Canada, July 21-31. 
</P>
<P>
 * Diving: Nancy Janik and Ricky Wood, both from Simi Valley, begin competition 
today in the World Diving Trials at the St. Peter's Rec-Plex, near St. Louis. 
Janik and Wood both are participating in the one-meter and three-meter 
springboard events. 
</P>
<P>
 * Field hockey: Larry Amar and Taylor Trickle of Camarillo, Jeff Horrocks of 
Newbury Park, David Finkel of Thousand Oaks and Ben Maruquin of Ventura have 
been selected to the U.S. senior national team, which will train at the 
University of North Carolina, July 25-Aug. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team will participate in a four-team international tournament in 
Toronto, Aug. 4-7, then move to Madison, N.J., for a five-team international 
tournament, Aug. 10-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other area athletes are expected to be named to the U.S. junior 
national team that will play in an international tournament in Great Britain, 
Aug. 16-28. The squad will be announced later this week. 
</P>
<P>
 * Swimming: Nicole Beck, Rebecca Gilman and Mandy Walz of Ventura, Jennifer 
Parmenter of Granada Hills, Erin Schatz of Agoura Hills and John Jenkins of La 
Crescenta will compete in the senior long-course nationals, Aug. 14-19, in 
Indianapolis.  
</P>
<P>
 The top two finishers in each event will qualify to swim in the World 
Championships, Sept. 5-11 in Rome. Third and fourth-place finishers are likely 
to compete in the Pan American Games, March 12-17 in Mar del Plata, Argentina, 
near Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 * Table tennis: Anita Zakaryan of Glendale is a member of the U.S. team that 
will take part in the World Team Cup, Oct. 12-16, in France. Zakaryan is ranked 
fourth in the nation among women singles players. 
</P>
<P>
 * Ania Bleszynski of Thousand Oaks will play in the girls 18-and-under 
nationals, Aug. 7-13, in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 Bleszynski, a Stanford-bound Harvard-Westlake High graduate, won the Olympic 
Festival gold medal in singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Meilen Tu, coming off her impressive victory in the Surbiton Junior 
Championships in London on grass, is considered one of the favorites in the 
tournament. Tu, 16, from Northridge, was ranked fourth among singles players at 
the end of last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Racquetball: Tony Jelso of Woodland Hills will compete in the U.S. National 
Doubles Championships in Jacksonville, Fla., Oct. 18-22. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning team at nationals qualifies for the U.S. Pan-American team.

SURPRISE BID DERAILS QVC MERGER WITH CBS; COMMUNICATIONS: CABLE TV FIRM 
COMCAST, WHICH HELPED FOUND THE HOME SHOPPING NETWORK, RAISES ANTE TO $2.2 
BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS and JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a dramatic move, a key shareholder Tuesday pulled the rug out from under 
QVC Chairman Barry Diller's plan to sell the home shopping network to CBS Inc., 
where Diller was to become chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast Corp., the Philadelphia-based cable TV company that helped found QVC, 
announced that it is willing to buy all of QVC's outstanding shares for $2.2 
billion, or a 22% premium over Tuesday's closing price. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry executives said the Comcast bid will derail the CBS-QVC merger unless 
CBS sweetens its offer to QVC shareholders. In explaining their surprise bid, 
Comcast executives said they are motivated by a long-term strategy to 
participate more fully in cable TV programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the CBS transaction goes through, we're a disenfranchised investor," said 
Julian Brodsky, Comcast's vice chairman, in a telephone interview. As a cable 
TV company, Comcast would be forced by federal rules to limit its voting stock 
to less than 5%, and it would be prevented from even serving on the CBS board. 
</P>
<P>
 Diller, who lost a bruising, six-month battle for Paramount Communications 
earlier this year, issued a statement late Tuesday saying: "All the ironies 
aside, I said at the outset that if someone else wanted to bid for QVC, we 
would, of course, deal with it. And we will, with the only consideration being 
the best interests of the QVC shareholder." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street and Hollywood executives saw more than a little irony in Comcast's 
move, since it was Comcast President Brian L. Roberts who hotly pursued Diller 
to run the company two years ago. Said one high-level observer: "Brian Roberts 
has worshiped at the feet of Barry Diller for the past two years. . . . This 
has got to be political." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike CBS's all-stock proposal, the Comcast offer would provide QVC 
shareholders with considerable cash. For each share of QVC, Comcast is offering 
$37 in cash and $7 of a new series of Comcast convertible preferred stock. 
Since Comcast already owns 8.6 million of QVC's 39.2 million shares, the 
acquisition would cost Comcast about $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation swirled over CBS Chairman Laurence A. Tisch's next move, as 
analysts and industry executives debated whether he will fight to win QVC or 
its highly respected chairman. One unconfirmed report had the network 
withdrawing as early as today.  
</P>
<P>
 Alan Kassan, an analyst at Morgan Stanley in New York, said Diller could 
decide to take his profits from a QVC stock sale and accept a lucrative 
employment package at CBS, along the lines of the deal enjoyed by Walt Disney 
Co. Chairman Michael D. Eisner, for example. Or CBS could decide to "tweak the 
offer" to include some cash or greater value to QVC shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere on Wall Street, the reaction was mixed. "I don't like it," said 
Jessica Reif, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. "The value of QVC 
with CBS is so much greater than as a stand-alone" company. Moreover, Reif 
noted, "the real question is what Tele-Communications Inc. is going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But John Tinker, an analyst with Furman Selz in New York, was more upbeat. "If 
you believe in electronic retailing, it makes all the sense in the world," he 
said. Tinker noted that Comcast faces competition for cable TV subscribers from 
Bell Atlantic, the Philadelphia-based Baby Bell, and wants to control as much 
of the programming as possible. "Control of content is king," Tinker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both TCI, the large Denver-based cable TV operator, and Comcast own about 17% 
of QVC's common stock. TCI, however, would incur huge capital gains tax taxes 
if the company is sold. A source close to Comcast said there may be ways to 
minimize the impact. A TCI spokesman declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the players involved in the QVC battle could come face to face 
today, since they are coincidentally set to convene in Sun Valley, Idaho, for 
the annual blue-chip investment conference sponsored by Herbert Allen Jr. of 
Allen & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Acquiring the shares it did not already own would be the second big deal in 
less than a month for Comcast. In June, the cable operator won an auction to 
acquire the U.S. cable systems owned by Canadian-based McClean Hunter Ltd. for 
$1.27-billion. The deal, which would give Comcast 550,000 cable subscribers, 
would make it the third largest cable operator in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview from New York, where the QVC board will convene today 
, Comcast's Roberts said his company views QVC as an essential element for 
Comcast's growth. With QVC, he said, Comcast will generate nearly $900 million 
in annual cash flow--nearly half of which will be in unregulated businesses. 
Such a strategy is essential for cable TV operators who have endured two rate 
rollbacks from federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said Comcast's banks have already pledged $1 billion for the QVC 
purchase, and the company expects to raise an additional $300 million from the 
sale of its 19.9% interest in Heritage Media. Comcast has been assured that it 
could raise another $200 million in QVC debt, and it expects to issue the $275 
million in Comcast new convertible preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC shares added 25 cents to close at $36 Tuesday, before the offer was 
announced. CBS fell $2, to $300. Comcast Class A shares added 12.5 cents, to 
$16.625.

 NME Settlement With SEC Approved: National Medical Enterprises said a federal 
judge approved an agreement between the company and the Securities and Exchange 
Commission to settle securities fraud charges involving activities at NME's 
psychiatric and substance-abuse facilities. The SEC had accused the company of 
making false statements in required federal filings and annual reports from 
1990 through late 1992.Generally, the SEC alleges that the company misled 
investors by improperly recording its sales and profit and by not disclosing 
that its businesses "were subject to material risks" arising from practices at 
some of its psychiatric and substance-abuse facilities. The agreement was part 
of broad negotiations between NME and the federal government in which the 
company last month pleaded guilty to eight criminal counts and agreed to pay 
$379 million in fines and restitution.

ANOTHER LOW FOR DOLLAR; DOW HOLDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The dollar set another 50-year low against the Japanese yen Tuesday, falling 
as low as 96.55 yen before recovering to 97.50 in New York, off from 97.75 on 
Monday. It also fell against the German mark.  
</P>
<P>
 Blue chip stocks ended little changed after the weakness in the dollar 
dampened the impact of upbeat economic news and solid corporate earnings. 
During the day, the Dow industrials slid more than 30 points and then 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stock analysts believe it is only a matter of time before the Federal 
Reserve Board will be forced to defend the greenback by raising short-term 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly good second-quarter earnings from Motorola also failed to snap 
Wall Street out of its dollar fixation.  
</P>
<P>
 A better market mood, coupled with Motorola's results, could have written a 
different story, said Bill Allyn, an analyst at Jefferies & Co. "We could have 
had a bang-up day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about the dollar overshadowed two reports that showed inflation is in 
check. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department said wholesale prices held steady in June and even fell 
0.1% when the volatile food and energy sectors are excluded. Economists had 
predicted a rise in the overall producer price index of 0.3% and a gain in the 
core rate of 0.2%. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta also reported minimal 
pricing pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields dipped. The 30-year Treasury bond closed at 7.68%. 
</P>
<P>
 But uncertainty over whether the dollar's doldrums and the economy's strength 
will push the Fed into ratcheting up interest rates is keeping investors 
cautious, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's sitting on their hands, waiting to see what the Fed does," said 
Tony Dwyer, chief strategist at Sherwood Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the release of quarterly corporate earnings reports began in 
earnest, and investors were making good on earlier promises to treat 
disappointments harshly. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Morris fell 3/4 to 53 1/8 after the company reported net income of 
$1.42 per share in the second quarter, compared to $1.19 a year ago. The 
earnings were about on target with analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodyear declined 1 3/4 to 35 after the tire maker said its second-quarter 
earnings would be below analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Motorola was the volume leader on the New York Stock Exchange and rose 5 3/8 
to 50 1/8. The company said late Monday that its second-quarter profit jumped 
64% to 63 cents a share, from 40 cents a year earlier, on sharply higher sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbott Labs declined 2 1/8 to 26 7/8 after saying Monday that its 
second-quarter profit totaled 46 cents a share, up from 42 cents in the 
year-ago quarter and 1 cent below analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham Steel fell 1 5/8 to 26 3/4 after the company lowered its 
fourth-quarter earnings estimate to about 30 cents a share after saying just 
last week that it could earn 40 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Other highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 Semiconductor stocks fell after a trade association released disappointing 
data on product bookings in June. National Semiconductor lost 1/2 to 17 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Motorola's gains, semiconductor stocks came under pressure after the

BETSY NORTH -- A SILENT BUT OH-SO STRONG PARTNER; SHE'S AN INDEPENDENT WOMAN 
DEVOTED TO HER FAMILY AND -- SOME SAY -- A REASON HER HUSBAND IS A SENATE 
CONTENDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The back-yard barbecue in a leafy Virginia suburb was half over and the time 
had come for Oliver L. North, Republican candidate for Senate, to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 Before jumping into his standard stump speech about the evils of the 
Washington Establishment he hopes to tangle with for a second time, the former 
Marine lieutenant colonel and Iran-Contra defendant referred to his wife of 26 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Betsy was supposed to be here half an hour ago, but she's operating on Betsy 
Standard Time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he added: "We don't have any nannies, butler or a maid. Betsy believes 
someone should be there with our children." 
</P>
<P>
 The Norths, beneficiaries of that unique American phenomenon that can turn 
those touched by scandal into millionaires, could easily afford household help, 
even though their son and three daughters, all in their teens or 20s, no longer 
need baby-sitters. 
</P>
<P>
 But "family values" are a major theme of the North campaign, so the candidate 
sought to portray his wife's absence as a virtue. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the gathering that his wife had taken their daughters to a wedding 
shower in Great Falls, Va., where the Norths lived during his tenure on the 
National Security Council in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, North said his wife was shepherding their youngest daughter, Dornin, 
through a riding test. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Betsy North's exact whereabouts, North, who has been known to 
embellish his own exploits, was apparently not exaggerating his wife's devotion 
to their children -- or the independent streak that would lead her to go AWOL 
from a minor political function on a sweaty Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have observed Betsy North over the years described her as the force 
that has kept her household together, the calm in the storm aroused by North 
since he was revealed as a central figure in Iran-Contra. (For those who may 
have forgotten, that was the scheme to sell arms to Iran to try to free 
American hostages in Lebanon; then divert the profits to circumvent a 
congressional ban on aid to anti-communist guerrillas in Nicaragua.) 
</P>
<P>
 But while Betsy North sat dutifully in congressional hearing rooms and 
courtrooms during her husband's legal tribulations -- the picture of devotion 
in shirtwaist dress and pearls -- her participation in his first electoral 
foray has been sporadic. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's such a private person," said Dorothea Bronars, a longtime friend. "When 
Ollie got the nomination, she told me, 'I will do what I can when I can . . . 
if it doesn't interfere with the children.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Repeated requests to interview Betsy North were denied. Whether that was her 
decision or that of her husband's campaign staff could not be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 "We choppered her back home when I found out you were here," Dan McLagan, a 
North spokesman, told a reporter at the rally, presumably in jest. 
</P>
<P>
 Betsy North was at her husband's side at his nomination June 4 and has 
appeared in and narrated a commercial, in which she describes North as a 
"special man" who has been attacked by "the powerful few" but who has "never 
given up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to those who know her well, she would far rather spend time with her 
kids and her dogs, cats, horses and cattle on the 194-acre spread 70 miles from 
Washington in northwest Virginia, to which the family moved when North's court 
days were over -- and his lecture fees began mounting. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a horse person. She loves to ride," Bronars said, adding that Betsy 
North's "favorite thing is cleaning out the barn," perhaps not such a bad 
preparation for political life. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman North calls his best friend was born Frances Elizabeth Stuart 50 
years ago in a small town in western Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Jeb, descended from the Jeb Stuart, the Confederate war hero, ran 
a small canning factory. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Penn State University, Betsy Stuart had a job at Hechts, a 
Washington-area department store, when a cousin of North's showed her his 
picture and asked if she'd accept a blind date. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's good-looking. You can give him my number," she said, according to a 1987 
interview in Life magazine, the only one she is known to have given. 
</P>
<P>
 The courtship lasted seven months, while North completed the Naval Academy and 
Marine officers training. Following their wedding in 1968, they had barely two 
weeks together before he was sent to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The marriage was almost a war casualty. 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1973, North, who had already completed one tour of duty in Vietnam and 
a year as a trainer on Okinawa, agreed, without consulting his wife, to extend 
his deployment to command a company likely to be sent back to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 According to North's autobiography, "Under Fire" (HarperCollins, 1991), Betsy 
sent him a letter saying she now realized that the Marine Corps was more 
important to him than she or their (then two) children and she wanted a 
divorce. 
</P>
<P>
 North canceled the extension and returned to Washington, where he was briefly 
hospitalized for psychiatric treatment of depression. At the suggestion of 
doctors, he and his wife entered marriage counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stateside assignments helped pull the family back together even though the 
eager-beaver North continued to work killer hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Iran-Contra. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Life interview, Betsy North confided that she used to get "real mad" at 
her husband's frequent unexplained absences in the days when he was jetting off 
to Central America and Tehran.  
</P>
<P>
 "I used to complain, 'Why can't you be here . . . at this, that and the 
other?' Then you think, 'This is causing friction. Be happy when he's there.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Religion has helped her cope with her husband's ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Betsy became 'born again' before her husband did, and a beautiful Christian 
she is," Bronars said. "She doesn't bombard you with it all the time. It's her 
personal belief and her way of life. She believes her life is planned. She took 
the (1987 Iran-Contra) hearings as she takes things today -- one day at a 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesman McLagan said Betsy North will probably stay on the farm should her 
husband become the junior Senator from Virginia in November -- a distinct 
possibility in what has become a four-way free-for-all between him, Democratic 
incumbent Charles Robb, former Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder and former Atty. 
Gen. J. Marshall Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.17-million property, in lush Virginia horse country near the Shenandoah 
River, is a major preoccupation and refuge for her: a place too sprawling and 
remote to attract the hordes of journalists who made the family's lives 
miserable in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides horses, dogs and cats, Betsy North is raising 50 head of beef cattle. 
She and daughter Dornin tend the house -- a cluttered, antique-filled structure 
built around a 200-year-old log cabin. 
</P>
<P>
 If her husband is elected, some friends said they thought she would eventually 
emerge as a Barbara Bush kind of political wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Barbara, Betsy's a delightful, down-home kind of person who makes people 
feel at ease," said Alice Buck, a friend. She described how Betsy North once 
arrived at a luncheon in tony Middleburg, Va., "in blue jeans and her hair 
soaking wet" after having changed a tire. 
</P>
<P>
 On one point, friends agreed: Without her, North wouldn't be a contender. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he was married to another woman, he would never have come this far," 
Bronars said.

O.J. AND LOST INNOCENCE; CHILDREN ARE DEEPLY AFFECTED BY THE SIMPSON CASE -- 
ITS GRAPHIC VIOLENCE AND OVERWHELMING PUBLICITY -- AND THEY HARBOR STRONG 
OPINIONS ABOUT GUILT OR INNOCENCE. 
</P>

 Joshua said he'd had enough of the televised O.J. Simpson preliminary hearing 
by the time it reached closing arguments Friday, but the frowning face of the 
famous defendant was still on his mind when he hit the beach that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for him," said the tanned 10-year-old, dragging his body board 
through the sand near the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks so sad. . . . He's in big trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Added his 9-year-old buddy, Brian, also of Huntington Beach: "He's a nice guy. 
He's on TV. They wouldn't let him be on TV if he killed someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as adult America has been obsessed with the Simpson affair, so has young 
America been fixated -- in their case on a sports hero they never saw play. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been largely overlooked in the media rush to interview anybody with 
an opinion on the case. Yet today's kids are every bit as opinionated, 
passionate and conflicted as their parents and older siblings about what is 
becoming the most publicized and sensational murder case in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 The hoards of news crews have left the courthouse for now, but legal experts 
aren't the only ones raising questions since Simpson was arrested in the 
double-homicide of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald 
Goldman. Experts say the confusion felt by youth is more pronounced because 
they are the part of our population most affected by violence, yet they lack 
the tools of maturity to sort it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he did do it, he wasn't himself," declared 14-year-old Angie del la Torre. 
"He just lost it. . . . Something's wrong; he was possessed." 
</P>
<P>
 Angie and her friends were still reeling from the preliminary hearing, every 
minute of which they say they watched with interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's watching it," said 13-year-old Lisa Long. "My mom taped the whole 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The boys said they knew Simpson from trading sports cards, while the girls 
knew him as "the Hertz guy" and from the "Naked Gun" movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wish he didn't do it," said Ryan Myers, 13. "Yeah," added Joey Maletic, 
also 13, "he was like a sports hero." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While kids like Angie and her friends are able to weigh the facts in the case, 
younger children have a tougher time, says Brea psychotherapist Toni Aquino. 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion, fueled by unrelenting media coverage and gavel-to-gavel 
broadcast of the courtroom events, has children weighing factors like celebrity 
and consequence, gaping wounds and bloodstains -- true-life topics far more 
graphic than your basic schoolyard discussions of right versus wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Aquino, along with other experts in child psychology, agree that because the 
double slaying and the high-profile circumstances surrounding it have dominated 
adult conversation, kids naturally soak it in. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern is that it's not just how they take it in, it's that we are 
presenting children with a plethora of violence, day in and day out, and it's 
taking on the tenor of normalcy," she said. "The far-ranging ramification of it 
is yet to be known." 
</P>
<P>
 Home environment and the way parents present the events surrounding the 
Simpson case also play a big part in its lasting effect on America's children, 
Aquino says. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are affected by it in terms of how their parents deal with it," Aquino 
said. She added that children from stable families tend to be left more 
confused by the possibility of a likable personality like Simpson committing 
such a heinous crime, while children in a violent environment are more cynical, 
and simply become even less trusting of adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Peg, a telephone counselor at the Hotline Help Center in Orange, says she 
advises any parent faced with troubling questions to hear their children out, 
and focus on their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest advice is to listen, and reflect on how sad the whole situation 
is," she said, "I would ask the child what they were feeling, and respond to 
those feelings. I would tell them that the facts aren't important, that it's in 
the court. No one knows what happened, but I would reflect on the pain of not 
only O.J., but also of his kids, and the families of Nicole and of Ron 
Goldman." 
</P>
<P>
 Aquino agrees, adding that parents should reassure their children, reinforcing 
that it won't happen to them, and that they are loved and secure in their home. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to know that their world is safe," she said. 
</P>

<P>
 Youth minister Jim Burns said he witnessed firsthand how emotionally affected 
even 17-year-olds have been with the situation from its unpredictable start. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving at a scheduled graduation speech at the Crystal Cathedral on June 17, 
he expected to be greeted with smiles and laughter. What he didn't expect was 
the nearly-hysterical cluster of teen-age girls that met him before his 
address. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to kill himself," one of them sobbed. "And it's going to ruin my 
graduation." 
</P>
<P>
 It was their day, but, unfortunately, they were competing with history in the 
making. The group of Valley Christian High School graduates had just traveled 
the same freeway as the infamous Ford Bronco that chauffeured Simpson on the 
low-speed chase that had scores of millions transfixed to the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 Modifying his speech for the uneasy crowd gathered at the Crystal Cathedral, 
Burns began: "This is a day you'll never forget -- for several reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Burns, president of the San Clemente-based National Institute of Youth 
Ministry, says the kids he's talked don't have the same understanding of the 
case, noting that they don't really know the same O.J. grown-ups do. Just as 
the theories and judgments vary, the name "O.J. Simpson" seems to have changed 
with time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was with a group of kids, and they had to explain to one girl who he was," 
Burns said. "And she still had a blank look." 
</P>
<P>
 The touchdowns that brought the young athlete to glory were never witnessed 
firsthand by today's youth, nor do they know much of his rags-to-riches tale. 
Yet because everyone else is obsessed, they also talk at the beach, in malls 
and summer school classrooms of the defendant they've always known as "The 
Juice," the part-time actor who dashed through airports and acted as 
commentator for NFL games on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Recent statements from children on the Simpson case range from confused to 
judgmental. Playing a true-life game of Clue, some had theories, some had 
questions, some even made angry declarations of the Juice's innocence.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was framed," said Jordan Turner, 13, of Lake Forest. "It bothers me that 
they're not asking if anybody else murdered them." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Lieber, of Huntington Beach, had a similar reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry for him because of all he's had to go through," said the blond 
and freckled 11-year-old. "And he's innocent." 
</P>
<P>
 Lieber, chomping on popcorn with his father in the Westminster Mall, says he's 
gotten into arguments with at least one friend about the case, adding that "the 
news (media) has made up everything they can" to make Simpson look guilty. He 
added, however, that he had only tuned in "a couple of times" to the 
preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe someone's trying to get revenge on him for something he did a long time 
ago," Lieber said, "but he didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond's father, James Lieber, says he's concerned not only with the Simpson 
case, but also with the excessive violence in general that saturates the 
childhoods of today's American youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it rips at their innocence, being exposed to these violent episodes," 
he said. "And it seems to come up on a regular basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the students in summer school or on year-round campuses, the Simpson 
case has provoked a great deal of discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the boys make jokes, but I don't think it's funny," said Katie, a 
third-grade pupil at Hopkinson Elementary School in Los Alamitos. "Someone was 
stabbed with a knife." 
</P>
<P>
 Leighton Davis, 12, of Mission Viejo, also had empathy for the victims, 
something most of the children interviewed never expressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel really sorry for his kids. Their mom's dead, and their dad's in jail. 
It's sad."

SEEING AND BELIEVING; WHEN IT COMES TO APPARITIONS, THE CHURCH IS AS SKEPTICAL 
AS ANYONE. BUT AN INCREASE IN ACTIVITY IS TOUGH TO IGNORE. 
</P>

 Reyes Ruiz cleans his yard with a rosary clenched in his teeth, to keep both 
hands free for his work. But that's not the only unusual thing that happens 
around his house. Five years ago, he says, his wife, Estela, told him that she 
saw a vision of the Virgin Mary, and the visions continue today. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 3, 1988, the Ruizes were praying before a portrait of the Virgin that 
Reyes had painted. Suddenly, Estela Ruiz recalls, she saw a mist. "I thought I 
was going blind. The Blessed Mother appeared on a cloud. I started screaming 
and yelling, 'She's here, and she's beautiful.' Our Lady stole my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 That took some doing. Estela Ruiz is a woman with silver hair, a quick wit and 
a masters degree in education. She was director of a bilingual education 
program for the Phoenix public schools when she started seeing visions. "I was 
a skeptic," she says. "When the spiritual world enters ours, we think we must 
be going crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Most people would agree. They'd say that visits from angels and saints rank 
right up there with visions of ghosts, seances and psychic predictions as the 
products of a hyperactive imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the Roman Catholic Church is as skeptical as anyone when it 
comes to supernatural events. "The Vatican gets 200 calls on apparitions each 
year. The vast majority are determined to be false" says Father Robert Faricy, 
a theology professor at the Gregorian Institute in Rome who has written three 
books on such events. 
</P>
<P>
 But too much has happened in recent history for the Catholic Church to 
overlook it all. Since 1981, when six children in the rural town of Medjugorje, 
Bosnia, told of meeting the Blessed Mother on a hillside, there has been a 
notable increase in reports of religious apparitions worldwide. About 15 
million people have visited Medjugorje. Two of the six children are said to 
continue meeting the Virgin each evening and receiving her messages. Pilgrims 
report miracle healings and rosary beads that miraculously turn gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of similar encounters have been reported in recent years. Most reported 
visions are of the Virgin appearing to Roman Catholics. Many continue over 
several years and attract so many visitors that pilgrim sites spring up. 
Thousands of people have traveled to the Ruiz home during the past five years. 
Other pilgrim sites have flourished in Scottsdale, Ariz.; Santa Maria, Calif.; 
Conyers, Ga.; Cortnadreha, Ireland; Kibeho, Rwanda, and Akita, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the Vatican does not get involved in these events. But in 1978, a 
papal department prepared a letter updating guidelines for investigating 
apparitions, says Father Johann Roten, director of the Marian Research 
Institute for academic studies concerning the Virgin Mother, at the Catholic 
University of Dayton, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 It is up to the local bishop to decide when an investigation is warranted, 
Roten explains. The bishop forms a commission that includes theologians expert 
at discerning apparitions (as well as satanism), medical and psychological 
doctors, and the pastor of the local church. 
</P>
<P>
 The group looks for answers to two major questions: Do any of the messages the 
seers claim to receive agree with church teachings? And, how much good has come 
to those attracted to the site? Both spiritual conversions and physical 
healings qualify as good, Roten explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Another key question is whether the event can be explained by natural causes. 
Usually, the church favors that explanation. In Scottsdale, Ariz., where nine 
members of the St. Maria Gorretti parish believed that they heard messages from 
Jesus and Mary starting in the late 1980s, Bishop Thomas O'Brien's commission 
decided the messages could be explained by "ordinary human dynamics," the sort 
experienced during prayerful meditation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even sites that draw vast numbers of pilgrims over long years face official 
resistance. Medjugorje has been under investigation -- in "discernment" to use 
church language -- since 1985. Events at the Ruiz household are also in 
discernment. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the extreme caution taken, a rise in official investigations signals a 
change in attitude, Roten says. "The church is loosening up. Concerning 
apparitions, it is more open than it has been." He believes the new openness 
reflects changing social trends. "People today are frustrated by rationalism as 
the only explanation of life," Roten says. "As a result we have a revival of 
religious spirit, of New Age spirituality; we have discussions about values. 
All this is telling us, 'There is a different approach to life.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Outside observers tend to view reported apparitions of Mary and Jesus as part 
of a long tradition within Catholic Church history. (See accompanying story.) 
"When I hear that a Catholic saw the Virgin Mary, I don't laugh," says Daniel 
Gordis, an assistant professor of philosophy at the University of Judaism in 
Los Angeles. "Catholicism always went beyond what your eye could see." Another 
example, he says, is the Catholic sacrament of the Eucharist. Doctrine holds 
that bread and wine become the real presence of Christ's body and blood, even 
though there is no visible proof. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the religious passion that gives rise to those beliefs," says 
Gordis of apparitions. "And people who take religious traditions seriously have 
to allow for the possibility that the visions do occur." He includes himself in 
that group. 
</P>
<P>
 Catholics aren't the only seers, notes Robert Ellwood, a professor of 
comparative religion at the University of Southern California. "Protestants 
have visions of angels, or of Jesus. Hindus have visions of Krishna. Catholics 
expect to see the Blessed Virgin, and so they do," he says. "It's part of their 
individual belief systems. It's within their individual traditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Faricy has an entirely different explanation for the increase in reported 
apparitions since Medjugorje. "The world's in trouble," he says. "We've made a 
mess of it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some believers consider Medjugorje to be a spiritual comet in the modern 
world. They might also say a number of metaphysical meteors have burst on the 
scene lately, burned bright, then fizzled. Some have been just plain silly. The 
face of Jesus on a tortilla shell drew busloads to Lake Arthur, N.M., in 1978. 
A similar image in a spaghetti ad attracted crowds to a billboard in Atlanta in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The church considers some apparitions copycats. They mirror visions of the 
past, most notably those at Fatima, Portugal, and Lourdes, France. The church 
has long since accepted as authentic that in 1917 the Virgin appeared to three 
children in Fatima and in 1858 she appeared to a shepherd girl at Lourdes. Both 
times she gave the children messages, asking that the faithful pray for peace 
and strive for holiness. 
</P>
<P>
 But "after Lourdes, there were some 50 apparitions like it reported around 
Paris," says Thomas Petrisko, president of the Center for Peace. Based in 
Pittsburgh, Pa., it is one of about 300 such nonprofit centers around the 
country that supply information on reported apparitions of the Virgin. Petrisko 
publishes a monthly newsletter and is completing a four-part series on the 
history of modern apparitions. Petrisko is a Catholic layman, whose Peace 
Center is not directly affiliated with the church. 
</P>
<P>
 Faricy says some reported visions turn out to be "authentic coincidences." Two 
years ago, hundreds trekked to a tree in North Hollywood to see the image of 
Mary in the tree bark, until it was determined to be a natural formation caused 
by sap. One year earlier, a reported image of Mary in the tile wall of a Santa 
Ana church drew crowds until it faded with the natural sunlight. In Santa Ana 
last month, a cross reflected in a bathroom window drew hundreds of visitors to 
a small house. The landlord heard about it, changed the glass and the image was 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There've been dozens of asteroid type events in Southern California lately," 
Petrisko says. "But nothing the big-boy theologians are looking at closely." 
</P>

 In September, 1988, Reyes Ruiz was on a pilgrimage in Medjugorje, praying for 
his then-skeptical wife. She told him that praying was for people who couldn't 
get what they needed for themselves, and she refused to go with him. He was 
there on a vacation from his job for the Catholic Diocesean Office of Phoenix. 
He works with undocumented farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Estela says she was not a particularly religious person at the time, but that 
week she recalls having her first encounter with the Blessed Mother. She was 
walking past a painting of Our Lady of Guadalupe, one of many religious 
artworks by Reyes in their house. Other times she had passed it and thought, 
"Why can't we have landscapes like everybody else?" That morning, however, she 
recalls hearing a voice say, "Good morning daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no vision to accompany the voice. Those started three months later, 
she says. "I thought to myself, 'There's no way I'm going to tell anybody about 
this.' I'd lose prestige." But afterward she felt herself opening up to 
spiritual life. 
</P>
<P>
 When her husband came home she told him what had happened and started to 
attend daily Mass with him. She expected him to be shocked, but he wasn't. 
"When you pray for something, change doesn't surprise you," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back at her old self, Estela Ruiz now believes, "I had become worldly. 
I was into the power of my job, the prestige, the money. I had everything I 
wanted, I felt I had no need of prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 "With education comes analysis of God. We analyze God, we no longer believe in 
God. Why should we pray?" 
</P>
<P>
 She believes that the mystical events reported around the world today are 
related. For her, "Medjugorje was Our Lady's grand entrance into the world. God 
sent his mother to lead us back to him. These are times of great mercy." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Reyes Ruiz visited Medjugorje, life has changed for the entire family. 
His wife quit her job and gave up her $40,000 salary. They now live on Reyes' 
$20,000 annual income. They travel the country telling their story, invited by 
church groups who finance their trips. They will speak at Blessed Sacrament 
Church in Westminster on July 21. Estela Ruiz continues to see the Blessed 
Mother and receives a message each month, she says. That day several hundred 
pilgrims come to the house. The messages are faxed to people around the world, 
on request. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven Ruiz children and 20 grandchildren pitch in on other projects. They 
helped Reyes Ruiz build a shrine in his back yard and they have acted in Bible 
skits put on for the busloads of school children who come to the house for a 
day, from around the Southwest. At the center of the activities is a group of 
100 or so regulars who gather in the back yard twice each week to pray. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I met Estela, she was going for it," recalls a family friend, Tom 
Esperanza. "Feminist, Chicana, masters degree. Now, their entire life is 
different."

 The thing that bugs me the most about my mother, I guess, is that she follows 
through with her rules. Like, right now I'm kinda grounded and she sticks with 
it. If I try to weasel out of it, she won't let me. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I think I can get away with it, but I should know better. I try 
anyway. I say: "Come on, Ma. Let me talk on the phone." I beg her to let me go 
somewhere. I can't talk on the phone and I'm not allowed out. I can go to 
school and do things I need for school. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm grounded right now because of my grades in Spanish. She wants me to get at 
least a C, so I've been grounded for the whole last quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that, I was grounded for throwing this party for my sister. We were 
supposed to have a party for 35 people but 350 people showed up. My mom was 
really mad. It was our fault and we took full responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like toward the end of the year, I always seem to get in trouble for 
something. I start to goof off or something. Last year, I got in trouble 
because I went with my friends to Magic Mountain. My parents said I couldn't go 
because I came home late one night. I went anyway. I was grounded for a long 
time. Then I hadn't been grounded for a while until my sister's birthday party. 
</P>
<P>
 But, one other thing about my mom. She's always there for us. Whenever we need 
someone to talk to, she's there. She's a really strong person. She has to be 
with four kids and one on the way. And I guess you could say I'm mischievous. I 
guess it's because I'm a kid, still growing up, trying to see what I can get 
away with.

 Juanita is the sweetest girl and I adore her. But she has one flaw that drives 
me crazy. She thinks she knows it all. She's very stubborn and she doesn't take 
a step back to observe what's going on around her. 
</P>
<P>
 When my second daughter turned 15 recently, Juanita decided to plan the 
birthday party. She's the type to take charge. They were supposed to have a 
small party in the back yard with 30 friends. They ended up with something 
else. There were 300 kids there. I almost died. My husband and I were in New 
York at the time. Luckily I asked my family to be at the party. My brother 
called the police, who peacefully broke it up. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's Juanita. She thinks she knows it all, that you can invite 300 
people to a party and it will still be peaceful. She just doesn't listen to our 
experience and our advice. She thinks of short-term gratification. 
</P>
<P>
 I worked hard when I was growing up. I knew I had to go to college to get 
ahead. I knew I had to save money. Juanita knows she is going to college so 
there's no planning there. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a little worried. My husband and I were poor. Our parents always worked, 
but we just didn't have everything we have now. But we had a certain richness 
in our lives. My immigrant parents came here with their work ethic. That was 
really something. Sometimes I think now we were lucky to be poor because it 
made us appreciate what we have now. Now we're solidly middle class. I 
sometimes wonder if maybe my children have it too easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Juanita is very strong-willed. She's a hard worker and very analytical. She's 
always for the underdog. She enjoys debating, only I hate it when she debates 
with me. Now that I'm pregnant, I'm too tired. When I'm tired, Juanita wins.

A LONG AND VARIED HISTORY OF VISIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ROURKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The history of heavenly apparitions in the Roman Catholic Church is long and 
rich. While most reports are never officially sanctioned by the church, a 
handful have been approved as authentic. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these apparitions have certain things in common: the Virgin Mary is 
said to appear, alone or with Jesus. Most often, it is the powerless and 
impoverished who say they have seen her. She appears to them in nature -- on a 
hillside, in a grove or in a grotto. And she delivers messages meant for the 
world. Usually, the messages contain some good news and some bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, no apparition has ever been "proved" by scientific standards, but 
the sites where visions have been reported attract millions of visitors. And 
thousands have claimed to be cured, physically or spiritually, as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Americas, Our Lady of Guadalupe is the premiere pilgrim site. On Dec. 
9, 1531, a peasant named Juan Diego told the local bishop that he met the 
Virgin in the hills near what is now Mexico City. She asked him to have a 
church built in her honor, but the bishop wanted proof. Legend has it that Juan 
Diego opened his cloak to show the Virgin's image impressed upon it. And the 
building of a church, now Our Lady of Guadalupe basilica in Mexico City, began. 
</P>
<P>
 France captured world attention in the 19th Century when four separate visions 
of the Virgin were accepted as authentic by the church. Over a period of 41 
years, she was said to appear to a nun in Paris, two children in LaSalette in 
Southern France, and four children on a farm in Pontmain, near the German 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 But events at Lourdes, in southwestern France, eclipsed them all. The country 
girl Bernadette Soubirous was not yet a teen-ager in February, 1858, when she 
told of seeing the Virgin in a grotto. Bernadette later described how she was 
directed to uncover an underground spring of water with her hands.  
</P>
<P>
 Since then, thousands have claimed to be healed by that water. A 
church-coordinated medical board tracks health records to determine whether the 
cures can be explained by natural, rather than supernatural, causes. The vast 
majority have been judged to be normal cures. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1917, attention swiveled to Fatima, Portugal, when three shepherd children 
reported seeing the Virgin once each month, from May through October. They 
shared messages they said she gave them, asking people to fast and pray. One 
message promised, "If they listen to my requests, Russia will be converted and 
there will be peace." 
</P>
<P>
 That was the good news from Fatima. The rest of it was awful. Unchecked 
disease, massive death and destruction, and fire falling from the sky were 
among the horrific predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say the messages of Fatima foretell of the millennium, the end of time. 
Others say it predicted the spread of communism through the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in the dark messages of Fatima has peaked again lately, perhaps in 
part because we are so close to the end of this century. "The end of time as we 
know it has always been part of a Christian world view," notes Anne Taves, 
professor of Christian church history at Claremont School of Theology. "It was 
a widespread belief in Greco-Roman world, and a strong motif in the early 
Christian church." 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggest that the calendar may even help explain the recent rise in 
reports of apparitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The millennium is seen as a critical time," says Robert Ellwood, professor of 
Comparative Religion at University of Southern California. "There is a sense 
that we're coming to the end of an age, and changes are probably imminent. 
There is a lot of anxiety in the air. This opens a crack for what is outside 
the scientific and predictable." 
</P>
<P>
 Some religion scholars with a scientific bent suggest that too many travelers 
to pilgrim sites fall through that crack. Among pilgrims and some other 
Catholics, stories abound about suns that spin in the sky, rosaries that turn 
gold and physical ailments that miraculously disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is magical thinking," scolds Gerald Larue, head of the Committee for 
Scientific Examination of Religion and Emeritus Professor of Religion at USC. 
He has traveled to apparition sites in California and come away unconvinced. 
"These claims need to be tested," he says. "Critical thinking is the road to 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, a woman told Larue that her silver rosary turned gold while she was 
on a pilgrimage. His advice? "Dip it in Tarn-X. See if it's just tarnished 
beads." 
</P>
<P>
 She refused, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 That the church hierarchy is skeptical toward visions, voices and other 
supernatural activity does not surprise Sister Bridget Mary Meehan of Falls 
Church, Va. "The mystical is threatening because the hierarchy can't control 
it," says Meehan, who studied visionaries through history for her book, 
"Praying With Passionate Women," due out in January from Crossroads Press. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their white-male perspective is not open to the mystical. They're into the 
logical, not emotional. Apparitions are relational and powerful. Not 
analytical." 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney Callahan, professor of Psychology at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, 
N.Y., agrees that the rise in reported apparitions today could reflect greater 
openness. But, she cautions, "The price you pay for mysticism is, you have to 
live with superstitiousness."

PLAYING TO UNIVERSAL CONCERNS; AMERICAN SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA LEAGUE MEMBERS MEET 
TO DISCUSS WAYS TO PROMOTE EXCELLENCE AND MAKE MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For most music lovers, the concert experience is the be-all and end-all of 
their interest. But for the professionals involved, the program is merely the 
culmination of a long process. Beyond the rehearsals, there are practical 
problems of running an organization and keeping it alive.  
</P>
<P>
 Once a year, members of the American Symphony Orchestra League -- representing 
about 850 orchestras -- meet to discuss their problems and concerns. This year 
about 2,000 people, including representatives from Orange County Philharmonic 
Society, the Pacific Symphony and the UC Irvine Symphony, attended the four-day 
ASOL conference in June in Dallas. These were some of the issues that surfaced. 
* 
</P>
<P>
 The smoke from the lightning bolt that struck last year's American Symphony 
Orchestra League conference hung over this year's convention in Dallas. 
Specifically, the smoke from the league's hotly debated 1993 report titled 
"Americanizing the American Orchestra." 
</P>
<P>
 The 200-page report called for an affirmative-action program of seemingly 
radical proportions. Among the ideas presented to the league's thousands of 
members nationwide: 
</P>
<P>
 * Be strongly responsive to community needs and desires. 
</P>
<P>
 * Court younger audiences with more diverse repertory, including pop and jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 * Find ways to include more minorities -- at all levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be more egalitarian from top to bottom in running the orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reconsider whether musicianship alone should be the factor in hiring players 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 Edward Rothstein, chief music critic of the New York Times, immediately 
pounced on the report, denouncing it as "a disgrace" that "may very well 
Americanize the orchestra into extinction." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody wanted to say the theme of this year's conference was "backtracking"; 
the key word that emerged this year was "excellence," a word straight out of 
the corporate and management world. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference was called "Celebrate Excellence." People talked about how 
"excellent" the Western classical music tradition is, after all. How 
"excellently" it is being played by so many American orchestras. Apologies were 
not offered. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word 'quality' was used a great deal," Pacific Symphony executive 
director Louis G. Spisto said in an interview upon his return from Dallas. 
"There are real artistic standards that do measure quality. You have to be 
committed to quality and standards. Talking about serving the community 
shouldn't be talking about moving away from quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Said ASOL spokeswoman Sandra Hyslop in a recent phone interview from her 
office in Washington, D.C.: "The report was published as a work in progress. It 
was not meant to be prescriptive, although people cast it that way. Rather, 
these were some of the ideas that came up. It was meant to be thought-provoking 
and discussion-provoking. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The league certainly knows -- and all the orchestras know -- that to serve 
our communities is first and foremost to be proud of the tradition of Western 
so-called 'classical' music," she added. "Certainly the league wants to 
preserve that and do it as well as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 But working out the details of how to serve two different masters -- artistic 
excellence and the needs of increasingly diverse audiences -- remains a 
challenge orchestras must face. 
</P>
<P>
 Spisto characterized the 1994 conference as "more 'business as usual,' but, in 
effect, it was a better conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "The discussions and meetings focused on issues -- management issues, issues 
of building boards and strengthening ties to the community in new ways. We had 
a number of sessions that dealt with interactive technology that could be 
helpful to orchestras. There was a lot of focus on education." 
</P>
<P>
 Dena Montiel, marketing director for the Orange County Philharmonic Society, 
came away feeling that Orange County music groups are on the right track. "I 
realized there were a lot of things we're doing right, and a lot of other 
organizations are doing right," Montiel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she returned with "a few ideas to make us more customer-oriented and 
how we can better serve our patrons," Montiel said. "Little things that could 
possibly make additions to that personal touch and make a difference." 
</P>
<P>
 She said found concern over issues that have long dogged classical-music 
presenters.  
</P>
<P>
 "What to do with an eroding audience, an older audience," she said. "We're 
losing a lot of people. How to tap into new markets and reach new audiences." 
</P>
<P>
 For UCI Symphony conductor Zelman Bokser, the conference allowed him to 
organize and chair a newly created division encompassing college, university 
and conservatory orchestras. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means we'll have some representation . . . in terms of staff and some 
thinking about how ASOL might interact with those orchestras in fulfilling 
their various missions," Bokser said in a phone interview from New York, where 
he is working on Wagner's music dramas as part of a summer NEH Fellowship. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about a variety of issues that are specific to collegiate 
orchestras that wouldn't get raised at the professional level: what we program, 
how we go about recruiting, how to chose repertory for pedagogical purposes -- 
what makes an orchestra grow best. We shared a lot of information . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis of the league now is on education missions," he added. "Everyone 
recognizes that something is not quite working at the professional orchestra 
level. And everyone is working very hard to figure out what kinds of things 
they can do to get orchestral music or music in general to people in the 
schools, not only on the university level but younger levels as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you go to an ASOL conference," Bokser said, "you always have the sense 
that everything is in a very healthy state. Everyone is now beginning to admit 
that everything is not in a very healthy state and that we have to talk steps 
to bring them to a healthy state." 
</P>
<P>
 Hyslop countered: "Audiences have always been aging. I don't understand this 
point, really. I've been going to orchestral concerts since I was a kid. I 
looked around then and saw I was one of very few young people in the audience. 
It's always been like that to a certain extent. But the quality had been high 
and always has been through all this time. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, there are financial difficulties, but the American world we live in has 
a lot of economic issues, and orchestras certainly reflect that." 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the ASOL issued no report. "The last two conferences sent people 
off to think that each conference would produce something like that," Hyslop 
said. "But no resolutions were taken. There was no conclusion to come to."

A 'KIMBA' SURPRISE FOR DISNEY; MOVIES: 'THE LION KING' IS A HIT, BUT REPORTED 
SIMILARITIES TO THE JAPANESE-CREATED AMERICAN CARTOON OF THE '60S ARE RAISING 
SOME QUESTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT W. WELKOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Creators of "The Lion King," Disney's summer box-office smash, say they were 
surprised to learn of reported similarities in the animated film and a 
Japanese-created American television cartoon series of the 1960s called "Kimba, 
the White Lion." 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I'm not familiar with (the TV series)," said Rob Minkoff, who added 
that he and co-director Roger Allers first learned about the controversy on a 
recent trip to Japan to promote the Disney film, whose lion cub is named Simba. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney's promotional material says that the idea for its African-based 
coming-of-age story originated "in the story department of Disney Feature 
Animation more than four years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 "The project was initially called 'King of the Jungle' and, like most animated 
features at Disney, its development was evolutionary, taking years to create 
and refine," stated a Disney press kit. 
</P>
<P>
 An expert on Japanese comic books and the American producer of "Kimba" both 
said that while the story itself is far different from the "Lion King," they 
noticed striking similarities in several characters and in at least one scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The similarities in characters include an excitable bird who accompanies the 
lion, a guru-like baboon who gives sage advice, and even a pack of smart-aleck 
hyenas, according to Fred Ladd, who produced the "Kimba" TV series. 
</P>
<P>
 "When one sees the film, it's inevitable that one should be reminded of 
similar material in the TV series of 30 years ago," Ladd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frederik Schodt of San Francisco, author of a 1983 book on Japanese comic 
books called "Manga! Manga!," said the Disney film contains one scene that is 
amazingly similar to a scene on Page 173, Vol. 3, of a paperback edition of the 
1950s comic book series called "The Jungle Emperor" by animator Osamu Tezuka. 
The cartoon TV series was based on the comic book series. 
</P>
<P>
 In that scene, Schodt recalled, the lion father, named Leo, has just died (by 
a hunter's gun) and his son, named Lune, runs into a man who has witnessed the 
killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are about to walk off into the distance when the clouds on the horizon 
start to take on the shape of Leo," Schodt said. "The man says to the little 
lion cub, 'Look, that cloud looks just like Leo.' Then, on the horizon, we see 
the shape of the lion's father." 
</P>
<P>
 Schodt said he thought a scene in "Lion King" where Simba sees his ghostly 
father, Mufasa, in the clouds "too similar to be a coincidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Schodt said, it would be nearly impossible for the hundreds of 
animators at Disney not to be aware of the similarities in the comic book.

 "There are an awful lot of young Americans who are big fans of Japanese 
animation today," he said. "Many of those people are now working in the United 
States animation industry. It would be inconceivable that no one (at Disney) 
had never seen 'Kimba, the White Lion' before. 
</P>
<P>
 "In animation," he added, "it is common to have allusions to other movies and 
in-jokes." 
</P>
<P>
 But, while some see obvious references and influences to Tezuka's work in 
"Lion King," the story itself is quite different. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Kimba," the cub's mother dies aboard a ship and Kimba escapes, swimming 
back to shore. While trying to go home, he visits cities and realizes that 
mankind has created a wonderful civilization of laws -- quite different from 
the law of the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Lion King," Simba leaves the pride after mistakenly believing that he had 
a role in his father's death. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Kimba," the hero battles poachers and trappers, a magic serpent and even 
the monster of Petrified Valley. He defends his domain against "the insect 
invasion," "the red menace" and "the gigantic grasshopper." Aiding his efforts 
are his animal friends, Dan'l Baboon, Pauley Cracker, Tadpole, Samson and Roger 
Ranger, who is a human. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Lion King," however, there are no human beings and Simba fights hyenas and 
Scar. 
</P>
<P>
 The character of Scar, the power hungry "black sheep" brother of Mufasa, is 
particularly intriguing to some observers. In the TV series, the villain Claw, 
who has a scar above his eye, takes over the throne in Kimba's absence. 
</P>
<P>
 Takayuki Matsutani, president of Tezuka Productions in Tokyo, said there is 
some similarity between the animated creations on two counts: the son grows up 
to be the king's successor after his father's death, and the symbolic scene 
where Simba stands on a rock in "The Lion King," whereas in the Japanese 
version, the opening scene has Kimba standing on a rock. He also agreed there 
were similarities in the baboon, the bird, the hyenas and the evil lion. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, quite a few staff of our company saw a preview of 'The Lion King,' 
discussed this subject and came to the conclusion that you cannot avoid having 
these similarities as long as you use animals as characters and try to draw 
images out of them," Matsutani said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Disney Co. had gotten a hint from 'The Jungle Emperor,' Osamu Tezuka, 
a founder of our company, would have been pleased," he continued. "And, we feel 
the same way, rather than making a claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Therefore, our company's general opinion is 'The Lion King' is a totally 
different piece from 'The Jungle Emperor' and is an original work completed by 
the Disney production's long-lasting excellent production technique." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the apparent similarities, Minkoff said that whenever a story is 
based in Africa, it is "not unusual to have characters like a baboon, a bird or 
hyenas." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know for a fact that ("Kimba") has never been discussed as long as I've 
been on the project," said Minkoff, who joined the film project in April, 1992. 
"In my experience, if Disney becomes aware of anything like that, they say you 
will not do it. People are claiming copyright infringement all the time."

WATTS PROPHETS: WELL-VERSED IN LIFE'S LESSONS; POETRY: THE GROUP, WHICH 
PERFORMS TONIGHT IN LONG BEACH, TELLS OF ITS EXPERIENCES AND CONCERNS FOR THE 
COMMUNITY.

 Amde Hamilton knows how powerful an act of creativity can be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can say that a poem saved my life," says Hamilton, a member of the Watts 
Prophets, one of the forebears of rap. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview at his South-Central home, Hamilton says that when he walked 
into the Watts Writers Workshop in 1966 "and took my little writing that I had 
put on a piece of paper and people said that it was something, it was the most 
meaningful thing that ever happened to me. It changed my whole life." 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop was founded by Academy Award-winning screenwriter and novelist 
Budd Schulberg in 1966, in the aftermath of the Watts riots, as a means of 
providing urban blacks with a forum for expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "It let me know who I was," said Hamilton, who is joined in the Prophets by 
Otis O'Solomon and Richard Dedeaux. "It gave me a direction, gave me an outlet, 
it gave me a place to explore." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Solomon is of a like mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had times where I was broke, and I've written a poem and I finished and 
I'd be so high," said O'Solomon, seated next to Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I'd get in my car, put in two hours' worth of gas and just drive. I'd 
stop somewhere and read the poem and it felt good. I've had money at different 
points in my life, but I don't think I've had a greater high" than writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the three men are considered the grandfathers of rap. But there was a 
time in their lives when poetry was just a word. That all changed when the 
three joined the Watts Writers Workshop. All the men praised Schulberg, who won 
a best screenplay Oscar for 1954's "On the Waterfront." 
</P>
<P>
 "He saw what was happening (in our community), made a commitment and came 
down, stayed in the trenches and proved himself," said O'Solomon. "People said, 
'Hey, this guy's for real, even if he is white.' " 
</P>
<P>
 By the late '60s, using the name Watts Prophets, the three were reciting 
gut-level, insightful poetry -- sometimes simultaneously -- about their 
experiences as young black men. These poems, with titles like "Sell Your Soul" 
and "Black in a White World," were delivered dramatically over spirited music 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio had some very strong years, appearing with everyone from Sarah 
Vaughan and Muhammad Ali to Billy Higgins and Ornette Coleman, and it has 
recorded an album, "Rappin' Black in a White World." And while the Prophets 
weren't very active in the '80s, that has begun to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides tonight's performance in Long Beach, the Watts Prophets will appear at 
California Plaza in downtown Los Angeles on July 30, and they've been signed to 
appear at Lollapalooza, coming to Cal State Dominguez Hills Sept. 3 and 4. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they are hammering out contract details for their first recording 
in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "That album should take us out into the world," Dedeaux said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men still write about their experiences, and their concerns for their 
community. In one Hamilton poem about raising children, he writes, "Son, lend 
me your ears . . . I can see in the garden of young brains . . . you see man is 
fertile like the earth . . . what seeds are planted determine his worth . . . 
the cultivation of your child's mind . . . must be done on your own time." 
</P>
<P>
 Though they'd like to earn a living as the Watts Prophets, Hamilton, Dedeaux 
and O'Solomon, all in their 50s, each have day jobs. Hamilton works as 
counselor in alcohol and drug treatment programs, Dedeaux runs a custom 
picture-framing business from his home, and O'Solomon sells his poetry door to 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go into beauty shops and barber shops, stores, parks," O'Solomon said. 
"I've sold thousands of poems." 
</P>
<P>
 The poets, whose work has been digitally sampled by numerous rap groups, will 
be backed tonight by a trio led by their musical director, Herb Graham Jr., of 
the B Sharp Jazz Quartet. The band will play everything from jazz to hip-hop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can play over any kind of music. Next we are going to try Tchaikovsky," 
said Dedeaux, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 A Watts Prophets program includes poems written years ago, and some written 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it all sounds fresh, whether it's old or new," O'Solomon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for their views on the state of the nation, and their community, the 
writers were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love America, and I believe it will sustain," Dedeaux said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no hope," said Hamilton, "but I have learned to have hope in the face 
of no hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, it's the written word that keeps these gentlemen going. 
</P>
<P>
 "Writing a poem, even if it's not the greatest poem, is like a release valve, 
Hamilton said. "It's so therapeutic." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Watts Prophets appear tonight at the Long Beach Museum of Art, 2300 E. 
Ocean Ave., Long Beach. 7 p.m. $8-10. (310) 438-9900.

 The Quiet Zone Theatre's seventh annual benefit show, held Saturday at the 
Irvine Barclay Theatre, raised $3,208 for Orange County nonprofit organizations 
serving the deaf and hard of hearing. The troupe raised a total of roughly 
$15,000 for such groups with four other performances of the same show this 
year.

VANESSA REDGRAVE PERFORMANCES IN HAIFA DERAILED BY PROTESTS; THEATER: HAIFA 
MUNICIPAL THEATER CANCELS TWO SCHEDULED SHOWS AMID AN ALMOST TOTAL BOYCOTT OF 
TICKET SALES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bowing to public pressure and an almost total boycott of advance ticket sales, 
the Haifa Municipal Theater on Tuesday canceled two scheduled performances by 
British actress Vanessa Redgrave, whose years of militant support for the 
Palestine Liberation Organization led many here to view her as an enemy of 
Israel and anti-Semitic. 
</P>
<P>
 Amalia Eyal, a spokeswoman for the city-owned theater, said it told Redgrave 
that "we were facing a situation in which she would be playing to an empty 
hall" because of an intense campaign against her appearances in Haifa, her 
first in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Redgrave, whose films include "Howards End," "Julia" and "The Bostonians," was 
to have appeared next week in "Brecht in Exile," a selection of works by German 
playwright Bertolt Brecht while he was in exile from Nazi Germany. In one 
segment, Redgrave plays a Jewish woman in Nazi Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our naivete, we thought the time was appropriate (to bring Redgrave to 
Israel), that something had changed in the Israeli public," Eyal said. 
"Regrettably, we were wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Redgrave, who had long advocated a cultural boycott of Israel because of its 
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, had agreed to come to Haifa after 
Israel and the PLO signed an agreement on Palestinian self-government and 
Israeli forces withdrew from Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Oded Kutler, the theater director, who has staged a number of politically 
controversial plays, had wanted to bring Redgrave to Israel "as a chance for 
Israelis to see a great artist on the stage -- and as a chance perhaps to set a 
precedent." 
</P>
<P>
 "She has her beliefs, but the main body of her work is to be a great actress, 
perhaps one of the greatest actresses," Kutler added in announcing the 
performances in early June. 
</P>
<P>
 But the protests began immediately and grew in volume to the point where the 
Haifa city council was to debate the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Posters of Redgrave were torn down and ripped up during the last month, many 
of the theater's normal outlets refused to sell tickets, and opponents of the 
performance set up a stand outside the theater to collect signatures on a 
petition demanding that the mayor stop her from coming to Haifa. 
</P>
<P>
 A picture of her carrying an AK-47 assault rifle and dancing with Palestinians 
was turned into a poster against her appearance here, and a "struggle 
committee" put out leaflets recalling her past denunciations of "Zionist 
hooligans" and her justification of a major Palestinian attack on Israeli 
civilians as "a legitimate military action." 
</P>
<P>
 With only 150 tickets sold out of a total of 1,600 for the two performances, 
the theater's board told the management earlier this week that it was free to 
make its own decision on whether to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Zvi Dahari, chairman of the board, said, "Redgrave was to come as an actress, 
not as a politician. 
</P>
<P>
 "A new page has been turned in the Middle East," Dahari added, "and today we 
are already sitting with enemies who were greater than she."

NO MAJOR OVERHAUL FOR GETTY MUSEUM; ART: ALTHOUGH THE MALIBU VILLA WILL BE 
MODIFIED TO BECOME A CENTER FOR THE ANTIQUITIES, THE BUILDING WILL REMAIN 
ESSENTIALLY INTACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 No bulldozers or wrecking balls are in the current J. Paul Getty Museum's 
future. The Roman-style villa that has housed the museum in Malibu for the past 
20 years will remain essentially intact when it is converted to a museum and 
study center for Greek and Roman antiquities, according to Harold M. Williams, 
president of the Getty Trust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we wanted to make major changes, we would have to bear in mind that 
this was all made possible by J. Paul Getty," Williams said of the museum and 
seven other Getty programs endowed by the late oil magnate. "The building is 
his creation, and we will honor that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Getty Trust last week announced the appointment of the Boston-based firm 
of Machado and Silvetti Associates Inc. as master planners of the project. The 
renovation is expected to begin in 1997, after the Getty's other art 
collections have moved to a new museum at the Getty Center, under construction 
in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the process of planning the villa's conversion is only beginning, 
changes under discussion include improving visitor circulation and installing 
skylights in the second-floor galleries to create better viewing conditions for 
antiquities, Williams said. In addition, the museum's entrance may be 
reconfigured so that the main peristyle garden is experienced as an intimate 
interior space -- as in a real Roman villa -- rather than a point of entry, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached by telephone at his office in Boston, architect Jorge Silvetti said 
the renovation is likely to develop open spaces around the museum and offer 
more public access to the grounds. As for the building, "through a twist of 
fate, it will become more relevant by staying the same," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Roman villa built in the 1970s in Southern California to house European 
Renaissance and Baroque art is problematic," Silvetti said. Indeed, 
"ridiculous" was the cognoscenti's judgment in 1974, when Silvetti and his 
partner, Rodolfo Machado, were doing graduate work at UC Berkeley and the Getty 
opened its museum in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when the villa is turned into a museum of classical antiquities, the 
first and only one in the country, the building will become much more relevant. 
The building itself will become an object in the exhibit that must be preserved 
and even improved in its faithfulness," Silvetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Paul Getty's architectural folly has not only survived its baptism by 
ridicule, it has become a beloved cultural monument, and Silvetti is thrilled 
with the prospect of working there. "It's such a special commission, such a 
special institution and such a special city, we are very excited. It's the kind 
of work we have been dreaming of," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said that activities at the refurbished villa will better reflect the 
full, multidisciplinary spectrum of the trust's programs. In addition to 
serving as a public museum, the facility will be a site for antiquities-related 
projects involving branches of the trust that focus on art history, 
conservation and education. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years of staff discussions to determine the future use of the villa 
preceded the appointment of master planners, Williams said. Programs are still 
evolving, but the consensus that emerged is that the museum's collection should 
not be an end itself but a catalyst for new scholarship, scientific research, 
public education and exhibitions placing the objects in a broad context and 
relating them to other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Getty Conservation Institute might establish a program for archeological 
conservation at the villa, Williams said, and its projects might include public 
programs on the importance and methods of preserving cultural artifacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Offering an example of the kind of exhibitions visitors might see at the 
Getty's planned antiquities museum, he suggested a show that would compare and 
contrast Greek and Roman civilizations with Central America's Mayan and Aztec 
civilizations. 
</P>
<P>
 No date has been set for the completion of the renovation, Williams said, but 
in 1997 the villa will be closed for construction.

PBS TELLS YOUNG VIEWERS: IT'S TIME TO LEARN; TELEVISION: A BLOCK OF CHILDREN'S 
PROGRAMS WILL BE OFFERED WEEKDAYS FOR UP TO 10 HOURS ON 11 STATIONS, INCLUDING 
KCET.

 Ready, set . . . "Ready to Learn. " 
</P>
<P>
 With much fanfare, including announcements packaged in a clear plastic replica 
of a child's briefcase, PBS this week launched its much-ballyhooed "Ready to 
Learn Service" for children 2-12. 
</P>
<P>
 But at first blush, it appears that it's mainly the labeling and packaging 
that have changed. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the "Ready to Learn" package, up to 10 hours of children's 
programming will be offered weekdays on 11 public TV stations in 10 markets -- 
including Los Angeles' KCET-TV Channel 28 -- roughly 25% of U.S. households. 
Previously, PBS had offered about seven hours a day of children's programming. 
</P>
<P>
 All of it is familiar stuff -- including Mr. Rogers, Barney, Lamb Chop, 
"Reading Rainbow" and, of course, "Sesame Street." Even the so-called new show 
in the summer lineup -- KCET's "Storytime" -- has been running nationally since 
June 6 (and locally since October, 1992). 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Cahn, PBS' director of children's programming, isn't bothered by the 
lack of fresh programming. "Kids want to watch their favorite things over and 
over again," she notes, "and a sense of consistency is very important to us. I 
don't feel a real need to premiere brand-new stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, "Ready to Learn" contains repeats within each day's schedule. On the 
nine-hour feed, 2 1/2 hours duplicate each other. On a 10-hour feed, there are 
3 1/2 hours of duplication. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one who cares about their children would want them spending that much time 
in front of a television set," Cahn explains. "(We're) providing a safe haven 
for parents and kids (to find) programming that's entertaining, educational, 
engaging, motivational. . . . We're kind of like a supermarket. You don't buy 
everything you see on the shelves but it's good to know it's all available." 
</P>
<P>
 At KCET, the children's program schedule has a morning block airing from 6 
a.m. to noon and afternoon programming from 4 to 5:30 p.m. On July 25, the 
station will add a second half-hour of "Storytime" at noon and a second 
half-hour of "Reading Rainbow" at 12:30 -- bringing the total to 8 1/2 hours a 
day of children's programming.  
</P>
<P>
 A station spokeswoman said KCET was delaying the additional hour to complete 
college telecourses.  
</P>
<P>
 KCET, meanwhile, is playing a key role in new children's program production. 
"Storytime," a $3.6-million production, is designed to get preschoolers to read 
by having such actors as Tom Selleck, A Martinez and Cloris Leachman read 
stories to children. "The Puzzleworks," which KCET is co-producing with Lancit 
Media Productions Ltd. of New York ("Reading Rainbow"), will air in January. 
"Puzzleworks," featuring a cast of multicultural "people puppets," is designed, 
says PBS, to "help preschoolers and their care-givers understand the values of 
diversity and individuality." It has received $8 million in funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Two new programs will join the "Ready to Learn" package in the fall: 
</P>
<P>
 * On Sept. 11, "The Magic School Bus" arrives. The animated series is based on 
the popular children's book series. Lily Tomlin is the voice of Mrs. Frizzle, a 
teacher who stimulates students' passion for science by taking them on unusual 
field trips with the help of a magic bus. 
</P>
<P>
 * On Oct. 10, "Bill Nye the Science Guy" comes on board. A co-production of 
KCTS Seattle and Disney's Buena Vista Television, it has been airing in 
syndication on commercial stations. 
</P>
<P>
 While a dozen or more children's programs are now in the production pipeline, 
Cahn estimates three to five more programs will be added to "Ready to Learn" in 
the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
 As "glue" between programs, "Ready to Learn" will intersperse a series of 
fast-paced 15- to 60-second segments on such topics as information gathering, 
task completion and negotiation skills. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 37 additional stations will begin the "Ready to Learn" service, 
covering half the country. The service will be available to all PBS outlets in 
1996.

VAN CLIBURN TO CONTINUE TOUR; NO REFUNDS FOR BOWL PATRONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 Despite the lightheadedness that caused Van Cliburn to interrupt his concert 
Monday night at the Hollywood Bowl, a spokeswoman for the pianist said Tuesday 
that he is in good health and will continue his 16-city United States tour with 
the Moscow Philharmonic as planned.  
</P>
<P>
 Cliburn's Los Angeles performance was the first official appearance on a 
comeback tour after going into retirement in 1978. The pianist also performed 
in a preview concert Saturday in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 After announcing that he would not play the Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 3, 
Cliburn played four short solo pieces during the second half of the Monday 
concert. Surprised audiences mostly stayed in their seats, and some offered 
standing ovations when he finished each piece. The Moscow orchestra sat 
silently behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 After the event, a number of disgruntled patrons reportedly went to the Bowl 
box office, which was closed, seeking refunds for tickets that ranged in price 
from $10 to $250, well above the usual price range for Bowl tickets. Among them 
was Norman Potter of Hermosa Beach, who told The Times on Tuesday, "I was 
mortified at the treatment of the members of this world-class orchestra (the 
Moscow Philharmonic), in keeping them sitting there all that time, without 
their conductor, and without playing. That's the height of Ugly Americanism." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday morning, while the pianist and his entourage were flying home to 
Texas, Barbara Clarkson of the Van Cliburn Foundation in Ft. Worth said, "As 
far as we know, the tour (scheduled to resume in Garland, Tex., Friday night) 
will continue, with the same repertory as announced. Mr. Cliburn is feeling 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Tilley, president of the board of the foundation, was unavailable for 
further comment, since she was traveling with Cliburn.

<P>
 There will be no refunds for ticket-holders, according to Stephen Belth, 
senior director for marketing and communications for the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic. Although the Philharmonic did not sponsor the concert, it 
administers concerts at the Hollywood Bowl, and Belth said that "there is a 
no-refund policy on this program since it was a full concert that went beyond 
intermission." 
</P>
<P>
 Belth said that complaints about the concert should be addressed to the World 
Cup organizers care of the Hollywood Bowl, 2301 N. Highland Ave., Los Angeles 
90078.

FAMILY; SHAKESPEARE FOR CHILDREN IN OUTDOOR FESTIVAL SETTING

 It's a bird, it's a plane . . . no, it's Super Shakespeare -- able to recite 
all 154 Shakespearean sonnets upon demand.  
</P>
<P>
 The caped Bardaholic, otherwise known as actor Paul Bordman, will be joined by 
jugglers, storytellers, puppeteers, musicians, a 15-minute production of 
"Hamlet" and bilingual magician Brandon Scott, who performs in Spanish and 
English. It's all part of the child-friendly Shakespeare Family Festival, being 
held in the Japanese Garden of the West Los Angeles Veterans Administration 
complex on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented by the Shakespeare Festival/LA theater company to complement its 
ongoing evening production of "Twelfth Night," the festival "is an opportunity 
to introduce young people to Shakespeare in a very informal way," according to 
festival producer Gail Leone. 
</P>
<P>
 The outdoor fantasy setting, with costumed entertainers, fencing 
demonstrations, a juggling workshop, Renaissance-flavored live music, crafts, 
art exhibitions and games, is "the perfect environment" to expose children and 
families to live theater in a very palatable way, Leone said. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival's most important element is audience involvement, she noted. 
Children are encouraged to come as a character from a Shakespeare play and 
enter the festival's daily costume contest -- and, if a junior Macbeth or 
Richard III aren't quite the ticket, keep in mind that an old Halloween witch's 
costume or sparkily fairy wings will do. Audience volunteers also get a chance 
to dress up during puppeteer Judith Kory's comic theater presentation of 
"Goldenlox and the Three Fools." 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is free; craft, workshop and vendor fees will go toward Shakespeare 
Festival/LA's "Will Power to the Schools" educational outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shakespeare Family Festival, Japanese Gardens, West L.A. Veterans 
Administration complex, entrance on Wilshire Boulevard, west of the 405 
freeway. Saturday-Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. (213) 489-4127, Ext. 31.

 Newsmagazines made another strong showing in the television ratings last week, 
led by "60 Minutes," which topped the popularity list released Tuesday by the 
A. C. Nielsen Co. The long-running CBS series was seen in 14.6 million homes on 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Other newsmagazines finishing among the week's Top 20 were ABC's "20/20," 
"PrimeTime Live" and "Turning Point," and two installments of "Dateline NBC." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC edged out CBS in the weekly network competition, but none of the Big Three 
had much to crow about: Together they attracted only 48% of the prime-time 
audience--down from the 60% they averaged during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 In its second week out, "Models Inc." lost about 18% of the viewers from its 
initial outing on Fox. But the ratings were still good enough to rank 39th 
among the week's 91 prime-time network programs. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS did not fare so well with a new sitcom, "Muddling Through," which placed 
66th. And ABC's two-hour special about AIDS, "In a New Light," attracted only 
6% of the available audience Saturday night and finished last. Southland

PRUDENTIAL'S FRAUD COSTS NOW TOP $1 BILLION; SECURITIES: THE ADDITIONAL 
RESERVES FOR INVESTORS' CLAIMS WILL MORE THAN ERASE THE BROKERAGE'S PROFIT FOR 
THE FIRST HALF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Prudential Securities said Tuesday that it has set aside an additional $305 
million to pay investors' fraud claims, making its limited partnership debacle 
one of Wall Street's costliest scandals ever and more than wiping out the 
firm's profit for the first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential Securities also disclosed that parent company Prudential Insurance 
has injected $180 million of new capital into the Wall Street subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 The new reserve pushes the total amount Prudential Securities has had to set 
aside for customers' claims over the last three years to more than $1.1 
billion. The claims stem from Prudential Securities' limited partnership 
debacle, which led to charges last year by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission, numerous lawsuits and a pending federal criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The reserve means Prudential Securities will report a net loss of $215 million 
for the second quarter of 1994 and a net loss for the first six months of the 
year of $180 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The capital injection by Newark, N.J.-based Prudential Insurance marks the 
first time the parent has had to put in money as a result of the brokerage 
firm's legal woes. The parent last had to put in $215 million in 1990, after 
Prudential Securities' costly failure to expand its investment banking 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joseph Vecchione, the parent firm's chief spokesman, said there are no 
plans to oust Prudential Securities' management or to sell the firm. "We think 
that Prudential Securities is doing a good job of dealing with a very difficult 
problem from the past," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The additional capital restores the brokerage's capital base to $887 million, 
where it was at the end of 1993, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until earlier this year, the exceptionally buoyant stock market had enabled 
the brokerage to show a profit despite having to pay investors' claims. But the 
recent downturn in the market raises questions about Prudential Securities' 
ability to keep paying claims that repeatedly exceed estimates.  
</P>
<P>
 Even without the $305-million reserve, the brokerage said, it would have shown 
a loss for the second quarter of $35 million, because trading profits and 
securities sales dropped with the falling market.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the firm settled SEC charges and agreed to create a fund of $330 
million to reimburse investors. But the firm has had to set aside much more 
than that because of pending private lawsuits and arbitration claims. 
Prudential Securities spokesman William J. Ahearn said the firm is being forced 
to pay out more in interest on investors' losses than anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal woes resulted from Prudential's sale of about $8 billion in limited 
partnership interests, mainly to small investors, beginning in the early 1980s. 
Most of the investments produced heavy losses.

ELEKTRA CHIEF BOB KRASNOW ABRUPTLY QUITS; ENTERTAINMENT: CHAIRMAN OF RECENTLY 
REALIGNED WARNER MUSIC UNIT CITES SUDDEN EXCLUSION FROM THE CORPORATE INNER 
CIRCLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The first casualty in the corporate shake-up at Warner Music Group occurred 
Tuesday as Elektra Entertainment Chairman Bob Krasnow abruptly resigned. At the 
same time, Warner Bros. Records Chairman Mo Ostin indicated that he will remain 
in place under the new regime. 
</P>
<P>
 The future of both executives was called into question Monday when Warner 
Music Group announced a realignment that requires Ostin and Krasnow to report 
to former Atlantic Group Chairman Doug Morris, who was elevated to the top of 
Time Warner Inc.'s new domestic music division. 
</P>
<P>
 The realignment was orchestrated by Warner Music Group Chairman Robert 
Morgado, who is trying to stimulate business at the labels. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Krasnow -- who masterminded the success of such acts as 
Metallica, Natalie Cole and Tracy Chapman during his 11-year-tenure -- blamed 
his departure on his exclusion from the new corporate inner circle. A Warner 
Music Group spokeswoman confirmed that Krasnow resigned, but she declined to 
comment further. Krasnow, who is said to have had two years left on his 
contract, did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
 The 59-year-old executive, widely respected for his keen musical ear and bold 
decisions, has been dogged recently by Elektra's lackluster chart and fiscal 
performance. Once the toast of the industry, the eclectic New York label has 
been sorely lagging behind its sister companies, Atlantic Group and Warner 
Bros. Records. 
</P>
<P>
 EastWest Chief Executive Sylvia Rhone, a 13-year Warner Atlantic veteran who 
has overseen the success of such acts as En Vogue and Pantera, could take over 
the reins at Elektra as early as next week, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Krasnow's sudden resignation was the talk of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has good years and bad years, but as far as I'm concerned Bob 
Krasnow is one of the smartest and most talented executives working in the 
music business these days," music mogul David Geffen said. "His track record as 
a talent scout is impeccable. My guess is Bob will do fantastic wherever he 
ends up deciding to work." 
</P>
<P>
 At Warner, sources said Ostin privately committed to remaining as chairman 
even though he is upset by the changes at the company. He will concentrate on 
overseeing a series of much-anticipated releases by such blockbuster artists as 
R.E.M., Madonna, Prince, Eric Clapton, Van Halen, Neil Young and the Red Hot 
Chili  
</P>
<P>
 Peppers. Ostin's contract runs through the end of the year, but sources said 
he is expected to continue at the helm until at least 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Interscope co-chief Jimmy Iovine denied rumors that he is being groomed to 
take over Ostin's position at Warner Bros. Records. 
</P>
<P>
 "These rumors are absurd," he said. "Interscope is taking up all of my 
available time. Besides, Mo is the preeminent record executive and someone I 
greatly admire."

DODGING THE BULLETS; ARCO RESISTS DEALER REQUESTS TO INSTALL BULLETPROOF GLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two recent holdup attempts at Southern California gasoline service stations -- 
one of which ended in a slaying -- have boosted efforts by dealers to force 
Atlantic Richfield Co. to install bullet-resistant glass and other safety 
features at its facilities in high-crime neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullet-resistant glass cages for station attendants have become increasingly 
common in urban areas around the country in the past decade. But Arco has 
resisted installing them at its facilities, citing mixed reviews of their 
effectiveness from security experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "They aren't a definite lifesaver," Arco spokeswoman Annie Reutinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 2, Gonzalo Garcia Alvarez, a 22-year-old Arco attendant in Long Beach, 
was shot to death in a robbery attempt, the fourth slaying at an Arco facility 
in the Los Angeles area in the past year.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great kid," station owner Frank Cappello said. "I'm devastated." 
Cappello said two attendants have quit since the killing, citing fear for their 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Some dealers were quick to note that five days after Alvarez was killed, a 
Mobil Corp. attendant in Gardena was saved by bulletproof glass after being 
fired on five times by a would-be robber.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you go to any Chevron, Shell, Mobil, Texaco or independent -- I don't care 
in what neighborhood -- most of their lessee operations in 24-hour stations 
operate from bulletproof enclosures with a pass-through drawer," said Charlie 
Mulcahy, a Wilmington Arco dealer and board member of the Automotive Trade 
Organizations of California, which represents 89 of the 1,100 Arco dealers in 
California, as well as other brand-name operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unusual that the Arco franchisee is the only one out there without a 
bulletproof enclosure," Mulcahy said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the latest survey by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, about 
4% of all workplace killings occur at service stations. "It's a very dangerous 
occupation," said Guy Toscano, program manager for the bureau's census of fatal 
occupational injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Arco and many police crime experts and safety consultants say 
bullet-resistant glass does not always prevent crime at service stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've avoided jumping on the bandwagon for bulletproof glass," said Arco's 
Reutinger. "None of the statistics have shown that it is the cure-all for 
deterring crime. And the issue is not just to make the cashier safe, but to 
secure the entire premises." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, groups ranging from the National Assn. of Convenience Stores to the 
LAPD Crime Prevention Unit have studied the matter without issuing clear-cut 
recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we don't want is for a bullet-resistant barrier to create a false sense 
of security, where an employee may try to resist a robber -- and maybe not even 
give up the money," said Teri Richman, a spokeswoman for the national 
convenience store group. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there has never been a systematic study of how effective 
bullet-resistant enclosures really are. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true that a bullet-resistant enclosure can thwart some robbery 
attempts," said Bill Longacre, a 20-year LAPD officer who has spent the past 
six years specializing in crime prevention through building and site design. 
But Longacre says such barriers can also produce "these by-product problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Bullet-resistant glass, he says, can cause a rude customer to become more 
agitated, for instance. Worse, it has encouraged robbers to force attendants 
from behind the glass by taking customers hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 Longacre admitted, however, that "if I were standing there in a store, I would 
like to have something between me and an adrenaline-pumping robber." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, an LAPD survey of 19 homicides during robberies around gas 
stations, liquor stores and convenience stores over a one-year period in the 
city of Los Angeles found that most victims were customers, not clerks. "It's a 
corporate decision, not a law enforcement decision," Longacre said. 
</P>
<P>
 Policies vary at other brand-name companies. Shell Oil Co. evaluates requests 
for beefed-up security from its dealers on a site-by-site basis. And Shell pays 
for bullet-resistant glass when it deems it necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past five years, Mobil has had a similar policy, while Texaco is 
evaluating requests for bullet-resistant glass from several of its dealers but 
hasn't yet adopted a formal policy. (No attendants were slain at Shell, Texaco 
or Mobil stations in Southern California during the past year.) 
</P>
<P>
 Arco allows franchise dealers to install bullet-resistant glass if they pay 
for it themselves -- as their contracts call for -- and if it meets Arco 
specifications. The company also recently agreed to pay for a trial of 
bullet-resistant glass at a Wilmington franchise facility.  
</P>
<P>
 The test, however, is to determine how feasible it would be to conduct 
business with a glass enclosure, not to gather statistics on the enclosure's 
crime-thwarting ability. 
</P>
<P>
 Arco also conducts regular security surveys of its company-owned and franchise 
facilities, Reutinger said, to develop improved policies for Arco-owned 
stations and recommendations for franchise facilities.  
</P>
<P>
 As it has after most other slayings, the company has offered a $25,000 reward 
for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the July 2 killer. Arco 
has spent more than $2.2 million nationwide for such rewards since 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 But the dealer group considers them less useful than preventive measures. And 
they believe that Arco's deep pockets put the company in a better position to 
pay for security improvements. The group estimates that bullet-resistant glass 
enclosures run from $10,000 to $35,000 each to install. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had members with beatings, pistol whippings -- and most of those take 
place after 11 (p.m.) and before 6 a.m.," said Janet L. Speelman, executive 
director of the dealers group, which used to be known as the Southern 
California Service Station Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Speelman wants Arco to install bullet-resistant kiosks with pass-through 
drawers in high-crime areas or allow franchisees to close down their 
convenience store operations without penalty during the most dangerous hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, Arco charges 14% in royalties to franchise operators, but discounts 
that to 11% for those that remain open 24 hours a day -- because customer 
traffic increases significantly when patrons know a facility is always open.  
</P>
<P>
 Staying open all night is "an important feature to the bottom line of the 
store," Reutinger said. Reducing the Risk 
</P>
<P>
 Robbery is the primary motive for workplace homicide. The National Institute 
for Occupational Safety and Health advises: 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not work alone at night if you handle money. 
</P>
<P>
 * Work behind bulletproof enclosures if possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Install alarm systems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Train employees in security practices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide job counseling for employees. WHERE WORKPLACE DEATHS OCCUR 
</P>
<P>
 Murders by industry for 1992: Hotels and other service jobs: 19% Food stores: 
18% Eating and drinking places: 14% Other retail: 13% Taxicabs: 9% Police 
protection: 5% Gas stations: 4% Other: 18%

JAMES FLANIGAN: NORTH KOREA TODAY: A NEED TO JOIN ASIAN DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To understand what's ahead for the Korean peninsula now that North Korea's 
leader, Kim Il Sung, has died and there are worries over the ability of his 
son, Kim Jong Il, to succeed him, stop thinking in terms of the Cold War -- of 
North Korea as resolute member of the Communist bloc or as a loony-bin house of 
horrors where a bloody factional struggle is about to erupt. 
</P>
<P>
 Think rather of regional development and the interest of North Korea's 
neighbors -- particularly China -- that there be no disruption in the area. And 
think of the late Kim Il Sung's reaching out to the United States just before 
he died in an attempt to integrate North Korea into Asia's rapidly developing 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, there's always a chance of strife when a longtime dictator passes from 
the scene, concedes a manager of investments in South Korea, but it's just as 
likely that what you'll see next in North Korea is Kim Jong Il reaching out for 
foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The country may have several cards to play to get such investment, says Andrew 
Kim of Sit/Kim International, a New York institutional investment firm. "Kim 
Jong Il should be asking for Japanese war reparations, U.S. aid and investment 
from South Korean and multinational companies," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the wisest policy for the United States and South Korea would be to 
flood North Korea with food, clothing and consumer goods. Send in surplus 
grain, fashionable clothes and a few thousand Kia cars from South Korea (the 
model we know as the Ford Festiva). That would give North Koreans an 
introduction to the joys of motoring and help Kim Jong Il succeed his father 
without factional fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the consumer goods are already coming in. A healthy border trade 
carried on by Chinese merchants is relieving some of the tedium in an economy 
that has grown poorer in recent years while the rest of Asia advanced 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The gap in Korean living standards is immense: The output of goods and 
services of North Korea's 22 million people is only $869 a person, while that 
of South Korea's 44 million people is fully eight times that, at $6,850 a 
person. 
</P>
<P>
 The dangers are many and obvious. If factional fighting broke out and North 
Korea's moribund economy collapsed totally, South Korea would have to take on 
the support of a far less productive population half the size of its own. Once 
upon a time, South Korea wanted rapid reunification with the north; now it 
wants gradual development of economic ties. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not to mention the even greater danger a disorderly North Korea, 
possessing nuclear materials and an enormous army, would present to South Korea 
and to 33,000 U.S. troops stationed there. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are also great opportunities. If North Korea remains a separate 
state gradually developing its economy, South Korea's major companies could 
benefit from less costly production in the north. Japanese business would also 
be an early investor. 
</P>
<P>
 And these days, the positive scenario is more likely than the negative simply 
because North Korea has no allies and no support from any country, including 
China, if it doesn't develop economically. 
</P>
<P>
 A point to remember is that North Korea has always feared being isolated. Kim 
Il Sung, a clever despot who tried to rule by taking advantage of help from 
both the Soviet Union and China, considered opening Korea to the West in the 
early 1970s, according to Suh Dae Suk of the University of Hawaii, a highly 
respected Korean historian who wrote a biography of Kim in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim's efforts in the '70s, when both Communist powers were welcoming President 
Nixon, came to nought. But lately, with the Soviet Union dismantled and China 
encouraging capitalist development, Kim tried again by welcoming former 
President Jimmy Carter and agreeing to participate in talks with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 It's likely his intentions will be carried out by Kim Jong Il, 52, who has run 
day-to-day government operations in North Korea for the last two years. Kim 
Jong Il has a reputation as a womanizing flake and a sponsor of terrorism, but 
that doesn't mean he or his military officers are unaware of North Korea's 
desperate need to join in Asia's development. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cold War is over and attitudes are changing -- and not only in North 
Korea," says Michael Robinson, a specialist in Korean history at USC. In South 
Korea, the North is no longer seen simply as a place of Socialist demons, but 
as part of the common development of the modern Korean economy that began at 
the turn of the century, when Korea came under Japanese rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, Robinson reports, Korean development is being seen in the 
context of a century of Asian development marked by revolutions from dynastic 
rule in China and Korea, by the end of colonialism and by war and conquest. 
</P>
<P>
 Such philosophical change provides a foundation on which South and North Korea 
could cooperate in developments that have immense potential. If North Korea's 
economy could be brought even to near parity with that of South Korea, the 
combined Korean economy would be one of the most productive and one of the 
richest on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am basically optimistic but cautious," says John Lee, a manager for the 
Korea Fund, which has more than $300 million invested in South Korean 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Korea Fund, which trades -- lately at $22.375 a share -- on the 
New York Stock Exchange, hit its all-time high of $43 a share in 1989, when the 
Berlin Wall fell and optimism ran high that a new era was beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentiment was premature then, but it may be getting a chance to come true 
now on the Korean peninsula.

WHOLESALE PRICES REMAIN FLAT IN JUNE; ECONOMY: THE LABOR DEPARTMENT REPORT 
SHOWS AN ANNUAL INFLATION RATE OF 1.6% FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF '94. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Labor Department said Tuesday that wholesale prices remained in check last 
month, easing some analysts' concerns that inflation is heating up but putting 
renewed downward pressure on the battered U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
 The report shows that the prices producers charged their retail customers -- a 
key indicator of which way prices will move when they finally hit store shelves 
-- were unchanged in June from their May levels. It was the third month in a 
row that prices have not climbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some economists said the good inflation news could dissuade the Federal 
Reserve Board from raising short-term interest rates again soon in its battle 
to keep price increases under control. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the chances of another round of interest rate hikes apparently 
reduced, traders once again sent the dollar tumbling against most major foreign 
currencies Tuesday before the greenback rallied late in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed at 97.50 yen in New York trading, off from 97.75 yen Monday. 
It had fallen to 96.55 yen early Tuesday morning, a postwar low. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department's inflation report says wholesale prices for food were 
flat last month, while tobacco prices dropped. Energy prices edged up 0.3% 
after dropping a full percentage point in May. 
</P>
<P>
 If the volatile food and energy sectors are excluded, the so-called core rate 
of inflation actually fell 0.1% last month. Inflation in the first six months 
of the year ran at a modest 1.6% annual rate, even lower than the 1.9% rate in 
the first half of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "If inflation runs more than 3% this year, I'll eat my computer printouts," 
said Ron Schreibman, executive director of the National Assn. of Wholesale 
Distributors in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Schreibman and some other analysts said Tuesday's report relieves pressure on 
the Fed to raise short-term interest rates again soon. The Fed has raised rates 
four times in the past five months to keep inflation in check and the economy 
from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 But other experts disagreed, noting that the economy added a robust 1 million 
jobs over the past few months. With prices for oil and many other raw materials 
beginning to rise, inflation is far from dead, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's report of flat producer prices was "a nice surprise, but 
inflationary pressures are still out there building," said David Munro, an 
analyst for the New York research firm High Frequency Economics. "There's still 
room for the Fed to push rates higher." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Fed thinks another rate hike is needed, this could be an ideal time to 
get it out of the way, some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the economy still humming along, it would be difficult for either the 
Clinton Administration or Congress to complain that a rate hike as high as 
one-half or even three-quarters of a percentage point could throw the country 
back into recession. 
</P>
<P>
 An increase in short-term rates could also bolster the dollar, because rates 
on Treasury bills and other U.S. investments would rise. Higher rates in 
America could attract more foreign money, which would tend to make the 
greenback stronger, experts said.

 Consumer Credit Up $10.4 Billion: Americans' credit card purchases increased 
for the 14th consecutive month in May, bringing installment credit to a 
seasonally adjusted $837.701 billion after an increase of $10.115 billion in 
April, the Federal Reserve said.The annual rate of borrowing was 15.1% in May, 
up from 14.9% in April. The figures are based on benchmark revisions on 
statistics from 1989 to 1994. Although monthly increases are larger than before 
as a result of the revisions, the trend in borrowing hasn't changed.

STRONG/CORNELIUSON TO REPAY THREE OF ITS FUNDS TO SETTLE SEC CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Strong/Corneliuson mutual fund group agreed Tuesday to repay $444,299 to 
three of its funds to settle charges by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
that it failed to comply with federal laws in more than 600 transactions 
between 1987 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC action named not only Strong/Corneliuson Capital Management, which has 
more than $10 billion in assets, but also its chairman, Richard Strong, and 
chief financial officer, Bruce Behling. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue are SEC rules governing the transfer of assets between affiliated 
mutual funds, transactions known as cross trades. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC alleged that many of Strong/Corneliuson's cross trades -- mainly 
involving junk bonds -- failed to comply with the rules because the bonds were 
improperly priced by the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Without admitting or denying guilt, the Menominee Falls, Wis.-based firm 
agreed to repay $327,506 to the Strong/Corneliuson Total Return Fund, $70,563 
to its Discovery Fund and $46,230 to its Advantage Fund. The figures represent 
the net effect of pricing errors in the trades, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong and Behling were censured but not fined. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC also alleged that Richard Strong purchased and sold securities for his 
own account that had been recommended to clients -- a conflict of interest.

NORTHROP TO BUY REST OF VOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Northrop Grumman Corp. said Tuesday that it agreed to buy the 51% of Vought 
Aircraft Co. it does not already own for $130 million from Carlyle Group, a 
Washington investment partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas-based Vought makes large sections of commercial and military airplanes, 
including Northrop's B-2 Stealth bomber and Boeing Co.'s 747 jumbo passenger 
jet. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is not a surprise. Northrop, the Los Angeles-based aerospace and 
defense concern that recently bought Grumman Corp. for $2.2 billion, was 
expected to buy the rest of Vought to further expand its airplane subassembly 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop's Hawthorne operation, for instance, makes the fuselages for the 747, 
and its newly acquired Grumman unit makes wing sections, flaps and other parts 
for several Boeing jets. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Northrop exercised its option for the rest of Vought earlier than 
planned. When Northrop and Carlyle jointly bought Vought in 1992 from LTV 
Corp., Northrop was given the option to buy Carlyle's share beginning in 
September, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 But Northrop said it is buying Vought now because it is already in the process 
of merging Grumman's aerostructures business with its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as they concluded the Grumman deal, it was clear that if they were 
going to do Vought, now was the time to do it," said Jerry Cantwell, an 
aerospace analyst with Lionheart Research in New York. "Why go through all of 
that disruption twice?" 
</P>
<P>
 Cantwell also predicted that Grumman's airplane parts units, located mostly 
along the East Coast, are "all going to migrate to Dallas" so Northrop can cut 
costs through streamlining. 
</P>
<P>
 That raised the question of whether Northrop also might weigh whether to shift 
its 747 work in Hawthorne, which employs 1,250 people, to Dallas. Northrop 
spokesman Tony Cantafio said it would be premature to comment on facilities, 
but added, "Clearly, we intend to maintain a 747 presence in California."

NATIONAL MEDICAL-SEC SETTLEMENT OKD; HEALTH CARE: THE HOSPITAL COMPANY HAD 
AGREED TO PAY $379 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH FRAUD CHARGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 National Medical Enterprises said Tuesday that a federal judge approved an 
agreement to settle federal securities fraud charges involving activities at 
the company's psychiatric and substance-abuse facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission was part of broad 
negotiations between NME and the federal government.The company last month 
pleaded guilty to eight federal criminal counts and agreed to pay $379 million 
in fines and restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC had accused NME of making false statements in required federal filings 
and annual reports from 1990 through late 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 The SEC alleged that the company misled investors by improperly recording its 
sales and profits and by failing to disclose that its businesses "were subject 
to material risks" arising from practices at some of its psychiatric and 
substance-abuse facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "NME knew or recklessly disregarded the likelihood that, as a result of these 
practices, a substantial portion of insurance billings" from those facilities 
could be the subjects of fraud claims from private insurers and the federal 
government, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement, filed in U.S. District Court in Washington, includes no 
additional financial penalties against the Santa Monica-based hospital company. 
In agreeing to the settlement, NME neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen P. Mahoney, an SEC attorney, said the agency is continuing its 
investigation of the NME case but that the settlement completes its action 
against the company.  
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the record settlement with NME last month, Justice Department 
officials said the government would continue to investigate NME officials, 
doctors and sources of patient referrals involved in the fraud.

WHITE HOUSE SHRINKS ESTIMATES ON DEFICIT; ECONOMY: THE ADMINISTRATION'S MIDYEAR 
REPORT SAYS THE RECOVERY IS EASING THE RED INK FASTER THAN IT HAD PREDICTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, trumpeting perhaps its most important economic 
policy achievement, said Tuesday that the federal deficit is shrinking faster 
than even the White House expected in response to accelerating economic growth. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials now estimate the deficit will decline to $167.1 
billion in 1995, and they say the Clinton economic plan should result in a 
cumulative $691.7 billion in deficit reduction over five years. Originally, 
President Clinton claimed that the deficit would shrink by about $500 billion 
over five years if his 1993 economic package was passed by Congress.  
</P>
<P>
 The new figures, included in the Administration's midyear review of the budget 
to be officially released Thursday, also show that Clinton should come close to 
achieving his goal, first stated during the 1992 presidential campaign, of 
cutting the deficit in half during his first term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 The new forecast for fiscal 1995 calls for the deficit, as a share of the 
overall economy, to decline to its lowest level since 1979. When Clinton came 
into office, his Administration projected that the deficit in 1995 would hit 
$301.8 billion unless his economic plan was approved by Congress. And even in 
its last full budget last winter, the White House predicted that next year's 
deficit would total $176.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1994, the Administration now estimates the deficit will hit $220.1 
billion, down from February's prediction of $234.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually all of the improvement in the deficit outlook since the 
Administration's last official projection was issued last winter has come as a 
result of accelerating economic growth.  
</P>
<P>
 Faster growth puts more people back to work, which means they pay more taxes 
to the federal government. More employment also tends to lower the welfare 
rolls, holding down Medicaid health care costs for welfare recipients. Growth 
also leads to healthier banks and savings and loans, thus lowering federal 
costs for bank and thrift bailouts.  
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we were targeting about $500 billion in deficit reduction over 
five years; we're now looking at close to $700 billion. . . . Of that $200 
billion, a good portion comes from revenues that are flowing in above our 
expectations because of economic performance, and we have gotten some smaller 
costs in the health care area as well," White House Budget Director Leon 
Panetta said. The news briefing to announce the figures marked Panetta's last 
public appearance as budget director; he is moving at the end of the week to 
the White House to become chief of staff. He will be succeeded at the Office of 
Management and Budget by his deputy, Alice Rivlin, who, like Panetta, is widely 
considered a deficit hawk. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the new figures show that rising interest rates will create a larger 
deficit in later years. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House said that beginning in 1996, the effect of this year's rising 
interest rates will more than offset the positive impact of faster growth, 
resulting in a deficit of $179.2 billion, up slightly from February's estimate 
of $173.1 billion. But that is still far below the Administration's initial 
projection, made in early 1993, that the deficit would reach $298 billion in 
1996 without the Clinton plan. The budget deficit hit its all-time record of 
$290 billion in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's new report is certain to renew the partisan debate in 
Washington over the degree to which Clinton can claim credit for improved 
outlooks for the deficit and the economy. Most private economists argue that 
the Clinton plan has had relatively little to do with the overall recovery. 
Deficit in Decline?

the President's economic plan, in billions: 06,15,08,08,08,08,08 1994 1995 1996

 MetLife Broadens Settlement: Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., accused of 
misleading consumers by selling its whole life policies as retirement or 
savings accounts, agreed to expand the terms of an earlier settlement, making 
it easier for California victims to collect restitution.Under the deal 
announced by state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, MetLife will 
compensate not only consumers with evidence of misrepresentation, but also 
those who feel they were misled but lack evidence. The deadline for filing 
claims has been extended to Sept. 30, 1995, from June 30, 1994. As part of a 
national settlement last March, MetLife originally agreed to pay a $1.1-million 
fine, plus reimbursement averaging $1,000 apiece to about 2,700 California 
consumers.

 Ford, Chrysler Win U.S. Fuel Cell Contracts: The auto makers have been the 
awarded contracts as part of a federal effort to develop a new generation of 
vehicles to meet strict environmental standards and triple the fuel economy of 
gasoline-powered internal combustion engines, the nonprofit Fuel Cells 2000 
group said. The Ford contract is for $13.8 million; Chrysler's Pentastar 
Electronics Inc. contract is for $15 million. Fuel cells act like continuously 
renewed batteries, combining hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and 
water, without combustion and its attendant pollution.

trying to recover from huge losses in government bond trading suffered earlier 
this year, said it has fired a trader in its London office for allegedly hiding 
$6 million in losses on options on French and Spanish government bonds. As a 
result, the Wall Street brokerage, already shaken by recent dismissals of 
several traders for improper dealings, is expected to take a $10-million pretax 
write-down in the second quarter, a spokesman said. The 34-year-old trader, 
Peter N.J. Bryant, was fired July 1 after a "routine closing of the books for 
the second quarter," John Liftin, Kidder's general counsel, said in a Wall 
Street Journal article.

 Ample Harvests Seen for U.S. Field Crops: The nation's corn, soybean and wheat 
farms will produce large crops this season, in contrast to the 
weather-decimated harvests of 1993, the U.S. Agriculture Department 
predicted.It forecast wheat production at 2.42 billion bushels, up 1% from last 
year. Durum wheat, used to make pasta, is estimated at 101 million bushels, up 
47% from last year and 4% more than in 1992. The government projected corn 
production at 9 billion bushels, which would be the second-largest corn harvest 
on record, and soybean output at 2.15 billion bushels. Estimates of winter 
wheat and tobacco harvests were below 1993 levels due to reductions in acreage 
planted.

 Study Links Weight, Height to Wages: Girls who were obese adolescents and boys 
who were short were found to have lower wages years later compared to their 
thinner and taller counterparts, a study shows. The Dartmouth College study of 
more than 12,500 people born in England, Scotland and Wales found girls who 
were fat at age 16 wound up with lower-paying jobs at age 23, even if they had 
since lost weight. The same was not true for overweight boys, but the study 
found that boys who were short at age 16 wound up making less than their taller 
counterparts by age 23.

 Commercial Real Estate Prices Up, Study Says: Prices were up for all major 
property types, posting the largest gain this decade in the first quarter, 
National Real Estate Index said.But the gains continued to be chalked up mainly 
in western states outside California and in the economically strong Sun Belt 
states, led by a surge in apartment property values, the research firm said in 
its quarterly report. Saying the commercial real estate market "is back," 
National Real Estate said its composite price index increased 1.8% in the 
quarter. That follows a 1.1% gain in the previous quarter and marks the fourth 
consecutive quarter the index has risen. It gained 3.0% for the 12 months ended 
March 31.

 Machines to Provide Tickets, Checks: Consumers across the nation will soon be 
able to pick up pre-ordered airline tickets and traveler's checks from machines 
placed in stores and other convenient locations, under the venture with Docunet 
Inc. The San Francisco-based company said it will be joined by Olivetti of 
Italy, Bell Atlantic Corp., Chemical Banking Corp. and General Motors Corp.'s 
Electronic Data Systems in building a network of the machines, to be introduced 
in Washington this fall. Southern California's Ralphs chain has agreed to 
install them in 170 supermarkets by early 1995, said Vajid Jafri, Docunet's

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: SOME INVESTORS TO GAIN FROM STATE'S BUDGETARY CRUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state of California will borrow a record amount of short-term money during 
the next two weeks to close its horrendous budget gap. For individual investors 
hungry for high short-term returns, the state's cash needs spell opportunity: 
Depending on your tax bracket, the yields on this debt could be lucrative. 
</P>
<P>
 Next Wednesday, California will sell $4 billion in revenue anticipation 
warrants (RAWs) maturing in 22 months (on April 25, 1996). On July 27, the 
state will borrow another $3 billion via revenue anticipation notes (RANs) 
maturing in 11 months (on June 22, 1995). 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented short-term borrowings have been necessitated by the state's 
continuing budget woes: The weak California economy has depressed tax revenue 
since 1990, while the Legislature has been unwilling since then to make the 
deep cuts in spending that would balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Hence, California has continued to roll over its growing deficits and now must 
go hat in hand to investors for a mammoth short-term loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the size of the borrowing, Wall Street remains confident in 
California's ability to repay these debts on time -- even though a long-term 
solution to the state's chronic cash shortage remains an issue of heated debate 
in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Moody's Investors Service and other credit- rating agencies are expected to 
rate the RAWs and the RANs, and many analysts expect most of the securities to 
get the highest safety rating. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the state has in effect been forced to buy investors' confidence: The bulk 
of the RAWs will be guaranteed by a syndicate of major banks and other 
institutions, which have agreed to purchase the securities from investors at 
maturity if the state can't repay them for any reason. The banks will get a fee 
for the guarantee, adding yet another taxpayer-borne cost to this deal. 
</P>
<P>
 For taxpayers who also are investors, the state's need for cash means a chance 
to profit even as you pay. Though the exact yields on the RAWs and RANs won't 
be determined until the securities are sold, Wall Street now expects the 
fixed-rate RANs to yield between 4% and 4.3%, annualized, over their 11-month 
life. In addition, some of the RANs will be issued with floating rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank-guaranteed RAWs are expected to yield 4.5% or better, annualized, 
over their 22-month life. Yields on the non-guaranteed portion of the RAWs 
could approach 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Because those yields are exempt from federal and state income tax, they are 
equivalent to substantially higher taxable yields, such as on bank savings 
certificates. The accompanying chart shows what 4% and 4.5% California tax-free 
yields are worth if fully taxed. 
</P>
<P>
 So the question is, are the RAN and RAW yields likely to be better than 
anything you can find today on taxable securities of the same maturities ? 
</P>
<P>
 That depends. Consider: If the 11-month RANs pay about 4%, that's a 
taxable-equivalent yield of 5.91% for a couple earning between $38,001 and 
$48,456. One-year bank CDs, which are fully taxable, pay about 4% today on 
average, so a CD owner would plainly be better off in a RAN yielding the 
taxable equivalent of 5.91%. 
</P>
<P>
 But compared to yields on U.S. Treasury securities -- which are subject to 
federal tax but not state tax -- RAN and RAW yields may look much less 
appealing. Based just on the 28% federal tax rate in the income bracket 
mentioned above, a 4% RAN yield would be worth a 5.55% one-year T-bill yield. 
That's only slightly above the current actual 5.53% T-bill yield. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher-income Californians generally will be better-rewarded, especially in 
RAWs. But that may not be true for investors subject to the federal 
"alternative minimum tax." Those investors should definitely contact a tax 
adviser before buying. 
</P>
<P>
 Other details on the RAN and RAW offers: 
</P>
<P>
 * Major banks and brokerages statewide are taking orders now. Though the 
official minimum is $5,000, many banks and brokers want individuals to put up 
at least $20,000 to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * You won't know the yield you're getting until the deals are finalized -- so 
there's a risk that yields could come in lower than expected. Another option is 
to wait to buy in the "after-market" -- that is, after the debt is issued and 
begins to trade. 
</P>
<P>
 * Interest on both the RANs and the RAWs is payable at maturity, so you'll get 
your return in one lump sum rather than in installments. This may be a problem 
for investors who might otherwise be interested in the 22-month RAWs but who 
need current income. Assessing Muni Yields 
</P>
<P>
 California will issue a record amount of short-term (11- to 22-month) debt in 
coming weeks, and the annualized tax-free yields are expected to be in the 
4%-to-4.5% range. Here are the equivalent taxable yields in various tax 
brackets, for married filers.(Single filers' tax rates are slightly higher.)

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; PLOWSHARES; FIRM SEEKS 
VESTED INTEREST IN VIDEO GAMES 
</P>

<P>
 Aura Systems Inc. is a little El Segundo firm that's trying to convert from 
"Star Wars" to Sega. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, formed in 1987 by several former Hughes Aircraft Co. engineers, 
started out developing electromagnetic devices for the operation of 
surveillance gear under the Strategic Defense Initiative, or "Star Wars." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Aura is aiming for the consumer video game market. In September, it plans 
to start selling a vest that players wear to "feel" the kicks, tackles, 
gunshots, bomb explosions and laser blasts that occur on their game screens. 
</P>
<P>
 The $99 adjustable vest weighs four pounds, is made of plastic with a nylon 
shoulder harness and can be plugged into the audio output of any game system, 
Aura says. The accessory also comes with a set of controls that allows players 
to adjust the intensity of sounds they want to feel and to filter out those 
they don't. 
</P>
<P>
 How does it work? As an action appears on the screen -- a boxer's right hook 
to his opponent, for instance -- its sound waves are fed into the vest. Aura's 
patented actuator, a device that uses electronic signals to create mechanical 
movements, translates the sound waves into vibrations that resonate throughout 
the vest. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't stereo speakers vibrate when the stereo's volume is cranked up? Of 
course. But those vibrations are simply caused by air moving from the speakers' 
components -- air movement that's widely dispersed and created only at high 
volume, said Harry Kurtzman, Aura's chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Aura's vest, by contrast, delivers its video game vibrations regardless of the 
volume, because the vibes are created by the moving actuator in the vest, not 
moving air. "Because of that, you can control the intensity and locality of the 
vibration," Kurtzman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aura, which has been a target lately of bearish investors who are speculating 
that the company's prospects won't materialize, nonetheless hopes to find other 
commercial uses for its actuator technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Among them: converting mechanical valve systems in car and truck engines to 
electrical systems, in which Aura's computer-driven actuators control the 
valves. That would eliminate the engine's cam shaft, mechanical valve lifters 
and other parts, making the engines more efficient and less polluting, Aura 
says. JAMES F. PELTZ

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; LAX: A UNIQUE 
ALTERNATIVE-FUEL LABORATORY; ENERGY: WITH THEIR LIMITED-DISTANCE DRIVES, 
AIRPORT VEHICLES ARE EASILY MONITORED AND REFUELED.

 Los Angeles International Airport, the world's fourth-busiest, has become the 
hottest testing ground in the country for research and demonstration programs 
in alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest project, Southern California Gas Co. and the Los Angeles 
Department of Airports this week unveiled three airport shuttles powered by 
liquefied natural gas -- the first such vehicles in the country. Airport 
officials plan to replace the rest of their 46-bus diesel fleet with the 
alternative-fuel shuttles over the next few years and to have a permanent 
fueling facility in place within 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere at the airport, electric baggage trains, propane vans and natural 
gas forklifts tote freight and luggage, airline snacks and fuel. Electric 
vehicle recharging stations, already in place in the United Airlines terminal 
area, will be built into the latest parking addition. And the second of two 
compressed natural gas fueling terminals will be installed by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Airports, as it happens, are uniquely suited to showcase alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has primarily to do with economics," says Warren I. Mitchell, president of 
Southern California Gas Co. "When you get into an operation where it is highly 
predictable -- how far the vehicles will travel, when they will refuel -- it 
allows you to optimize the infrastructure design. And you want a relatively 
high utilization of the refueling infrastructure." 
</P>
<P>
 An airport plays well to these strengths -- and downplays the major drawbacks 
of alternative fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most of these jobs, range isn't a big factor," says Bill Van Amburg, a 
spokesman for Calstart, the public-private consortium attempting to foster an 
advanced transportation industry in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're doing these loops," Van Amburg says of an airport vehicle's typically 
repetitive work pattern. "And all the refueling can be done at a central 
refueling site." 
</P>
<P>
 For their part, airport authorities and their tenant airlines have taken a 
keen interest in clean-fuel vehicles because they are under the regulatory gun 
as major air polluters. Air pollution regulations mandate that both the 
airlines and ground transporters in Southern California dramatically cut 
emissions over the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is an unequaled panorama of alternative-fuel projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Super Shuttle's fleet of 140 vans in Los Angeles and Orange counties, 22 
run on propane and two on natural gas. Hertz Corp. will field the nation's 
largest fleet of alternative-fuel rental cars -- up to 1,000 Ford Tauruses that 
can switch from methanol to gasoline -- at LAX and other Southern California 
airports over the next two years. Electric vehicles ranging from large buses to 
pickups are being added to the airport's own fleet. 
</P>
<P>
 United Airlines, with the largest facility at LAX, is experimenting the most 
among the airlines so far. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, 56 of United's 350 motorized vehicles have been 
converted to run on electricity, propane or natural gas. More will be converted 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Specific operations lend themselves to specific alternative fuels," says 
Walter B. Harri son, manager of United's plant and equipment maintenance at 
LAX. 
</P>
<P>
 Compressed natural gas seems to work well for bigger vehicles that not only 
pull heavy loads but also need to be roadworthy, Harrison has found. Now being 
powered by natural gas are two high-speed tugs that move large air-freight 
containers, three 19-passenger vans, a lavatory service truck, a couple of 
forklifts and a belt loader, which places bags and cargo into the "belly pits" 
of aircraft.  
</P>
<P>
 Inside United's immense, congested luggage-handling room, zero-emission 
vehicles -- in this case electrics -- "are the best to use and most comfortable 
for our employees," Harrison says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had our problems," he says, "but we're very encouraged. . . . It's 
doable." 
</P>
<P>
 LAX is also part of the National Airport Electrification Study, an effort to 
find the best uses of electric power at air terminals that is sponsored by U.S. 
electric utilities and the Electric Power Research Institute, the Palo 
Alto-based industry group. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport is a good showcase with its 45 million visitors a year. "When you 
put something out there, it's going to get worldwide attention," says Thomas J. 
Doughty, director of electric  
</P>
<P>
 transportation at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
</P>
<P>
 "The airport is like a little city, a microcosm of the larger cityscape," 
Doughty says. "You can try different mixes of transportation systems."

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; ANTITRUST PROBE OF SONY, 
PHILIPS FOCUSES ON LICENSING PRACTICES; MUSIC: THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS FIRMS 
JOINTLY CHARGED FEES FOR USE OF COMPACT DISC TECHNOLOGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department has launched an antitrust investigation into an 
arrangement between Sony Corp. and Philips Electronics that has helped the two 
consumer electronics companies dominate the compact disc business for more than 
a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies agreed in the 1970s to cross-license each other's patents on 
CD technology, enabling them to jointly charge patent licensing fees to dozens 
of disc manufacturers. That has enabled them to exert control over innovations 
in the manufacturing process. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokeswomen from both Sony and Philips declined to comment on the 
investigation, first reported in the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday. A Justice 
Department spokeswoman confirmed that it has "opened an investigation into 
licensing practices in the optical disc area."  
</P>
<P>
 Quixote Corp., which presses 70 million discs a year for recording companies 
and CD-ROM publishers, is one of several companies to have received subpoenas 
from the Justice Department in recent weeks requesting documents about their 
agreements with Sony and Philips. 
</P>
<P>
 Like every other U.S. disc manufacturer, the firm pays Sony and Philips a 
6-cent royalty fee for each disc. "That's not an insubstantial sum," said James 
DeVries, executive vice president of the Chicago-based firm, which is in the 
midst of expanding its Anaheim plant. "And it's the consumer that pays it in 
the end." 
</P>
<P>
 It's also the record companies. Retail sales of music compact discs in the 
United States totaled $6.5 billion last year. Music industry executives 
declined to comment Tuesday but said they are watching the investigation 
carefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Most troubling to some industry executives is the hold Sony and Philips have 
exercised over the design of the discs. Under the terms of the license, Sony 
and Philips require some companies to follow detailed specifications regarding 
size, thickness and other characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 With the emergence of CD-ROMs -- compact discs that hold images, video and 
text as well as music -- dozens of companies have been experimenting with 
methods to squeeze more data onto the shiny discs.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a negative if Philips and Sony are using this to stifle new 
technologies on the disc," said Norman Bastins, executive vice president of 
Compton's New Media. But he added, "On the positive side, without this patent 
setting some standards, we'd have players all over the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Antitrust experts said the investigation reflects the agenda of the Justice 
Department's new antitrust chief, Anne Bingaman, who announced in April that 
high-technology would be a focus of the her department's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The antitrust division recognizes that in the 1990s, control of technology 
and intellectual property, patents, licenses is key to controlling market share 
in an industry," said Barbara Reeves, a partner with Morrison & Foerster in Los 
Angeles. "The reason you're given a patent is to reward and encourage your 
innovation, but when people misuse that legal monopoly to make it reach further 
-- such as by cross-licensing -- that raises competitive concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 DiscoVision Associates, an Irvine-based subsidiary of Pioneer Electronics that 
owns several patents on compact disc technology, was also subpoenaed in the 
investigation. Ronald Clark, the company's senior vice president, said the firm 
has no joint licensing agreements with Sony and Philips. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not have any difficulty with Sony. We do not have any difficulty with 
Philips. We are independently licensing our patents, " he said.

 Coast Guard searchers Tuesday morning recovered the bodies of two men amid 
debris from a boat that apparently sank along a busy shipping corridor about 10 
miles off Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The search for other possible victims and remains of the vessel continued till 
dusk, as Coast Guard vessels scoured 450 square miles of ocean surrounding the 
point where the bodies were found. The search was discontinued because of 
darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members identified one of the dead as Khanh Nguyen, 50, of Alhambra, 
but the other man had not been identified late Tuesday afternoon, according to 
Scott Carrier, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrier said relatives told investigators that Nguyen and a friend set out on 
a fishing trip late Monday night. He said the relatives did not know the 
friend's name or where the boat had been docked. The family became worried when 
Nguyen had not returned by Tuesday morning, and called authorities after 
hearing reports that the bodies had been found. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither man was wearing a life jacket. However, one was found clutching a life 
preserver and the other was holding onto a boat fender -- a plastic barrel hung 
over the side of a boat to cushion it while at a dock, according to Coast Guard 
spokeswoman Liz Brannan.  
</P>
<P>
 Authorities received no distress calls overnight and did not know what 
happened to the two men or their boat. Coast Guard radio reports indicated that 
rescuers found nets registered to a commercial fishing boat, but officials said 
the gear had not been linked to the men. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no evidence right now that any of the debris belonged to any 
particular boat," said Coast Guard spokeswoman Brandy Ian. "We have debris and 
we have two bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 Brannan said a private boater bound from Newport Beach to Avalon reported 
seeing one of the bodies shortly before 7 a.m. She said a Coast Guard cutter 
recovered the second body about two hours later amid a floating trail of ice 
chests, line, a tarp and other debris. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, the Coast Guard had searched 450 square miles off the 
coast, using two helicopters, an airplane and two boats as commercial fishermen 
swarmed the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Jeffrey C. Jackson, commanding officer of one of the Coast Guard boats, 
said searchers found most of the debris between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Among items 
found were a man's blue work jacket, a baseball cap, a bait cutting board, and 
a white drum that carries bait, which Jackson said leads authorities to believe 
the boat was a commercial fishing vessel. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a number of different possibilities that could have led to this 
incident," Jackson said. "You can't even start to guess." 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is unusual," Jackson added. "The mystery of it all is that usually 
people have a chance to get at least one radio call in." 
</P>
<P>
 The area where the bodies were found is traveled regularly by freighters and 
tankers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes you instantly speculate it could possibly be a collision," said 
Steve Allison, spokesman for the Vessel Assist Assn. of America, a boat-towing 
company based in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the traffic, Jackson said, those who travel the area should be 
experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the busiest ports in the world and it's an area that you should 
have some experience in it before you go out at night. You should be aware of 
the dangers of shipping." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard completed its daylong search about 7:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 One 82-foot Coast Guard vessel and one auxiliary vessel remained until the 
search was called off. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, the search team monitored the currents using a device that 
was placed in the water near what was believed to be the area of the wreck. The 
device monitors the currents throughout the day so that search vessels can 
follow the likely pathway of wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 During its height, the search team consisted of a helicopter, an airplane and 
four boats from Long Beach, Newport Beach and San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard Lt. Mark Frankford said authorities were evaluating the debris 
found Tuesday and had not yet decided whether to resume the search today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The searches were very extensive," Frankford said. "The area was thoroughly 
saturated by search units under excellent searching conditions, which included 
calm seas and good visibility. That makes it easy to find objects in the 
water."

CBS DROPS OUT AS COMCAST BIDS FOR QVC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS and JOHN LIPPMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CBS on Tuesday abruptly abandoned its plan to merge with QVC after a rival 
bidder said it has offered $2.2 billion for the home shopping network. 
</P>
<P>
 The rival bid came from Comcast Corp., the Philadelphia-based cable TV company 
that helped found QVC and owns about 17% of its stock. Comcast said that it is 
willing to buy all of QVC's outstanding shares for a 22% premium over Tuesday's 
closing price. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS Chairman Laurence A. Tisch said in a telephone interview that he did not 
want to be drawn into a bidding contest. "It's not my style," said the 
71-year-old Tisch, who made it clear that he is also abandoning his plan to 
bring in QVC Chairman Barry Diller as CBS's new chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining their surprise bid, Comcast executives said they are motivated 
by a long-term strategy to add cable TV programming to the company's cable 
systems and cellular telephone holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the CBS transaction goes through, we're a disenfranchised investor," said 
Julian Brodsky, Comcast's vice chairman, in a telephone interview.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Comcast would have owned about 9% of CBS after the merger, its voting 
stock would be limited to less than 5% and it would be prevented from even 
serving on the CBS board. Federal rules restrict cross ownership of cable and 
broadcast TV properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast is clearly prepared to lose Diller as QVC's chief executive, since the 
QVC chairman has vowed to be his own boss and the Comcast bid is not contingent 
on his staying. Unless other suitors materialize for QVC, Diller may set 
himself adrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, sources said, Diller learned about the bid when Comcast Chairman Ralph 
Roberts and his son Brian, Comcast's president, met Diller's corporate jet at a 
New Jersey airport when it landed late Tuesday afternoon. Diller was headed to 
a CBS board dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast's offer to pay $44 for each QVC share "really puts pressure" on Diller 
to accept the deal because he could reap close to $100 million from his QVC 
stock options, one analyst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street and Hollywood executives saw more than a little irony in Comcast's 
move, since it was Comcast President Roberts who hotly pursued Diller to run 
the company two years ago and backed QVC's losing six-month battle for 
Paramount Communications earlier this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Diller issued a statement saying: "All the ironies aside, I said at the outset 
that if someone else wanted to bid for QVC, we would, of course, deal with it. 
And we will, with the only consideration being the best interests of the QVC 
shareholder." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, sources said CBS may still press ahead with a plan to give more 
than $1 billion to its own shareholders. CBS last month proposed to pay $175 in 
cash for each CBS share before swapping stock with QVC. The CBS board is 
scheduled to meet today in New York.  
</P>
<P>
 Tisch declined to comment on any refinancing, but insisted that CBS has not 
put itself up for sale. Even with the QVC merger, CBS shareholders would have 
remained in control. Still, speculation has swirled that Walt Disney Co. or 
other entertainment companies remain interested in acquiring a network. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike CBS's all-stock proposal, the Comcast offer would provide QVC 
shareholders with considerable cash. For each share of QVC, Comcast is offering 
$37 in cash and $7 of a new series of Comcast convertible preferred stock. 
Since Comcast already owns 8.6 million of QVC's 39.2 million shares, the 
acquisition would cost Comcast about $1.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Comcast's stock, however, may be pummeled today by media investors who favored 
the CBS-QVC merger and don't want to see Diller leave QVC. At the same time, 
Comcast shareholders may fret that their company is taking on too much debt.  
</P>
<P>
 One large investor lamented Tisch's decision to withdraw, saying that CBS 
could have ridden out the storm and persuaded many QVC investors that a deal 
with CBS was favorable. Tisch, however, dismissed such a notion, saying: "Stand 
out there for 30, 60 or 90 days and propagandize that our bid is better?" 
</P>
<P>
 John Tinker, an analyst with Furman Selz in New York, was upbeat. "If you 
believe in electronic retailing, it makes all the sense in the world," he said. 
Tinker noted that Comcast faces competition for cable TV subscribers from Bell 
Atlantic, the Philadelphia-based Baby Bell, and wants to control as much of the 
programming as possible.  
</P>
<P>
 "Control of content is king," Tinker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it," said Jessica Reif, an analyst with Oppenheimer & Co. in New 
York. "The value of QVC with CBS is so much greater than as a stand-alone" 
company. Moreover, Reif noted, "the real question is what Tele-Communications 
Inc. is going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 TCI, the large Denver-based cable TV operator, also owns about 17% of QVC's 
common stock. TCI, however, would incur huge capital gains taxes if the company 
is sold. A source close to Comcast said there may be ways to minimize the 
impact. A TCI spokesman declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Acquiring the shares it did not already own would be the second big deal in 
less than a month for Comcast.  
</P>
<P>
 In June, the cable operator won an auction to acquire the U.S. cable systems 
owned by Canadian-based Maclean Hunter Ltd. for $1.27 billion. The deal, which 
would give Comcast 550,000 cable subscribers, would make it the third largest 
cable operator in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview from New York, where the QVC board will convene 
today, Comcast's Brian Roberts said his company views QVC as an essential 
element for Comcast's growth. With QVC, he said, Comcast will generate nearly 
$900 million in annual cash flow -- nearly half of which will be in unregulated 
businesses. Such a strategy is essential for cable TV operators who have 
endured two rate rollbacks from federal regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts said Comcast's banks have already pledged $1 billion for the QVC 
purchase, and the company expects to raise an additional $300 million from the 
sale of its 19.9% interest in Heritage Media. Comcast has been assured that it 
could raise another $200 million in QVC debt, and it expects to issue the $275 
million in Comcast new convertible preferred stock. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC shares added 25 cents to close at $36 Tuesday, before the offer was 
announced. CBS fell $2, to $300. Comcast Class A shares added 12.5 cents, to 
$16.625.

SIMPSON ATTORNEYS DRAFT MOTIONS TO CHALLENGE CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON and ANDREA FORD, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorneys for O.J. Simpson already have begun preparing a battery of motions 
in an attempt to undermine the prosecution case against the superstar and to 
bolster his contention of innocence, Simpson's lead lawyer said in an interview 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are only going to file motions that are legally supportable and that 
support O.J.'s innocence," said Robert L. Shapiro, the Los Angeles lawyer who 
heads Simpson's high-profile legal team. "We are not going to file anything 
frivolous." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the motions being drafted, Shapiro said, is one to dismiss the case 
based on a lack of prosecution evidence presented during the preliminary 
hearing directly linking Simpson to the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown 
Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Shapiro said, defense attorneys will introduce a motion 
contesting evidence obtained during a warrantless search of Simpson's home and 
another to challenge evidence seized under a subsequent search warrant. In 
addition, a number of so-called in limine motions seeking to limit evidence or 
testimony in the case probably will be offered, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are only a few of the challenges being mounted to the prosecution case, 
Shapiro said, adding that he and other Simpson attorneys spent most of Monday 
and Tuesday drafting motions and sharing them with their client during the 
limited visitation hours at the Men's Central Jail. Despite the extensive 
motions envisioned, Shapiro is pressing for an early trial -- perhaps as soon 
as late September. 
</P>
<P>
 As Simpson's lawyers launch the next phase of their assault on the prosecution 
case, investigators continue to sift through evidence and chase down leads. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, detectives presented to the district attorney's office the results 
of the Police Department's investigation of Al Cowlings, who came to his former 
teammate's aid on the day Simpson failed to surrender to police as promised. 
The police file details evidence so that prosecutors can decide whether 
criminal charges are warranted, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, detectives and prosecutors continued to pursue their principal 
target. Detective Tom Lange, one of two lead investigators in the Simpson case, 
traveled to the Men's Central Jail on Tuesday to collect a hair sample from the 
athlete-turned-actor. Simpson's hairs will be compared to strands recovered 
from a blue knit cap found at the Brentwood murder scene. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, law enforcement sources said Tuesday that prosecutors have met 
for the first time with a witness who said she saw a car resembling Simpson's 
near the scene of the crime on the night the murders took place. 
</P>
<P>
 That witness, a young woman who was jogging in the neighborhood shortly before 
the killings, met with homicide detectives last month. In an interview with The 
Times the same day, she said she could not see anyone inside the car but that 
the vehicle looked like Simpson's white Ford Bronco. She said the car arrived 
between 9:45 p.m. and 10:10 p.m. and parked near Nicole Simpson's home. 
</P>
<P>
 The jogger, who said she stopped circling the block about 10:10 p.m., did not 
witness the killings. One prosecution witness at the preliminary hearing told 
of hearing a dog bark about 10:15 p.m. to 10:20 p.m., while another said he 
found Nicole Simpson's dog, its paws bloody, wandering nearby shortly after 
10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the jogger's description of the car near the murder scene could 
bolster the prosecution's attempts to undermine Simpson's alibi and show that 
he was in the vicinity when the crimes were committed. Simpson's lawyers have 
said he was at home waiting for a limousine to take him to the airport when 
Goldman and Nicole Simpson were killed, but the limousine driver testified 
during the preliminary hearing that Simpson did not answer his door until just 
after 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 When Simpson did answer the door, he apologized for having overslept, the 
driver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although authorities continue to interview witnesses and await test results to 
determine the source of blood samples found at the scene of the crime and at 
Simpson's Brentwood estate, the next public announcement is likely to be the 
decision on whether to prosecute Cowlings, who was booked last month on 
suspicion of aiding a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of harboring or concealing a person wanted for committing a 
felony, Cowlings could face a year in prison and a fine of $5,000. His lawyer, 
Donald Re, has said Cowlings was not attempting to help Simpson flee, but 
rather was trying to keep him from committing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Police sources said Tuesday that they doubted whether a case would be filed, 
in part because of Cowlings' public role in bringing Simpson home, where both 
men were arrested after a breathtaking standoff in the driveway as helicopters 
hovered overhead and a crowd gathered outside the gates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officers at the scene of Simpson's surrender said Cowlings interfered with 
their efforts to negotiate with the ex-athlete, and Cowlings was arrested along 
with Simpson. But those same officers also credited Cowlings with coming to 
their aid when Simpson's cellular telephone battery died and they needed to 
deliver a new phone to him. 
</P>
<P>
 At their request, Cowlings delivered the new phone. That saved officers from 
having to expose themselves to Simpson, who had a loaded pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 Given those and other circumstances, legal experts generally agreed that a 
case against Cowlings would be problematic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question for prosecutors is: 'Could you ever convince a jury beyond a 
reasonable doubt that he was helping Simpson flee?' " said Myrna Raeder, a law 
professor at Southwestern University School of Law. "It would be a difficult 
case for the prosecution." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, experts said, prosecuting Cowlings could complicate the case 
against Simpson. A spokeswoman for the district attorney's office said Simpson 
prosecutors Marcia Clark and William Hodgman were being consulted for their 
opinions about whether to proceed against Cowlings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They shouldn't prosecute Cowlings," Danny Davis, a leading defense attorney 
in Los Angeles, said of prosecutors. "It's a briar trap that Brer Rabbit has 
laid for the district attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, experienced lawyers said, Cowlings could try to call Simpson to 
testify on his behalf, a move that might offer Simpson a platform to tell his 
story of failing to surrender to police without facing questions about his 
alleged role in the murders of Nicole Simpson and Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 If called to testify, Simpson could choose to take the stand, or, far more 
likely, would invoke his right against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are too many land mines for (Simpson) to step on," defense attorney 
Michael Yamaki said of the possibility of Simpson testifying in Cowlings' case. 
"Even the most innocent statement can be misinterpreted." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without Simpson taking the stand, however, the Cowlings case would almost 
certainly feature testimony -- either from him or from other occupants of the 
house in the hours before Cowlings and Simpson disappeared -- about Simpson's 
state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that Cowlings or other witnesses in his case testified that Simpson 
was distraught or bereft over the death of his ex-wife, that testimony could 
help Simpson at his own trial, particularly if those witnesses indicated that 
Simpson was not attempting to flee when he left the house that day. 
</P>
<P>
 There is yet another consideration in prosecuting Cowlings, legal experts 
said. If prosecutors bring a case against Cowlings and lose -- a possibility 
made more real by the fact that Cowlings' attorney, Re, is among Los Angeles' 
most admired defense lawyers -- it could create a public perception of weakness 
in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cowlings is a shoe-in for a sympathetic acquittal," Davis said. "And that 
could become a harbinger of defeat for the district attorney's case against 
O.J. Simpson." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowlings is scheduled to appear in court Friday. A decision on whether the 
district attorney's office will prosecute him could be announced before then.

COUNTRIES ARE JOINING THE BATTLE TO KEEP MEN FROM SEEKING YOUNG PROSTITUTES

<P>
 Early last year, a retired Swedish civil servant was arrested during a police 
raid in the beach resort of Pattaya and charged with molesting a 13-year-old 
boy in his hotel room. As is common in prosecutions involving child 
prostitution in Asia, the case never went to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the 66-year-old Swede, Bengt Bolin, was released on $4,000 bail and 
fled the country. Because Sweden has no extradition treaty with Thailand, it 
appeared that his legal problems were over. 
</P>
<P>
 After Bolin arrived in Sweden, however, he received a shock. State Prosecutor 
Sven-Erik Alhem called Bolin in and informed him that he was being officially 
investigated -- the formal stage before prosecution -- for violating Sweden's 
own child molestation law with his activities in Thailand. It is the first time 
Swedish authorities have contemplated using the 30-year-old law for crimes 
involving children overseas, Alhem says. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bolin maintains his innocence and prosecutors are still awaiting key 
evidence from Thailand before proceeding, the case has become the opening 
skirmish in a novel, worldwide legal battle to curb the flourishing trade in 
child prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, Germany, France and Australia have proposed tough legal 
measures to discourage their citizens from traveling abroad for child 
prostitution. In the United States, Senate and House versions of a law on child 
abuse overseas have been sent to a joint congressional committee along with the 
rest of the current crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Child prostitution is one of the saddest scourges in developing Asia. Every 
year, thousands of men from Western Europe, the United States and Australia fly 
into Southeast Asia in search of children, both boys and girls, as sex partners 
or to use in pornography. Some poor parents in developing countries sell their 
children into a kind of slavery, while governments desperate for tourist 
dollars turn a blind eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, efforts to control the trade have largely been a pitiful failure 
because of corruption. Now, however, efforts around the world have been 
galvanized in a campaign to adopt strict laws in the so-called consumer 
countries to discourage men from venturing overseas for underage sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The international campaign is being spearheaded by a small group called End 
Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism, which was founded in Bangkok in 1990 
during an international conference on tourism. It has offices in 26 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to let people know that if they want a child prostitute in 
Thailand or elsewhere in Asia that they are doing something illegal," said 
Sudarat S. Srisang, a Thai social worker who became ECPAT's executive director. 
"Before, there was this attitude that it was OK, that there was an acceptance 
in this part of the world. Well, it's no longer OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Although precise statistics are not available, ECPAT estimates that nearly 1 
million children are involved in Asia's sex trade, including 300,000 to 400,000 
in India, 200,000 to 300,000 in Thailand, 100,000 each in the Philippines and 
Taiwan, 40,000 in Vietnam and 30,000 in Sri Lanka. A recent report suggested 
that war-devastated Cambodia, which has few enforceable laws, is fast becoming 
a haven for child prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed U.S. law would expand the Mann Act, which makes it an offense to 
travel across state lines for immoral purposes, to make it a felony to travel 
outside the United States to engage in any sexual act with a minor that would 
be illegal in America. It would also be illegal for Americans to traffic in 
child pornography overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Enforced by a special Justice Department office, the proposal calls for 
punishment of 10 years' imprisonment for a first offense and 20 years for a 
second offense. Civil liberties advocates had initially questioned whether it 
was legal to try someone in the United States for a crime committed overseas. 
But legal experts said this concept of "extraterritoriality" has been upheld in 
such cases as the one against former Panamanian leader Gen. Manuel A. Noriega, 
who was tried and convicted in Miami on eight counts of racketeering, 
conspiracy and cocaine-smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is outrageous that U.S. citizens are allowed to travel abroad to engage in 
the sexual exploitation and abuse of minors that would be illegal in the United 
States and that U.S. (travel) agencies organize and advertise such laws," Rep. 
Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.), one of the bill's sponsors, testified at a House 
committee hearing in March. "U.S. citizens and tour agencies should not be 
allowed to fuel an international industry that results in the physical and 
psychological abuse of tens of thousands of children. The damaging consequences 
of this abuse can last a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, Germany enacted a law providing for prison sentences of up to 
10 years for any German who engages in sexual practices with a child younger 
than 14, even if the crime takes place in a foreign country. France also 
adopted punitive measures, while Britain promised to provide Asian countries 
with lists of known British pedophiles so they can be kept out by immigration 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most sweeping proposals was adopted by the lower house of 
Australia's Parliament earlier this year and is awaiting passage by the upper 
house. It provides for up to 14 years' imprisonment for cases involving 
children younger than 12 and up to seven years' imprisonment for those 
involving youngsters between 13 and 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The Australian proposal would become one of that country's few 
"extraterritorial" criminal laws; the others include war crimes. Among its 
novel features is a provision to allow testimony to be given by satellite 
television hookup, which was initially criticized by civil liberties groups 
concerned that defendants would forfeit a traditional right to confront a 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
 "While we do not expect large numbers of prosecutions, the law sends a message 
that this country will not tolerate its citizens going offshore to abuse the 
children of other countries," Mark Lever, an aide to Australian Atty. Gen. 
Michael Lavarch, said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 In some countries, the problem involves mature-looking teen-age girls who 
become prostitutes while below the legal age of consent. But in other places, 
customers are specifically looking for children younger than 12, or even 10. 
Some men believe, for instance, that sex with children will give them 
longevity, while others hope, equally incorrectly, that choosing a child as a 
sexual partner will decrease the risk of contracting the virus that causes 
AIDS. Others are hard-core pedophiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tourism is providing the context in which the child abuse exists," said Ron 
O'Grady, a New Zealand native who was one of the original founders of ECPAT. 
"You often find that the farther a traveler gets away from home, the more they 
lose restraints." 
</P>
<P>
 The beaches of Sri Lanka are renowned haunts of European pedophiles looking 
for pre-adolescent boys. In the Philippine town of Angeles, which is on the 
outskirts of the former U.S. military facility Clark Air Base, bars advertise 
prostitutes whom the barkeepers guarantee are virgins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put in a family context, if a man has sex with a 15-year-old or a 10-year-old 
the damage is equal," said the Rev. Shay Cullen, an Irish priest who has worked 
with street children in the Philippines for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ECPAT has focused on enacting laws in the "consumer" nations because only a 
handful of cases have been successfully prosecuted in Asia, although the number 
is starting to grow. More often than not, when foreign men are accused of sex 
crimes with children in an Asian country, they either pay a bribe or flee while 
on bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they return home, most offenders are safe from being extradited because 
Western governments tend not to send their citizens back to face trial in 
another country unless it has a Western-style judicial system and civil 
liberties, which few Asian nations do. 
</P>
<P>
 The new child sex laws will replace extradition by providing for cases to be 
heard in the accused's home countries, with local safeguards, but using 
testimony and evidence gathered abroad. Officials believe most cases will 
involve instances in which an accused was arrested in Asia but managed to 
return home before being brought to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have big problems with child prostitution here, so it is important for 
us to show them how important it is for us," said Per Olov Forslund, a Swedish 
detective who is assigned to his country's Bangkok embassy to gather 
information on child prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai made the elimination of child prostitution 
his top priority shortly after he took office in September, 1992. After a 
series of well-publicized police raids, the trade in very young children moved 
out of the open in nightclubs and into the shadows, but it still persists on a 
large scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice talk, but it's just talk," Sanphasit Koompraphant, director of the 
Center for the Protection of Children's Rights in Bangkok, said of Chuan's 
efforts to crack down. Sanphasit asserted that Chuan had reneged on a pledge to 
make local officials resign in areas where child prostitution proliferates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite clear evidence of direct official involvement in every stage of the 
trafficking process, not a single Thai officer, to our knowledge, has been 
investigated or prosecuted except in one highly publicized case of murder," 
said a recent study by New York-based Human Rights Watch of Thailand's trade in 
young girls from neighboring Myanmar. "For the most part, agents, pimps, 
brothel owners and clients have also been exempt from punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech last month, Chuan said that child prostitution had become a 
"transnational trade involving powerful organizations which have a close-knit 
network." But he also charged that the problem was being blown out of 
proportion by the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuan's government has proposed a significant toughening of the child 
prostitution laws, which is still awaiting passage in Parliament. But social 
workers and officials agree that the problem is lack of enforcement, not a lack 
of laws. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Philippines, for example, stringent laws against sex with children were 
adopted in 1992. But officials acknowledge that the laws have not been used. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is rumored that the Philippine National Police is very corrupt," said 
Santiago Y. Toledo, deputy director of the National Bureau of Investigation, 
the local version of the FBI. "Besides, you almost never get a girl to file a 
complaint. They just disappear." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most blatant examples of sex tourism in Asia can be found in 
Angeles, which suffered the departure of 20,000 U.S. servicemen from Clark Air 
Base and was heavily damaged by the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though there are no beaches, nearby mountains or any scenery to speak of, 
the number of bars in the town has doubled to 173 since October thanks to an 
influx of single men, largely from Australia and Germany, but also including a 
sizable number of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hate the fact that our survival depends on these young girls," said 
Carlito M. Ganzo, an Angeles city councilman. "But we cannot do anything. It's 
an economic reality." 
</P>
<P>
 American Max Rose, who runs an Angeles bar known as Platinum, said the girls 
working in the bars were licensed by the government as being over 18 and there 
was nothing the bar owners could do about it. He added that by giving licenses, 
the government in fact "condoned" prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Any notion that the girls are working as "entertainers" is dispelled by the 
requirements of the government license: a yearly test for HIV -- the virus that 
causes AIDS -- and weekly checkups for venereal disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Romega Anteola, a social worker with a women's rights group in Angeles, said 
the government requires no proof of age when it issues licenses, and she 
estimated that the majority of bar girls are younger than 18 when they start 
working. "The truth is, they come at the age of 14 and 15," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A stroll along Angeles' main street one recent night tended to support her 
argument: There were scores of middle-aged Caucasian males walking hand in hand 
with teen-age Philippine girls, some barely half their size. 
</P>
<P>
 Cullen, the Catholic priest working with street children in Olongapo, near the 
former U.S. naval base at Subic Bay, said he believes that 50% of the women 
working in that city's bars are underage. 
</P>
<P>
 Cullen is outspoken in his criticism of the U.S. Navy for allowing servicemen 
arrested as child abusers to escape the Philippines, and in some cases, he 
said, abetting their escape. Cullen estimated that during the 10 years before 
the U.S. military departed in November, 1992, there were 150 child abuse 
accusations against U.S. servicemen and all were dismissed at a preliminary 
stage because the accused had left the country on "unauthorized leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Cullen brought a child abuse case against an Australian who 
allegedly abused children aboard a private yacht anchored offshore from 
Cullen's offices, known as the Preda Foundation. Some of the children involved 
were the same ones who had been involved in a child prostitution case involving 
a U.S. sailor. 
</P>
<P>
 Cullen, who traveled to Tokyo in May to campaign for the adoption of 
extraterritorial child sex laws being considered by Japan's Parliament, 
acknowledged that there would be difficulty making a case overseas but said the 
obstacles were more than offset by the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a great point of education," he said. "People will realize that 
they may be caught. It will be a great deterrent against ever leaving home."

UNITED AIRLINES DEAL GIVES WORKERS 55% OF COMPANY; JOBS: LARGEST EMPLOYEE-OWNED 
FIRM GETS $5 BILLION IN CONCESSIONS. LAUNCH OF NEW LOW-FARE CARRIER IS PLANNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a deal that creates the nation's largest employee-owned company, United 
Airlines' shareholders on Tuesday approved the sale of 55% of the giant carrier 
to workers in return for nearly $5 billion in concessions and the right to 
create a new low-fare airline. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversial agreement involving the country's No. 2 airline will be 
scrutinized as the most important test yet of employee ownership. Turning 
workers into owners has been promoted by the Clinton Administration as an 
important tool in rejuvenating corporate America and saving jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 United's experience with employee ownership will also be closely watched by 
rival airlines as they struggle to emerge from a deep industry slump that has 
resulted in $14 billion in combined losses since 1990. Several other carriers, 
such as Northwest and Continental, have sold ownership stakes to workers in 
return for lower wages and higher productivity, but none has gone as far as 
Chicago-based United. 
</P>
<P>
 Many industry observers are skeptical whether United's new management team 
will be able to make tough decisions if employees control the company. Former 
Chrysler Corp. executive Gerald Greenwald, who was selected as chairman by the 
machinists and pilots unions, must also win over the 17,000 flight attendants 
who refused to participate in the buyout and the many other workers who opposed 
the arrangement. United employs about 75,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is going to be looking at them to see how well it works," said 
Harold Sirkin, a transportation specialist at the Boston Consulting Group. 
"Employee ownership is the first step. What is going to be important is for all 
the people at United to pull together to make it work and improve overall 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
 The shareholders' approval Tuesday came nearly a year after the unions and 
management began complicated and often contentious negotiations that broke down 
at several points. Under the agreement, each existing United share will be 
swapped for $84.81 in cash and half a share in the stock of the new United 
Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In return for the 55% stake in the airline, United's pilots, machinists, 
administrative and management employees agreed to pay cuts ranging from 8% to 
20% and changes in work rules that will boost productivity. Workers could 
eventually own up to 63% of United if the company's stock price rises to $136 a 
share. Shares of United's parent company, UAL Corp., closed Tuesday at $128.125 
on the New York Stock Exchange, down $1.625. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement will also allow the company to form a low-fare "airline within 
an airline" called United Shuttle. United Shuttle, which is expected to begin 
service along the West Coast by October, is designed to permit United to better 
compete against low-cost competitors -- such as Southwest Airlines -- that have 
driven down fares industrywide and won over passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 United's employee buyout is one of the many strategies major airlines have 
adopted to survive in an era of low fares and slow growth. Delta Air Lines, for 
example, plans to lay off 15,000 workers in the next few years as part of a 
plan to reduce operating costs by $2 billion; Continental Airlines is expanding 
its own low-fare airline operation called Calite; American Airlines has 
withdrawn from unprofitable destinations and, in California, cut a deal with 
low-cost newcomer Reno Air to handle some of its routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwald, who replaces longtime United Chairman Stephen M. Wolf, supported 
the strategy crafted by his predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 "No other airline is as well-positioned for takeoff as United: a route system 
that spans five continents, an excellent fleet of aircraft, a management team 
that is one of the very best in the business -- and a name that is recognized 
and respected the world over," Greenwald said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich hailed the buyout as a model for other service 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "UAL will be the largest employee-owned company in the U.S., and the fact that 
a healthy company is going into employee ownership is a useful precedent for 
large service companies in the U.S., whether in the airline industry or 
telecommunications or other services," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now every board of directors in a large company will have to consider 
employee ownership as an option when they think about restructuring companies." 
</P>
<P>
 But critics of employee ownership said it will limit Greenwald and his 
management team in making tough decisions, such as cutting back on money-losing 
routes, without being stymied by workers. The buyout agreement also protects 
workers from layoffs for nearly six years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Job protection was the main reason United's 22,000 members of the 
International Assn. of Machinists supported the buyout, union chief Ken Thiede 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We enter it with mixed emotions because we have not been involved in this 
kind of endeavor before," Thiede said. But, "we think that management is going 
to be forced to look for other efficiencies . . . instead of just saying, 'If 
we cut some workers, we will be OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Greenwald and Wolf have told non-employee shareholders that management 
will run United -- not its unions. Employee representatives on United's board 
of directors can veto some important company decisions, but they will 
constitute a minority of the board members. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwald must contend with the large numbers of workers who have opposed the 
buyout and wage cuts. One of the biggest hurdles will be to persuade the Assn. 
of Flight Attendants to participate in the buyout. The flight attendants 
refused to join the buyout because they oppose the company's plan to establish 
bases of flight attendants overseas, which they say would threaten union jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenwald has said he is committed to forging an agreement with the flight 
attendants, who reportedly are willing to offer more than $400 million in 
concessions to join the buyout if their concerns over the foreign bases are 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee buyout at United or at any other airline, however, falls short of 
the major overhaul that is needed, industry consultant Michael Boyd said. 
Although such buyouts may cut operating costs initially, they do not change the 
highly bureaucratic and costly policies that were adopted in the less 
competitive era before deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It lowers their labor costs a little bit," Boyd said of the employee buyout. 
But "it doesn't solve the problems that got them into this mess in the first 
place."

BRENTWOOD RESIDENTS GROW ANGRY IN SPOTLIGHT'S GLARE; SIMPSON CASE: THE ENCLAVE 
ENDURES A SIEGE OF SIGHTSEERS. SIGNS BESEECH THEM TO 'GET A LIFE' -- ELSEWHERE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The questions came fast at B. Christian Coe, newly elected president of the 
South Brentwood Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is there any chance we can do without the helicopters?" demanded one man who 
lives not far from where Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman were 
slain. "Can a curfew be put on the area?" plaintively asked a middle-aged 
woman. And one bespectacled man drew loud laughs and more than a few nods of 
approval from his 200 or so assembled neighbors when he inquired: "Is it OK to 
shoot people walking by?" A police officer stepped to the microphone to deliver 
the sardonic answer: "Only on Tuesdays," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Such barbed sentiments are now common in the Brentwood neighborhood where the 
bodies of Simpson and Goldman were discovered a month ago, and where 
beleaguered residents say they have lived under a state of siege ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 With the media and the curious continuing to descend on the crime scene on 
South Bundy Drive, traffic accidents, lack of parking and tourists trampling 
over the private property of the increasingly angry locals have been the 
inevitable results. And though homemade signs implore sightseers to leave and 
"get a life," the continued prominence of the O.J. Simpson murder case has only 
increased the flow of visitors, who come at all hours and from as far away as 
Canada, South Africa and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some frustrated, tired and worn-out residents out there," said Coe, 
who presided over a specially called homeowners meeting Monday evening. 
"They're at the end of their rope." 
</P>
<P>
 Stories of insensitivity and macabre behavior abound. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor of the Nicole Brown Simpson residence inexplicably had his house 
pelted with rocks. Another reported hearing limousines pulling up in front of 
Nicole Simpson's condominium at 2 a.m. and seeing more than a dozen people 
emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are bringing their 1-, 2- and 3-year-old babies over here," said Barry 
Greenberg, who lives 1 1/2 blocks from the condo. "It's been a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 Added another resident, who lives on Dorothy Street, which abuts South Bundy 
Drive: "We're prisoners in our own homes." 
</P>
<P>
 In response, residents have proposed several measures to slow the flow of 
traffic, including barricading the neighborhood, instituting permit parking and 
even throwing a tent over the condominium to shield it from sightseers. 
</P>
<P>
 But police and homeowners association officials say that given the interest in 
the murder case, such proposals would be of limited effectiveness. "When 
there's something on the news, or something happens in the courts, two hours 
later, there's 70 people there," said Coe. "There are no immediate cures." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, none of the proposals would have stopped Gina Mastandrea and Lisa 
Bivens, who flew in for the day from Seattle just to see the Bundy Drive condo 
and try to catch a glimpse of O.J. Simpson's estate a few miles north. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in the hot sun in front of the condo, Mastandrea, 23, said her 
one-day trip was definitely worth it, even if there really wasn't much to see, 
and even if she and Bivens were yelled at by irate neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We followed the case from Day 1," said Mastandrea, who along with Bivens paid 
$300 for air fare. "We just wanted to see it for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the neighbors' feelings regarding sightseers, "We live in a media 
society," Mastandrea said brusquely. "You have to expect that this is going to 
happen."  
</P>
<P>
 Added Bivens: "It's America. People are always going to come around to look." 
</P>
<P>
 That compulsion to look is not likely to abate soon, said Chaytor Mason, 
professor emeritus of human factors psychology at USC. Mason said he expects 
that gawkers will be attracted to the Brentwood neighborhood for six months to 
a year. The reasons, said Mason, have to do with people identifying with those 
involved, wanting to become part of an event larger than themselves and 
escaping the routine of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Most peoples' lives are pretty damned dull," said Mason, "so when they get a 
chance to insert themselves in something real and get a feeling out of it, they 
will. They will go hundreds of miles to gain that feeling of fulfillment and 
identity." 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the complaints are being leveled at tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 The media is also a target of scorn, particularly the omnipresent television 
crews that residents say park illegally and heedlessly drape cables and wires 
across their lawns. Residents also blame the media for continually broadcasting 
scenes from the neighborhood, even when there are no new developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can we do to be protected from these people?" wondered one frustrated 
homeowner, who complained that police have failed to ticket illegally parked 
news vans and that the media have been awarded undue privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Some blame is also being aimed at a local businessman and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 One Brentwood retailer recently printed a flyer advertising "cut-throat" 
prices, an ad that has offended some. Similarly, at Monday's homeowners 
meeting, a neighbor of the Nicole Simpson residence said that while he 
appreciated the empathy of other residents, most of the noise he now hears 
comes from angry horns honking at sightseers and the attendant shouts of "Get a 
life!" 
</P>
<P>
 "You're much more of a problem in some ways," he said to the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fractiousness involving residents, the media and sightseers, Karen 
LeBlanc says she hopes that a new sense of community will emerge among those 
who live and work in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we're just angry because our space has been violated," said 
LeBlanc, who describes her home as being in "the Brentwood Triangle." 
"Brentwood has changed, it's taken on a notoriety and it won't go back to what 
it was before. But it's not Bosnia, it's not a war zone. We have to rise to the 
occasion of adapting to, but not necessarily accepting, this situation."

BAN ON FIRING STRIKERS BLOCKED; LABOR: SENATE REPUBLICANS SUCCEED IN A 
FILIBUSTER ON THE MEASURE. UNIONS HAD SOUGHT TO KEEP FIRMS FROM PERMANENTLY 
REPLACING THEIR MEMBERS DURING WALKOUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton and organized labor suffered a stinging defeat Tuesday when 
the Senate effectively rejected legislation that would have prevented American 
corporations from firing striking union members and permanently replacing them 
with non-union workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the fiercest political battles between management and labor in a 
generation, union supporters in the Senate mustered a 53-47 majority but fell 
seven votes short of the 60 needed to break a Republican filibuster of the 
striker replacement measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate's Democratic leadership scheduled another vote for today to stop 
the filibuster, but both sides said they expect the result to be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Although union officials were reluctant to comment extensively until after 
today's expected final vote, they did express disappointment and frustration. 
"We really feel it's a travesty," AFL-CIO spokeswoman Sharolyn Rosier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Business lobbyists who worked fiercely to kill the bill were ecstatic. "This 
is a major blow to organized labor," said a triumphant Richard L. Lesher, 
president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Passage of the legislation "would 
have destroyed the balance of power that has existed for more than 50 years 
between labor and management," Lesher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that this is the death knell for organized labor's confrontational 
approach on labor-management issues," said Dan Yager, a lobbyist with the Labor 
Policy Assn., a business trade group. 
</P>
<P>
 For the labor movement, the defeat was especially bitter because it comes at a 
time when corporate America is showing an increased willingness to fire 
striking workers rather than bargain with them to hammer out new contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor unions and their allies in Congress said the use of permanent 
replacements for striking workers sharply increased in the 1980s, after 
President Ronald Reagan fired union air traffic controllers in 1981, thus 
signaling to the business community that the federal government approved of the 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal law never prohibited the use of replacement workers but, union leaders 
said, until Reagan's action there was a strong cultural stigma that made 
business executives reluctant to fire striking employees. As a result, they had 
insisted that the federal ban was needed so labor could use the threat of a 
strike as an effective lever at the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 While the Senate was voting Tuesday, Caterpillar Tractor was hiring workers to 
keep its assembly lines rolling in the face of its second bitter strike in two 
years. During Caterpillar's last strike in the midst of the 1992 presidential 
campaign, candidate Bill Clinton made a high-profile visit to striking workers 
in Illinois and vowed to push for the striker replacement ban if elected. 
</P>
<P>
 That 1992 strike eventually ended in a union defeat when workers agreed to 
return to their jobs after the company threatened to find permanent 
replacements. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's campaign promise to sign a striker replacement ban helped energize 
union support for his candidacy, especially in the general election campaign 
against President George Bush, who had vowed to veto the ban if it reached his 
desk. The last congressional battle over the issue also died in the Senate 
while Bush was in the White House in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite his campaign pledge, President Clinton did not mount an 
aggressive, public campaign in support of the legislation, as he has done on 
other high-profile initiatives like last year's North American Free Trade 
Agreement, prompting quiet frustration among some union officials. 
</P>
<P>
 For years the striker replacement legislation has been the No. 1 legislative 
priority of organized labor, which has suffered a long string of political 
setbacks during the last decade as it has seen its economic power and 
membership erode. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders said Tuesday that they were satisfied with the Administration's 
effort in support of the striker replacement ban and acknowledged that the 
ideological battle between business and labor over the issue was so heated that 
a White House lobbying campaign would have done little to budge swing votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt the White House was trying," said Rex Hardesty, chief spokesman for 
the AFL-CIO. "We are satisfied that the White House did what we could 
reasonably expect. We also know that they were not successful." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton did, however, make last-minute appeals to key Democratic senators by 
telephone from Europe this week, and he assigned senior adviser George 
Stephanopoulos to head the White House lobbying campaign on the legislation. 
Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich also played a leading role in pushing for the 
bill and made repeated calls on critical lawmakers in the closing days. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday's defeat still damaged Clinton's attempts to improve his ties to 
organized labor, which were badly frayed by the battle over the North American 
Free Trade Agreement last fall. That trade fight pitted unions against the 
White House, which was then allied with the same business interest groups that 
opposed the Administration on the striker replacement bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, the White House was unable to win over key Southern Democrats to 
the striker replacement bill, most notably the two from Clinton's home state of 
Arkansas, Sens. David Pryor and Dale Bumpers, who were under heavy pressure 
from business lobby groups. Labor lobbyists, who focused their efforts on 
Republicans while the White House handled Democrats, also failed to lure many 
moderate Northern Republicans into breaking ranks with their party leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday morning, supporters of the striker replacement ban -- which already 
had passed the House -- knew that they would fall short, but the margin of 
defeat was larger than the three to five votes they were predicting. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of California's Democratic senators -- Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer 
-- voted to end the filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, Mark O. Hatfield of Oregon and 
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania joined 50 Democrats in supporting cloture. 
Democrats David L. Boren of Oklahoma, Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina, 
Harlan Mathews of Tennessee and Sam Nunn of Georgia joined Pryor and Bumpers in 
voting with the Republicans against cloture. 
</P>
<P>
 "This issue has become such a lightning rod for both sides that it was a very 
tough, uphill battle all the way," an Administration lobbyist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), who sponsored the legislation, argued that 
the current law "sends the unmistakable message that workers are disposable, 
reducing employee morale and lowering productivity." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) said that "any right to strike today is . . . a 
hollow right." 
</P>
<P>
 Business leaders and their supporters, by contrast, insisted that the use of 
permanent replacements is still quite rare but warned that a federal ban on the 
practice would give unions a new weapon and make labor leaders much more 
willing to strike to win contract demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that our system of collective bargaining has worked well 
for over half a century and continues to work well today," said Senate Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), a leader of the bill's opposition. "But by 
eliminating the risk factor from strikes, this bill presents employers with an 
untenable Hobson's choice: Shut down the business -- close down the factory -- 
or accede to the union's demands, whether those demands are reasonable or not."

FREQUENT-FLIER FELINE REUNITED WITH HER OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A cat-astrophe was averted Tuesday when Tabitha, the celebrated flying feline, 
was found aboard a 747 jet -- 12 days and 30,000 miles after disappearing on a 
Los Angeles-bound flight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called her and called her, and all of a sudden, she cried back," said the 
cat's owner, Carol Ann Timmel, after coaxing the tabby from the jet's cargo 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the happiest day of my life. I thought I'd never see her again." 
</P>
<P>
 Timmel carried her long-lost cat off the Tower Air plane at Kennedy 
International Airport in New York on Tuesday morning -- several hours after the 
airline, under threat of a lawsuit from the owner, agreed to ground the jet for 
one final search. 
</P>
<P>
 As befits such a story, Tabitha was found with the aid of a psychic. After 
forging a feline frame of mind, psychic Christa Carl pinpointed the drop 
ceiling in the cargo area as the place the cat had recently taken up residence. 
</P>
<P>
 "A psychic told her where the cat was, and lo and behold, that is where the 
cat was," veterinarian Dr. Keith Manning said. "So go figure." 
</P>
<P>
 Manning said the cat survived because the cargo hold in which she had hidden 
was temperature-controlled. Nonetheless, he said, the cat was dehydrated and 
hungry: Her weight had dropped from eight pounds to six, and she appeared to be 
suffering from jet lag -- an ailment for which the veterinarian prescribed "a 
catnap." 
</P>
<P>
 Timmel, an aspiring actress, was moving from New York to Los Angeles on June 
30 when Tabitha escaped from her cargo crate. Tabitha's sister, Pandora, 
remained in her box. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabitha logged 30,000 miles, zipping from New York to Los Angeles, New York to 
San Juan, Puerto Rico, and New York to Miami, and became a kitty cause celebre. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone from the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to 
psychics joined in the search. The New York Post ran a daily "cat watch."  
</P>
<P>
 Tower Air conducted numerous searches. Cat traps were baited with fresh tuna, 
but the finicky 3-year-old didn't show. She prefers dry food. "We tore the 
inside of the airplane apart," said Nick Lacey, Tower Air vice president for 
operations in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Timmel filed a suit to force the airline to conduct a thorough search, but 
dropped it when the airline agreed to ground the plane for 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was taken to a quiet area and Timmel was allowed to go in and call 
out for her kitty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cat just started meowing," Lacey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tower is flying Timmel and Tabitha home for free on Thursday. The cat will be 
in Timmel's lap, Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tabitha was found one day after Carnival Air Lines announced a frequent-flier 
program for pets. Seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 But, said Timmel, "Once I get her to L.A., she's never going to fly again." 
</P>
<P>
 A purr-fect ending.

BREYER DIGS AT ELITE IMAGE AS HEARINGS START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three times during the first hour of hearings Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary 
Committee heard that Supreme Court nominee Stephen G. Breyer had dug ditches 
for the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. as a summer job.  
</P>
<P>
 He also mixed salads at a camp run by the city of San Francisco, it was 
revealed. And he was no bookworm as a child. "My ideas about people do not come 
from libraries," Judge Breyer told the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 As hearings opened on President Clinton's second nominee to the high court, 
both Breyer and his White House backers sought to wipe away the image of the 
55-year-old judge as a Harvard-educated elitist with a theoretical approach to 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they stressed that he is a practical man in touch with real people.  
</P>
<P>
 "Above all," he said, "I will remember that the decisions I help to make will 
have an effect upon the lives of many, many Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer's bit of image-making came during a smooth opening day in which the 
nominee moved quickly to quell any remaining controversy standing in the way of 
his confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
 In opening comments, he announced that he would divest himself of holdings in 
insurance companies to head off further concerns about a possible conflict of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, Breyer, a multimillionaire, had invested heavily in Lloyd's 
of London, the international insurer of last resort. In several cases that came 
before the U.S. Court of Appeals in Boston, Breyer wrote opinions that limited 
the liability of companies for cleaning up pollution and questions were raised 
whether these rulings could ultimately benefit Lloyd's. 
</P>
<P>
 But White House officials pointed out that none of Breyer's holdings in 
Lloyd's were directly affected by those rulings. They also released letters 
from three experts in legal ethics who had reviewed the matter and concluded 
that Breyer did not err. Judges are not required to step aside, they said, 
simply because of a "speculative" chance that their investments could be 
affected by a ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer's attempt to polish his image came as no surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Judge Clarence Thomas went before the committee and followed 
what his advisers called the "Pinpoint strategy." He spoke repeatedly of 
growing up poor in Pinpoint, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg told of how she had been denied entry 
jobs as a lawyer because she was a woman. She then became a pioneering lawyer 
on behalf of women's rights. 
</P>
<P>
 But Breyer's life does not readily make for a hard-luck story. The son of a 
San Francisco lawyer, young Breyer was a brilliant student who excelled at 
Stanford, Harvard and Oxford. He married into a wealthy English family and he 
and his wife, Joanna, list assets valued at more than $6.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Short, slight and balding, the judge seemed dwarfed when seated between 
Massachusetts Sens. Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry as the hearing began. 
</P>
<P>
 But given a chance to speak, he adroitly answered questions without provoking 
controversy. He won warm praise from several senators, especially from the 
committee's Republicans, who recalled his intelligence and fairness during the 
two years, 1979-80, that he served as the panel's majority counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the up-from-the-ditches portrayal of Breyer did not succeed entirely in 
dispelling his elite image. 
</P>
<P>
 His Senate supporters could not resist pointing out that Breyer is 
"trilingual" and in his spare time likes to read novelist Marcel Proust "in the 
original French." 
</P>
<P>
 Breyer apologized on occasion for lapsing into his "professorial mode" when he 
answered a simple question with a lecture. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday's session had none of the drama or tension of past confirmation 
hearings, largely because Breyer came unopposed. And since he has written 
little on constitutional law, he easily skirted the questions that touched on 
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
 He did, however, reveal his views in several areas: 
</P>
<P>
 * He said that both the right to abortion established in the Supreme Court's 
Roe vs. Wade decision and the constitutionality of the death penalty are 
matters of "settled law," meaning that they are no longer in legal dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 * Asked about the First Amendment's ban on "an establishment of religion," 
Breyer said: "First, I think of Jefferson and the wall." That comment will not 
rest well with conservatives such as Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who 
has derided Jefferson's view that the Constitution erects a "wall of separation 
between church and state."  
</P>
<P>
 The panel expects to continue the hearing today and Thursday.

GERMAN COURT OKS GLOBAL ROLE FOR TROOPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Opening the door for Germany to play a global role for the first time since 
World War II, this country's highest court ruled Tuesday that federal troops 
may participate in international military missions. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe was a victory for 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who has argued in the face of national reluctance that 
the reunified Germany must take on international responsibilities commensurate 
with its new size and its economic power. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the decision allows Kohl to relax restraints imposed on the armed 
forces after Nazi-era militarism to ensure that Germany would never again 
threaten its neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the court required the government to secure parliamentary approval before 
deploying troops on U.N. or other multinational missions, and Foreign Minister 
Klaus Kinkel hastened to assure the world that Germany would be a team player, 
not an aggressor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Germany will never pursue an interventionist policy," Kinkel told reporters 
at the court. "Our foreign and security policy will not be militarized, you can 
be sure of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl and President Clinton welcomed the decision in Berlin, where they met at 
the historic German Reichstag (Parliament) building and later walked solemnly 
together through the Brandenburg Gate that once divided East and West Berlin.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am very happy with this," Kohl said. "I have always held the view that 
deployments like this are allowed by the constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have been 
pressing Germany to abandon its military caution and make a sizable troop 
contribution to new, rapid-reaction units designed to intervene in regions in 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bonn on Monday, Clinton made it clear that he views Germany as America's 
primary ally in Europe now and said, "I do hope that we will have the benefit 
of the full range of Germany's capacities to lead." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said Germany has demonstrated its leadership with aid to former Soviet 
Bloc countries and efforts to integrate them into the European Union. When 
Germany took over the union's presidency July 1, Kohl vowed to fight for the 
integration into that group of countries such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech 
Republic. Western Europe supports broadening the union but also fears it will 
concentrate too much power in centrally located Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability to send troops on international missions is likely to boost Kohl's 
bid for a seat for Germany on the U.N. Security Council. But the issue remains 
highly sensitive among Germans still grappling with the country's Nazi past. 
There is a deep pacifist undercurrent in the country; political observers say 
it will continue to limit government involvement in foreign military 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will not be freewheeling intervention, by no means," said Michael 
Stuermer, director of the independent Research Institute for International 
Affairs near Munich. "The decision of the court will force us to think much 
more clearly, without using false pretexts, about what to do in what kinds of 
contingencies. But Germany will more often than not say 'No, this is not for 
us.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Stuermer said Germany is further restricted because it is not a nuclear power 
and not a former colonial power -- like Britain and France -- with links in 
other parts of the world. History also would keep Germany from sending troops 
to the former Yugoslav federation, for example, where Hitler's army intervened 
in support of a repressive Croatian regime that killed thousands of Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Germany's constitution was written with the founding of the Federal Republic 
in 1949 and includes a provision that, "except for self-defense," the armed 
forces can be deployed only where it is explicitly allowed. Every government 
before Kohl's has interpreted the clause to mean the German military could be 
used only to defend the country or to help NATO against an attack from the 
former Soviet Union and its allies. 
</P>
<P>
 But after the fall of communism, Bonn began to view this interpretation as 
obsolete. And when the constitution kept Germany from fighting in the 1991 
Persian Gulf War against Iraq, Kohl argued that such missions were permissible 
with allies and under a multinational mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's long-awaited decision -- one of the most important since German 
reunification in 1990 -- was a rejection of actions brought by the opposition 
Social Democratic Party over deployment of German ships in the Adriatic Sea to 
support an embargo against Serbia, and of the assignment of German soldiers on 
radar surveillance flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and on the ground in 
Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peace forces and their task of securing peace are part of the United Nations' 
system of collective security as it has developed through the practical 
application of the U.N. charter, which the Federal Republic of Germany joined 
in 1973," the eight-judge panel ruled. "For that reason, German soldiers also 
may be deployed in the framework of United Nations peace troops even when these 
have a mandate to use force." 
</P>
<P>
 But the court said Kohl had infringed on the rights of Parliament when he 
failed to consult lawmakers before deploying troops over Bosnia and in Somalia. 
It said approval by a simple majority in Parliament was required for further 
deployments. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl's Christian Democratic Union hailed the decision as a victory over the 
opposition Social Democratic Party, saying the court had ratified the country's 
"moral obligation" to participate in multilateral military missions. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Democratic leader Rudolf Scharping, meanwhile, issued a face-saving 
statement saying the verdict had "clearly removed the legal twilight zone" 
around deployment of German troops and ensured parliamentary oversight. "The 
court plainly and clearly dismissed the view of the CDU, according to which the 
government could single-handedly order international missions," said Scharping, 
Kohl's opponent in the Oct. 16 federal election. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl's coalition partner in the government, the liberal Free Democratic Party, 
had joined the SPD in its April, 1993, challenge of the use of German staff on 
NATO surveillance flights over Bosnia. But they too lauded the court's 
insistence on parliamentary approval. 
</P>
<P>
 In Berlin, Clinton was ebullient over the court decision and said Germany has 
set standards in humanity, democracy and respect for diversity.

4 CITIES TO FUND STUDY OF EL TORO AIRPORT IMPACT; DEVELOPMENT: COALITION 
ALLOCATES MORE THAN $600,000 FOR SURVEY, WHICH WILL PROPOSE ALTERNATIVE USES 
FOR BASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of four South County cities has set aside more than $600,000 to 
battle a proposal to turn the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station into a 
commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Mission Viejo and Laguna Niguel, which pledged $200,000 each, coalition 
leaders insist the effort is not intended to oppose a controversial initiative 
on the November ballot, which, if approved by voters, would require the county 
to build a civilian airport at the Marine base. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, spokesmen said the money will be used to hire a consultant to do an 
independent environmental and economic impact study to gauge the effect that an 
airport will have on the environment and jobs in South County.  
</P>
<P>
 A consultant will probably be hired in the next two weeks and a report will be 
available within 90 days, well before the Nov. 8 election, Laguna Niguel City 
Councilman Mark Goodman said Tuesday. In addition to doing an environmental and 
fiscal assessment, the consultant will also look at alternative uses for the El 
Toro Marine base, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the report will not "get into the nitty-gritty of air quality 
and traffic issues," but will instead look "at some environmental impact 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
 The group's study will be separate from the official study that will be done 
by the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority, the county agency that will decide 
what to do with the military base when the Marines complete their departure by 
1999. The first units will leave next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The other cities in the coalition -- called the South County Working Group -- 
are Lake Forest and Laguna Hills. Lake Forest Mayor Marcia Rudolph said her 
city budgeted $150,000 for the separate study. Laguna Hills City Manager Bruce 
Channing said Laguna Hills appropriated $100,000 "for El Toro-related studies 
and prospective uses." 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the ballot initiative were not available for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Thomas F. Riley, head of the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority's 
board of directors, was critical of the South County coalition, saying the 
county planning process would be fair to all interests. 
</P>
<P>
 However, South County residents and leaders fear that North and Central County 
communities will dominate the planning and decision-making process, forcing a 
commercial airport on them. The coalition leadership also vowed a court fight 
to prevent the building of a commercial airport that would affect "their 
quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, coalition leaders are cautious about taking an active role 
in opposing the ballot measure because using municipal funds for political 
purposes is prohibited by state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with the (El Toro) initiative," Goodman said. "Nobody 
is using city money for anything that has to do with the initiative. We have an 
obligation to inform the citizenry on something that will have tremendous 
impact on their children, daily life, property values and quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the insistence of Goodman and others that the group's planned study is 
not specifically intended to oppose the initiative, it appears that some 
coalition members are already using the document to draw a line in the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 "United we stand. We're going to win it by sticking together because we're all 
impacted," said Mission Viejo Councilman Robert D. Breton. "Life in South 
Orange County will never be the same if El Toro becomes a (commercial) 
airport." 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure -- called the Orange County/El Toro Economic Stimulus 
Initiative -- would require the building of the airport and change the county's 
land-use plan to allow its development on 2,000 acres of the 4,700-acre base. 
It is sponsored by a coalition of business and political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 However, even if the measure passes, it will probably be challenged in court 
because it does not comply with federal environmental laws, Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't say this is going to be the use for El Toro, because a federal 
environmental impact report requires that you look at other alternatives," 
Goodman said. "At the very least, the decision makers must have alternatives 
before making a decision" on how to redevelop the Marine base. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you say you must have an airport there and then say we'll do an 
environmental document to look at alternatives. It makes no sense," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In criticizing the coalition, Riley said he is especially surprised by Lake 
Forest's involvement since the city is also a member of the county reuse 
planning authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm saddened by the fact that there are so many interests at work on El Toro 
that don't want to let the (county agency) work," Riley said. "I'm committed to 
doing what's best for the county, but I'm not sure of these outside processes." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rudolph said Lake Forest joined the anti-airport coalition in part because 
"you can safely say that about 95% of our community opposes the idea of a 
commercial airport at El Toro." 
</P>
<P>
 "That would mean death to our quality of life down here," Rudolph said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest has had one representative on the reuse planning authority's board 
since it was formed. It joined, in part, to ensure it would have a say in the 
planning process. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition leaders said the group is fully prepared to sue if the initiative 
passes or if the county decides independently to put a commercial airport at El 
Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "If more aggressive North County communities try to skew the process and 
pressures the county to put an airport there, we're fully prepared to go out 
and spend money to do an environmental document to shoot holes on whatever 
information the county's consultants bring forward," Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll tie this thing up in the courts for 10 years or more," Breton said. "We 
have to fight this to the bitter end and fight it together. We have to show 
everyone that this is the wrong solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph said the cities are willing to use some of the money already 
appropriated to initiate a court challenge to building an airport at El Toro. 
If necessary, the cities would be willing to budget additional money to pursue 
the matter in court, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ultimate negative outcome of all this would probably be incurring 
additional costs for litigation," Rudolph said. "But if we have to do that to 
stop a civilian aviation facility at the base, that is the will of the people 
in my city and throughout South County."

FEDERAL COURTS SUSPEND RIGHTS LAWYER YAGMAN FROM LAW PRACTICE FOR 2 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A panel of three federal judges has suspended Venice civil rights lawyer 
Stephen Yagman for two years from practicing law in federal courts in seven 
Southern California counties, including Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension stems from Yagman's criticism of U.S. District Judge William D. 
Keller, whom the attorney accused of being anti-Semitic, drunk on the bench, 
"dishonest . . . a bully and one of the worst judges in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman violated local court rules by "impugning the integrity of the court, 
and by interfering with the random assignment of cases to the judges of this 
court," according to the order signed Friday and issued Tuesday by U.S. 
District Judges Edward Rafeedie, John G. Davies and David W. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "In essence, (Yagman) attempted to reduce the pool of judges to whom his cases 
could be assigned by publicly making false and inflammatory statements," the 
order states. Yagman "hoped that such accusations would compel the judge to 
recuse himself to avoid an appearance of impropriety," the order says. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman, who practices almost exclusively in federal court, specializes in 
representing plaintiffs accusing law enforcement personnel of brutality or 
other misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman is well known to police in Orange County, particularly Newport Beach, 
partly due to a ruling on the use of excessive force that the U.S. Supreme 
Court let stand in 1991. In that celebrated case brought by Yagman, the U.S. 
9th Circuit Court of Appeals said the Newport Beach police went too far when 
they handcuffed a drunk-driving suspect to a Hoag Memorial Hospital 
Presbyterian chair and allegedly held him by the shoulders as a nurse drew 
blood from him. 
</P>
<P>
 In another high-profile Newport Beach case in 1993, Yagman won $285,000 in 
damages from the city for an advertising executive who was beaten during a 1986 
traffic arrest.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Keller controversy, Yagman maintained in papers filed earlier that he 
had violated no ethical rules. Rather, he said, he had only exercised his First 
Amendment right to criticize a public official. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller, who was appointed to the federal bench in 1984, is viewed as 
sympathetic to law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 In imposing the stiff suspension, the judges said Yagman has "steadfastly 
refused to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman declined comment Tuesday, but he is expected to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-judge panel said Yagman's allegations against Keller, "particularly 
the accusations of dishonesty, drunkenness and anti-Semitism, lacked an 
objectively reasonable basis in fact." The judges said Yagman "acted at least 
recklessly in impugning the integrity of the court." 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining its reasons for the two-year suspension -- nine months longer 
than recommended by a 12-lawyer federal court disciplinary committee -- the 
judges referred to American Bar Assn. standards. The standards, the judges 
said, require them to consider the duty violated by the attorney, the lawyer's 
mental state, the actual or potential injury caused by the lawyer's misconduct 
and the existence of any aggravating or mitigating factors. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges said they found no mitigating factors and several aggravating 
factors, including prior disciplinary offenses. They said that in 1981 Yagman 
had been found guilty of judge-shopping; he was suspended for 30 days and fined 
$500. In addition, in 1989, he was suspended by the California State Bar for 
six months for charging "unconscionable fees" to one client and other offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also cited other cases where attorneys had been sanctioned "for 
misconduct involving improper attacks on the integrity of the courts." For 
example, it cited a Virginia federal case where an attorney was disbarred after 
he contended that a judge had made a decision based either on incompetence or 
because of "a Jewish bias in favor of the (opposing attorney)." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension is scheduled to become effective Friday. In order to be 
reinstated after two years, Yagman would be required to pass the California 
Professional Responsibility Examination administered by the State Bar of 
California.

JUDGE FACES MISCONDUCT HEARING; COURTS: PROCEEDINGS AGAINST KINGS COUNTY JURIST 
WILL BE PUBLIC. STATE PANEL HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR SECRECY AND LENIENCY IN 
PRIOR CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Commission on Judicial Performance announced Tuesday that it will 
hold a public hearing into charges of serious misconduct against a Kings County 
judge -- the first such hearing since voters passed a 1988 initiative designed 
to strip the veil of secrecy from these proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has been heavily criticized in recent months for failing to 
hold open hearings and for meting out lenient discipline. Legislation to force 
the commission to conduct more of its hearings in public has passed the state 
Senate and is pending in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the commission accused Corcoran Municipal Court Judge Glenda K. 
Doan of four counts of misconduct. She denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The first charge alleges that the judge presided over a bail reduction hearing 
for her gardener, who was charged with conspiracy to purchase cocaine, a felony 
narcotics offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Doan owed the gardener, Miguel Meneses, $400 for his services. The day 
after he was arrested in March, 1993, Meneses' wife approached the judge at her 
home for help. The judge then arranged for the wife to visit her husband and 
accompanied her to the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the jail, Judge Doan spoke with Meneses . . . and advised him not to speak 
about the incident, but rather to obtain the services of an attorney," 
according to the charges. The same day she called a Corcoran police officer and 
asked him if he opposed Meneses being released on his own recognizance. The 
officer's supervisor went to the judge's chambers and said he opposed such a 
release. Another judge set bail at $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a few days later, Doan presided over a bail reduction hearing, did 
not disclose her ties to Meneses and "falsely stated" that a Corcoran officer 
did not oppose releasing the defendant on his own recognizance, the charges 
state. She then ordered him released without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission also charged that Judge Doan: 
</P>
<P>
 * Failed to report two loans on her annual statement of economic interests, 
including a $3,000 loan from a Corcoran police lieutenant who was the court 
liaison of the Corcoran Police Department. The judge insisted that there be no 
written evidence of the loan. The other loan was $740 from a court clerk who 
was her subordinate. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission said the loans were part of a "continuing pattern of failure to 
report income or loans" and cited two prior incidents.  
</P>
<P>
 * "Improperly exploited her judicial position" by accepting several allegedly 
improper loans. For example, in December, 1991, she borrowed $10,410 from local 
businessman Hugh Osburn, which has not been repaid. "Osburn and his business . 
. . frequently appear before the court on which Judge Doan sits." Additionally, 
Doan borrowed about $10,000 from another local businessman, Morris Proctor, and 
subsequently presided over the criminal sentencing of Proctor's son, Jason. 
That loan has not been repaid either.  
</P>
<P>
 * Deliberately made false statements in a personal bankruptcy petition that 
she filed in June, 1993.  
</P>
<P>
 The formal charges also include Doan's denials that she engaged in any 
misconduct. She contends that her statement to Meneses that he should not speak 
to anyone without consulting a lawyer "was one that she ordinarily made to 
unrepresented defendants pursuant to her obligation to preserve the defendant's 
right to a fair trial." 
</P>
<P>
 She also asserts that her relationship with Meneses did not oblige her to 
remove herself from the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine if this argument were used in O.J. Simpson's case," Doan said in a 
statement issued by her lawyer Thursday. "No judge could pass over his matters 
because they all knew him. He was their sportscaster, or hero or whatever. . . 
. I would not put my judicial career on the line for my gardener." 
</P>
<P>
 Doan also denied that she "engaged in a continuing pattern of failure to 
report income or loans" on her economic statements. She maintains that the loan 
from the police officer was "a friendly 'handshake loan' " obtained at the time 
her husband was involved in a failing business. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also maintained that she does not have continuing business 
relationships with Osburn and Proctor. She said her interpretation of the 
Canons of Ethics does not "prohibit her, in a small community, from dealing in 
arm's-length transactions with persons and businesses who are likely to come 
before the court upon which she sits." 
</P>
<P>
 Doan also denied making any false statements on her bankruptcy petition. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's statement, issued by chief counsel Victoria B. Henley, noted 
that the commencement of formal proceedings against Doan is not a determination 
that she is guilty of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing, presided over by three judges, is scheduled to begin Aug. 16 in 
Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing, the judges are to report to the commission on their 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Doan was first elected in 1982 and was reelected in 1988 and 1994.  
</P>
<P>
 The investigation that led to the current charges was under way during Doan's 
recent reelection campaign.

WILSON DECRIES DEBATE STALLING U.S. CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Tuesday condemned the so-called Racial Justice Act that is 
stalling the federal crime bill, saying it would lead to "a total frustration" 
on the part of prosecutors seeking the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 In a spirited session with a small group of reporters, Wilson exuded 
confidence about his prospects for reelection in November and indicated he 
would throw his shoulder into efforts by Republican moderates to delete the 
anti-abortion plank from the GOP platform in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me a conservative position is that government ought to stay out 
of people's personal lives to a very considerable extent," Wilson said. "I 
think the absence of a plank (on abortion) from a platform is consistent with 
that attitude. And I think you will undoubtedly see a lot of people trying to 
achieve that in '96 at the Republican convention, and I think rightly." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's remarks echoed recent comments by other GOP moderates such as New 
Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and may foreshadow a major internal 
Republican struggle over the party's staunch anti-abortion stance. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson made it clear he thought the debate over abortion less important 
than the intensifying discussion -- in California and Washington -- over how to 
stem the tide of out-of-wedlock births, which now constitute about 30% of all 
births. 
</P>
<P>
 In criticizing the racial justice measure, Wilson, who has emphasized support 
of the death penalty in his campaign for reelection against Democrat Kathleen 
Brown, joined a chorus of law enforcement officials and Republican legislators 
who have voiced similar concerns.  
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which narrowly passed the House this spring, would allow defendants 
in capital cases to challenge their sentences with statistics showing that the 
jurisdiction sentencing them had applied the death penalty proportionately more 
often to minorities than to whites. The Senate has rejected the idea, which has 
emerged as a major point of contention in the conference committee attempting 
to complete the massive crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice . . . should be colorblind," Wilson said. "There should be a single 
question and that is the guilt of the perpetrator and whether or not special 
circumstances exist that warrant the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson suggested that arguments from civil rights groups that minorities tend 
to receive the death penalty more than whites obscure the central issue in the 
crime debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victims . . . are indifferent to the color of their attacker," he said. 
"They want to see them dealt with and they want to be protected. I think that 
is an interest that outweighs concern about whether or not there is a 
disproportionate number of a particular racial group who fall within the 
category of those convicted and sentenced to a penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson was in Washington meeting with a bipartisan group of California 
representatives to promote a new approach to resolving conflicts between local 
communities and homeless organizations over the use of closed military bases. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1987 law, the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, gives homeless 
advocates first crack at surplus federal land. The approach outlined by Wilson 
would mandate that local groups devise plans with a "reasonable" level of 
homeless assistance. But it would also attempt to increase the priority on 
using the bases for economic development.

FEDERAL COURTS SUSPEND RIGHTS LAWYER YAGMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A panel of three federal judges has suspended Venice civil rights lawyer 
Stephen Yagman for two years from practicing law in federal courts in seven 
Southern California counties, including Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspension stems from Yagman's criticism of U.S. District Judge William D. 
Keller, whom the attorney accused of being anti-Semitic, drunk on the bench, 
"dishonest . . . a bully and one of the worst judges in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman violated local court rules by "impugning the integrity of the court, 
and by interfering with the random assignment of cases to the judges of this 
court," according to the order signed Friday and issued Tuesday by U.S. 
District Judges Edward Rafeedie, John G. Davies and David W. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "In essence, (Yagman) attempted to reduce the pool of judges to whom his cases 
could be assigned by publicly making false and inflammatory statements," the 
order states. Yagman "hoped that such accusations would compel the judge to 
recuse himself to avoid an appearance of impropriety," the order says. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman, who practices almost exclusively in federal court, specializes in 
representing plaintiffs accusing law enforcement personnel of brutality or 
other misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 Keller, who was appointed to the federal bench in 1984, is viewed as 
sympathetic to law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman maintained in papers filed earlier that he had violated no ethical 
rules. Rather, he said, he had only exercised his 1st Amendment right to 
criticize a public official. 
</P>
<P>
 In imposing the stiff suspension, the judges said Yagman has "steadfastly 
refused to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman declined comment Tuesday, but he is expected to appeal. 
</P>

the accusations of dishonesty, drunkenness and anti-Semitism, lacked an 
objectively reasonable basis in fact." The judges said Yagman "acted at least 
recklessly in impugning the integrity of the court." 
</P>
<P>
 In explaining its reasons for the two-year suspension -- nine months longer

Professional Responsibility Examination administered by the State Bar of

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; ATTACKS GROW STRONGER ON BOTH SIDES; 
CANDIDATES BRING SPOUSES AND STAFF INTO FRAY. FEINSTEIN ACCUSES HER OPPONENT OF 
BEING RACIALLY INSENSITIVE IN HIS HIRING OF ADVISERS. HUFFINGTON ADS ATTACK 
BUSINESS DEALINGS OF SENATOR'S HUSBAND. 
</P>

<P>
 Far from taking a summer break, California's U.S. Senate race raged at full 
boil Tuesday as both major campaigns exchanged some of the sharpest accusations 
of the contest, attacking staff members and spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 In angry and personal tones, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein's campaign 
charged that Republican challenger Michael Huffington "is a damn liar" for 
attacking financial investments made by the senator's husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein officials also accused Huffington of being racially insensitive by 
hiring three strategists with controversial backgrounds in ethnic voting. The 
charge was prompted by Tuesday's announcement that Huffington's team has added 
Edward J. Rollins, a nationally known consultant who revealed -- and then 
recanted -- a strategy to suppress the black vote in last year's New Jersey 
governor's race. Rollins also ran Ronald Reagan's 1984 reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In a campaign that has been a slugfest since polls showed the race growing 
tighter last month, Tuesday's developments seemed to take things up another 
notch. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, a Santa Barbara congressman who has financed most of his campaign 
with money from his family oil and gas company in Texas, launched two more 
commercials attacking Feinstein, continuing their tit-for-tat, 
multimillion-dollar advertising battle. 
</P>
<P>
 One Huffington commercial, on radio, warned voters that Feinstein is known for 
negative campaigns. The second ad, on television, attacked the Democrat's claim 
that she is tough on illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Huffington was slapped Tuesday with a $20,000 fine by the 
Federal Elections Commission for not properly reporting all of the personal 
contributions he made to his 1992 House campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials said they initiated the investigation after discovering that 
Huffington did not report a $250,000 contribution he gave to his own campaign 
before the November election, as is required. Huffington reported the 
contribution after the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington counsel Benjamin L. Ginsberg criticized the FEC action, saying the 
error was minor and inadvertent and did not effect the election's outcome.  
</P>
<P>
 But of all of the developments Tuesday, perhaps the most telling about the 
campaign's direction were the personal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's husband, Richard C. Blum, has been scrutinized in previous 
campaigns for a private investment business that has earned him a fortune 
estimated at more than $50 million. In the past, Feinstein officials have 
bristled at the attention, saying it is inappropriate because Feinstein is not 
involved in her husband's business deals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday, the Democrats seemed ready -- if it meant the same attention 
could be paid to Huffington's wife, Arianna Stassinopolous Huffington, a 
provocative and controversial best-selling author whose latest book talks about 
her unconventional search for spiritual meaning.  
</P>
<P>
 "This opens a new area -- are (candidates) responsible for the activities of 
their spouse?" Blum said Tuesday. "We'll take that one on." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's campaign charged in a news release that it was fair to call 
Feinstein and Blum "junk bond profiteers" since the Democrat's campaign had 
called Huffington "an oil millionaire." But Huffington provided no evidence 
that Blum had ever dealt with junk bonds, let alone profited from them.  
</P>
<P>
 The allegation stems from Blum's role in helping organize about $100 million 
for a $3.6-billion purchase of Northwest Airlines. The five investors that made 
up the $100-million deal five years ago included First Executive Life Insurance 
Co., which was later seized by state regulators after extensive use of junk 
bond financing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Blum said none of the funds used by First Executive in the Northwest 
investment came from junk bonds. "It is a total outright lie," Blum said 
Tuesday. "We were a million miles away from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington campaign adviser Ken Khachigian did not offer additional proof, but 
said the charge was fair because Blum dealt with a company that used junk bonds 
in its other business deals. "A rose by any other name smells as sweet," he 
said. He also defended the campaign's attack on Feinstein's spouse, saying 
Feinstein benefits from the profits and because she opened the door by 
questioning Huffington's personal finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Khachigian also said it would be inappropriate for Feinstein's campaign to 
raise issues about Huffington's wife unless they are pertinent to the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is generally that we ought to all tread relatively carefully in 
this area in dealing with spouses," he said. "I would want to know what the 
relevance was to (Huffington's) ability to conduct himself as a U.S. senator." 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the appointment of Rollins as a campaign adviser, Feinstein 
officials said it is one more example of indifference to ethnic voters by 
Huffington's strategy team. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Rollins, Feinstein officials said two other top Huffington 
advisers have been involved in controversies regarding ethnic voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The producer of Huffington's television commercials, Washington-based Larry 
McCarthy, crafted the controversial Willie Horton ad that helped defeat 1988 
Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis. The ad was derided as 
racially explosive because it centered on Horton, a black convict who raped a 
woman while on furlough from a Massachusetts prison during Dukakis' term as 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Huffington adviser, Carlos Rodriguez of Sacramento, was the campaign 
manager for a 1988 Republican state Assembly campaign that hired uniformed 
guards to stand outside polling places in Latino neighborhoods of Orange County 
to deter voting by illegal immigrants. The action led to a civil lawsuit on 
behalf of Latino voters who said they were intimidated by the guards. It was 
settled out of court for $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Rollins was the lead consultant in the successful Republican campaign for New 
Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. After the campaign, Rollins told reporters 
the campaign spent $500,000 to pay campaign workers and ministers to suppress 
the black vote in Democratic areas. Rollins later said he fabricated his story 
and an investigation found no evidence that such payments were made. 
</P>
<P>
 But his hiring prompted Feinstein campaign manager Kam Kuwata to ask if 
Rollins had "come on to depress turnout in the African American community." 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was one hire, that would be one thing," Kuwata added. "But to have this 
group of all-stars that are assembled to try and decrease turnout, it speaks 
volumes. There is a pattern that emerges. These are all people with some effort 
to affect turnout in the minority community." 
</P>
<P>
 Khachigian responded angrily to the allegation of racial insensitivity, saying 
"that is an irresponsible statement . . . that is using innuendo to suggest 
something very slanderous. . . . The fact is . . . you've mentioned three 
professionals . . . and there is nothing in this campaign that looks untoward. 
Unless that happens, (Feinstein) should just shut up. Those are cheap shots by 
panicking opponents."

ON CALIFORNIA: THEY KEEP COMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They keep coming. Just like the governor's campaign ad says. They keep coming 
up from Mexico. Pete Wilson complains that they come to laze about, to leech 
off taxpayers. This, of course, is merely political wind, hot gas, as even 
Wilson himself must know. The reason they keep coming is to work. 
</P>
<P>
 In this part of California, the San Joaquin Valley, they come to work in the 
fields. It's been true for decades. Hold their wages to a minimum level. House 
them in shacks. Haul them to work before the sun each day, packed like cattle 
in the beds of pickup trucks. Still, they keep coming. 
</P>
<P>
 The dynamics are not complex. They need work, which they cannot find at home. 
They want to survive. We let them come -- and don't be fooled by rhetoric about 
sealing the border; it could never be allowed to happen -- because their bottom 
dollar wages translate into bottom line advantages for growers, and less 
expensive groceries for you and me. Everyone wins just enough to tolerate the 
system's messiness. 
</P>
<P>
 And it can get messy. Celia Duran knows this well. For 18 seasons, her husband 
came from southern Mexico to work the California fields. "He did it," she said, 
"out of necessity. To feed his family." She stayed behind and raised their 
children. One year ago the telephone rang. Celia Duran, 44 years old, mother of 
10, learned she was a widow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He had been bound for a farm north of Bakersfield. It was just before dawn. 
Rogelio Duran rode in back with four other pickers, unprotected by seats or 
seat belts. This technically was legal because the pickup was covered with a 
camper shell. The aluminum hood made the ride no safer, but it satisfied state 
law. When it comes to traveling in truck beds, California legislators have been 
quicker to offer protection for dogs than they have for farm workers. This is a 
fact. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, a field hand apparently paid extra to transport these workers in 
his truck, missed a stop sign. The brakes, he later told a highway patrolman, 
"did not work so good." The pickup was struck by a van. The men in back were 
tossed out. Four died. The fifth was severely injured. Those riding up front 
were not scratched. 
</P>
<P>
 Now these kind of accidents are quite common in the fields. They are a reason 
why traffic fatalities in the San Joaquin Valley run at a rate more than double 
the state average. They are a reason why kids growing up around here are taught 
early to steer clear of rural highways during harvest times. And they are a 
reason why the U.S. Congress in 1983 passed the Migrant and Seasonal 
Agricultural Worker Protection Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other provisions, the law required seats and seat belts for farm workers 
being transported to the fields. Moreover, it allowed farm workers -- or their 
survivors -- to sue if minimum safety standards were not met. Attorney Federico 
Sayre said the law represented an extraordinary attempt to deal with an 
extraordinary problem, "the routine slaughter of human beings on the highway." 
He has won three settlements for farm workers caught in the carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, insurance companies have raised rates. Growers have complained. 
Politicians have heard. Two California Democrats, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and 
Rep. Vic Fazio of Sacramento, have introduced legislation that would allow farm 
workers to recover damages only through the no-fault workers comp system. This 
system may or may not apply to highway wrecks, and in any case would offer only 
a fraction of what could be won through the courts. Needless to say, the 
politics don't favor the farm workers on this one. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Celia Duran, a Sayre client, knows little of the politics and legalities. What 
she knows is that it now has become necessary for her to come north and follow 
the crops. She lives here with half her children in a tiny cottage they share 
with two other families. Her other five children were left behind in Mexico. 
She sends them all she can. 
</P>
<P>
 She earns $4.50 an hour, picking tomatoes. She rises at 3 a.m. each day and 
rides to work with eight other pickers in the back of a pickup. She pays the 
driver $4 a day for the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else can I do?" she said the other afternoon, sitting on a faded couch, 
surrounded by sleeping children. "My husband gave his life working to feed our 
children. Now I must work to feed them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is," she said, "a necessity." 
</P>
<P>
 She picked through a paper sack of belongings and pulled out a washed-out 
snapshot of her husband, a handsome man in a straw cowboy hat. She told of 
their dream of one day building a home, in Mexico. As she contemplated her 
loss, she began to weep. And the tears, they kept coming.

CLINTON FIGHTS TO SHORE UP ERODING HEALTH PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 As both houses of Congress brace to vote on health care legislation, the chief 
challenge confronting President Clinton and his allies is a growing perception 
that a marginal measure is the easy way out of the most difficult political 
bind that many lawmakers have ever faced. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, members of Congress facing reelection this fall want proof to 
show voters that they are capable of doing something significant. But just as 
great or greater is their fear of taking too big a leap. 
</P>
<P>
 "The political calculus that 'small is safer' is the quick, knee-jerk 
reaction," said one Senate aide. "The evidence (to the contrary) is rolling out 
slowly, and we need to pile it on in the next couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles): "Usually when you have something 
very controversial, if Congress is left to its own devices, it goes for the 
lowest common denominator. Only this time, the lowest common denominator won't 
work." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his supporters will be turning up the heat as the health debate 
enters what amounts to its semifinal round. Both the House and Senate are 
expected to vote on legislation before Congress adjourns for its August recess, 
setting the stage for a final battle over a compromise version this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The appeal of a modest, incremental approach is understandable because it 
steers clear of the most politically charged element of the Clinton plan, which 
is a requirement that employers pay as much as 80% of the costs of their 
workers' health benefits. Small and weak businesses say that the additional 
cost of such an "employer mandate" would force them to lay off workers or shut 
down entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans want health care, but they don't want to pay for it with their 
jobs," Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.), one of the chief backers of a 
more gradual approach, warned in a speech Tuesday on the Senate floor.  
</P>
<P>
 Without a mandate, however, it is unlikely that the health care system would 
reach Clinton's goal of universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's backers will release a torrent of new studies aimed at convincing 
wavering members that fiddling with the health care system around the edges 
will only make the current problems worse. The more incremental reform plans 
would remedy the apparent shortcomings of today's insurance system, requiring 
insurance companies to provide coverage at the same rate regardless of age or 
health, but not requiring everyone to carry insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 But, say Clinton backers, unless everyone has health insurance, marginal 
reforms are a recipe for more misery: Fewer people will have health coverage 
and those who do will pay more for it because the sick will be able to buy it, 
pushing up the premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, with Clinton back in Washington from his European trip, the White 
House is planning to turn up the heat with a busy schedule of public 
appearances for both the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 One coalition of organizations that support the Clinton plan will launch bus 
caravans from four cities. Called the "Health Security Express," it is clearly 
designed to evoke memories of the popular bus trips taken during the 1992 
presidential campaign by Clinton, Al Gore and their wives.

GEORGIA AWASH IN DAMAGES AND MEMORIES; DISASTER: FLINT RIVER TAKES OUT BRIDGES 
AND ROADS AS IT CREEPS INTO HOMES AND FACTORIES. WARY RESIDENTS WRING OUT TALES 
OF PAST FLOODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 John Pugh was 4 years old and fearless the last time the Flint River came 
lapping at his doorstep. "Mama told me don't go outside," he remembered, a man 
of 48 sitting astride a bicycle chatting Tuesday with friends, one eye scanning 
the heavens for hints of rain. "I climbed over the fence and fell in the 
water," he recalled with a chuckle. "It was over my head. Somebody picked me up 
out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 High waters once again have come to Bainbridge. The state's worst flood ever 
is washing muddy water into homes all along the Flint, shutting down factories, 
turning communities into ghost towns, forcing thousands to flee their homes. 
This time, Pugh isn't fooling around. The water still hasn't reached his house 
and the river isn't expected to crest before Thursday, but he's already moved 
his family to higher ground after emergency crews told him the area was unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might be all right," he said, wiping his brow. But he's not taking any 
chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage from the flooding still has not been calculated, but so many bridges 
and roadways have been destroyed or weakened by surging currents that officials 
say the entire infrastructure of southwest Georgia may have to be 
reconstructed. Some 1,500 bridges are still out, and 60 state roads and 
hundreds of county roads still are closed, said Georgia Emergency Management 
Agency spokesman Ken Davis.  
</P>
<P>
 "The litany of things that have been affected with the infrastructure goes on 
and on, and it will increase as water goes down," he said. "It's nothing like 
we've seen in Georgia certainly this century." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton plans to visit Albany, one of the hardest-hit cities, today 
to view the damage there. Thirty-one counties in Georgia already have been 
declared federal disaster areas. The Flint crested in Albany at 20 feet above 
flood stage Monday and is expected to remain near that level for five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said flooding has been responsible for 30 deaths in the state, half of 
them in Sumter County, where floodwaters rose rapidly last week. And 
thunderstorms moved into the area Tuesday, prompting a flash flood watch for 
portions of Georgia, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle already reeling from the 
floods. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida has estimated $40 million in flood damage so far, including 234 homes 
destroyed and almost 200 more damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost a week now, the people of Bainbridge have watched the waters slowly 
envelop parks, homes and businesses, it's relentless movement as insidious as a 
disease.  
</P>
<P>
 Bainbridge, a neighborly town of 15,000 people, where strangers wave at 
passing cars, has been blessed with time to prepare, because of its position 
downriver from areas of initial heavy flooding. But that means it is also 
cursed with the unbearable strain of waiting for the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wearing out the nerves," admitted Mayor Bill K. Reynolds, who said he 
was operating on three hours of sleep Monday. "By having time, you can do a lot 
of things to prepare," he said. But on the other hand, the city has been on 
edge for a week, with work crews working long hours of overtime, missing meals 
and sleep, trying to protect homes, businesses and government facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Expensive equipment at the city's sewage treatment plant has been hoisted to 
the ceilings. Similarly, workers at the many factories that stud the low-lying 
area in west Bainbridge along the Flint River have had time to remove or 
protect materials and equipment.  
</P>
<P>
 One concern here is a fertilizer plant where 9 million pounds of toxic ammonia 
is stored in a giant tank. Because the poisonous ammonia would gasify and be 
released into the air if the plant's cooling system malfunctions, the plant 
took numerous precautions. First, it added a second natural gas line to power 
generators in case the first line becomes damaged. Then tanks of butane and new 
electrical systems were added for backup power. Finally, as a last resort, the 
plant installed a system to burn off any escaping gas, the mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The river already was 11 feet above flood stage Tuesday. Forecasters predict 
it will crest at a record 20 feet above flood level. Among the facilities that 
have been evacuated and ringed by a wall of red Georgia clay is a brand new 
sprawling county jail, which opened in the flood plain only months ago. Inmates 
have been dispersed to surrounding counties, and sheriff's department personnel 
have temporarily moved back into their old quarters downtown, which at 130 feet 
above sea level is safe from floodwaters.  
</P>
<P>
 About 175,000 people remained without drinking water Tuesday in Georgia. The 
Red Cross said at least 7,500 families were displaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Terry Everett (R-Ala.) spent much of last week touring the 
flood-devastated portion of southeastern Alabama he represents. In an 
eight-county area of his district -- the third largest peanut producer in the 
country, surpassed only by two counties in Georgia that also are underwater -- 
more than 1,100 people are homeless because of the floods. The peanut crop has 
been crippled. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the second time in four years we've been flooded," said Everett on 
the plane as he flew back to Washington.  
</P>
<P>
 In a shelter in Elba, Ala., last week, he said he met a 91-year-old woman with 
no family. She lost everything she owned in the 1990 flood and then again last 
week. "She was crying," Everett said. "It was tough to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison reported from Bainbridge and Stanley from Atlanta.

GOP SENT CONDOLENCES TO COMMUNISTS; DIPLOMACY: CLINTON'S MESSAGE TO NORTH KOREA 
ECHOES NOTES ISSUED BY REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTS UPON DEATHS OF MAO TSE-TUNG AND 
STALIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When President Clinton expressed condolences to the North Korean people for 
the death Friday of their president, Kim Il Sung, Republicans lambasted him for 
insensitivity to the families of the 54,000 Americans killed in the Korean War. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we sent any condolences when Mao Tse-tung died," sniffed Rep. 
Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But the record shows that is not true. In fact, Gingrich and some other 
Republicans such as Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) are attacking the Democratic 
President for an action quite similar to what their own party did when it 
occupied the White House at the time of Mao Tse-tung's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Files obtained by The Times from the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library 
indicate that on Sept. 9, 1976, the day Mao died, the Republican President sent 
his condolences for the death of the Chinese leader -- whose troops fought side 
by side with Kim Il Sung's army against American forces in the 1950-53 Korean 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mrs. Ford joins me in extending to you our deepest sympathy on the death of 
Chairman Mao Tsetung," wrote the Republican President in a signed note on White 
House stationery. "Chairman Mao had a profound impact on his era. . . . Please 
accept my personal condolences." 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, Ford's condolences concerning Mao went one step further than 
Clinton's. They were addressed directly to "Madame Mao" -- that is, Jiang Qing, 
then a political leader of the ultra-leftist, anti-American forces in Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, they gave a dollop of White House recognition to Mao's wife, at a time 
when she and her allies, known as the "Gang of Four," were striving to 
consolidate control of the Chinese leadership. (They failed, and a month after 
Mao's death, she was imprisoned.)  
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton had followed Ford's example, he might have addressed his 
condolences to Kim Jong Il, who is Kim Il Sung's son. But he addressed his 
message to "the people of North Korea." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's condolence statement, issued Saturday, said in its entirety: 
</P>
<P>
 "On behalf of the people of the United States, I extend sincere condolences to 
the people of North Korea on the death of President Kim Il Sung. We appreciate 
his leadership in resuming the talks between our governments. We hope they will 
continue as appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, who is now preparing a possible run for the 1996 Republican presidential 
nomination, has been the most determined and vehement critic of Clinton's 
condolence message on Kim Il Sung's death. But in 1976, at the time of Ford's 
Mao Tse-tung condolence message, Dole was Ford's vice presidential running 
mate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's criticisms of Clinton have been picked up and rebroadcast by 
conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps President Clinton has forgotten that Kim Il Sung was responsible for 
the war that caused the loss of more than 54,000 American lives and 100,000 
Americans wounded," Dole declared last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Mao was at least arguably responsible for far more American deaths 
than his Korean counterpart. China intervened in the Korean War in October, 
1950, at a time when Gen. Douglas MacArthur was driving North Korean forces 
toward the Yalu River border with China and American forces were widely thought 
to be within a few weeks of victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Well over half of America's casualties in the Korean War took place after 
Mao's forces entered the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Clarkson Hine, Dole's press secretary, insisted that there were 
"significant differences" between Ford's condolences and Clinton's. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, unlike President Ford, President Clinton took the liberty of extending 
his condolences 'on behalf of the American people,' " Hine said. "If President 
Clinton wants to extend his personal condolences, Sen. Dole has no quarrel with 
that. The problem is that President Clinton signed the name of every American 
to the Kim Il Sung sympathy card. Second, China had already taken positive, 
concrete steps to improve relations." 
</P>
<P>
 Following Dole's criticisms, Clinton defended his message, saying that his 
condolence note concerning Kim Il Sung was "to the point and appropriate and 
very much in the interest of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.) pointed out Tuesday that the Eisenhower 
Administration sent its own condolences after the death of another brutal 
leader -- Josef Stalin, who died in 1953.

RESEARCH; SCHIZOPHRENIC'S CASE SPURS REVIEW OF CONSENT GUIDELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF LEEDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The voices simply would not stop. In the end, Greg Aller was forced to listen. 
Following the commands of an unseen master, he says, he walked out to the 
highway, stuck out his thumb and started hitchhiking to the nation's capital to 
assassinate the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Aller, a schizophrenic, never made it to the White House that day in 1989. But 
his case has become a rallying point for federal regulators seeking to tighten 
the rules governing medical experiments on mentally incapacitated or 
unconscious patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Aller, a college student who volunteered to receive a new antipsychotic 
medication, claims UCLA researchers administered and then withdrew the drug 
without first getting his consent and without fully explaining their 
objectives. When they halted treatment, he says, his symptoms returned. He 
started to believe government agents were chasing him. He thought there were 
hidden cameras in his living room. He tried to kill his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Medical Center officials say the study was designed to identify factors 
that might help predict the need for short-term outpatient medication and was 
not intended to cause relapses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that the researchers viewed people with schizophrenia as subhuman," 
Aller testified at a recent congressional hearing. "I doubt whether any doctor 
who works at the UCLA Medical Center would ever allow a son or daughter to 
become a subject in this experiment." 
</P>
<P>
 An inquiry into the UCLA experiments by the Health and Human Services 
Department's Office of Protection from Research Risks found "insufficiencies" 
in documents that were supposed to ensure that patients understood the goals -- 
and risks -- of the study. School officials say they have since improved 
record-keeping and plan to create a monitoring board to oversee studies 
involving patients with serious psychiatric disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulators warn that much of the blame for inadequate disclosure and 
consent resides with government health agencies, not with the universities and 
hospitals that conduct the experiments. The National Institutes of Health and 
the Food and Drug Administration have issued contradictory rules that blur the 
ethical boundaries of clinical research, critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 NIH, which last year spent $5.5 billion to finance research involving human 
subjects, has devised a set of fairly rigid rules designed to ensure that 
informed consent is obtained. Researchers are permitted to waive consent rules 
only if an experiment involves no more than "minimal risk" -- defined as the 
level of harm encountered in everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
 The FDA's regulations are considerably looser, critics say. The agency, for 
example, allows physicians to waive consent requirements if the patient is 
facing a life-threatening emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, experts say, the experiment on Aller would not have passed either 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most hospitals and universities go to local review boards to get approval for 
medical studies and experiments. But without a single, comprehensive directive 
from the federal government, boards may misinterpret or ignore the rules, 
approving studies without requiring informed consent. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinical investigators and drug firms have devised their own rules in some 
instances. Lack of agreement on common standards poses a serious risk to 
patient safety, says Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), whose subcommittee convened a 
hearing on the problem in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts want Congress to create a national review board to regulate 
federally funded research involving humans. The panel would design research 
policies and police local review boards, which are susceptible to conflicts 
because board investigators often serve on the faculties or staffs of the 
institutions they regulate. 
</P>
<P>
 FDA and NIH officials have pledged to try to reconcile their conflicting 
policies. They expect to hold a workshop this summer for patients, physicians 
and ethicists to discuss safeguards for comatose patients and other consent 
issues.

DESPITE ARISTIDE PLEA, OAS AND U.N. PULL OBSERVERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff Writers 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations and the Organization of American States, concerned about 
their human rights monitors' safety in Haiti, rejected a plea from exiled 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and agreed to withdraw the workers from the 
beleaguered Caribbean nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide, in an interview with The Times and The Miami Herald, said he 
discussed the Haitian military's expulsion order with U.N. Secretary General 
Boutros Boutros-Ghali and told him, "Personally, I would defy it." 
</P>
<P>
 But a U.N. spokesman announced that Boutros-Ghali and Christopher R. Thomas, 
acting OAS secretary general, decided to pull the observers out "in the next 
day or so." Spokesman Joe Sills said the withdrawal was ordered out of concern 
for the safety of the more than 100 observers. 
</P>
<P>
 Their withdrawal means that just a handful of foreign embassy officials and 
private U.S. groups will be keeping track of human rights abuses in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coup leaders don't want to let you see the rapes they are using as a 
political weapon," Aristide said. "If they don't have witnesses, they think it 
will be better for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Juan E. Mendez, general counsel of Human Rights Watch, a private monitoring 
group, said his organization fears "this is a prelude to the systematic 
slaughter of remaining Aristide supporters." 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the U.N. and OAS orders went out to pack and leave, the U.N. 
Security Council unanimously approved a stern statement condemning the military 
regime's decree expelling the observers who have documented a stream of 
political killings, torture and rapes in the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Security Council considers this action a serious escalation in the 
defiant stance of Haiti's illegal de facto regime toward the international 
community," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interview, Aristide refused to endorse or condemn a U.S. invasion to 
overthrow the Haitian military government but said he wants to see the regime 
toppled through peaceful international pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Clinton Administration officials have complained that Aristide has 
privately supported an invasion, only to reject the idea in public statements.

CLINTON HAILS UNITY, FREEDOM IN BERLIN; GERMANY: VISIT EMPHASIZES U.S. DESIRE 
TO REBUILD EUROPE AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT ONCE BLEW IT APART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 President Clinton strode through Brandenburg Gate into the former East Berlin 
on Tuesday, declaring a "monument to conquest" and "tyranny" had now become a 
gateway to a united Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing will stop us -- all things are possible," he told tens of thousands 
of Berliners massed at the structure that long obstructed Berlin's central 
boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 " Berlin ist frei " -- Berlin is free, the President exclaimed in German. 
</P>
<P>
 Joined by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on a dais before snapping German and 
U.S. flags, Clinton said: "We stand together where Europe's heart was cut in 
half, and celebrate unity. We stand where cruel walls of concrete separated 
mother from child, and we meet as one family." 
</P>
<P>
 The speech, in a city used as an oratorical prop for celebrated Cold War 
speeches by Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan, closed an eight-day 
European trip partly focused on Clinton's desire to rebuild Europe around the 
country that once blew it apart. The nine-minute address offered little in the 
way of new policy goals but referred again to Clinton's desire to give a 
leading role to Europe's biggest, wealthiest country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Berlin Wall is gone," said Clinton, who passed beneath the 85-foot 
triumphal arch as the first President since 1945 to walk on the soil of the 
former East Germany. "Now we must decide what we will build in its place." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, who later attended a ceremony marking the decommissioning of the Army 
unit that long policed Berlin, alluded to the long ties between the Germans and 
the United States, the country that had helped rebuild and protect it after the 
Nazi era. 
</P>
<P>
 The President invoked the memory of U.S. soldiers, the pilots who kept the 
15-month Berlin airlift alive and the sentries at the famous Checkpoint Charlie 
border crossing. "I say . . . America is on your side, now and forever," he 
told his audience, in German and English, drawing a renewed roar from the 
crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton praised Berliners' courage, recalling how, for 28 years of the Berlin 
Wall, half of the city was "encircled and the other half enslaved." He 
remembered how Berliners hurled stones at tanks in the aborted uprising of June 
17, 1953 and cited the "civil courage" that led East Germans to begin agitation 
for an end to their regime five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "You turned your dreams of a better life into the chisels of liberty," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that shaping the new era would not be easy. In an indirect 
reference to anti-foreigner violence in Germany, Clinton said, "We must reject 
those who would divide us with scalding words about race, ethnicity or 
religion." 
</P>
<P>
 The speech added an upbeat closing note to a presidential trip marred by the 
embarrassment of a plummeting dollar and the rejection at last weekend's 
economic summit of a Clinton trade proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 In Berlin -- a liberal city whose eastern sector gave the party run by former 
Communists 40% of the vote in the last election -- signs of the struggles that 
have convulsed Germany were apparent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was met by lusty cheers when he appeared under the gate after a 
five-minute walk from the Reichstag, the German Parliament building, with 
Hillary Rodhman Clinton, Kohl and his wife, Hannelore. But the chancellor, who 
has struggled to guide Germany during its racking transition, was greeted with 
boos as he approached the microphone. Eberhard Diepgen, the conservative mayor 
of Berlin, was also booed. 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks, Kohl said that "the experience of history demands that Germany 
does not stand on the sidelines when peace and freedom in Europe and the world 
are at stake." He said that, in the effort to knit a new Europe from the old 
Soviet empire, "'the dreadful news reaching us daily from Bosnia shows that we 
still have a long way to go to reach our goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandenburg Gate was modeled on an entry at the Acropolis and was intended as 
an emblem of Berliners' aim to make their city another Athens. But over the 
years, as conquering armies passed beneath it, it became a symbol of militarism 
-- topped with an Iron Cross and Prussian eagle -- and later, a monument to the 
divided city. During the Communist years, the gate fell into the eastern zone; 
when Reagan delivered his wall speech in 1987, East German troops prowled atop 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton spoke Tuesday as Berliners enjoyed an uncharacteristic spell of sunny 
weather during a season when the air is sweetened by the scent of blooming 
linden trees. The crowd was swelled by children given a holiday to attend the 
President's speech. The brash colors of their U.S.-style clothing mingled with 
the sober tones of older Berliners and east Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had struggled with his pronunciation of foreign languages earlier in 
the trip, in Latvia and Poland, and some aides hoped he would not try out the 
German he learned in three years of high school study. Some critics have 
pointed out that Kennedy's phrase " Ich bin ein Berliner, " from his 1963 
speech at the Berlin City Hall, was ungrammatical; it meant, literally, the 
President was a jelly-filled pastry. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton risked slip-ups three times in the speech with German expressions 
and seemed to satisfy his listeners. "He's got it down well," said German 
listener Andreas Schultz. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Berliners in the crowd spoke favorably of Clinton -- the older ones often 
because of their warm memories of America's postwar role and the younger ones 
because they found Clinton young and appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something I never thought I would see in my life," said Uwe Weimann, 
a retired manager for a large chemical company and a veteran of the 1945 Battle 
of Berlin. "I am extremely happy that toward the end of my life, I can see 
positive things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Clinton presided over a ceremony deactivating the U.S. Army's elite 
Berlin Brigade, organized in 1961 to oversee military operations in Berlin. 
Although it never fired a hostile shot, the unit oversaw the exchange of 
political prisoners and the operations of the well-known Checkpoint Charlie. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton reviewed the 1,000 troops and watched as the flag flying over Ft. 
McNair was lowered. It was presented to him to take back to the United States. 
"We are marking the end of a half-century of sacrifice on freedom's frontier," 
the President said. "America salutes you. Mission accomplished."

UKRAINE WILL TRY TO REVIVE WEAPONS INDUSTRY, LAWMAKERS SAY; ECONOMY: NEW 
PRESIDENT MAY WORK WITH RUSSIA TO IMPROVE SHARE OF EXPORT MARKET. DEAL WITH 
IRAN IN '93 REPORTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President-elect Leonid Kuchma will try to boost this nation's moribund economy 
by reviving its military industries and teaming up with Russia to grab a bigger 
share of the arms export market, Ukrainian lawmakers said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts here say Ukraine's weapons industry, which largely ground to a halt 
after the collapse of the Soviet Union, has revived somewhat and that new 
automatic rifles and highly accurate short-range missiles are being built at 
Yuzhmash, the gigantic rocket factory in Dnepropetrovsk that Kuchma headed 
before becoming prime minister in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchma, 55, defeated President Leonid Kravchuk in Sunday's elections to become 
independent Ukraine's second president. Kuchma, who is due to take office next 
Tuesday, campaigned against a "suicidal course of isolation from Russia" and 
courted Ukrainian military support. 
</P>
<P>
 A report released last month by the campaign of Ivan Pliushch, a rival 
presidential candidate and former Speaker of Parliament, asserted that in May, 
1993, during Kuchma's tenure as prime minister, Ukraine gave Iran 50 MIG-29 
fighter-bombers, 20 tanks and eight "super-modern" anti-ship missiles in 
exchange for Iranian oil. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Soviet breakup, former CIA Director Robert M. Gates warned that Iran 
had a long shopping list of Soviet-made weapons, including MIG-29 planes. 
Ukrainian officials have made a series of contradictory and Delphic comments 
about whether weapons were sold to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the oil deal, some Ukrainian officials said the swap might involve 
military supplies, while Pliushch said that Ukraine would not swap weapons for 
the oil but would give Iran commodities instead. Afterward, Kravchuk neither 
confirmed nor denied a weapons swap and other officials were equally evasive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ukraine does not trade arms with U.N.-sanctioned countries," Deputy Foreign 
Minister Boris Tarasiuk said in December. "I can't say there are grounds for 
distress over massive sales of arms to Iran. But rumors of anti-ship missiles 
for the Iranian navy are not true." 
</P>
<P>
 A 1993 Ukrainian government decree made information about weapons sales a 
state secret. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. source said the government had "no evidence" of Ukrainian arms sales to 
Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Russian analyst Andrei V. Kortunov of Moscow's USA-Canada Institute said 
Ukraine is believed to have sold "a few dozen tanks" to Iran. But Russia got 
wind of the deal and elbowed Ukraine out of a deal for several hundred more 
tanks by promising Iran parts and service, he said. Though more expensive, the 
Russian deal gave Iran vital maintenance guarantees that Ukraine could not 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 A Clinton Administration official and other experts said Iran has bartered 
with Russia and other former Soviet republics for weapons, including MIGs and 
tanks. But these sources said the figure of 50 MIGs was probably too high. As 
of 1993, Iran's air force consisted of 210 planes, including at least 30 
MIG-29s. 
</P>
<P>
 With its economy in a shambles, Ukraine may find it difficult to turn down 
buyers that the West considers troublesome. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pliushch report states that India, once one of the biggest clients for 
Soviet weapons and still on an arms-buying spree, is offering Kiev a long-term 
credit of up to $7.5 billion to "orient its military exports on India and 
cooperate in the production of strategic weapons, particularly fighter-bombers, 
submarines, tanks and rockets." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Russia reluctantly abandoned a deal to sell commercial satellite 
technology to India because of U.S. insistence that the launch-ballistics 
technology could help India deliver missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine's military-industrial complex, which includes tank factories, naval 
shipyards, aerospace and missile plants and other high-tech military research 
and development facilities, employs 2.5 million of its 52 million citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 During the presidential campaign, Kuchma often noted that 70% of this vast 
industrial net once relied on supplies, parts, fuel and orders from Moscow. 
With overall industrial production plunging 40% last year, Ukraine cannot 
afford to lose its profitable weapons markets and must team up with Russia to 
sell its wares, Kuchma said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of Ukraine's economic ties with Russia were through the 
military-industrial complex," opposition lawmaker Ivan Zayets said. "Renewing 
those ties means building weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials also see their arms and aerospace industries as the sectors 
that are most competitive on the world market -- and they are unlikely to want 
to share their arms clients with Ukraine. By stressing cooperation, not 
competition, with Russia, Kuchma may be hoping to get a piece of the lucrative 
market from which Ukraine might otherwise be shut out. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Kuchma has been elected president, Kortunov said it is possible that 
Ukraine and Russia will shelve their competition and work together to boost 
arms sales. "Naturally there are forces in Russia quite interested in such 
cooperation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Few Ukrainians are likely to complain. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This could fill our budgetary holes," said economist and lawmaker Volodymyr 
Pylypchuk. He complained that Ukraine's excess arsenal -- the Soviet Union left 
it with 6,300 tanks -- is not being sold but turned into scrap metal to comply 
with treaties reducing conventional forces in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sawed up 140 tanks last year," Pylypchuk said. "Even if we had sold them 
at bargain prices, we would have no budget deficit." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the Pliushch report viewed arms sales as objectionable only if they 
gave Russia too much leverage over the Ukrainian economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ukraine will become an appendage of the Russian military industry and will 
lose the chance to independently enter the international weapons market," the 
report warned.

NEWS ANALYSIS; RESIGNATION MAY WORK IN NEPALESE LEADER'S FAVOR; ASIA: GIRIJA 
PRASAD KOIRALA RETAINS POWER AS CARETAKER PREMIER WHILE PEDDLING HIS PLATFORM 
TO THE VOTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For three years, a septuagenarian workaholic who suffers from fainting spells 
served as prime minister of Nepal as the poor, isolated Shangri-La experimented 
with parliamentary democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, assailed by lawmakers he thought were his allies as well as by 
opposition Communists, the beleaguered Girija Prasad Koirala resigned. 
Elections have been called for Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury is still out on Koirala's performance. But the leader from the Nepali 
Congress Party would have done well to heed the old French nobleman's prayer -- 
"God protect me from my friends, I'll take care of my enemies" -- for it was 
Koirala's supposed party buddies who did him in. 
</P>
<P>
 The moment of truth came Sunday. During a crucial parliamentary vote on his 
government's program, 36 dissident Congress legislators abstained. Koirala was 
able to muster only 74 "yes" votes in the 205-seat House of Representatives. "I 
have no moral authority to stay in office," Koirala announced, then tendered 
his resignation to Nepal's king. 
</P>
<P>
 Delighted by his fall, hundreds of people staged a victory march through 
Katmandu's streets, chanting, "Democracy, hi, hi, Giriji, bye-bye!" 
</P>
<P>
 The cheering, though, was premature. As the painful story of the infancy of 
Nepalese democracy continues to be written, it may well be Koirala who has the 
last laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Nepal, a land the size of Arkansas, was ruled by a Hindu 
absolute monarch, Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev. In 1990, after a long political 
struggle in which up to 500 people died, the Eton- and Harvard-educated king 
gave in, delegating sovereignty to his subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, after creation of a constitutional monarchy and Parliament, the 
Nepalese were able to vote in multi-party elections for the first time in three 
decades. On May 29, 1991, as a result of the election victory of the Nepali 
Congress, Koirala, 71, the brother of two former prime ministers, took over the 
reins. 
</P>
<P>
 As a seasoned leader of the Congress, spearhead of the popular movement that 
successfully campaigned for the establishment of European-style democracy, 
Koirala vowed to deliver immediate relief to his 20 million fellow citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 But within three months of the premier's swearing in, his comrade in arms, 
Ganesh Man Singh, commander in chief of the 1990 pro-democracy movement, was 
calling loudly for his resignation. One reason, it appears, was Singh's failure 
to get a cousin appointed to the Planning Commission; another was the failure 
of the now-ailing "supremo" of the Congress, unlike Koirala, to be one of his 
party's 114 members elected to the House of Representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The third powerful party figure, Nepali Congress President Krishna Prasad 
Bhattarai, also proved incapable of winning election. His most recent bid, when 
he was beaten by the widow of a Communist leader this February, was a fiasco. 
</P>
<P>
 This month Koirala buried the hatchet with Bhattarai. But that wasn't enough 
to snuff out the mutiny by party dissidents who accused him of sabotaging 
Bhattarai's campaign and who withheld support last weekend. According to 
Koirala's own analysis, the root of his problems lay in the fact that although 
Congress campaigned for free elections, it never concerned itself about what to 
do if it won. "We had not done our homework and we were not psychologically 
prepared," he said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 But his government also came to be widely accused of incompetence and 
corruption, and symptoms of the same post-democratic hangover that has affected 
the ex-Soviet Union became chronic in Nepal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Shangri-La" is the evocative nickname often given to Nepal, with its 
majestic, snow-clad Himalayan peaks and emerald valleys. But for most who live 
there, it is no Eden. More than four-fifths of the Nepalese eke out a living 
through subsistence farming. Public health is still so poor that each year 
45,000 children die of diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
 Political scientists, such as Prof. Lok Raj Baral of Katmandu's Tribhuvan 
University, see Nepal as in an uneasy transitional phase in which institutions 
from the old absolute monarchy coexist with democracy. "The bureaucracy is 
intact, it's the same army and police," Baral says. "The only new people are 
the ones in Parliament." 
</P>
<P>
 He accuses Koirala and his colleagues of having been too slow and timid in 
asserting their authority, both in government and over the fractious Nepali 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Koirala's foes on the left also became near-permanent sources of concern. 
Communist support gave the pro-democracy movement a crucial boost, and the 
Communists won 81 seats in Parliament. But when Koirala's government was only 
29 days old, the Communists began leading strikes and protests. 
</P>
<P>
 After Koirala's resignation, both the Communists and Bhattarai on behalf of 
the Congress demanded the chance to form a new government. But the route out of 
the governmental crisis that was unexpectedly chosen by King Birendra has given 
Koirala a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 A royal communique issued Monday said Koirala had been asked to stay on as 
Nepal's caretaker premier and organize the November parliamentary elections. So 
instead of having to hand power over now to a successor government, Koirala 
gets to wield the perks of his office for four more months, then to appeal 
directly to voters for their support. 
</P>
<P>
 He now seems keen on doing so. "I don't see any other alternative to going to 
people and seeking their fresh mandate," he told reporters.

2 MEN FOUND DEAD IN SEA OFF NEWPORT BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coast Guard searchers Tuesday recovered the bodies of two men about 10 miles 
off Newport Beach and used aircraft to hunt for other victims who may have been 
been aboard a boat that sank in a heavily traveled shipping corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members identified one of the men as Khanh Nguyen, 50, of Alhambra, but 
the other man had not been identified by late Tuesday, according to Scott 
Carrier, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities received no distress calls early Tuesday morning and had not 
determined what happened to the two men or their boat. Coast Guard radio 
reports indicated that rescuers had found nets registered to a commercial 
fishing boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrier said relatives told investigators that Nguyen and a friend set out on 
a fishing outing late Monday night. He said the relatives did not know the 
friend's name or where the boat was docked. The family got worried when Nguyen 
did not return by Tuesday morning and called authorities after hearing reports 
that the bodies had been found. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the men was wearing a life jacket. One was found clutching a life 
preserver and the other was holding on to a boat fender, a plastic barrel hung 
over the side of a boat to cushion the vessel from striking the dock while it 
is being moored, according to Coast Guard spokeswoman Liz Brannan.

 Democrat Bob Kerrey's bid for a second term in the U.S. Senate received a 
boost Tuesday from a Cabinet member of the George Bush Administration. Former 
Agriculture Secretary Edward R. Madigan said he was endorsing Kerrey because 
the senator is a strong advocate for agriculture at a time when rural 
representation is dwindling.

NEW AD FOCUSES ON IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican U.S. Senate candidate Michael Huffington began airing a new 
statewide television commercial Tuesday that criticizes Democratic Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein for claiming in another television ad that she is working hard to 
stop illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE AD: It opens with a picture of a television set showing Feinstein 
speaking to the camera. A voice then says, "In her immigration ad, Dianne 
Feinstein comes off like 'The Terminator.' But as mayor, Feinstein wasn't the 
Terminator to illegal aliens -- she was the Welcome Wagon." The ad then 
switches to a graphic that includes a purported headline from the San Francisco 
Chronicle about immigration. A narrator continues: "Feinstein ordered police 
not to report illegal aliens, making the city a sanctuary, a safe haven -- in 
defiance of federal immigration law. Mike Huffington cast three strong votes 
for 6,000 more border guards and tougher laws to stop illegal aliens. The 
Welcome Wagon becomes the Terminator -- must be election year." 
</P>
<P>
 * THE ANALYSIS: Feinstein's campaign hotly denies the ad's claim that she 
defied federal law by ordering police not to report illegal aliens. The 
statement is based on a non-binding resolution that Feinstein signed as mayor 
of San Francisco in 1985 that said city police and other officials would not 
initiate the deportation of refugees fleeing a particularly violent period in 
Guatemala and El Salvador. The resolution was directed only at law-abiding 
refugees from those two countries. Feinstein aides said the action was taken 
because refugees were fearful of reporting crimes. Huffington attributed the 
ad's claim that Feinstein defied federal law to a 1985 newspaper quote from a 
federal immigration official who said the resolution advocated law-breaking. 
The 6,000 new border guards were included in a plan Huffington voted for last 
April. Both candidates have staked out tough positions on immigration, with 
Feinstein pointing to a comprehensive package of reforms she introduced 
recently that also calls for more guards and tougher border enforcement.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN WOOS WALL STREET, CRITICIZES WILSON ON 
FINANCES; THE TREASURER GOES TO NEW YORK TO TRY TO BOLSTER THE STATE'S CREDIT 
RATING. A NEW CAMPAIGN COMMERCIAL ACCUSES THE GOVERNOR OF FOUR YEARS OF FISCAL 
MISMANAGEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As state Treasurer Kathleen Brown sought to reassure Wall Street about 
California's fiscal stability, Democratic candidate for governor Brown also 
unleashed a new series of ads Tuesday alleging that her Republican foe, Gov. 
Pete Wilson, has bungled the state's finances ever since he took office. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of three new Brown campaign commercials, an announcer says: "The Wilson 
years -- tax hikes, IOUs, now this: $7 billion in borrowing, a $3-billion 
deficit, tax breaks for the rich at the expense of students, senior citizens 
and the middle class." 
</P>
<P>
 The ad ends by saying: "Four years of fiscal mismanagement. Can we afford four 
more?" 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was in New York, along with other California fiscal managers, seeking to 
bolster the state's credit rating against concerns about another year of 
deficit financing in the new budget signed into law last Friday by Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is running for a second four-year term in the Nov. 8 general election. 
</P>
<P>
 A Brown campaign aide in Sacramento said there was no inherent conflict in her 
statements as treasurer and her campaign's anti-Wilson claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Glazer, a Brown campaign aide, said her role as treasurer in New York 
City is to assure potential investors that the state will be able to meet its 
obligations, even though Brown sharply disagrees with Wilson's method for 
paying off the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's consistent with her own view that she needs to fulfill her 
responsibilities as treasurer, yet doesn't take away from her own judgment 
about what a bad job the governor has done," added Glazer, a senior campaign 
adviser for communications and policy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Brown ads also appeared to criticize Wilson for failing to take 
actions that Brown so far has declined to take herself. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a commercial on education said Wilson tried to "slash billions" 
from the budget for public schools; Brown's own proposed budget outline 
released in June did not call for any increase in public school finance. 
</P>
<P>
 She also criticized Wilson for welfare cuts that she also has embraced. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's true," Glazer said in reference to spending on education. But he 
added, "Wilson can't run away from his record on education, his record of 
failing to support the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a theme to our challenge here," Glazer added. "That is there is a 
clear record of mismanagement. We are going to hold him accountable for that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson campaign spokesman Dan Schnur said Wilson's budgets had provided 
the full funding required by Proposition 98, the voter initiative that 
established school spending as a certain percentage of the state's General Fund 
each year. Several of the Brown campaign claims were based on original budget 
proposals by Wilson that were altered while the spending document was being 
worked out with the Legislature, which is controlled by Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's budget outline did not vary greatly from Wilson's. She proposed that 
the $3 billion in state debt be paid off over a five-year period rather than 
two as proposed by Wilson. Wilson aides said state law did not allow the 
government to stretch out a debt payment over five years without a vote of the 
people, thus claiming that Brown's plan was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 What the Brown ad labels "tax cuts for the rich" are not tax cuts in the 
traditional sense. They refer to Wilson's refusal to extend a temporary 
increase in the state income tax for the wealthiest of Californians beyond the 
end of 1995. They will continue to be in effect next year and could be extended 
then by the Legislature and governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The third Brown ad attacked Wilson on a subject that has been a constant 
theme: that Wilson's claim to be tough on crime is undercut by a parole policy 
that has allowed violent criminals to remain on the street in spite of 
violations of their parole. In the case cited Tuesday, the criminal now is 
being held for trial on charges of committing murder while remaining free in 
spite of parole violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's argument on parole violators has not been that they automatically be 
returned to prison, but that they should not be allowed to remain free until 
they have been subjected to a parole revocation hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Schnur responded by saying the ads will only remind voters that Brown 
personally opposes the death penalty, although she says she would enforce it as 
governor just as rigorously as Wilson does, and that she is against Wilson's 
proposed law that violent sex offenders should be subject to a possible life 
prison term on a first offense.

COAST GUARD HELICOPTER CRASH KILLS 4 IN HUMBOLDT COUNTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four U.S. Coast Guard members were killed Tuesday morning when their 
helicopter crashed just a few minutes after the pilot radioed that the craft 
was heading into fog. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard HH-65 Dolphin helicopter crashed on land, killing the two 
pilots and two crew members, said California Department of Forestry Fire Capt. 
Ron Samuelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Their identities were withheld pending notification of family. 
</P>
<P>
 The last radio contact with the helicopter was about 5 a.m., shortly after the 
crew said it was descending through fog to assist a vessel stranded on rocks 
near Shelter Cove. The coastal town is in Humboldt County about 160 miles 
northwest of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Wreckage from the crash was found about 6:30 a.m., said Petty Officer Darrell 
Wilson, a Coast Guard spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had radio contact with them and then they just lost radio contact," 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews were scheduled to cut a trail through steep terrain to get to the crash 
site and remove the bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take quite an effort to get the people out," Samuelson said.

ENVIRONMENTALISTS SEEK MORE WATER FOR DELTA SMELT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Environmentalists who won federal protection for the delta smelt returned to 
court Tuesday, seeking more Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta fresh water for the 
tiny fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine environmental and fishing organizations sued the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 
Service, claiming the smelt is being threatened with extinction because of 
inadequate water allocations in the government's 1994 protection plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Any increased flows would probably come at the expense of farmers whose 
irrigation water is pumped from the delta by way of the federal Central Valley 
Project and the State Water Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit asked a federal judge to order a new plan with more protection for 
the smelt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fish and Wildlife Service disputed the allegations. The current plan is 
adequate to prevent further danger to the smelt population, said Cay Goude, 
chief of the agency's Endangered Species Division in Northern California.

OBESE GIRLS, SHORT BOYS EARN LESS, STUDY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Obese teen-age girls and short teen-age boys make less money when they become 
young adults than others their age, a study of thousands of British youths 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 The study doesn't indicate whether the culprit is discrimination or some 
internal factor such as low self-esteem, but it suggests that appearance can 
have a big effect on teen-agers' transition from school to work, the 
researchers said in the July issue of the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 They said research indicates that the same problems exist in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effects are very important just as people enter the labor market," said 
co-author David G. Blanchflower, an economics professor at Dartmouth College in 
Hanover, N.H. "It looks like that early stage is . . . crucial." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. James D. Sargent, lead author of the study, said obesity needs to be 
prevented by teaching children to eat properly. But he said he is also 
concerned that women are starving themselves or purging to achieve the ideal of 
thinness prized in British and U.S. society. 
</P>
<P>
 Sargent is an assistant professor of pediatrics at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical 
Center in Lebanon, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
 The study looked at 12,537 people in England, Scotland and Wales, where all 
children born between March 3 and 9, 1958, were enrolled in a national child 
development study and have been tracked ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that girls in the heaviest 10% of their age group at age 16 
earned 7.4% less than their non-obese peers by the time they reached 23; and 
those in the heaviest 1% earned 11.4% less at age 23. 
</P>
<P>
 For boys, obesity did not appear to affect earnings, but height did. For every 
four inches less height at age 16, boys earned 2% less at age 23, the 
researchers found. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous studies, including a recent survey of more than 10,000 Americans ages 
16 to 24, found that overweight people, especially women, are far less likely 
to get married or make a comfortable living when they get older. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. William H. Dietz, who led that study, said the new work "provides once 
again pretty compelling evidence that obesity is a major social handicap as 
well as physical handicap." 
</P>
<P>
 Dietz, director of clinical nutrition at New England Medical Center in Boston, 
said his study also found a correlation between lower male height and lower 
earnings.

WORLD CUP USA '94; ALL EYES ON THE PRIZE; SOCCER BECOMES BIGGER THAN A BIG 
STORY IN THE FOUR NATIONS IN THE SEMIFINALS: IT BECOMES THE ONLY STORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 If there are Bulgarians in Italy tonight, they are silent Bulgarians. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Alps to Sicily, nothing will move in Italy beyond flickering images 
on TV sets when the beloved Azzurri play Bulgaria in a World Cup semifinal 
game. More than half the country -- about 30 million people, nearly half of 
them women -- will watch every move with unconcealed partisanship. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bulgaria, the team's ascent has been compared to the fall of communism 
there in 1989. A victory today would send hundreds of thousands of celebrants 
onto the streets of Sofia, some bearing beer and schnapps, others wearing masks 
of hero Hristo Stoitchkov's face. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil, Luzinete Nunes de Santana, a 32-year-old domestic, again won't be 
able to watch her nation's semifinal game against Sweden without first taking 
tranquilizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I scream, I cry, I kick; whoever is at my side suffers," says De Santana, who 
spent most of her $64 monthly salary to buy a uniform resembling the national 
team's. "I feel my heart pounding and I'm afraid of getting sick." 
</P>
<P>
 If Sweden wins, fans by the thousands, with faces painted in the blue and 
yellow of the Swedish flag, can again be expected to dance and strip and swim 
in the fountain of Stockholm's central square, Sergels Torg, reveling in cool 
water against the heat of victory and shouting "Sweden, Sweden, Sweden," until 
they lose their voices. 
</P>
<P>
 The fervor today in four nations with teams in the World Cup semifinals will 
stretch across class, color and geography, from the Rocinha slums of Brazil to 
the majesty of Rome. It will be all-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard for Americans to understand," says Vanderley Borges, Rio de Janeiro 
police press secretary. "There's no equivalent to it for them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The local impact of this famous, long and contagious international athletic 
event rivals Carnival , outshines the Northern Lights, outdraws the pope, and, 
as party-starter down east, humbles the fall of communism. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, by now everybody knows the World Cup transfixes the world outside the 
United States, but today Brazil, Sweden, Italy and Bulgaria are most viscerally 
afflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The disparity of finalists is remarkable this year, rich and poor, large and 
small. There is an eastern team, a western team, a northern team and a southern 
team. Two teams that expected to be here; two that most expected would be long 
gone by now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real miracle of this World Cup is not the presence of Italy in the 
semifinal, a point the team has reached four times in the last five editions. . 
. . The real miracle has been achieved by little Bulgaria," said Giorgio 
Tosatti in the Milan daily Corriere della Sera. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil and Italy, cases in point, are among the final four because that is 
where they belong. Any of the millions of soccer experts walking the streets of 
Sao Paulo or Milan this morning can explain why, although few would resist also 
criticizing the much-maligned Italian and Brazilian coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 After Italy beat Spain to advance to the semifinals, a reporter asked Italian 
Coach Arrigo Sacchi why the same teams always seem to advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not the case of a single tournament but of the history, the 
organization and the soccer environment in any given country," said Sacchi, who 
once coached AC Milan, which has consistently been the best team in the Italian 
League, itself the world's best. 
</P>
<P>
 There are four soccer giants in the world, and Italy and Brazil, each 
three-time Cup winners, are two of them. Germany and Argentina, now among the 
20 also-rans, are the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans at home, their opponents -- indeed, the entire world -- expect these 
teams to do well. If they do not, heads roll as well as soccer balls. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no such lofty expectations in Sweden, which hasn't placed since 1958 
and nearly didn't qualify this year, or Bulgaria, which had never won a World 
Cup match until this year. They have triumphed, even if they lose today. 
</P>
<P>
 So is it that soccer-crazed millions in four competing nations will watch 
semifinal matches today from perspectives as disparate as the countries that 
engender them. BRAZIL 
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil, millions of hearts teeter on the edge of collective agony and 
ecstasy with each game, particularly as the country advances closer to the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiologist Carlos Sheer has been busy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last Cup, I took care of various urgent calls of high blood pressure and 
chest pain," Sheer said. "This year, for the time being, I've only received 
calls of people worrying if they could watch the game." 
</P>
<P>
 So intense is the emotion in Brazil that when a power outage in the remote 
Amazon town of Pimento Bueono sent television pictures flickering off the 
screen, an enraged mob of 1,000 rushed out of their homes, stoned the mayor's 
office and stormed the town's electrical power plant, setting fire to a power 
company car. And that was just for Brazil's first game. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire country borders on collective fanaticism, swept up in futbol fever. 
Even in the middle of a presidential campaign and a complete change of the 
national currency, football, accompanied with a huge photo, has been the lead 
story in every newspaper since the World Cup began. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, congress adjourns, schools close, government offices and local 
businesses shut down early for every game that Brazil plays, a phenomenon akin 
to shutting down all of America for a playoff game. Except for neighborhoods 
where tens of thousands gather to watch huge, big-screen televisions, urban 
centers such as Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo -- a total of 30 million people -- 
seem like ghost towns. Nearly everybody is inside watching the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football is more emblematic for the Brazilian population than a change in the 
economy," says anthropologist Jose Carlos Rodrigues, professor at Pontifica 
Catholic University and Federal Fluminense University. "We have our own 
mythology, like the Greeks have their own. Football is the God of our national 
mythology. It cauterizes emotions and makes each citizen feel like part of the 
whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Neighborhoods and even cities have been transformed into a sea of green and 
gold as residents have hung banners and canopies of streamers across streets 
that have been repainted in the national colors. One Sao Paulo store alone has 
sold 60,000 meters of decorative green and gold ribbon, enough to stretch the 
length of 650 football fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Exploding fireworks on game day give the city the sound of a war zone. And 
after each victory, streets are closed to vehicular traffic as people pour into 
the streets to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 With each victory, the anxiety is heightened. With a victory in the World Cup, 
the country will explode in a celebration bigger than the massive Carnival, 
which takes over the city every year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so big that it's actually frightening," says Eloisa Leuzinger, a 
45-year-old researcher. 
</P>
<P>
 And if they lose? 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll all cry," said Jorge Luiz Nascimento, 52, head of a neighborhood 
association. "The whole country. You don't want to see it." SWEDEN 
</P>
<P>
 The headline in Monday's afternoon Aftonbladet tabloid in Sweden said it all: 
"Yes!" 
</P>
<P>
 "This Was The Wildest Party of All," the paper said in its 16-page special 
section after Sweden defeated Romania on penalty kicks in the quarterfinal on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 So wild was it that one woman delivered a baby boy in the central square, 
unable to get through the throngs to the hospital; so wild that a man in the 
southern city of Malmo suffered a heart attack watching the game but refused to 
let his wife call the hospital until the penalty shooting was over; so wild 
that another woman fatally stabbed her husband who preferred the game to making 
love. 
</P>
<P>
 He and half the nation felt that way -- 4 million Swedes. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the cities early Monday morning, drivers honked their horns, 
pedestrians climbed traffic lights and lampposts to wave their flags higher, 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are so proud to be Swedish," enthused sports writer Bengt Olsson at 
Aftonbladet. "We haven't had a success like this since (Bjorn) Borg won 
Wimbledon back in the '70s." 
</P>
<P>
 Or since Sweden went to the semifinals in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made it through from the torture chamber of soccer," wrote Aftonbladet's 
Ulle Svenning. 
</P>
<P>
 Svenning is a political columnist, but then what could be more important to 
the nation than soccer now? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a triumph for a team, not for any individual," he wrote. "That's how 
we want it in Sweden. Nobody should be a hero, bigger than the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody but goalie Thomas Ravelli, perhaps, whose picture was plastered across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "He Saves Us" said the headline in Aftonbladet. 
</P>
<P>
 "England, France, Germany, Holland, Colombia -- All out," the Swedish paper 
Expressen celebrated. "And Sweden in the semifinals against Brazil." 
</P>
<P>
 Victory is thrilling, exciting, fantastic, Swedes said. Even the drunken fans, 
the soccer hooligans who turned over a patrol car and went for a bus before 
police evacuated Sergels Torg, even they didn't dampen the national enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sports pulls people together," Olsson said. "This is good nationalism." ITALY 
</P>
<P>
 By this late stage in a madness that sweeps all of Italy once every four 
years, newspapers can't keep soccer terms out of their headlines even when 
talking of serious world affairs, such as the outcome of the weekend G-7 
meeting in Naples. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeltsin wins the Mondiale (World Cup) of the Eight" said La Stampa of Turin, 
hailing Russia as a new member of the group of the seven, now eight, leading 
industrialized countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In their customary commentaries that put soccer on the front pages, columnists 
are not expecting an easy victory for Italy over Bulgaria, which has already 
beaten Argentina, Mexico and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be another suffering," predicts Gianni Mura in La Repubblica. 
</P>
<P>
 For Italy, suffering is the middle name of World Cup '94. Gritty Bulgaria 
stormed into the semifinals. Mighty Italy limped, each game a Calvary; every 
victory a last-minute miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Cup began, Italians have been outwardly unhappy with the coach, the 
stars and the entire team -- singly, or in often arcane combination. Would they 
qualify? Could they win? Would they advance? 
</P>
<P>
 "Ironically, now that they have made the semifinals, the pressure is off. The 
higher you go, the easier it gets," said commentator Giorgio Chinaglia, one of 
Italy's greatest former players. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that honor is assured, every move that any player or coach makes in 
America is grist to immediate digestion and instant analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every day there is a consuming teapot tempest: It is too hot, it is too 
humid, the team runs too much, the coach is a cretin, the team doesn't run 
enough, the coach is a genius. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian police will watch tonight's proceedings along with everyone else, but 
after the game there will be work to do if Italy wins: Italians have never been 
known to celebrate in silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Huge, happy crowds jam city centers up and down the peninsula. After the 
quarterfinal victory over Spain, police banned cars from the center of Rome -- 
there were too many people in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Naples, particularly, hankers for a festa. Italy's victory Saturday came when 
the ceremonial heart of the city was closed to Neapolitans and filled with VIPs 
-- President Clinton to Yeltsin to soccer fanatic Italian Prime Minister Silvio 
Berlusconi. 
</P>
<P>
 The best Naples could muster last weekend was a roar when Italy scored its 
winning goal that interrupted a press conference by visiting French President 
Francois Mitterand. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the bigwigs are gone and Naples is an open city again, able to fully 
participate in a consuming national thirst for soccer victory. BULGARIA 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps David Miller, writing in the Times of London, best summed up the 
feeling in Bulgaria: 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an element of national celebration in Bulgaria's victory that few in 
the United States for the finals can understand. For the nine million 
population of the country bordering the Black Sea, this performance is a global 
representation of new liberties, a joyous statement of nationalism enacted far 
away in the world's most powerful country, where the population is busy 
searching for Bulgaria on the atlas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The exploits of Stoitchkov and Yordan Letchkov have done for Bulgaria what 
Hungary's triumphs did for theirs in the early Fifties, winning the Olympic 
Games and, so nearly, the World Cup, and most especially for what it then still 
meant, defeating England at Wembley for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 So it was not surprising that President Zhelyu Zhelev, in a nationwide 
broadcast, equated the soccer team's ascent to the fall of communism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only after democracy came to this country our soccer players were allowed to 
play abroad and to create their real talents," Zhelev said. "So this victory 
comes naturally as a result of this development." 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of some 10,000 watched the quarterfinal victory over Germany on huge 
television screens in front of the National Palace of Culture. Hours after the 
game they formed a dancing and singing throng; cars filled downtown Sofia, 
causing traffic gridlock and blocking public transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our golden boys made us forget the 10th of November," said Alexander Tomov, 
40, referring to the day in 1989 when former Communist dictator Todor Zhivkov 
was toppled. "The 10th of July is our new national holiday." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Mihailova, 75, who was on the street celebrating with the young soccer 
fans, said she could not remember such a joyful event in Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel at least 10 years younger," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Ron Harris in Sao Paulo and Marjorie Miller in Bonn, 
Germany; special correspondent Janet Stobart in Rome and Times news services

COMMENTARY; WORLD CUP USA '94; HOW DO YOU SAY "WHERE IS THE GAP" IN BULGARIAN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In our continuing informational series entitled, "This Is America: I Hope You 
Brought Money," today we poke our roving World Cup cameras into that most 
American of money institutions, The Mall. For it is at The Mall that we find 
out precisely why the world has come to Los Angeles these last few weeks -- not 
for soccer, but for pins, pendants, posters, paperweights and, of course, Peter 
Max. 
</P>
<P>
 At The Mall we find stores that did not even exist several weeks ago and won't 
exist several weeks from now, but at this very moment are doing a brisk 
business in World Cup wastebasket backboards ($7.95). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good old American ingenuity," said Melvin Galloway, manager of retail 
operations at The Soccer Experience in Beverly Center. "This is just a bunch of 
Americans getting in here, making a buck and getting out." 
</P>
<P>
 "I met people from all 24 countries (participating in the World Cup finals) 
within the first month of opening our doors," said Steve Cross, owner of Plaza 
Pasadena's World Soccer Store, which opened April 1 and will close Aug. 1. 
"It's been steady business." 
</P>
<P>
 (Mall Tip I for Visitors: These World Cup stores are busiest on the day of 
games; the stores are least busy when they're closed. "Actually, for the last 
three Sundays (in which there were games at the Rose Bowl), we had people 
waiting at the door an hour before the store was supposed to open," Cross 
said.) 
</P>
<P>
 (Mall Tip II for Visitors: We cannot help the world find its cars when done at 
The Mall.) 
</P>
<P>
 There appears to be a simple formula to track the spending habits of foreign 
visitors and foreign-born L.A. residents: 
</P>
<P>
 You win, you buy; you lose, you cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever a team is in town, their sales go through the roof," Galloway said. 
"And if they win a game, forget it -- everything goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, there also appears to be a simple formula to track the spending 
habits of generic soccer fans and casual, local mall rats: 
</P>
<P>
 You got it, I'll get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of our product is moving," Galloway said. "There are no dogs." (Unless he 
has those soccer-playing dogs on velvet.) 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the following items can be sold and bought, and, in fact, are sold and 
bought: 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup coffee mug ($11.50). 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup fabric wallet ($5.95). 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup money clip ($39.95). 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup sterling silver cuff links ($59). 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup gold watch ($179). 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup shin and ankle protector ($16). 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup temporary tattoo ($4.50). 
</P>
<P>
 And now for the big-ticket item, ladies and gentlemen: 
</P>
<P>
 World Cup full-leather country jacket, Jeff Hamilton-designed, hand-stitched 
in L.A., 100% lambskin ($900). 
</P>
<P>
 Now, these are all practical items -- particularly if you happen to be 
shopping for Johnny Depp -- but there is some merchandise that we have to 
recommend against: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Pins. What's the deal with this pin craze the last 10 years? They're just 
pins, for crying out loud. (Obviously, the public disagrees. Cross does 10% of 
his business on pins. "It's a $5 souvenir," he explained. "It packs easy and 
you don't have to worry about sizes." Yeah, well, if that's all it takes, how 
come shoelace sales aren't booming?) 
</P>
<P>
 People buy pins, trade pins, collect pins and, ultimately, stick themselves 
with pins. (So many pins, so few shirts and coats.) There are subsets of pins 
-- city pins, team pins, nation pins, even McDonald's pins. It's kind of hard 
to collect them all, unless you don't mind eating Egg McMuffins every day for a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Peter Max. What, his 15 years of fame aren't up yet? It's just schlock art, 
for crying out loud. (Obviously, the public disagrees. "All my Peter Max stuff 
sells plenty," Galloway said. "The posters, the T-shirts, it's all popular." 
Yeah, well, not to burst any cold-water bubbles here, but that fancy schmancy 
soccer design on all those Peter Max T-shirts -- how's that baby going to hold 
up after going through the laundry? After three washings, it'll just look like 
a Rorschach test.) 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a tipoff on the quality of his work: The poster from the "Peter Max 
collection" sells for $60 framed, or $14 unframed. That means the frame is 
worth three times as much as the art, so how good can this guy be? (And why is 
he always referred to as "Peter Max?" Well, OK, sometimes it's "pop artist 
Peter Max." But it's never just "Max." Besides which, we'll take a good LeRoy 
Nieman water color any day of the week over any Peter Max finger painting. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Neckties. People, people, people -- there is absolutely no way any World 
Cup necktie looks good tied around anyone's neck. Case closed. (Obviously, the 
public disagrees. Our World Cup cameras spotted an otherwise 
respectable-looking, middle-aged man at Farmers Market last week wearing a 
necktie featuring the likeness of Roberto Baggio. Folks -- and we shouldn't 
have to say this more than once -- when you buy a fine Italian silk tie, it 
does not have to have an Italian on it.) 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the best buy might be the T-shirts that provide information about 
each World Cup nation. For $16.95, the front of the T-shirt includes capital, 
population, language, area, currency, continent and precise geographical 
location of the nation in question. (Saudi Arabia: 24 deg N lat; 46 deg E 
long.) 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this won't help you find your car when you're done at The Mall, but 
it will give you some sense of direction -- along with your World Cup compass 
($8.50) -- when you finally manage to leave.

WORLD CUP USA '94; 'IT'S THE AMAZING, AWESOME, FANTASTIC FOUR, BAY-BEE!!'; FOR 
THOSE WHO TURN UP THE VOLUME FOR ANDRES CANTOR, TURN IT DOWN NOW, BECAUSE HERE 
COMES DICK VITALE ON THE WORLD CUP 
</P>

<P>
 Hey, look what we have there, it's the championship of soccer, the ball that 
you kick with your foot and knock with your head and try to put in a net the 
size of a delivery truck lying on its side. Hey, is this a great sport, or 
what? I mean, it's not a little round goal, but, that's another sport. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm talking soccer now, baby. And don't call a TO, baby. Not here, not now, 
not ever. This entire World Cup has been amazing, absolutely great for America, 
and now we're down to the last four teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Do one thing for me, though, please. Just don't call it the Final Four. 
There's only one Final Four and it's college hoops, baby, so this has got to be 
something like the Amazing Four or Fantastic Four or Truly Awesome Four or . . 
. you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I'm no soccer expert, but let's look at the four teams that are still 
left. I like Italy, naturally, maybe because with a name like mine, I'm as 
Italian as gnocchi. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Baggio. Know something about this guy? He's awesome, baby. Baggio, 
A-E-I-O-U, you know, great vowels, great consonants, he's got it all, including 
hair, which is something I know about, or used to, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as I know, the only drawback is that Baggio dated Madonna one time or 
something, so you've got to grade him down on that. Sorry, baby. 
</P>
<P>
 The way I see it, the Italians have a lot going for them: a good offense, a 
good defense and the ability to appreciate good food. You gotta love 'em. How 
can you go against these guys? 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, if they find out that we're not all in their corner, they might do 
something really drastic, like take all our cappuccino machines back. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is Brazil. What a country. I mean, any place that has a mountain 
called Sugar Loaf in it, well, it's got to have a sweet team. Know what I mean? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know that much about Brazil's players except they're the all-name team 
by themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 It's amazing. Everybody goes by one name. Bebeto, Romario, Ronaldo, Muller, 
Viola, Zetti, Gilmar, Jorginho, Branco, Aldair, Cafu, Dunga, Zinho, Rai, 
Mazinho. Looks like the pass list at the Copacabana. 
</P>
<P>
 They sound like a high-wire act. This could be important since they play this 
tournament without a safety net. Good luck, Brazil (but not if it plays Italy). 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria isn't supposed to be here, but it is anyway after a huge upset of 
Germany. Since Germany was the defending World Cup champion, the Germans really 
were upset. 
</P>
<P>
 So we know Bulgaria is capable of pulling off a big one. The other thing we 
know about Bulgaria is that the Danube River flows along its northern border 
with Turkey and that Yordan Letchkov, the guy who scored the winning goal 
against Germany, doesn't have any more hair than I do. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweden also made the big party. For anyone who thought the best things Sweden 
ever came up with were Anita Ekberg and saunas, the soccer team is right up 
there too. Sweden's coach is Tommy Svensson, who had to sit there and wait 
through an overtime and then wait some more before his team finally beat 
Romania on penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, Tommy, I've got news for you. Keep it up this week and you'll be so big 
over here they'll name an ice cream parlor after you. 
</P>
<P>
 That reminds me. I'm taking a TO myself right here. I've got just a little bit 
of advice for all the World Cup coaches and it comes straight from the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Here it is: Just win. Yes, just win. Says it all, doesn't it?. 
</P>
<P>
 Too bad the U.S. didn't get here, but boy, were they ever something. Great 
spirit, great uniforms. I loved 'em, especially that guy with the big red hair 
and the red goatee, Lalas, Alexi Lalas. He'd make my All-Wacko team. . . . I 
mean wacko in a positive way, you understand. 
</P>
<P>
 You know the thing I like about soccer? The passion they all play with. The 
players have such a love of putting that jersey on. It's incredible. And the 
love they have for their country, that excites me. 
</P>
<P>
 They play with the three E's. You know: energy, excitement, enthusiasm. You 
gotta love the World Cup, baby. I do. 
</P>

WORLD CUP USA '94; THE PENULTIMATE GAME; LOOKING FOR THE BEST SEMIFINAL OF ALL 
TIME? GO BACK TO SEVILLE, SPAIN, ON JULY 8, 1982: WEST GERMANY VS. FRANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's the sort of question that can lead to endless argument: Which was the 
best ever World Cup semifinal? 
</P>
<P>
 Those who were in Italy four years ago will claim the England-West Germany 
game in Milan and the Argentina-Italy game in Naples, both of which went to 
overtime and then to penalty kicks, deserve the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who were in Mexico in 1970 will have a much better case if they argue 
that the Italy-West Germany match in front of 80,000 disbelieving fans at 
Azteca Stadium in Mexico City is the all-time greatest semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 They, too, will be wrong, but not by much. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians and Germans played an enthralling game. Italy led, 1-0, at the 
half and appeared to have the game won. But West Germany tied it in injury 
time, and the 30-minute overtime that followed produced an astonishing five 
goals. The lead alternated before Italy finally emerged with a 4-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a game that remains among the classics, but there was an even better 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was played at Sanchez Pizuan Stadium in Seville, Spain, on July 8, 1982. No 
one in the crowd of 63,000 or the worldwide television audience will forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side there was West Germany, powerful and confident as ever after 
winning the European Championship in 1980. On the other side there was France, 
just beginning to blossom into the team that two years later would win a 
European Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans had solid, capable players such as Paul Breitner, Karl-Heinz 
Rummenigge, Horst Hrubesch and Pierre Litbarski. The French countered with the 
creativity and elegance of Michel Platini, Jean Tigana, Alain Giresse and 
Dominique Rocheteau. 
</P>
<P>
 It was to be a game of contrasting personalities and contrasting styles, 
muscle against mind, force against flair. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans took the lead on a shot by Littbarski in the 18th minute, but the 
French tied the score on a penalty kick by Platini nine minutes later after 
Rocheteau had been held back by Bernd Foerster. 
</P>
<P>
 The score remained 1-1 for the rest of the half and, indeed, the rest of 
regulation time. But the game was hardly a dull affair. The turning point 
occurred in the 57th minute when West German goalkeeper Harald (Toni) 
Schumacher committed one of the worst World Cup fouls ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Glanville, in his authoritative "History of the World Cup," described 
the incident best: 
</P>
<P>
 "Patrick Battiston, who had just come on as a substitute, raced through the 
middle on to a beautifully executed pass, which turned the defense. Out of his 
goal raced the burly Schumacher. Battiston beat him to the ball, but Schumacher 
thundered into him, brutally smashing him to the ground with a blow of the 
forearm, and callously leaving him, minus two teeth, so badly hurt that there 
were fears he would die; fears compounded by the idiocy of the Seville police 
who had banned the Red Cross from the pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Battiston had to lie there for three long minutes before he could be treated. 
It was this incident, above all, which would make most neutral observers 
supporters of Italy in the World Cup final. No penalty was given. 
</P>
<P>
 "Schumacher undoubtedly should have been sent off, which would almost surely 
have condemned the Germans to defeat, but (Charles) Corver, the Dutch referee, 
had not seen the incident and his linesmen, incomprehensibly, did not enlighten 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this, or perhaps because of it, the French multiplied their efforts. 
They gained the lead for the first time in the match a scant two minutes into 
overtime when Marius Tresor drove home a free kick by Giresse to make it 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Giresse increased the French lead to 3-1 six minutes later when he hammered in 
a shot off the post. With only 22 minutes to play and a two-goal lead, France 
appeared to have earned a ticket to the final. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Germans were not giving up that easily. Rummenige, Europe's player of 
the year who had not started because of a nagging injury, came on as a 
substitute and, within six minutes, had scored to make it 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 17th minute of overtime, with the French tiring and not having another 
substitution left because of the Battiston incident, West Germany tied the 
score. A cross from Littbarski found Klaus Fischer and his overhead kick 
leveled the score at 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Overtime ended and the drama of penalty kicks began. 
</P>
<P>
 France scored. West Germany did likewise. 
</P>
<P>
 France scored again. West Germany again tied it. 
</P>
<P>
 France added a third goal. West Germany saw Uli Stielike's shot saved by 
Jean-Luc Ettori. 
</P>
<P>
 French hopes soared. 
</P>
<P>
 Then dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Didier Six missed for France. Littbarski tied it up for West Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Platini and Rummenigge each scored and it was 4-4, going into sudden death. 
</P>
<P>
 Devastatingly, Maxime Bossis had his shot saved by Schumacher, and when 
Hrubesch scored it was all over. 
</P>
<P>
 After 120 dramatic minutes and the agony of the penalty kicks, West Germany 
had found a way through to the final. France had failed on the field, but won 
the hearts of fans worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, without question, the best semifinal of all time.

<P>
 The 52-game, 24-team World Cup has come down to its final stages. Four teams 
have earned the right to play today for a berth in the final on Sunday at the 
Rose Bowl. TEAM ANALYSIS 
</P>
<P>
 BULGARIA 
</P>
<P>
 As it has proved time and again in this tournament, Bulgaria is a lot more 
than simply Hristo Stoitchkov, the star and supporting cast or 21. Sunday's 
victory over defending champion Germany underlined that fact. 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans managed to frustrate Stoitchkov for virtually the entire game but 
still lost. Why? Because the Bulgarians never were in awe of their opponents. 
They played a calm disciplined game, never hurrying or appearing hurried. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense is particularly cool under pressure, with Zlatko Iankov, Trifon 
Ivanov and Tsanko Tzvetanov especially impressive. In the midfield, Krasimir 
Balakov orchestrates the action, either distributing the ball in an intelligent 
fashion or making forays into the opposing penalty area. 
</P>
<P>
 If Stoitchkov is marked out of the game, as he was against Germany, the job of 
scoring falls to Emil Kostadinov or Nasko Sirakov. But as the Bulgarians proved 
Sunday, any of them can find the back of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Yordan Letchkov is a thoughtful midfielder who typifies the Bulgarians' habit 
of involving all players in both the offense and defense. He gave away a 
penalty at one end of the field and later scored the winning goal at the other. 
</P>
<P>
 As for style, Bulgaria is a counterattacking team that relies on the fast 
break and on set plays, such as free kicks and corners, to break down the 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Goalkeeper Borislav Mihaylov, who plays for a second-division team in France, 
has done well enough in this tournament to earn himself a heftier contract with 
a more fashionable club. Of course, with the exception of Stoitchkov, already 
at Barcelona, the same it true for all of the Bulgarina "supporting cast."

 Bulgaria did not qualify for the finals because it was 1-4-1 in Group 1 
eliminations. Bulgaria had not won a World Cup match in 16 tries before this 
year.

 FL: Forward TEAM ANALYSIS 
</P>
<P>
 ITALY 
</P>
<P>
 Talent can carry a team far in a World Cup, but there is an intangible quality 
that is needed to win the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy has shown only flashes of promise, only a hint of its true talent. It 
has been on the ropes and mere seconds away from elimination. But it has 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it is in the semifinals, and it is all due to that elusive quality that 
some call luck, others call fate and few can really pinpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy has been bedeviled by injuries, losing its most experienced defender, 
Franco Baresi, for the entire tournament. Italy has been the victim of red 
cards, losing its starting goalkeeper, Gianluca Pagliuca, and one of its 
strikers, Gianfranco Zola, in separate games. In addition, defender Mauro 
Tassotti received an eight-game suspension for an elbow that broke Spanish 
forward Luis Enrique's nose late in Saturday's quarterfinal. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Baggio has received most of the praise because he has scored the goals 
that have kept his country alive. But Baggio has played far better in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Arrigo Sacchi, who has tinkered incessantly with his starting lineup, 
has imposed a rigid tactical discipline that has brought success and caused 
problems. The player's need for self-expression and inventiveness and 
spur-of-the moment creativity has been stifled. 
</P>
<P>
 Italy in 1994 has not been an attractive team to watch, and Italian fans have 
suffered all sorts of agonies as their team has struggled to overcome the 
restraints placed on it by the coach. World Cup '90 
</P>
<P>
 Italy automatically qualified as the host country. The home-country advantage 
helped it get to the semifinals, where it tied Argentina, 1-1, but lost on 
penalty kicks, 4-3. Italy Coach: Arrigo Sacchi

 Newsmagazines made another strong showing in the television ratings last week, 
led by "60 Minutes," which topped the popularity list released Tuesday by the 
A. C. Nielsen Co. The long-running CBS series was seen in 14.6 million homes on 
Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Other newsmagazines finishing among the week's Top 20 were ABC's "20/20," 
"PrimeTime Live" and "Turning Point," and two installments of "Dateline NBC." 
</P>
<P>
 ABC edged out CBS in the weekly network competition, but none of the Big Three 
had much to crow about: Together they attracted only 48% of the prime-time 
audience--down from the 60% they averaged during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 In its second week out, "Models Inc." lost about 18% of the viewers from its 
initial outing on Fox. But the ratings were still good enough to rank 39th 
among the week's 91 prime-time network programs. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS did not fare so well with a new sitcom, "Muddling Through," which placed 
66th. And ABC's two-hour special about AIDS, "In a New Light," attracted only 
6% of the available audience Saturday night and finished last. Southland
